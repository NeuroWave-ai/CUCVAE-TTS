Story of Jansha The Book Of The THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT THE EBONY HORSE FN one There was once in times of yore and ages long gone before a great and puissant King of the Kings of the Persians Sabur by name who was the richest of all the Kings in store of wealth and dominion and surpassed each and every in wit and wisdom He was generous open handed and beneficent and he gave to those who sought him and repelled not those who resorted to him and he comforted the broken hearted and honourably entreated those who fled to him for refuge Moreover he loved the poor and was hospitable to strangers and did the oppressed justice upon the oppressor He had three daughters like full moons of shining light or flower gardens blooming bright and a son as he were the moon and it was his wont to keep two festivals in the twelve month those of the Nau Roz or New Year and Mihrgan the Autumnal Equinox FN two on which occasions he threw open his palaces and gave largesse and made proclamation of safety and security and promoted his chamberlains and viceroys and the people of his realm came in to him and saluted him and gave him joy of the holy day bringing him gifts and servants and eunuchs Now he loved science and geometry and one festival day as he sat on his kingly throne there came in to him three wise men cunning artificers and past masters in all manner of craft and inventions skilled in making things curious and rare such as confound the wit and versed in the knowledge of occult truths and perfect in mysteries and subtleties And they were of three different tongues and countries the first a Hindi or Indian FN three the second a Roumi or Greek and the third a Farsi or Persian The Indian came forwards and prostrating himself before the King wished him joy of the festival and laid before him a present befitting his dignity that is to say a man of gold set with precious gems and jewels of price and hending in hand a golden trumpet When Sabur FN four saw this he asked O sage what is the virtue of this figure and the Indian answered O my lord if this figure be set at the gate of thy city it will be a guardian over it for in an enemy enter the place it will blow this clarion against him and he will be seized with a palsy and drop down dead Much the King marvelled at this and cried By Allah O sage an this thy word be true I will grant thee thy wish and thy desire Then came forward the Greek and prostrating himself before the King presented him with a basin of silver in whose midst was a peacock of gold surrounded by four and twenty chicks of the same metal Sabur looked at them and turning to the Greek said to him O sage what is the virtue of this peacock O my lord answered he as often as an hour of the day or night passeth it pecketh one of its young and crieth out and flappeth its wings till the four and twenty hours are accomplished and when the month cometh to an end it will open its mouth and thou shalt see the crescent therein And the King said An thou speak sooth I will bring thee to thy wish and thy desire Then came forward the Persian sage and prostrating himself before the King presented him with a horse FN five of the blackest ebony wood inlaid with gold and jewels and ready harnessed with saddle bridle and stirrups such as befit Kings which when Sabur saw he marvelled with exceeding marvel and was confounded at the beauty of its form and the ingenuity of its fashion So he asked What is the use of this horse of wood and what is its virtue and what the secret of its movement and the Persian answered O my lord the virtue of this horse is that if one mount him it will carry him whither he will and fare with its rider through the air and cover the space of a year in a single day The King marvelled and was amazed at these three wonders following thus hard upon one another on the same day and turning to the sage said to him By Allah the Omnipotent and our Lord the Beneficent who created all creatures and feedeth them with meat and drink an thy speech be veritable and the virtue of thy contrivance appear I will assuredly give thee whatsoever thou lustest for and will bring thee to thy desire and thy wish FN six Then he entertained the sages three days that he might make trial of their gifts after which they brought the figures before him and each took the creature he had wroughten and showed him the mystery of its movement The trumpeter blew the trump the peacock pecked its chicks and the Persian sage mounted the ebony house whereupon it soared with him high in air and descended again When King Sabur saw all this he was amazed and perplexed and felt like to fly for joy and said to the three sages Now I am certified of the truth of your words and it behoveth me to quit me of my promise Ask ye therefore what ye will and I will give you that same Now the report of the King s daughters had reached the sages so they answered If the King be content with us and accept of our gifts and allow us to prefer a request to him we crave of him that he give us his three daughters in marriage that we may be his sons in law for that the stability of Kings may not be gainsaid Quoth the King I grant you that which you wish and you desire and bade summon the Kazi forthright that he might marry each of the sages to one of his daughters Now it fortuned that the Princesses were behind a curtain looking on and when they heard this the youngest considered her husband to be and behold he was an old man FN seven an hundred years of age with hair frosted forehead drooping eyebrows mangy ears slitten beard and mustachios stained and dyed eyes red and goggle cheeks bleached and hollow flabby nose like a brinjall or egg plant FN eight face like a cobbler s apron teeth overlapping and lips like camel s kidneys loose and pendulous in brief a terror a horror a monster for he was of the folk of his time the unsightliest and of his age the frightfullest sundry of his grinders had been knocked out and his eye teeth were like the tusks of the Jinni who frighteneth poultry in hen houses Now the girl was the fairest and most graceful of her time more elegant than the gazelle however tender than the gentlest zephyr blander and brighter than the moon at her full for amorous fray right suitable confounding in graceful sway the waving bough and outdoing in swimming gait the pacing roe in fine she was fairer and sweeter by far than all her sisters So when she saw her suitor she went to her chamber and strewed dust on her head and tore her clothes and fell to buffeting her face and weeping and wailing Now the Prince her brother Kamar al Akmar or the Moon of Moons hight was then newly returned from a journey and hearing her weeping and crying came in to her for he loved her with fond affection more than his other sisters and asked her What aileth thee What hath befallen thee Tell me and conceal naught from me So she smote her breast and answered O my brother and my dear one I have nothing to hide If the palace be straitened upon thy father I will go out and if he be resolved upon a foul thing I will separate myself from him though he consent not to make provision for me and my Lord will provide Quoth he Tell me what meaneth this talk and what hath straitened thy breast and troubled thy temper O my brother and my dear one answered the Princess Know that my father hath promised me in marriage to a wicked magician who brought him as a gift a horse of black wood and hath bewitched him with his craft and his egromancy but as for me I will none of him and would because of him I had never come into this world Her brother soothed her and solaced her then fared to his sire and said What be this wizard to whom thou hast given my youngest sister in marriage and what is this present which he hath brought thee so that thou hast killed FN nine my sister with chagrin It is not right that this should be Now the Persian was standing by and when he heard the Prince s words he was mortified and filled with fury and the King said O my son an thou sawest this horse thy wit would be confounded and thou wouldst be amated with amazement Then he bade the slaves bring the horse before him and they did so and when the Prince saw it it pleased him So being an accomplished cavalier he mounted it forthright and struck its sides with the shovel shaped stirrup irons but it stirred not and the King said to the Sage Go show him its movement that he also may help thee to win thy wish Now the Persian bore the Prince a grudge because he willed not he should have his sister so he showed him the pin of ascent on the right side of the horse and saying to him Trill this left him Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and lo the horse forthwith soared with him high in ether as it were a bird and gave not overflying till it disappeared from men s espying whereat the King was troubled and perplexed about his case and said to the Persian O sage look how thou mayest make him descend But he replied O my lord I can do nothing and thou wilt never see him again till Resurrection day for he of his ignorance and pride asked me not of the pin of descent and I forgot to acquaint him therewith When the King heard this he was enraged with sore rage and bade bastinado the sorcerer and clap him in jail whilst he himself cast the crown from his head and beat his face and smote his breast Moreover he shut the doors of his palaces and gave himself up to weeping and keening he and his wife and daughters and all the folk of the city and thus their joy was turned to annoy and their gladness changed into sore affliction and sadness Thus far concerning them but as regards the Prince the horse gave not over soaring with him till he drew near the sun whereat he gave himself up for lost and saw death in the skies and was confounded at his case repenting him of having mounted the horse and saying to himself Verily this was a device of the Sage to destroy me on account of my youngest sister but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great I am lost without recourse but I wonder did not he who made the ascent pin make also a descent pin Now he was a man of wit and knowledge and intelligence so he fell to feeling all the parts of the horse but saw nothing save a screw like a cock s head on its right shoulder and the like on the left when quoth he to himself I see no sign save these things like buttons Presently he turned the right hand pin whereupon the horse flew heavenwards with increased speed So he left it and looking at the sinister shoulder and finding another pin he wound it up and immediately the steed s upwards motion slowed and ceased and it began to descend little by little towards the face of the earth while the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Prince wound up the sinister screw the steed s upward motion slowed and ceased and it began to descend little by little towards the earth while the rider became yet more cautious and careful of his life And when he saw this and knew the uses of the horse his heart was filled with joy and gladness and he thanked Almighty Allah for that He had deigned deliver him from destruction Then he began to turn the horse s head whithersoever he would making it rise and fall at pleasure till he had gotten complete mastery over its every movement He ceased not to descend the whole of that day for that the steed s ascending flight had borne him afar from the earth and as he descended he diverted himself with viewing the various cities and countries over which he passed and which he knew not never having seen them in his life Amongst the rest he descried a city ordered after the fairest fashion in the midst of a verdant and riant land rich in trees and streams with gazelles pacing daintily over the plains whereat he fell a musing and said to himself Would I knew the name of yon town and in what land it is And he took to circling about it and observing it right and left By this time the day began to decline and the sun drew near to its downing and he said in his mind Verily I find no goodlier place to night in than this city so I will lodge here and early on the morrow I will return to my kith and kin and my kingdom and tell my father and family what hath passed and acquaint him with what mine eyes have seen Then he addressed himself to seeking a place wherein he might safely bestow himself and his horse and where none should descry him and presently behold he espied a middlemost of the city a palace rising high in upper air surrounded by a great wall with lofty crenelles and battlements guarded by forty black slaves clad in complete mail and armed with spears and swords bows and arrows Quoth he This is a goodly place and turned the descent pin whereupon the horse sank down with him like a weary bird and alighted gently on the terrace roof of the palace So the Prince dismounted and ejaculating Alhamdolillah praise be to Allah FN ten he began to go round about the horse and examine it saying By Allah he who fashioned thee with these perfections was a cunning craftsman and if the Almighty extend the term of my life and restore me to my country and kinsfolk in safety and reunite me with my father I will assuredly bestow upon him all manner bounties and benefit him with the utmost beneficence By this time night had overtaken him and he sat on the roof till he was assured that all in the palace slept and indeed hunger and thirst were sore upon him for that he had not tasted food nor drunk water since he parted from his sire So he said within himself Surely the like of this palace will not lack of victual and leaving the horse above went down in search of somewhat to eat Presently he came to a staircase and descending it to the bottom found himself in a court paved with white marble and alabaster which shone in the light of the moon He marvelled at the place and the goodliness of its fashion but sensed no sound of speaker and saw no living soul and stood in perplexed surprise looking right and left and knowing not whither he should wend Then said he to himself I may not do better than return to where I left my horse and pass the night by it and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride away And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Fifty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the king s son to himself I may not do better than pass the night by my horse and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and ride away However as he tarried talking to himself he espied a light within the palace and making towards it found that it came from a candle that stood before a door of the Harim at the head of a sleeping eunuch as he were one of the Ifrits of Solomon or a tribesman of the Jinn longer than lumber and broader than a bench He lay before the door with the pommel of his sword gleaming in the flame of the candle and at his head was a bag of leather FN eleven hanging from a column of granite When the Prince saw this he was affrighted and said I crave help from Allah the Supreme O mine Holy One even as Thou hast already delivered me from destruction so vouchsafe me strength to quit myself of the adventure of this palace So saying he put out his hand to the budget and taking it carried it aside and opened it and found in it food of the best He ate his fill and refreshed himself and drank water after which he hung up the provision bag in its place and drawing the eunuch s sword from its sheath took it whilst the slave slept on knowing not whence destiny should come to him Then the Prince fared forwards into the palace and ceased not till he came to a second door with a curtain drawn before it so he raised the curtain and behold on entering he saw a couch of the whitest ivory inlaid with pearls and jacinths and jewels and four slave girls sleeping about it He went up to the couch to see what was thereon and found a young lady lying asleep chemised with her hair FN twelve as she were the full moon rising FN thirteen over the Eastern horizon with flower white brow and shining hair paring and cheeks like blood red anemones and dainty moles thereon He was amazed at her as she lay in her beauty and loveliness her symmetry and grace and he recked no more of death So he went up to her trembling in every nerve and shuddering with pleasure kissed her on the right cheek whereupon she awoke forthright and opened her eyes and seeing the Prince standing at her head said to him Who art thou and whence comest thou Quoth he I am thy slave and thy lover Asked she And who brought thee hither and he answered My Lord and my fortune Then said Shams al Nahar FN fourteen for such was her name Haply thou art he who demanded me yesterday of my father in marriage and he rejected thee pretending that thou wast foul of favour By Allah my sire lied in his throat when he spoke this thing for thou art not other than beautiful Now the son of the King of Hind had sought her in marriage but her father had rejected him for that he was ugly and uncouth and she thought the Prince was he So when she saw his beauty and grace for indeed he was like the radiant moon the syntheism FN fifteen of love gat hold of her heart as it were a flaming fire and they fell to talk and converse Suddenly her waiting women awoke and seeing the Prince with their mistress said to her Oh my lady who is this with thee Quoth she I know not I found him sitting by me when I woke up haply tis he who seeketh me in marriage of my sire Quoth they O my lady by Allah the All Father this is not he who seeketh thee in marriage for he is hideous and this man is handsome and of high degree Indeed the other is not fit to be his servant FN sixteen Then the handmaidens went out to the eunuch and finding him slumbering awoke him and he started up in alarm Said they How happeth it that thou art on guard at the palace and yet men come in to us whilst we are asleep When the black heard this he sprang in haste to his sword but found it not and fear took him and trembling Then he went in confounded to his mistress and seeing the Prince sitting at talk with her said to him O my lord art thou man or Jinni Replied the Prince Woe to thee O unluckiest of slaves how darest thou even the sons of the royal Chosroes FN seventeen with one of the unbelieving Satans And he was as a raging lion Then he took the sword in his hand and said to the slave I am the King s son in law and he hath married me to his daughter and bidden me go in to her And when the eunuch heard these words he replied O my lord if thou be indeed of kind a man as thou avouchest she is fit for none but for thee and thou art worthier of her than any other Thereupon the eunuch ran to the King shrieking loud and rending his raiment and heaving dust upon his head and when the King heard his outcry he said to him What hath befallen thee speak quickly and be brief for thou hast fluttered my heart Answered the eunuch O King come to thy daughter s succour for a devil of the Jinn in the likeness of a King s son hath got possession of her so up and at him When the King heard this he thought to kill him and said How camest thou to be careless of my daughter and let this demon come at her Then he betook himself to the Princess s palace where he found her slave women standing to await him and asked them What is come to my daughter O King answered they slumber overcame us and when we awoke we found a young man sitting upon her couch in talk with her as he were the full moon never saw we aught fairer of favour than he So we questioned him of his case and he declared that thou hadst given him thy daughter in marriage More than this we know not nor do we know if he be a man or a Jinni but he is modest and well bred and doth nothing unseemly or which leadeth to disgrace Now when the King heard these words his wrath cooled and he raised the curtain little by little and looking in saw sitting at talk with his daughter a Prince of the goodliest with a face like the full moon for sheen At this sight he could not contain himself of his jealousy for his daughter s honour and putting aside the curtain rushed in upon them drawn sword in hand like a furious Ghul Now when the Prince saw him he asked the Princess Is this thy sire and she answered Yes And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Price saw the King rushing in upon them drawn sword in hand like a furious Ghul he asked the Princess Is this thy sire and she answered Yes Whereupon he sprang to his feet and seizing his sword cried out at the King with so terrible a cry that he was confounded Then the youth would have fallen on him with the sword but the King seeing that the Prince was doughtier than he sheathed his scymitar and stood till the young man came up to him when he accosted him courteously and said to him O youth art thou a man or a Jinni Quoth the Prince Did I not respect thy right as mine host and thy daughter s honour I would spill thy blood How darest thou fellow me with devils me that am a Prince of the sons of the royal Chosroes who had they wished to take thy kingdom could shake thee like an earthquake from thy glory and thy dominions and spoil thee of all thy possessions Now when the King heard his words he was confounded with awe and bodily fear of him and rejoined If thou indeed be of the sons of the Kings as thou pretendest how cometh it that thou enterest my palace without my permission and smirchest mine honour making thy way to my daughter and feigning that thou art her husband and claiming that I have given her to thee to wife I that have slain Kings and Kings sons who sought her of me in marriage And now who shall save thee from my might and majesty when if I cried out to my slaves and servants and bade them put thee to the vilest of deaths they would slay thee forthright Who shall deliver thee out of my hand When the Prince heard this speech of the King he answered Verily I wonder at thee and at the shortness and denseness of thy wit Say me canst covet for thy daughter a mate comelier than myself and hast ever seen a stouter hearted man or one better fitted for a Sultan or a more glorious in rank and dominion than I Rejoined the King Nay by Allah but I would have had thee O youth act after the custom of Kings and demand her from me to wife before witnesses that I might have married her to thee publicly and now even were I to marry her to thee privily yet hast thou dishonoured me in her person Rejoined the Prince Thou sayest sooth O King but if thou summon thy slaves and thy soldiers and they fall upon me and slay me as thou pretendest thou wouldst but publish thine own disgrace and the folk would be divided between belief in thee and disbelief in thee Wherefore O King thou wilt do well meseemeth to turn from this thought to that which I shall counsel thee Quoth the King Let me hear what thou hast to advise and quoth the Prince What I have to propose to thee is this either do thou meet me in combat singular I and thou and he who slayeth his adversary shall be held the worthier and having a better title to the kingdom or else let me be this night and whenas dawns the morn draw out against me thy horsemen and footmen and servants but first tell me their number Said the King They are forty thousand horse beside my own slaves and their followers FN eighteen who are the like of them in number Thereupon said the Prince When the day shall break do thou array them against me and say to them And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty first Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the Prince When day shall break do thou array them against me and say to them This man is a suitor to me for my daughter s hand on condition that he shall do battle single handed against you all for he pretendeth that he will overcome you and put you to the rout and indeed that ye cannot prevail against him After which leave me to do battle with them if they slay me then is thy secret surer guarded and thine honour the better warded and if I overcome them and see their backs then is it the like of me a King should covet to his son in law So the King approved of his opinion and accepted his proposition despite his awe at the boldness of his speech and amaze at the pretensions of the Prince to meet in fight his whole host such as he had described to him being at heart assured that he would perish in the fray and so he should be quit of him and freed from the fear of dishonour Thereupon he called the eunuch and bade him go to his Wazir without stay and delay and command him to assemble the whole of the army and cause them don their arms and armour and mount their steeds So the eunuch carried the King s order to the Minister who straightaway summoned the Captains of the host and the Lords of the realm and bade them don their harness of derring do and mount horse and sally forth in battle array Such was their case but as regards the King he sat a long while conversing with the young Prince being pleased with his wise speech and good sense and fine breeding And when it was day break he returned to his palace and seating himself on his throne commanded his merry men to mount and bade them saddle one of the best of the royal steeds with handsome selle and housings and trappings and bring it to the Prince But the youth said O King I will not mount horse till I come in view of the troops and review them Be it as thou wilt replied the King Then the two repaired to the parade ground where the troops were drawn up and the young Prince looked upon them and noted their great number after which the King cried out to them saying Ho all ye men there is come to me a youth who seeketh my daughter in marriage and in very sooth never have I seen a goodlier than he no nor a stouter of heart nor a doughtier of arm for he pretendeth that he can overcome you single handed and force you to flight and that were ye an hundred thousand in number yet for him would ye be but few Now when he chargeth down on you do ye receive him upon point of pike and sharp of sabre for indeed he hath undertaken a mighty matter Then quoth the King to the Prince Up O my son and do thy devoir on them Answered he O King thou dealest not justly and fairly by me how shall I go forth against them seeing that I am afoot and the men be mounted The King retorted I bade thee mount and thou refusedst but choose thou which of my horses thou wilt Then he said Not one of thy horses pleaseth me and I will ride none but that on which I came Asked the King And where is thy horse Atop of thy palace In what part of my palace On the roof Now when the King heard these words he cried Out on thee this is the first sign thou hast given of madness How can the horse be on the roof But we shall at once see if thou speak the truth or lies Then he turned to one of his chief officers and said to him Go to my palace and bring me what thou findest on the roof So all the people marvelled at the young Prince s words saying one to other How can a horse come down the steps from the roof Verily this is a thing whose like we never heard In the meantime the King s messenger repaired to the palace and mounting to the roof found the horse standing there and never had he looked on a handsomer but when he drew near and examined it he saw that it was made of ebony and ivory Now the officer was accompanied by other high officers who also looked on and they laughed to one another saying Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake We cannot deem him other than mad however we shall soon see the truth of his case And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the high officials looked upon the horse they laughed one to other and said Was it of the like of his horse that the youth spake We cannot deem him other than mad however we shall soon see the truth of his case Peradventure herein is some mighty matter and he is a man of high degree Then they lifted up the horse bodily and carrying it to the King set it down before him and all the lieges flocked round to look at it marvelling at the beauty of its proportions and the richness of its saddle and bridle The King also admired it and wondered at it with extreme wonder and he asked the Prince O youth is this thy horse He answered Yes O King this is my horse and thou shalt soon see the marvel it showeth Rejoined the King Then take and mount it and the Prince retorted I will not mount till the troops withdraw afar from it So the King bade them retire a bowshot from the horse whereupon quoth its owner O King see thou I am about to mount my horse and charge upon thy host and scatter them right and left and split their hearts asunder Said the King Do as thou wilt and spare not their lives for they will not spare thine Then the Prince mounted whilst the troops ranged themselves in ranks before him and one said to another When the youth cometh between the ranks we will take him on the points of our pikes and the sharps of our sabres Quoth another By Allah this a mere misfortune how shall we slay a youth so comely of face and shapely of form And a third continued Ye will have hard work to get the better of him for the youth had not done this but for what he knew of his own prowess and pre eminence of valour Meanwhile having settled himself in his saddle the Prince turned the pin of ascent whilst all eyes were strained to see what he would do whereupon the horse began to heave and rock and sway to and fro and make the strangest of movements steed ever made till its belly was filled with air and it took flight with its rider and soared high into the sky When the King saw this he cried out to his men saying Woe to you catch him catch him ere he scape you But his Wazirs and Viceroys said to him O King can a man overtake the flying bird This is surely none but some mighty magician or Marid of the Jinn or devil and Allah save thee from him So praise thou the Almighty for deliverance of thee and of all thy host from his hand Then the King returned to his palace after seeing the feat of the Prince and going in to his daughter acquainted her with what had befallen them both on the parade ground He found her grievously afflicted for the Prince and bewailing her separation from him wherefore she fell sick with violent sickness and took to her pillow Now when her father saw her on this wise he pressed her to his breast and kissing her between the eyes said to her O my daughter praise Allah Almighty and thank Him for that He hath delivered us from this crafty enchanter this villain this low fellow this thief who thought only of seducing thee And he repeated to her the story of the Prince and how he had disappeared in the firmament and he abused him and cursed him knowing not how dearly his daughter loved him But she paid no heed to his words and did but redouble in her tears and wails saying to herself By Allah I will neither eat meat nor drain drink till Allah reunite me with him Her father was greatly concerned for her case and mourned much over her plight but for all he could do to soother her love longing only increased on her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King mourned much over his daughter s plight but for all he could do to soothe her love longing only increased on her Thus far concerning the King and Princess Shams al Nahar but as regards Prince Kamar al Akmar when he had risen high in air he turned his horse s head towards his native land and being alone mused upon the beauty of the Princess and her loveliness Now he had enquired of the King s people the name of the city and of its King and his daughter and men had told him that it was the city of Sana a FN nineteen So he journeyed with all speed till he drew near his father s capital and making an airy circuit about the city alighted on the roof of the King s palace where he left his horse whilst he descended into the palace and seeing its threshold strewn with ashes though that one of his family was dead Then he entered as of wont and found his father and mother and sisters clad in mourning raiment of black all pale of faces and lean of frames When his sire descried him and was assured that it was indeed his son he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fit but after a time coming to himself threw himself upon him and embraced him clipping him to his bosom and rejoicing in him with exceeding joy and extreme gladness His mother and sisters heard this so they came in and seeing the Prince fell upon him kissing him and weeping and joying with exceeding joyance Then they questioned him of his case so he told them all that had passed from first to last and his father said to him Praised be Allah for thy safety O coolth of my eyes and core of my heart Then the King bade hold high festival and the glad tidings flew through the city So they beat drums and cymbals and doffing the weed of mourning they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the streets and markets whilst the folk vied with one another who should be the first to give the King joy and the King proclaimed a general pardon and opening the prisons released those who were therein prisoned Moreover he made banquets for the people with great abundance of eating and drinking for seven days and nights and all creatures were gladsomest and he took horse with his son and rode out with him that the folk might see him and rejoice After awhile the Prince asked about the maker of the horse saying O my father what hath fortune done with him and the King answered Allah never bless him nor the hour wherein I set eyes on him For he was the cause of thy separation from us O my son and he hath lain in gaol since the day of thy disappearance Then the King bade release him from prison and sending for him invested him in a dress of satisfaction and entreated him with the utmost favour and munificence save that he would not give him his daughter to wife whereat the Sage raged with sore rage and repented of that which he had done knowing that the Prince had secured the secret of the steed and the manner of its motion Moreover the King said to his son I reck thou wilt do will not to go near the horse henceforth and more especially not to mount it after this day for thou knowest not its properties and belike thou art in error about it Not the Prince had told his father of his adventure with the King of Sana a and his daughter and he said Had the King intended to kill thee he had done so but thine hour was not yet come When the rejoicings were at an end the people returned to their places and the King and his son to the palace where they sat down and fell to eating and drinking and making merry Now the King had a handsome handmaiden who was skilled in playing the lute so she took it and began to sweep the strings and sing thereto before the King and his son of separation of lovers and she chanted the following verses Deem not that absence breeds in me aught of forgetfulness What should remember I did you fro my remembrance wane Time dies but never dies the fondest love for you we bear And in your love I ll die and in your love I ll arise again FN twenty When the Prince heard these verses the fires of longing flamed up in his heart and pine and passion redoubled upon him Grief and regret were sore upon him and his bowels yearned in him for love of the King s daughter of Sana a so he rose forthright and escaping his father s notice went forth the palace to the horse and mounting it turned the pin of ascent whereupon bird like it flew with him high in air and soared towards the upper regions of the sky In early morning his father missed him and going up to the pinnacle of the palace in great concern saw his son rising into the firmament whereat he was sore afflicted and repented in all penitence that he had not taken the horse and hidden it and he said to himself By Allah if but my son return to me I will destroy the horse that my heart may be at rest concerning my son And he fell again to weeping and bewailing himself And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King again fell to weeping and bewailing himself for his son Such was his case but as regards the Prince he ceased not flying on through air till he came to the city of Sana a and alighted on the roof as before Then he crept down stealthily and finding the eunuch asleep as of wont raised the curtain and went on little by little till he came to the door of the Princess s alcove FN twenty one chamber and stopped to listen when lo he heard her shedding plenteous tears and reciting verses whilst her women slept round her Presently overhearing her weeping and wailing quoth they O our mistress why wilt thou mourn for one who mourneth not for thee Quoth she O ye little of wit is he for whom I mourn of those who forget or who are forgotten And she fell again to wailing and weeping till sleep overcame her Hereat the Prince s heart melted for her and his gall bladder was like to burst so he entered and seeing her lying asleep without covering FN twenty two touched her with his hand whereupon she opened her eyes and espied him standing by her Said he Why all this crying and mourning And when she knew him she threw herself upon him and took him around the neck and kissed him and answered For thy sake and because of my separation from thee Said he O my lady I have been made desolate by thee all this long time But she replied Tis thou who hast desolated me and hadst thou tarried longer I had surely died Rejoined he O my lady what thinkest thou of my case with thy father and how he dealt with me Were it not for my love of thee O temptation and seduction of the Three Worlds I had certainly slain him and made him a warning to all beholders but even as I love thee so I love him for thy sake Quoth she How couldst thou leave me can my life be sweet to me after thee Quoth he Let what hath happened suffice I am now hungry and thirsty So she bade her maidens make ready meat and drink and they sat eating and drinking and conversing till night was well nigh ended and when day broke he rose to take leave of her and depart ere the eunuch should awake Shams al Nahar asked him Whither goest thou and he answered To my father s house and I plight thee my troth that I will come to thee once in every week But she wept and said I conjure thee by Allah the Almighty take me with thee whereso thou wendest and make me not taste anew the bittergourd FN twenty three of separation from thee Quoth he Wilt thou indeed go with me and quoth she Yes Then said he arise that we depart So she rose forthright and going to a chest arrayed herself in what was richest and dearest to her of her trinkets of gold and jewels of price and she fared forth her handmaids recking naught So he carried her up to the roof of the palace and mounting the ebony horse took her up behind him and made her fast to himself binding her with strong bonds after which he turned the shoulder pin of ascent and the horse rose with him high in air When her slave women saw this they shrieked aloud and told her father and mother who in hot haste ran to the palace roof and looking up saw the magical horse flying away with the Prince and Princess At this the King was troubled with ever increasing trouble and cried out saying O King s son I conjure thee by Allah have ruth on me and my wife and bereave us not of our daughter The Prince made him no reply but thinking in himself that the maiden repented of leaving father and mother asked her O ravishment of the age say me wilt thou that I restore thee to thy mother and father whereupon she answered By Allah O my lord that is not my desire my only wish is to be with thee wherever thou art for I am distracted by the love of thee from all else even from my father and mother Hearing these words the Prince joyed with great joy and made the horse fly and fare softly with them so as not to disquiet her nor did they stay their flight till they came in sight of a green meadow wherein was a spring of running water Here they alighted and ate and drank after which the Prince took horse again and set her behind him binding her in his fear for her safety after which they fared on till they came in sight of his father s capital At this the Prince was filled with joy and bethought himself to show his beloved the seat of his dominion and his father s power and dignity and give her to know that it was greater than that of her sire So he set her down in one of his father s gardens without the city where his parent was wont to take his pleasure and carrying her into a domed summer house prepared there for the King left the ebony horse at the door and charged the damsel keep watch over it saying Sit here till my messenger come to thee for I go now to my father to make ready a palace for thee and show thee my royal estate She was delighted when she heard these words and said to him Do as thou wilt And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the maiden was delighted when she heard these words and said to him Do as thou wilt for she thereby understood that she should not enter the city but with due honour and worship as became her rank Then the Prince left her and betook himself to the palace of the King his father who rejoiced in his return and met him and welcomed him and the Prince said to him Know that I have brought with me the King s daughter of whom I told thee and have left her without the city in such a garden and come to tell thee that thou mayst make ready the procession of estate and go forth to meet her and show her thy royal dignity and troops and guards Answered the King With joy and gladness and straightaway bade decorate the town with the goodliest adornment Then he took horse and rode out in all magnificence and majesty he and his host high officers and household with drums and kettle drums fifes and clarions and all manner instruments whilst the Prince drew forth of his treasuries jewellery and apparel and what else of the things which Kings hoards and made a rare display of wealth and splendour moreover he got ready for the Princess a canopied litter of brocades green red and yellow wherein he set Indian and Greek and Abyssinian slave girls Then he left the litter and those who were therein and preceded them to the pavilion where he had set her down and searched but found naught neither Princess nor horse When he saw this he beat his face and rent his raiment and began to wander round about the garden as he had lost his wits after which he came to his senses and said to himself How could she have come at the secret of this horse seeing I told her nothing of it Maybe the Persian sage who made the horse hath chanced upon her and stolen her away in revenge for my father s treatment of him Then he sought the guardians of the garden and asked them if they had seen any pass the precincts and said Hath any one come in here Tell me the truth and the whole truth or I will at once strike off your heads They were terrified by his threats but they answered with one voice We have seen no man enter save the Persian sage who came to gather healing herbs So the Prince was certified that it was indeed he that had taken away the maiden And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Prince heard their answer he was certified that the Sage had taken away the maiden and abode confounded and perplexed concerning his case And he was abashed before the folk and turning to his sire told him what had happened and said to him Take the troops and march them back to the city As for me I will never return till I have cleared up this affair When the King heard this he wept and beat his breast and said to him O my son calm thy choler and master thy chagrin and come home with us and look what King s daughter thou wouldst fain have that I may marry thee to her But the Prince paid no heed to his words and farewelling him departed whilst the King returned to the city and their joy was changed into sore annoy Now as Destiny issued her decree when the Prince left the Princess in the garden house and betook himself to his father s palace for the ordering of his affair the Persian entered the garden to pluck certain simples and scenting the sweet savour of musk and perfumes that exhaled from the Princess and impregnated the whole place followed it till he came to the pavilion and saw standing at the door the horse which he had made with his own hands His heart was filled with joy and gladness for he had bemourned its loss much since it had gone out of his hand so he went up to it and examining its every part found it whole and sound whereupon he was about to mount and ride away when he bethought himself and said Needs must I first look what the Prince hath brought and left here with the horse So he entered the pavilion and seeing the Princess sitting there as she were the sun shining sheen in the sky serene knew her at the first glance to be some high born lady and doubted not but the Prince had brought her thither on the horse and left her in the pavilion whilst he went to the city to make ready for her entry in state procession with all splendor Then he went up to her and kissed the earth between her hands whereupon she raised her eyes to him and finding him exceedingly foul of face and favour asked Who art thou and he answered O my lady I am a messenger sent by the Prince who hath bidden me bring thee to another pleasance nearer the city for that my lady the Queen cannot walk so far and is unwilling of her joy in thee that another should forestall her with thee Quoth she Where is the Prince and quoth the Persian He is in the city with his sire and forthwith he shall come for thee in great state Said she O thou say me could he find none handsomer to send to me whereat loud laughed the Sage and said Yea verily he hath not a Mameluke as ugly as I am but O my lady let not the ill favour of my face and the foulness of my form deceive thee Hadst thou profited of me as hath the Prince verily thou wouldst praise my affair Indeed he chose me as his messenger to thee because of my uncomeliness and loathsomeness in his jealous love of thee else hath he Mamelukes and negro slaves pages eunuchs and attendants out of number each goodlier than other Whenas she heard this it commended itself to her reason and she believed him so she rose forthright And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Persian sage acquainted the Princess with the case of the King s son she believed him so she rose forthright and putting her hand in his said O my father what hast thou brought me to ride He replied O my lady thou shalt ride the horse thou camest on and she I cannot ride it by myself Whereupon he smiled and knew that he was her master and said I will ride with thee myself So he mounted and taking her up behind him bound her to himself with firm bonds while she knew not what he would with her Then he turned the ascent pin whereupon the belly of the horse became full of wind and it swayed to and fro like a wave of the sea and rose with them high in air nor slackened in its flight till it was out of sight of the city Now when Shams al Nahir saw this she asked him Ho thou what is become of that thou toldest me of my Prince making me believe that he sent thee to me Answered the Persian Allah damn the Prince he is a mean and skin flint knave She cried Woe to thee How darest thou disobey thy lord s commandment Whereto the Persian replied He is no lord of mine knowest thou who I am Rejoined the Princess I know nothing of thee save what thou toldest me and retorted he What I told thee was a trick of mine against thee and the King s son I have long lamented the loss of this horse which is under us for I constructed it and made myself master of it But now I have gotten firm hold of it and of thee too and I will burn his heart even as he hath burnt mine nor shall he ever have the horse again no never So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for I can be of more use to thee than he and I am generous as I am wealthy my servants and slaves shall obey thee as their mistress I will robe thee in finest raiment and thine every wish shall be at thy will When she heard this she buffeted her face and cried out saying Ah well away I have not won my beloved and I have lost my father and mother And she wept bitter tears over what had befallen her whilst the Sage fared on with her without ceasing till he came to the land of the Greeks FN twenty four and alighted in a verdant mead abounding in streams and trees Now this meadow lay near a city wherein was a King of high puissance and it chanced that he went forth that day to hunt and divert himself As he passed by the meadow he saw the Persian standing there with the damsel and the horse by his side and before the Sage was ware the King s slaves fell upon him and carried him and the lady and the horse to their master who noting the foulness of the man s favour and his loathsomeness and the beauty of the girl and her loveliness said O my lady what kin is this oldster to thee The Persian made haste to reply saying She is my wife and the daughter of my father s brother But the lady at once gave him the lie and said O King by Allah I know him not nor is he my husband nay he is a wicked magician who hath stolen me away by force and fraud Thereupon the King bade bastinado the Persian and they beat him till he was well nigh dead after which the King commanded to carry him to the city and cast him into jail and taking from him the damsel and the ebony horse though he knew not its properties nor the secret of its motion set the girl in his serraglio and the horse amongst his hoards Such was the case with the Sage and the lady but as regards Prince Kamar al Akmar he garbed himself in travelling gear and taking what he needed of money set out tracking their trail in very sorry plight and journeyed from country to country and city to city seeking the Princess and enquiring after the ebony horse whilst all who heard him marvelled at him and deemed his talk extravagant Thus he continued doing a long while but for all his enquiry and quest he could hit on no new news of her At last he came to her father s city of Sana a and there asked for her but could get no tidings of her and found her father mourning her loss So he turned back and made for the land of the Greeks continuing to enquire concerning the twain as he went And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King s son made for the land of the Greeks continuing to enquire concerning the two as he went along till as chance would have it he alighted at a certain Khan and saw a company of merchants sitting at talk So he sat down near them and heard one say O my friends I lately witnessed a wonder of wonders They asked What was that and he answered I was visiting such a district in such a city naming the city wherein was the Princess and I heard its people chatting of a strange thing which had lately befallen It was that their King went out one day hunting and coursing with a company of his courtiers and the lords of his realm and issuing from the city they came to a green meadow where they espied an old man standing with a woman sitting hard by a horse of ebony The man was foulest foul of face and loathly of form but the woman was a marvel of beauty and loveliness and elegance and perfect grace and as for the wooden horse it was a miracle never saw eyes aught goodlier than it nor more gracious than its make Asked the others And what did the King with them and the merchant answered As for the man the King seized him and questioned him of the damsel and he pretended that she was his wife and the daughter of his paternal uncle but she gave him the lie forthright and declared that he was a sorcerer and a villain So the King took her from the old man and bade beat him and cast him into the trunk house As for the ebony horse I know not what became of it When the Prince heard these words he drew near to the merchant and began questioning him discreetly and courteously touching the name of the city and of its King which when he knew he passed the night full of joy And as soon as dawned the day he set out and travelled sans surcease till he reached that city but when he would have entered the gate keepers laid hands on him that they might bring him before the King to question him of his condition and the craft in which he was skilled and the cause of his coming thither such being the usage and custom of their ruler Now it was supper time when he entered the city and it was then impossible to go in to the King or take counsel with him respecting the stranger So the guards carried him to the jail thinking to lay him by the heels there for the night but when the warders saw his beauty and loveliness they could not find it in their hearts to imprison him they made him sit with them without the walls and when food came to them he ate with them what sufficed him As soon as they had made an end of eating they turned to the Prince and said What countryman art thou I come from Fars answered he the land of the Chosroes When they heard this they laughed and one of them said O Chosroan FN twenty five I have heard the talk of men and their histories and I have looked into their conditions but never saw I or heard I a bigger liar than the Chosroan which is with us in the jail Quoth another And never did I see aught fouler than his favour or more hideous than his visnomy Asked the Prince What have ye seen of his lying and they answered He pretendeth that he is one of the wise Now the King came upon him as he went a hunting and found with him a most beautiful woman and a horse of the blackest ebony never saw I a handsomer As for the damsel she is with the King who is enamoured of her and would fain marry her but she is mad and were this man a leach as he claimeth to be he would have healed her for the King doth his utmost to discover a cure for her case and a remedy for her disease and this whole year past hath he spent treasure upon physicians and astrologers on her account but none can avail to cure her As for the horse it is in the royal hoard house and the ugly man is here with us in prison and as soon as night falleth he weepeth and bemoaneth himself and will not let us sleep And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Sixty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the warders had recounted the case of the Persian egromancer they held in prison and his weeping and wailing the Prince at once devised a device whereby he might compass his desire and presently the guards of the gate being minded to sleep led him into the jail and locked the door So he overheard the Persian weeping and bemoaning himself in his own tongue and saying Alack and alas for my sin that I sinned against myself

none	none	st the King s son in that which I did with the damsel for I neither left her nor won my will of her All this cometh of my lack of sense in that I sought for myself that which I deserved not and which befitted not the like of me for whoso seeketh what suiteth him not at all falleth with the like of my fall Now when the King s son heard this he accosted him in Persian saying How long will this weeping and wailing last Say me thinkest thou that hath befallen thee that which never befel other than thou Now when the Persian heard this he made friends with him and began to complain to him of his case and misfortunes And as soon as the morning morrowed the warders took the Prince and carried him before their King informing him that he had entered the city on the previous night at a time when audience was impossible Quoth the King to the Prince Whence comest thou and what is thy name and trade and why hast thou travelled hither He replied As to my name I am called in Persian Harjah FN twenty six as to my country I come from the land of Fars and I am of the men of art and especially of the art of medicine and healing the sick and those whom the Jinns drive mad For this I go round about all countries and cities to profit by adding knowledge to my knowledge and whenever I see a patient I heal him and this is my craft FN twenty seven Now when the King heard this he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said O excellent Sage thou hast indeed come to us at a time when we need thee Then he acquainted him with the case of the Princess adding If thou cure her and recover her from her madness thou shalt have of me everything thou seekest Replied the Prince Allah save and favour the King describe to me all thou hast seen of her insanity and tell me how long it is since the access attacked her also how thou camest by her and the horse and the Sage So the King told him the whole story from first to last adding The Sage is in goal Quoth the Prince O auspicious King and what hast thou done with the horse Quoth the King O youth it is with me yet laid up in one of my treasure chambers whereupon said the Prince within himself The best thing I can do is first to see the horse and assure myself of its condition If it be whole and sound all will be well and end well but if its motor works be destroyed I must find some other way of delivering my beloved Thereupon he turned to the King and said to him O King I must see the horse in question haply I may find in it somewhat that will serve me for the recovery of the damsel With all my heart replied the King and taking him by the hand showed him into the place where the horse was The Prince went round about it examining its condition and found it whole and sound whereat he rejoiced greatly and said to the King Allah save and exalt the King I would fain go in to the damsel that I may see how it is with her for I hope in Allah to heal her by my healing hand through means of the horse Then he bade them take care of the horse and the King carried him to the Princess s apartment where her lover found her wringing her hands and writhing and beating herself against the ground and tearing her garments to tatters as was her wont but there was no madness of Jinn in her and she did this but that none might approach her When the Prince saw her thus he said to her No harm shall betide thee O ravishment of the three worlds and went on to soothe her and speak her fair till he managed to whisper I am Kamar al Akmar whereupon she cried out with a loud cry and fell down fainting for excess of joy but the King thought this was epilepsy FN twenty eight brought on by her fear of him and by her suddenly being startled Then the Prince put his mouth to her ear and said to her O Shams al Nahar O seduction of the universe have a care for thy life and mine and be patient and constant for this our position needeth sufferance and skilful contrivance to make shift for our delivery from the tyrannical King My first move will be now to go out to him and tell him that thou art possessed of a Jinn and hence thy madness but that I will engage to heal thee and drive away the evil spirit if he will at once unbind thy bonds So when he cometh in to thee do thou speak him smooth words that he may think I have cured thee and all will be done for us as we desire Quoth she Hearkening and obedience and he went out to the King in joy and gladness and said to him O august King I have by thy good fortune discovered her disease and its remedy and have cured her for thee So now do thou go in to her and speak her softly and treat her kindly and promise her what may please her so shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Prince feigned himself a leach and went in to the damsel and made himself known to her and told her how he purposed to deliver her she cried Hearkening and obedience He then fared forth from her and sought the King and said Go thou in to her and speak her softly and promise her what may please her so shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee Thereupon the King went in to her and when she saw him she rose and kissing the ground before him bade him welcome and said I admire how thou hast come to visit thy handmaid this day whereat he was ready to fly for joy and bade the waiting women and the eunuchs attend her and carry her to the Hammam and make ready for her dresses and adornment So they went in to her and saluted her and she returned their salams with the goodliest language and after the pleasantest fashion whereupon they clad her in royal apparel and clasping a collar of jewels about her neck carried her to the bath and served her there Then they brought her forth as she were the full moon and when she came into the King s presence she saluted him and kissed ground before him whereupon he joyed in her with joy exceeding and said to the Prince O Sage O philosopher all this is of thy blessing Allah increase to us the benefit of thy healing breath FN twenty nine The Prince replied O King for the completion of her cure it behoveth that thou go forth thou and all thy troops and guards to the place where thou foundest her not forgetting the beast of black wood which was with her for therein is a devil and unless I exorcise him he will return to her and afflict her at the head of every month With love and gladness cried the King O thou Prince of all philosophers and most learned of all who see the light of day Then he brought out the ebony horse to the meadow in question and rode thither with all his troops and the Princess little weeting the purpose of the Prince Now when they came to the appointed place the Prince still habited as a leach bade them set the Princess and the steed as far as eye could reach from the King and his troops and said to him With thy leave and at thy word I will now proceed to the fumigations and conjurations and here imprison the adversary of mankind that he may never more return to her After this I shall mount this wooden horse which seemeth to be made of ebony and take the damsel up behind me whereupon it will shake and sway to and fro and fare forwards till it come to thee when the affair will be at an end and after this thou mayst do with her as thou wilt When the King heard his words he rejoiced with extreme joy so the Prince mounted the horse and taking the damsel up behind him whilst the King and his troops watched him bound her fast to him Then he turned the ascending pin and the horse took flight and soared with them high in air till they disappeared from every eye After this the King abode half the day expecting their return but they returned not So when he despaired of them repenting him greatly of that which he had done and grieving sore for the loss of the damsel he went back to the city with his troops He then sent for the Persian who was in prison and said to him O thou traitor O thou villian why didst thou hide from me the mystery of the ebony horse And now a sharper hath come to me and hath carried it off together with a slave girl whose ornaments are worth a mint of money and I shall never see anyone or anything of them again So the Persian related to him all his past first and last and the King was seized with a fit of fury which well nigh ended his life He shut himself up in his palace for a while mourning and afflicted but at last his Wazirs came in to him and applied themselves to comfort him saying Verily he who took the damsel is an enchanter and praised be Allah who hath delivered thee from his craft and sorcery And they ceased not from him till he was comforted for her loss Thus far concerning the King but as for the Prince he continued his career towards his father s capital in joy and cheer and stayed not till he alighted on his own palace where he set the lady in safety after which he went in to his father and mother and saluted them and acquainted them with her coming whereat they were filled with solace and gladness Then he spread great banquets for the towns folk And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King s son spread great banquets for the towns folk and they held high festival a whole month at the end of which time he went in to the Princess and they took their joy of each other with exceeding joy But his father brake the ebony horse in pieces and destroyed its mechanism for flight moreover the Prince wrote a letter to the Princess s father advising him of all that had befallen her and informing him how she was now married to him and in all health and happiness and sent it by a messenger together with costly presents and curious rarities And when the messenger arrived at the city which was Sana a and delivered the letter and the presents to the King he read the missive and rejoiced greatly thereat and accepted the presents honouring and rewarding the bearer handsomely Moreover he forwarded rich gifts to his son in law by the same messenger who returned to his master and acquainted him with what had passed whereat he was much cheered And after this the Prince wrote a letter every year to his father in law and sent him presents till in course of time his sire King Sabur deceased and he reigned in his stead ruling justly over his lieges and conducting himself well and righteously towards them so that the land submitted to him and his subjects did him loyal service and Kamar al Akmar and his wife Shams al Nahar abode in the enjoyment of all satisfaction and solace of life till there came to them the Destroyer of deligights and Sunderer of societies the Plunderer of palaces the Caterer for cemeteries and the Garnerer of graves And now glory be to the Living One who dieth not and in whose hand is the dominion of the worlds visible and invisible Moreover I have heard tell the tale of UNS AL WUJUD AND THE WAZIR S DAUGHTER AL WARD FI L AKMAM OR ROSE IN HOOD FN thirty There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a King of great power and lord of glory and dominion galore who had a Wazir Ibrahim hight and this Wazir s daughter was a damsel of extraordinary beauty and loveliness gifted with passing brilliancy and the perfection of grace possessed of abundant wit and in all good breeding complete But she loved wassail and wine and the human face divine and choice verses and rare stories and the delicacy of her inner gifts invited all hearts to love even as saith the poet describing her Like moon she shines amid the starry sky Robing in tresses blackest ink outvie The morning breezes give her boughs fair drink And like a branch she sways with supple ply She smiles in passing us O thou that art Fairest in yellow robed or cramoisie Thou playest with my wit in love as though Sparrow in hand of playful boy were I FN thirty one Her name was Rose in Hood and she was so named for her young and tender beauty and the freshness of her brilliancy and the King loved her in his cups because of her accomplishments and fine manners Now it was the King s custom yearly to gather together all the nobles of his realm and play with the ball FN thirty two So when the day came round whereon the folk assembled for ballplay the Minister s daughter seated herself at her lattice to divert herself by looking on at the game and as they were at play her glance fell upon a youth among the guards than whom never was seen a comelier face nor a goodlier form for he was bright of favour showing white teeth when he smiled tall statured and broad shouldered She looked at him again and again and could not take her fill of gazing and presently said to her nurse What is the name of yonder handsome young man among the troops Replied the nurse O my daughter the dear fellows are all handsome Which of them dost thou mean Said Rose in Hood Wait till he come past and I will point him out to thee So she took an apple and as he rode by dropped it on him whereupon he raised his head to see who did this and espied the Wazir s daughter at the window as she were the moon of fullest light in the darkness of the night nor did he withdraw his eyes till his heart was utterly lost to her and he recited these lines Was t archer shot me or was t thine eyes Ruined lover s heart that thy charms espies Was the notched shaft FN thirty three from a host outshot Or from latticed window in sudden guise When the game was at an end and all had left the ground she asked her nurse What is the name of that youth I showed thee and the good woman answered His name is Uns al Wujud whereat Rose in Hood shook her head and lay down on her couch with thoughts a fire for love Then sighing deeply she improvised these couplets He missed not who dubbed thee World s delight A world s love conjoining to bounty s light FN thirty four O thou whose favour the full moon favours Whose charms make life and the living bright Thou hast none equal among mankind Sultan of Beauty and proof I ll cite Thine eye brows are likest a well formed Nun FN thirty five And thine eyes a Sad FN thirty six by His hand indite Thy shape is the soft green bough that gives When asked to all with all gracious sprite Thou excellest knights of the world in stowre With delight and beauty and bounty dight When she had finished her verses she wrote them on a sheet of paper which she folded in a piece of golf embroidered silk and placed under her pillow Now one of her nurses had seen her so she came up to her and held her in talk till she slept when she stole the scroll from under her pillow and after reading it knew that she had fallen in love with Uns al Wujud Then she returned the scroll to its place and when her mistress awoke she said to her O my lady indeed I am to thee a true counsellor and am tenderly anxious on thy account Know that love is a tyrant and the hiding it melteth iron and entaileth sickness and unease nor for whoso confesseth it is there aught of reproach Rejoined Rose in Hood And what is the medicine of passion O nurse mine Answered the nurse The medicine of passion is enjoyment Quoth she And how may one come by enjoyment Quoth the other By letters and messages my lady by whispered words of compliment and by greetings before the world FN thirty seven all this bringeth lovers together and makes hard matters easy So if thou have aught at heart mistress mine I am the fittest to keep thy secret and do thy desires and carry thy letters Now when the damsel heard this her reason flew and fled for joy but she restrained herself from speech till she should see the issue of the matter saying within herself None knoweth this thing of me nor will I trust this one with my secret till I have tried her Then said the woman O my lady I saw in my sleep as though a man came to me and said Thy mistress and Uns al Wujud love each other so do thou serve their case by carrying their messages and doing their desires and keeping their secrets and much good shall befal thee So now I have told thee my vision and it is thine to decide Quoth Rose in Hood after she heard of the dream And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Rose in Hood asked her nurse after hearing of the dream Tell me canst thou keep a secret O my nurse whereto she answered And how should I not keep secrecy I that am of the flower of the free FN thirty eight Then the maiden pulled out the scroll whereon she had written the verses and said Carry me this my letter to Uns al Wujud and bring me his reply The nurse took the letter and repairing to Uns al Wujud kissed his hands and greeted him right courteously then gave him the paper and he read it and comprehending the contents wrote on the back these couplets I soothe my heart and my love repel But my state interprets my love too well When tears flow I tell them mine eyes are ill Lest the censor see and my case fortell I was fancy free and unknew I Love But I fell in love and in madness fell I show you my case and complain of pain Pine and ecstasy that your ruth compel I write you with tears of eyes so belike They explain the love come my heart to quell Allah guard a face that is veiled with charms Whose thrall is Moon and the Stars as well In her beauty I never beheld the like From her sway the branches learn sway and swell I beg you an tis not too much of pains To call FN thirty nine twere boon without parallel I give you a soul you will haply take To which Union is Heaven Disunion Hell Then he folded the letter and kissing it gave it to the go between and said to her O nurse incline the lady s heart to me To hear is to obey answered she and carried the script to her mistress who kissed it and laid it on her head then she opened it and read it and understood it and wrote at the foot of it these couplets O whose heart by our beauty is captive ta en Have patience and all thou shalt haply gain When we knew that thy love was a true affect And what pained our heart to thy heart gave pain We had granted thee wished for call and more But hindered so doing the chamberlain When the night grows dark through our love s excess Fire burns our vitals with might and main And sleep from our beds is driven afar And our bodies are tortured by passion bane Hide Love in Love s code is the first command And from raising his veil thy hand restrain I fell love fulfilled by yon gazelle Would he never wander from where I dwell Then she folded the letter and gave it to the nurse who took it and went out from her mistress to seek the young man but as she would fare forth the chamberlain met her and said to her Whither away To the bath answered she but in her fear and confusion she dropped the letter without knowing it and went off unrecking what she had done when one of the eunuchs seeing it lying in the way picked it up When the nurse came without the door she sought for it but found it not so turned back to her mistress and told her of this and what had befallen her Meanwhile the Wazir came out of the Harim and seated himself on his couch whereupon behold the eunuch who had picked up the letter came in to him hending it in hand and said O my lord I found this paper lying upon the floor and picked it up So the Minister took it from his hand folded as it was and opening it read the verses as above set down Then after mastering the meaning he examined the writing and knew it for his daughter s hand whereupon he went to her mother weeping so abundant tears that his beard was wetted His wife asked him What maketh thee weep O my lord and he answered Take this letter and see what is therein So she took it and found it to be a love letter from her daughter Rose in Hood to Uns al Wujud whereupon the ready drops sprang to her eyes but she composed her mind and gulping down her tears said to her husband O my lord there is no profit in weeping the right course is to cast about for a means of keeping thine honour and concealing the affair of thy daughter And she went on to comfort him and lighten his trouble but he said I am fearful for my daughter by reason of this new passion Knowest thou not that the Sultan loveth Uns al Wujud with exceeding love And my fear hath two causes The first concerneth myself it is that she is my daughter the second is on account of the King for that Uns al Wujud is a favourite with the Sultan and peradventure great troubles shall come out of this affair What deemest thou should be done And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir after recounting the affair of his daughter asked his wife What deemest thou should be done And she answered Have patience whilst I pray the prayer for right direction So she prayed a two bow prayer according to the prophetic FN forty ordinance for seeking divine guidance after which she said to her husband In the midst of the Sea of Treasures FN forty one standeth a mountain named the Mount of the Bereaved Mother the cause of which being so called shall presently follow in its place Inshallah and thither can none have access save with pains and difficulty and distress do thou make that same her abiding place Accordingly the Minister and his wife agreed to build on that mountain a virgin castle and lodge their daughter therein with the necessary provision to be renewed year by year and attendants to cheer and to serve her Accordingly he collected carpenters builders and architects and despatched them to the mountain where they builded her an impregnable castle never saw eyes the like thereof Then he made ready vivers and carriage for the journey and going in to his daughter by night bade her prepare to set out on a pleasure excursion Thereupon her heart presaged the sorrows of separation and when she went forth and saw the preparations for the journey she wept with sore weeping and wrote that upon the door which might acquaint her lover with what had passed and with the transports of passion and grief that were upon her transports such as would make the flesh to shiver and hair to stare and melt the hardest stone with care and tear from every eye a tear And what she wrote were these couplets By Allah O thou house if my beloved a morn go by And greet with signs and signals lover e er is wont to fly I pray thee give him our salams in pure and fragrant guise For he indeed may never know where we this eve shall lie I wot not whither they have fared thus bearing us afar At speed and lightly quipt the lighter from one love to fly When starkens night the birds in brake or branches snugly perched Wail for our sorrow and announce our hapless destiny The tongue of their condition saith Alas alas for woe And heavy brunt of parting blow two lovers must aby When viewed I separation cups were filled to the brim And us with merest sorrow wine Fate came so fast to ply I mixed them with becoming share of patience self to excuse But Patience for the loss of you her solace doth refuse Now when she ended her lines she mounted and they set forward with her crossing and cutting over wold and wild and riant dale and rugged hill till they came to the shore of the Sea of Treasures here they pitched their tents and built her a great ship wherein they went down with her and her suite and carried them over to the mountain The Minister had ordered them on reaching the journey s end to set her in the castle and to make their way back to the shore where they were to break up the vessel So they did his bidding and returned home weeping over what had befallen Such was their case but as regards Uns al Wujud he arose from sleep and prayed the dawn prayer after which he took horse and rode forth to attend upon the Sultan On his way he passed by the Wazir s house thinking perchance to see some of his followers as of wont but he saw no one and looking upon the door he read written thereon the verses aforesaid At this sight his senses failed him fire was kindled in his vitals and he returned to his lodging where he passed the day in trouble and transports of grief without finding ease or patience till night darkened upon him when his yearning and love longing redoubled Thereupon by way of concealment he disguised himself in the ragged garb of a Fakir FN forty two and set out wandering at random through the glooms of night distracted and knowing not whither he went So he wandered on all that night and next day till the heat of the sun waxed fierce and the mountains flamed like fire and thirst was grievous upon him Presently he espied a tree by whose side was a thin thread of running water so he made towards it and sitting down in the shade on the bank of the rivulet essayed to drink but found that the water had no taste in his mouth FN forty three and indeed his colour had changed and his face had yellowed and his feet were swollen with travel and travail So he shed copious tears and repeated these couplets The lover is drunken with love of friend On a longing that groweth his joys depend Love distracted ardent bewildered lost From home nor may food aught of pleasure lend How can life be delightsome to one in love And from lover parted twere strange unkenned I melt with the fire of my pine for them And the tears down my cheek in a stream descend Shall I see them say me or one that comes From the camp who th afflicted heart shall tend And after thus reciting he wept till he wetted the hard dry ground but anon without loss of time he rose and fared on again over waste and wold till there came out upon him a lion with a neck buried in tangled mane a head the bigness of a dome a mouth wider than the door thereof and teeth like elephants tusks Now when Uns al Wujud saw him he gave himself up for lost and turning FN forty four towards the Temple of Meccah pronounced the professions of the faith and prepared for death He had read in books that whoso will flatter the lion beguileth him FN forty five for that he is readily duped by smooth speech and gentled by being glorified so he began and said O Lion of the forest O Lord of the waste O terrible Leo O father of fighters O Sultan of wild beasts Behold I am a lover in longing whom passion and severance have been wronging since I parted from my dear I have lost my reasoning gear wherefore to my speech do thou give ear and have ruth on my passion and hope and fear When the lion heard this he drew back from him and sitting down on his hindquarters raised his head to him and began to frisk tail and paws which when Uns al Wujud saw he recited these couplets Lion of the wold wilt thou murther me Ere I meet her who doomed me to slavery I am not game and I bear no fat For the loss of my love makes me sickness dree And estrangement from her hath so worn me down I am like a shape in a shroud we see O thou sire of spoils FN forty six O thou lion of war Give not my pains to the blamer s gree I burn with love I am drowned in tears For a parting from lover sore misery And my thoughts of her in the murk of night For love hath make my being unbe As he had finished his lines the lion rose And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that as Uns al Wujud ended his lines the lion arose and stalked slowly up to him with eyes tear railing and licked him with his tongue then walked on before him signing to him as though saying Follow me So he followed him and the beast ceased not leading him on for a while till he brought him up a mountain and guided him to the farther side where he came upon the track of a caravan over the desert and knew it to be that of Rose in Hood and her company Then he took the trail and when the lion saw that he knew the track for that of the party which escorted her he turned back and went his way whilst Uns al Wujud walked along the foot marks day and night till they brought him to a dashing sea swollen with clashing surge The trail led down to the sandy shore and there broke off whereby he knew that they had taken ship and had continued their journey by water So he lost hope of finding his lover and with hot tears he repeated these couplets Far is the fane and patience faileth me How can I seek them FN forty seven o er the abyssmal sea Or how be patient when my vitals burn For love of them and sleep waxed insomny Since the sad day they left the home and fled My heart s consumed by love s ardency Sayhun Jayhun FN forty eight Euphrates like my tears Make flood no deluged rain its like can see Mine eyelids chafed with running tears remain My heart from fiery sparks is never free The hosts of love and longing pressed me And made the hosts of patience break and flee I ve risked my life too freely for their love And risk of life the least of ills shall be Allah ne er punish eye that saw those charms Enshrined and passing full moon s brilliancy I found me felled by fair wide opened eyes Which pierced my heart with stringless archery And soft lithe swaying shape enraptured me As sway the branches of the willow tree Wi them I covet union that I win O er love pains cark and care a mastery For love of them aye morn and eve I pine And doubt all came to me from evil eyne And when his lines were ended he wept till he swooned away and abode in his swoon a long while but as soon as he came to himself he looked right and left and seeing no one in the desert he became fearful of the wild beasts so he clomb to the top of a high mountain where he heard the voice of a son of Adam speaking within a cave He listened and lo they were the accents of a devotee who had forsworn the world and given himself up to pious works and worship He knocked thrice at the cavern door but the hermit made him no answer neither came forth to him wherefore he groaned aloud and recited these couplets What pathway find I my desire t obtain How scape from care and cark and pain and bane All terrors join to make me old and hoar Of head and heart ere youth from me is ta en Nor find I any aid my passion nor A friend to lighten load of bane and pain How great and many troubles I ve endured Fortune hath turned her back I see unfain Ah mercy mercy on the lover s heart Doomed cup of parting and desertion drain A fire is in his heart his vitals waste And severance made his reason vainest vain How dread the day I came to her abode And saw the writ they wrote on doorway lain I wept till gave I earth to drink my grief But still to near and far FN forty nine I did but feign Then strayed I till in waste a lion sprang On me and but for flattering words had slain I soothed him so he spared me and lent me aid He too might haply of love s taste complain O devotee that idlest in thy cave Meseems eke thou hast learned Love s might and main But if at end of woes with them I league Straight I ll forget all suffering and fatigue Hardly had he made an end of these verses when behold the door of the cavern opened and he heard one say Alas the pity of it FN fifty So he entered and saluted the devotee who returned his salam and asked him What is thy name Answered the young man Uns al Wujud And what caused thee to come hither quoth the hermit So he told him his story in its entirety omitting naught of his misfortunes whereat he wept and said O Uns al Wujud these twenty years have I passed in this place but never beheld I any man here until yesterday when I heard a noise of weeping and lamentation and looking forth in the direction of the sound saw many people and tents pitched on the sea shore and the party at once proceeded to build a ship in which certain of them embarked and sailed over the waters Then some of the crew returned with the ship and breaking it up went their way and I suspect that those who embarked in the ship and returned not are they whom thou seekest In that case O Uns al Wujud thy grief must needs be great and sore and thou art excusable though never yet was lover but suffered love longing Then he recited these couplets Uns al Wujud dost deem me fancy free When pine and longing slay and quicken me I have known love and yearning from the years Since mother milk I drank nor e er was free Long struggled I with Love till learnt his might Ask thou of him he ll tell with willing gree Love sick and pining drank I passion cup And well nigh perished in mine agony Strong was I but my strength to weakness turned And eye sword brake through Patience armoury Hope not to win love joys without annoy Contrary ever links with contrary But fear not change from lover true be true Unto thy wish some day thine own twill be Love hath forbidden to his votaries Relinquishment as deadliest heresy The eremite having ended his verse rose and coming up to Uns al Wujud embraced him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the eremite having ended his verse rose and coming up to Uns al Wujud embraced him and they wept together till the hills rang with their cries and they fell down fainting When they revived they swore brotherhood FN fifty one in Allah Almighty after which said Uns al Wujud This very night will I pray to God and seek of Him direction FN fifty two anent what thou shouldst do to attain thy desire Thus it was with them but as regards Rose in Hood when they brought her to the mountain and set her in the castle and she beheld its ordering she wept and exclaimed By Allah thou art a goodly place save that thou lackest in thee the presence of the beloved FN fifty three Then seeing birds in the island she bade her people set snares for them and put all they caught in cages within the castle and they did so But she sat at a lattice and bethought her of what had passed and desire and passion and distraction redoubled upon her till she burst into tears and repeated these couplets O to whom now of my desire complaining sore shall I Bewail my parting from my fere compelled thus to fly Flames rage within what underlies my ribs yet hide them I In deepest secret dreading aye the jealous hostile spy I am grown as lean attenuate as any pick of tooth FN fifty four By sore estrangement absence ardour ceaseless sob and sigh Where is the eye of my beloved to see how I m become Like tree stripped bare of leafage left to linger and to die They tyrannised over me whom they confined in place Whereto the lover of my heart may never draw him nigh I beg the Sun for me to give greetings a thousandfold At time of rising and again when setting from the sky To the beloved one who shames a full moon s loveliness When shows that slender form that doth the willow branch outvie If Rose herself would even with his cheek I say of her Thou art not like it if to me my portion thou deny FN fifty five His honey dew of lips is like the grateful water draught Would cool me when a fire in heart upflameth fierce and high How shall I give him up who is my heart and soul of me My malady my wasting cause my love sole leach of me Then as the glooms of night closed around her her yearning increased and she called to mind the past and recited also these couplets Tis dark my transport and unease now gather might and main And love desire provoketh me to wake my wonted pain The pang of parting takes for ever place within my breast And pining makes me desolate in destitution lain Ecstasy sore maltreats my soul and yearning burns my sprite And tears betray love s secresy which I would lief contain I weet no way I know no case that can make light my load Or heal my wasting body or cast out from me this bane A hell of fire is in my heart upflames with lambent tongue And Laza s furnace fires within my liver place have ta en O thou exaggerating blame for what befel enough I bear with patience whatsoe er hath writ for me the Pen I swear by Allah ne er to find aught comfort for their loss Tis oath of passion s children and their oaths are ne er in vain O Night Salams of me to friends and let to them be known Of thee true knowledge how I wake and waking ever wone Meanwhile the hermit said to Uns al Wujud Go down to the palm grove in the valley and fetch some fibre FN fifty six So he went and returned with the palm fibre which the hermit took and twisting into ropes make therewith a net FN fifty seven such as is used for carrying straw after which he said O Uns al Wujud in the heart of the valley groweth a gourd which springeth up and drieth upon its roots Go down there and fill this sack therewith then tie it together and casting it into the water embark thereon and make for the midst of the sea so haply thou shalt win thy wish for whoso never ventureth shall not have what he seeketh I hear and obey answered Uns al Wujud Then he bade the hermit farewell after the holy man had prayed for him and betaking himself to the sole of the valley did as his adviser had counselled him made the sack launched it upon the water and pushed from shore Then there arose a wind which drave him out to sea till he was lost to the eremite s view and he ceased not to float over the abysses of the ocean one billow tossing him up and another bearing him down and he beholding the while the dangers and marvels of the deep for the space of three days At the end of that time Fate cast him upon the Mount of the Bereft Mother where he landed giddy and tottering like a chick unfledged and at the last of his strength for hunger and thirst but finding there streams flowing and birds on the branches cooing and fruit laden trees in clusters and singly growing he ate of the fruits and drank of the rills Then he walked on till he saw some white thing afar off and making for it found that it was a strongly fortified castle So he went up to the gate and seeing it locked sat down by it and there he sat for three days when behold the gate opened and an eunuch came out who finding Uns al Wujud there seated said to him Whence camest thou and who brought thee hither Quoth he From Ispahan and I was voyaging with merchandise when my ship was wrecked and the waves cast me upon the farther side of this island Whereupon the eunuch wept and embraced him saying Allah preserve thee O thou friendly face Ispahan is mine own country and I have there a cousin the daughter of my father s brother whom I loved from my childhood and cherished with fond affection but a people stronger than we fell upon us in foray and taking me among other booty cut off my yard FN fifty eight and sold me for a castrato whilst I was yet a lad and this is how I came to be in such case And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the eunuch who came forth from the castle where Rose in Hood was confined told Uns al Wujud all his tale and said The raiders who captured me cut off my yard and sold me for a castrato and this is how I came to be in such case FN fifty nine And after saluting him and wishing him long life the eunuch carried him into the courtyard of the castle where he saw a great tank of water surrounded by trees on whose branches hung cages of silver with doors of gold and therein birds were warbling and singing the praises of the Requiting King And when he came to the first cage he looked in and lo a turtle dove on seeing him raised her voice and cried out saying O Thou Bounty fraught Whereat he fell down fainting and after coming to himself he sighed heavily and recited these couplets O turtle dove like me art thou distraught Then pray the Lord and sing O Bounty fraught Would I knew an thy moan were sign of joy Or cry of love desire in heart inwrought An moan thou pining for a lover gone Who left thee woe begone to pine in thought Or if like me hast lost thy fondest friend And severance long desire to memory brought O Allah guard a faithful lover s lot I will not leave her though my bones go rot Then after ending his verses he fainted again and presently reviving he went on to the second cage wherein he found a ringdove When it saw him it sang out O Eternal I thank thee and he groaned and recited these couplets I heard a ringdove chanting plaintively I thank Thee O Eternal for this misery Haply perchance may Allah of His grace Send me by this long round my love to see Full oft FN sixty she comes with honeyed lips dark red And heaps up lowe upon love s ardency Quoth I while longing fires flame high and fierce In heart and wasting life s vitality And tears like gouts of blood go railing down In torrents over cheeks now pale of blee None e er trod earth that was not born to woe But I will patient dree mine agony So help me Allah till that happy day When with my mistress I unite shall be Then will I spend my good on lover wights Who re of my tribe and of the faith of me And loose the very birds from jail set free And change my grief for gladdest gree and glee Then he went on to the third cage wherein he found a mockingbird FN sixty one which when it saw him set up a song and he recited the following couplets Pleaseth me yon Hazar of mocking strain Like voice of lover pained by love in vain Woe s me for lovers Ah how many men By nights and pine and passion low are lain As though by stress of love they had been made Morn less and sleep less by their pain and bane When I went daft for him who conquered me And pined for him who proved of proudest strain My tears in streams down trickled and I cried These long linkt tears bind like an adamant chain Grew concupiscence severance long and I Lost Patience hoards and grief waxed sovereign If Justice bide in world and me unite With him I love and Allah veil us deign I ll strip my clothes that he my form shall sight With parting distance grief how poor of plight Then he went to the fourth cage where he found a Bulbul FN sixty two which at sight of him began to sway to and fro and sing its plaintive descant and when he heard its complaint he burst into tears and repeated these couplets The Bulbul s note whenas dawn is nigh Tells the lover from strains of strings to fly Complaineth for passion Uns al Wujud For pine that would being to him deny How many a strain do we hear whose sound Softens stones and the rock can mollify And the breeze of morning that sweetly speaks Of meadows in flowered greenery And scents and sounds in the morning tide Of birds and zephyrs in fragrance vie But I think of one of an absent friend And tears rail like rain from a showery sky And the flamy tongues in my breast uprise As sparks from gleed that in dark air fly Allah deign vouchsafe to a lover distraught Someday the face of his dear to descry For lovers indeed no excuse is clear Save excuse of sight and excuse of eye Then he walked on a little and came to a goodly cage than which was no goodlier there and in it a culver of the forest that is to say a wood pigeon FN sixty three the bird renowned among birds as the minstrel of love longing with a collar of jewels about its neck marvellous fine and fair He considered it awhile and seeing it absently brooding in its cage he shed tears and repeated these couplets O culver of copse FN sixty four with salams I greet O brother of lovers who woe must weet I love a gazelle who is slender slim Whose glances for keenness the scymitar beat For her love are my heart and my vitals a fire And my frame consumes in love s fever heat The sweet taste of food is unlawful for me And forbidden is slumber unlawfullest sweet Endurance and solace have travelled from me And love homes in my heart and grief takes firm seat How shall life deal joy when they flee my sight Who are joy and gladness and life and sprite As soon as Uns al Wujud had ended his verse And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that as soon as Uns al Wujud had ended his verse the wood culver awoke from its brooding and cooed a reply to his lines and shrilled and trilled with its thrilling notes till it all but spake with human speech FN sixty five and the tongue of the case talked for it and recited these couplets O lover thou bringest to thought a tide When the strength of my youth first faded and died And a friend of whose form I was namoured Seductive and dight with beauty s pride Whose voice as he sat on the sandhill tree From the Nay s FN sixty six sweet sound turned my heart aside A fowler snared him in net the while O that man would leave me at large he cried I had hoped he might somewhat of mercy show When a hapless lover he so espied But Allah smite him who tore me away In his hardness of heart from my lover s side But aye my desire for him groweth more And my heart with the fires of disjunction is fried Allah guard a true lover who strives with love And hath borne the torments I still abide And seeing me bound in this cage with mind Of ruth release me my love to find Then Uns al Wujud turned to his companion the Ispahahi and said What palace is this Who built it and who abideth in it Quoth the eunuch The Wazir of a certain King built it to guard his daughter fearing for her the accidents of Time and the incidents of Fortune and lodged her herein her and her attendants nor do we open it save once in every year when their provision cometh to them And Uns al Wujud said to himself I have gained my end though I may have long to wait Such was his case but as regards Rose in Hood of a truth she took no pleasure in eating or drinking sitting or sleeping but her desire and passion and distraction redoubled on her and she went wandering about the castle corners but could find no issue wherefore she shed tears and recited these couplets They have cruelly ta en me from him my beloved And made me taste anguish in prison ta en They have fired my heart with the flames of love Barred all sight of him whom to see I m fain In a lofty palace they prisoned me On a mountain placed in the middle main If they d have me forget him right vain s their wish For my love is grown of a stronger strain How can I forget him whose face was cause Of all I suffer of all I plain The whole of my days in sorrow s spent And in thought of him through the night I m lain Remembrance of him cheers my solitude While I lorn of his presence and lone remain Would I knew if after this all my fate To oblige the desire of my hear will deign When her verses were ended she ascended to the terrace roof of the castle after donning her richest clothes and trinkets and throwing a necklace of jewels around her neck Then binding together some dresses of Ba albak FN sixty seven stuff by way of rope she tied them to the crenelles and let herself down thereby to the ground And she fared on over wastes and waterless wilds till she came to the shore where she saw a fisherman plying here and there over the sea for the wind had driven him on to the island When he saw her he was affrighted FN sixty eight and pushed off again flying from her but she cried out and made pressing signs to him to return versifying with these couplets O fisherman no care hast thou to fear I m but an earth born maid in mortal sphere I pray thee linger and my prayer grant And to my true unhappy tale give ear Pity so Allah spare thee warmest love Say hast thou seen him my beloved fere I love a lovely youth whose face excels Sunlight and passes moon when clearest clear The fawn that sees his glance is fain to cry I am his thrall and own himself no peer Beauty hath written on his winsome cheek Rare lines of pregnant sense for every seer Who sights the light of love his soul is saved Who strays is Infidel to Hell anear An thou in mercy show his sight O rare FN sixty nine Thou shalt have every wish the dearest dear Of rubies and what likest are to them Fresh pearls and unions new the seashell s tear My friend thou wilt forsure grant my desire Whose heart is melted in love s hottest fire When the fisherman heard her words he wept and made moan and lamented then recalling what had betided himself in the days of his youth when love had the mastery over him and longing and desire and distraction were sore upon him and the fires of passion consumed him replied with these couplets What fair excuse is this my pining plight With wasted limbs and tears unceasing blight And eyelids open in the nightly murk And heart like fire stick FN seventy ready fire to smite Indeed love burdened us in early youth And true from false coin soon we learned aright Then did we sell our soul on way of love And drunk of many a well FN seventy one to win her sight Venturing very life to gain her grace And make high profit perilling a mite Tis Love s religion whoso buys with life His lover s grace with highest gain is dight And when he ended his verse he moored his boat to the beach and said to her Embark so may I carry thee whither thou wilt Thereupon she embarked and he put off with her but they had not gone far from land before there came out a stern wind upon the boat and drove it swiftly out of sight of shore Now the fisherman knew not whither he went and the strong wind blew without ceasing three days when it fell by leave of Allah Almighty and they sailed on and ceased not sailing till they came in sight of a city sitting upon the sea shore And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the fisherman s craft carrying Rose in Hood made the city sitting upon the sea shore the man set about making fast to the land Now the King of the city was a Prince of pith and puissance named Dirbas the Lion and he chanced at that moment to be seated with his son at a window in the royal palace giving upon the sea and happening to look out seawards they saw the fishing boat make the land They observed it narrowly and espied therein a young lady as she were the full moon overhanging the horizon edge with pendants in her ears of costly balass rubies and a collar of precious stones about her throat Hereby the King knew that this must indeed be the daughter of some King or great noble and going forth of the sea gate of the palace went down to the boat where he found the lady asleep and the fisherman busied in making fast to shore So he went up to her and aroused her whereupon she awoke weeping and he asked her Whence comest thou and whose daughter art thou and what be the cause of thy coming hither and she answered I am the daughter of Ibrahim Wazir to King Shamikh and the manner of my coming hither is wondrous and the cause thereof marvellous And she told him her whole story first and last hiding naught from him then she groaned aloud and recited these couplets Tear drops have chafed mine eyelids and rail down in wondrous wise For parting pain that fills my sprite and turns to springs mine eyes For sake of friend who ever dwells within my vitals homed And I may never win my wish of him in any guise He hath a favour fair and bright and brilliant is his face Which every Turk and Arab wight in loveliness outvies The Sun and fullest Moon lout low whenas his charms they sight And lover like they bend to him whene er he deigneth rise A wondrous spell of gramarye like Kohl bedecks his eyne And shows thee bow with shaft on string make ready ere it flies O thou to whom I told my case expecting all excuse Pity a lover wight for whom Love shafts such fate devise Verily Love hath cast me on your coast despite of me Of will now weak and fain I trust mine honour thou wilt prize For noble men whenas perchance alight upon their bounds Grace worthy guests confess their worth and raise to dignities Then O thou hope of me to lovers folly veil afford And be to them reunion cause thou only liefest lord And when she had ended her verses she again told the King her sad tale and shed plenteous tears and recited these couplets bearing on her case We lived till saw we all the marvels Love can bear Each month to thee we hope shall fare as Rajab FN seventy two fare Is it not wondrous when I saw them march amorn That I with water o eyes in heart lit flames that flare That these mine eyelids rain fast dropping gouts of blood That now my cheek grows gold where rose and lily were As though the safflower hue that overspread my cheeks Were Joseph s coat made stain of lying blood to wear Now when the King heard her words he was certified of her love and longing and was moved to ruth for her so he said to her Fear nothing and be not troubled thou hast come to the term of thy wishes for there is no help but that I win for thee thy will and bring thee to thy desire And he improvised these couplets Daughter of nobles who thine aim shalt gain Hear gladdest news nor fear aught hurt of bane This day I ll pack up wealth and send it on To Shamikh guarded by a champion train Fresh pods of musk I ll send him and brocades And silver white and gold of yellow vein Yes and a letter shall inform him eke That I of kinship with that King am fain And I this day will lend thee bestest aid That all thou covetest thy soul assain I too have tasted love and know its taste And can excuse whoso the same cup drain FN seventy three Then ending his verse he went forth to his troops and summoned his Wazir and causing him to pack up countless treasure commanded him carry it to King Shamikh and say to him Needs must thou send me a person named Uns al Wujud and say moreover The King is minded to ally himself with thee by marrying his daughter to Uns al Wujud thine officer So there is no help but thou despatch him to me that the marriage may be solemnized in her father s kingdom And he wrote a letter to King Shamikh to this effect and gave it to the Minister charging him strictly to bring back Uns al Wujud and warning him An thou fail thou shalt be deposed and degraded Answered the Wazir I hear and obey and setting out forthright with the treasures in due course arrived at the court of King Shamikh whom he saluted in the name of King Dirbas and delivered the letter and the presents Now when King Shamikh read the letter and saw the name of Uns al Wujud he burst into tears and said to the Wazir And where or where is Uns al Wujud he went from us and we know not his place of abiding only bring him to me and I will give thee double the presents thou hast brought me And he wept and groaned and lamented saying these couplets To me restore my dear I want not wealth untold Nor crave I gifts of pearls Or gems or store of gold He was to us a moon In beauty s heavenly fold Passing in form and soul With roe compare withhold His form a willow wand His fruit lures manifold But willow lacketh power Men s hearts to have and hold I reared him from a babe On cot of coaxing roll d And now I mourn for him With woe in soul ensoul d Then turning to the Wazir who had brought the presents and the missive he said Go back to thy liege and acquaint him that Uns al Wujud hath been missing this year past and his lord knoweth not whither he is gone nor hath any tidings of him Answered the Minister of King Dirbas O my lord my master said to me An thou fail to bring him back thou shalt be degraded from the Wazirate and shall not enter my city How then can I return without him So King Shamikh said to his Wazir Ibrahim Take a company and go with him and make ye search for Uns al Wujud everywhere He replied Hearkening and obedience and taking a body of his own retainers set out accompanied by the Wazir of King Dirbas seeking Uns al Wujud And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Seventy ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ibrahim Wazir to King Shamikh took him a body of his retainers and accompanied by the Minister of King Dirbas set out seeking Uns al Wujud And as often as they fell in with wild Arabs or others they asked of the youth saying Tell us have ye seen a man whose name is so and so and his semblance thus and thus But they all answered We know him not Still they continued their quest enquiring in city and hamlet and seeking in fertile plain and stony hall and in the wild and in the wold till they made the Mountain of the Bereaved Mother and the Wazir of King Dirbas said to Ibrahim Why is this mountain thus called He answered Once of old time here sojourned a Jinniyah of the Jinn of China who loved a mortal with passionate love and being in fear of her life from her own people searched all the earth over for a place where she might hide him from them till she happened on this mountain and finding it cut off from both men and Jinn there being no access to it carried off her beloved and lodged him therein There when she could escape notice of her kith and kin she used privily to visit him and continued so doing till she had borne him a number of children and the merchants sailing by the mountain in their voyages over the main heard the weeping of the children as it were the wailing of a woman bereft of her babes and said Is there here a mother bereaved of her children For which reason the place was named the Mountain of the Bereaved Mother And the Wazir of King Dirbas marvelled at his words Then they landed and making for the castle knocked at the gate which was opened to them by an eunuch who knew the Wazir Ibrahim and kissed his hands The Minister entered and found in the courtyard among the serving men a Fakir which was Uns al Wujud but he knew him not and said Whence cometh yonder wight Quoth they He is a merchant who hath lost his goods but saved himself and he is an ecstatic FN seventy four So the Wazir left him and went on into the castle where he found no trace of his daughter and questioned her women who answered We wot not how or whither she went this place misliked her and she tarried in it but a short time Whereupon he wept sore and repeated these couplets Ho thou the house whose birds were singing gay Whose sills their wealth and pride were wont display Till came the lover wailing for his love And found thy doors wide open to the way Would Heaven I knew where is my soul that erst Was homed in house whose owners fared away Twas stored with all things bright and beautiful And showed its porters ranged in fair array They clothed it with brocades a bride become FN seventy five Would I knew whither went its lords ah say After ending his verses he again shed tears and groaned and bemoaned himself exclaiming There is no deliverance from the destiny decreed by Allah nor is there any escape from that which He hath predestined Then he went up to the roof and found the strips of Ba albak stuff tied to the crenelles and hanging down to the ground and thus it was he knew that she had descended thence and had fled forth as one distracted and demented with desire and passion Presently he turned and seeing there two birds a gor crow and an owl he justly deemed this an omen of ill so he groaned and recited these couplets I came to my dear friends door of my hopes the goal Whose sight mote assuage my sorrow and woes of soul No friends found I there nor was there another thing To find save a corby crow and an ill omened owl And the tongue o the case to me seemed to say Indeed This parting two lovers fond was cruel and foul So taste thou the sorrow thou madest them taste and live In grief wend thy ways and now in thy sorrow prowl Then he descended from the castle roof weeping and bade the servants fare forth and search the mount for their mistress so they sought for her but found her not Such was their case but as regards Uns al Wujud when he was certified that Rose in Hood was indeed gone he cried with a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit nor came to himself for a long time whilst the folk deemed that his spirit had been withdrawn by the Compassionating One and that he was absorbed in contemplation of the splendour majesty and beauty of the Requiting One Then despairing of finding Uns al Wujud and seeing that the Wazir Ibrahim was distracted for the loss of his daughter the Minister of King Dirbas addressed himself to return to his own country albeit he had not attained the object of his journey and while bidding his companion adieu said to him I have a mind to take the Fakir with me it may be Allah Almighty will incline the King s heart to me by his blessing for that he is a holy man and thereafter I will send him to Ispahan which is near our country Do as thou wilt answered Ibrahim So they took leave of each other and departed each for his own mother land the Wazir of King Dirbas carrying with him Uns al Wujud And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eightieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir of King Dirbas carried with him Uns al Wujud who was still insensible They bore him with them on mule back he unknowing if he were carried or not for three days when he came to himself and said Where am I Thou art in company with the Minister of King Dirbas replied they and went and gave news of his recovering to the Wazir who sent him rose water and sherbet of sugar of which they gave him to drink and restored him Then they ceased not faring on till they drew near King Dirbas s capital and the King being advised of his Wazir s coming wrote to him saying If Uns al Wujud be not with thee come not to me ever Now when the Wazir read the royal mandate it was grievous to him for he knew not that Rose in Hood was with the King nor why he had been sent in quest of Uns al Wujud nor the King s reason for desiring the alliance whilst Uns al Wujud also knew not whither they were bearing him or that the Wazir had been sent in quest of him nor did the Wazir know that the Fakir he had with him was Uns al Wujud himself And when the Minister saw that the sick man was whole he said to him I was despatched by the King on an errand which I have not been able to accomplish So when he heard of my return he wrote to me saying Except thou have fulfilled my need enter not my city And what is the King s need asked Uns al Wujud So the Wazir told him the whole tale and he said Fear nothing but go boldly to the King and take me with thee and I will be surety to thee for the coming of Uns al Wujud At this the Wazir rejoiced and cried Is this true which thou sayest Yes replied he whereupon the Wazir mounted and carried him to King Dirbas who after receiving their salutations said to him Where is Uns al Wujud Answered the young man O King I know where he is So the King called him to him and said Where Returned Uns al Wujud He is near hand and very near but tell me what thou wouldst with him and I will fetch him into thy presence The King replied With joy and good gree but the case calleth for privacy So he ordered the folk to withdraw and carrying Uns al Wujud into his cabinet told him the whole story whereupon quoth the youth Robe me in rich raiment and I will forthright bring Uns al Wujud to thee So they brought him a sumptuous dress and he donned it and said I am Uns al Wujud the World s Delight and to the envious a despite and presently he smote with his glances every sprite and began these couplets to recite My loved one s name in cheerless solitude aye cheereth me And driveth off my desperance and despondency I have no helper FN seventy six but my tears that ever flow in fount And as they flow they lighten woe and force my grief to flee My longing is so violent naught like it ere was seen My love tale is a marvel and my love a sight to see I spend the night with lids of eye that never close in sleep And pass in passion twixt the Hells and Edens heavenly I had of patience fairish store but now no more have I And love s sole gift to me hath been aye growing misery My frame is wasted by the pain of parting from my own And longing changed my shape and form and made me other be Mine eyelids by my torrent tears are chafed and ulcerate The tears whose flow to stay is mere impossibility My manly strength is sore impaired for I have lost my heart How many griefs upon my griefs have I been doomed to dree My heart and head are like in age with similar hoariness By loss of Beauty s lord FN seventy seven of lords the galaxy Despite our wills they parted us and doomed us parted wone While they our lords desire no more than love in unity Then ah would Heaven that I wot if stress of parting done The world will grant me sight of them in union fain and free Roll up the scroll of severance which others would unroll Efface my trouble by the grace of meeting s jubilee And shall I see them homed with me in cup company And change my melancholic mood for joy and jollity And when he had ended his verses the King cried aloud By Allah ye are indeed a pair of lovers true and fain and in Beauty s heaven of shining stars a twain your story is wondrous and your case marvellous Then he told him all that had befalled Rose in Hood and Uns al Wujud said Where is she O King of the age She is with me now answered Dirbas and sending for the Kazi and the witnesses drew up the contract of marriage between her and him Then he honoured Uns al Wujud with favours and bounties and sent to King Shamikh acquainting him with what had befallen whereat this King joyed with exceeding joy and wrote back the following purport Since the ceremony of contract hath been performed at thy court it behoveth that the marriage and its consummation be at mine Then he made ready camels horses and men and sent them in quest of the pair and when the embassy reached King Dirbas he gave the lovers much treasure and despatched them to King Shamikh s court with a company of his own troops The day of their arrival was a notable day never was seen a grander for the King gathered together all the singing women and players on instruments of music and made wedding banquets and held high festival seven days and on each day he gave largesse to the folk and bestowed on them sumptuous robes of honour Then Uns al Wujud went in to Rose in Hood and they embraced and sat weeping for excess of joy and gladness whilst she recited these couplets Joyance is come dispelling cark and care We are united enviers may despair The breeze of union blows enquickening Forms hearts and vitals fresh with fragrant air The splendour of delight with scents appears And round us FN seventy eight flags and drums show gladness rare Deem not we re weeping for our stress of grief It is for joy our tears as torrents fare How many fears we ve seen that now are past And bore we patient what was sore to bear One hour of joyance made us both forget What from excess of terror grey d our hair And when the verses were ended they again embraced and ceased not from their embrace till they fell down in a swoon And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eighty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Uns al Wujud and Rose in Hood embraced when they foregathered and ceased not from their embrace till they fell down in a swoon for the delight of reunion and when they came to themselves Uns al Wujud recited these couplets How joyously sweet are the nights that unite When my dearling deigns keep me the troth she did plight When union conjoins us in all that we have And parting is severed and sundered from sight To us comes the world with her favour so fair After frown and aversion and might despight Hath planted her banner Good Fortune for us And we drink of her cup in the purest delight We have met and complained of the pitiful Past And of nights a full many that doomed us to blight But now O my lady the Past is forgot The Compassionate pardon the Past for unright How sweet is existence how glad is to be This union my passion doth only incite And when he ended his verses they once more embraced drowned in the sea of passion and lay down together in the private apartment carousing and conversing and quoting verses and telling pleasant tales and anecdotes On this wise seven days passed over them whilst they knew not night from day and it was to them for very stress of gaiety and gladness pleasure and possession as if the seven days were but one day with ne er a morrow Not did they know the seventh day FN seventy nine but by the coming of the singers and players on instruments of music whereat Rose in Hood beyond measure wondered and improvised these couplets In spite of enviers jealousy at end We have won all we hoped of the friend We ve crowned our meeting with a close embrace On quilts where new brocades with sendal blend On bed of perfumed leather which the spoils Of downy birds luxuriously distend But I abstain me from unneeded wine When honey dews of lips sweet musk can lend Now from the sweets of union we unknow Time near and far if slow or fast it wend The seventh night hath come and gone O strange How went the nights we never reckt or kenned Till on the seventh wishing joy they said Allah prolong the meet of friend with friend When she had finished her song Uns al Wujud kissed her more than an hundred times and recited these couplets O day of joys to either lover fain The loved one came and freed from lonely pain She blest me with all inner charms she hath And companied with inner grace deep lain She made me drain the wine of love till I Was faint with joys her love had made me drain We toyed and joyed and on each other lay Then fell to wine and soft melodious strain And for excess of joyance never knew How went the day and how it came again Fair fall each lover may he union win And gain of joy like me the amplest gain Nor weet the taste of severance bitter fruit And joys assain them as they us assain Then they went forth and distributed to the folk alms and presents of money and raiment and rare gifts and other tokens of generosity after which Rose in Hood bade clear the bath for her FN eighty and turning to Uns al Wujud said to him O coolth of my eyes I have a mind to see thee in the Hammam and therein we will be alone together He joyfully consented to this and she let scent the Hammam with all sorts of perfumed woods and essences and light the wax candles Then of the excess of her contentment she recited these couplets O who didst win my love in other date And Present e er must speak of past estate And oh who art my sole sufficiency Nor want I other friends with me to mate Come to the Hammam O my light of eyes And enter Eden through Gehenna gate We ll scent with ambergris and aloes wood Till float the heavy clouds with fragrant freight And to the World we ll pardon all her sins And sue for mercy the Compassionate And I will cry when I descry thee there Good cheer sweet love all blessings on thee wait FN eighty one Whereupon they arose and fared to the bath and took their pleasure therein after which they returned to their palace and there abode in the fulness of enjoyment till there came to them the Destroyer of Delights and the Sunderer of societies and glory be to Him who changeth not neither ceaseth and to whom everything returneth And they also tell a tale of ABU NOWAS WITH THE THREE BOYS AND THE CALIPH HARUN AL RASHID FN eighty two Abu Nowas one day shut himself up and making ready a richly furnished feast collected for it meats of all kinds and of every colour that lips and tongue can desire Then he went forth to seek a minion worthy of such entertainment saying Allah my Lord and my Master I beseech Thee to send me one who befitteth this banquet and who is fit to carouse with me this day Hardly had he made an end of speaking when he espied three youths handsome and beardless as they were of the boys of Paradise FN eighty three differing in complexion but fellows in incomparable beauty and all hearts yearned with desire to the swaying of their bending shapes even to what saith the poet I passed a beardless pair without compare And cried I love you both you ferly fir Money d quoth one quoth I And lavish too Then said the fair pair Pere c est notre affaire Now Abu Nowas was given to these joys and loved to sport and make merry with fair boys and cull the rose from every brightly blooming check even as saith the bard Full many a reverend Shaykh feels sting of flesh Loves pretty faces shows at Pleasure s depot Awakes in Mosul FN eighty four land of purity And all the day dreams only of Aleppo FN eighty five So he accosted them with the salutation and they returned his greeting with civility and all honour and would have gone their several ways but he stayed them repeating these couplets Steer ye your steps to none but me Who hath a mine of luxury Old wine that shines with brightest blee Made by the monk in monastery And mutton meat the toothsomest And birds of all variety Then eat of these and drink of those Old wines that bring you jollity And have each other turn by turn Shampooing this my tool you see FN eighty six Thereupon the youths were beguiled by his verses and consented to his wishes And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three hundred and Eighty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Abu Nowas beguiled the youths with his wishes saying We hear and obey and accompanied him to his lodging where they found all ready that he had set forth in his couplets They sat down and ate and drank and made merry awhile after which they appealed to Abu Nowas to decide which of them was handsometh of face and shapliest of form So he pointed to one of them and having kissed him twice over recited the following verses I ll ransom that beauty spot with my soup Where s it and where is a money dole FN eighty seven Praise Him who hairless hath made that cheek And bid Beauty bide in that mole that mole Then he pointed to another and kissing his lips repeated these couplets And loveling weareth on his cheek a mole Like musk which virgin camphor ne er lets off it My peepers marvel such a contrast seeing And cried the Mole to me Now bless the Prophet FN eighty eight Then he pointed to the third and after kissing him half a score times repeated these couplets Melted pure gold in silvern bowl to drain The youth whose fingers wore a winey stain He with the drawers FN eighty nine served one cup of wine And served his wandering eyes the

when it came to the turn of Abu Nowas he took the goblet and repeated these couplets Drink not strong wine save at the slender dearling s hand Each like to other in all gifts the spirt grace For wine can never gladden toper s heart and soul Unless the cup boy show a bright and sparkling face Then he drank off his cup and the bowl went round and when it came to Abu Nowas again joyance got the mastery of him and he repeated these couplets For cup friends cup succeeding cup assign Brimming with grape juice brought in endliess line By hand of brown lipped FN ninety five Beauty who is sweet At wake as apple or musk finest fine FN ninety six Drink not the wine except from hand of fawn Whose cheek to kiss is sweeter than the wine Presently the drink got into his noddle drunkenness mastered him and he knew not hand from head so that he lolled from side to side in joy and inclined to the youths one and all anon kissing them and anon embracing them leg overlying leg And he showed no sense of sin or shame but recited these couplets None wotteth best joyance but generous youth When the pretty ones deign with him company keep This sings to him sings to him that when he wants A pick me up FN ninety seven lying there all of a heap And when of a loveling he needeth a kiss He takes from his lips or a draught or a nip Heaven bless them How sweetly my day with them sped A wonderful harvest of pleasure I reap Let us drink our good liquor both watered and pure And agree to swive all who dare slumber and sleep While they were in this deboshed state behold there came a knocking at the door so they bade him who knocked enter and behold it was the Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid When they saw him they all rose and kissed ground before him and Abu Nowas threw off the fumes of the wine for awe of the Caliph who said to him Holla Abu Nowas He replied Adsum at thy service O Commander of the Faithful whom Allah preserve The Caliph asked What state is this and the poet answered O Prince of True Believers my state indubitably dispenseth with questions Quoth the Caliph O Abu Nowas I have sought direction of Allah Almighty and have appointed thee Kazi of pimps and panders Asked he Dost thou indeed invest me with that high office O Commander of the Faithful and the Caliph answered I do whereupon Abu Nowas rejoined O Commander of the Faithful hast thou any suit to prefer to me Hereat the Caliph was wroth and presently turned away and left them full of rage and passed the night sore an angered against Abu Nowas who amid the party he had invited spent the merriest of nights and the jolliest and joyousest And when day break dawned and the star of morn appeared in sheen and shone he broke up the sitting and dismissing the youths donned his court dress and leaving his house set out for the palace of the Caliph Now it was the custom of the Commander of the Faithful when the Divan broke up to withdraw to his sitting saloon and summon thither his poets and cup companions and musicians each having his own place which he might not overpass So it happened that day he retired to his saloom and the friends and familiars came and seated themselves each in his rank and degree Presently in walked Abu Nowas and was about to take his usual seat when the Caliph cried to Masrur the sworder and bade him strip the poet of his clothes and bind an ass s packsaddle on his back and a halter about his head and a crupper under his rump and lead him round to all the lodgings of the slave girls And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three hundred and Eighty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph commanded Masrur the sworder to strip Abu Nowas of his court suit and bind an ass s packsaddle on his back and a halter about his head and a crupper under his rump and lead him round to all the lodgings of the slave girls and the chambers of the Harim that the women might make mock of him then cut off his head and bring it to him Hearkening and obedience replied Masrur and doing with Abu Nowas as the Caliph had bidden him led him round all the chambers whose number equalled the days of the year but Abu Nowas was a funny fellow so he made all the girls laugh with his buffooneries and each gave him something whereby he returned not save with a pocketful of money And while this was going on behold Ja afar the Barmecide who had been absent on an important business for the Commander of the Faithful entered and recognising the poet albeit in this plight said to him Holla Abu Nowas He said Here at thy service O our lord Ja afar asked What offence hast thou committed to bring this punishment on thee Thereupon he answered None whatsoever except that I made our lord the Caliph a present of the best of my poetry and he presented me in return with the best of his raiment When the Prince of True Believers head this he laughed from a heart full of wrath FN ninety eight and pardoned Abu Nowas and also gave him a myriad of money And they also recount the tale of ABDALLAH BIN MA AMAR WITH THE MAN OF BASSORAH AND HIS SLAVE GIRL A certain man of Bassorah once bought a slave girl and reared and educated her right well Moreover he loved her very dearly and spent all his substance in pleasuring and merry making with her til he had naught left and extreme poverty was sore upon him So she said to him O my master sell me for thou needest my price and it maketh my heart ache to see thy sorry and want full plight If thou vend me and make use of my value twill be better for thee than keeping me by thee and haply Almighty Allah will ample thee and amend thy fortune He agreed to this for the straitness of his case and carried her to the bazar where the broker offered her for sale to the Governor of Bassorah by name Abdallah bin Ma amar al Taymi and she pleased him So he bought her for five hundred dinars and paid the sum to her master but when he book the money and was about to go away the girl burst into tears and repeated these two couplets May coins though gainest joy in heart instil For me remaineth naught save saddest ill I say unto my soul which sorely grieves Thy friend departeth an thou will nor nill And when her master heard this he groaned and replied in these couplets Albeit this thy case lack all resource Nor findeth aught but death s doom pardon still Evening and morning thoughts of thee will dole Comfort to heart all woes and griefs full fill Peace be upon thee Meet we now no more Nor pair except at Ibn Ma amar s will Now when Abdullah bin Ma amar heard these verses and saw their affection he exclaimed By Allah I will not assist fate in separating you for it is evident to me that ye two indeed love each other So take the money and the damsel O man and Allah bless thee in both for verily parting be grievous to lovers So they kissed his hand and going away ceased not to dwell together till death did them part and glory be to Him whom death over taketh not And amonst stories is that of THE LOVERS OF THE BANU FN ninety nine OZRAH There was once among the Banu Ozrah a handsome and accomplished man who was never a single day out of love and it chanced that he became enamoured of a beauty of his own tribe and sent her many messages but she ceased not to entreat him with cruelty and disdain till for stress of love and longing and desire and distraction he fell sick of a sore sickness and took to his pillow and murdered sleep His malady redoubled on him and his torments increased and he was well nigh dead when his case became known among the folk and his passion notorious And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eighty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the man took to his pillow and murdered sleep So his case became known and his passion notorious and his infirmity grew upon him and his pains redoubled until he was well nigh dead His family and hers were urgent with her to visit him but she refused till he was at the point of death when being told of this she relented towards him and vouchsafed him a visit As soon as he saw her his eyes ran over with tears and he repeated from a broken heart An by thy life pass thee my funeral train A bier upborne upon the necks of four Wilt thou not follow it and greet the grave Where shall my corpse be graved for evermore Hearing this she wept with sore weeping and said to him By Allah I suspected not that passion had come to such a pass with thee as to cast thee into the arms of death Had I wist of this I had been favourable to thy wish and thou shouldst have had thy will At this his tears streamed down even as the clouds rail rain and he repeated this verse She drew near whenas death was departing us And deigned union grant when twas useless all Then he groaned one groan and died So she fell on him kissing him and weeping and ceased not weeping until she swooned away and when she came to herself she charged her people to bury her in his grave and with streaming eyes recited these two couplets We lived on earth a life of fair content And tribe and house and home of us were proud But Time in whirling flight departed us To join us now in womb of earth and shroud FN one hundred Then she fell again to weeping nor gave over shedding tears and lamenting till she fainted away and she lay three days senseless Then she died and was buried in his grave This is one of the strange chances of love FN one hundred one And I have heard related a tale of the WAZIR OF AL YAMAN AND HIS YOUNG BROTHER It is said that Badr al Din Wazir of Al Yaman had a young brother of singular beauty and kept strait watch over him so he applied himself to seek a tutor for him and coming upon a Shaykh of dignified and reverend aspect chaste and religious lodged him in a house next his own This lasted a long time and he used to come daily from his dwelling to that of Sahib FN one hundred two Badr al Din and teach the young brother After a while the old man s heart was taken with love for the youth and longing grew upon him and his vitals were troubled till one day he bemoaned his case to the boy who said What can I do seeing that I may not leave my brother night or day and thou thyself seest how careful he is over me Quoth the Shaykh My lodging adjoineth thine so there will be no difficulty when thy brother sleepeth to rise and entering the privy feign thyself asleep Then come to the parapet FN one hundred three of the terrace roof and I will receive thee on the other side of the wall so shalt thou sit with me an eye twinkling and return without thy brother s knowledge I hear and obey answered the lad and the tutor began to prepare gifts suitable to his degree Now when a while of the night was past he entered the water closet and waited until his brother lay down on his bed and took patience till he was drowned in sleep when he rose and going to the parapet of the terrace roof found standing there to await him the old man who gave him his hand and carried him to the sitting chamber where he had made ready various dainties for his entertainment and they sat down to carouse Now it was the night of the full moon and as they sat with the wine cup going round her rays shone upon them and the governor fell to singing But whilst they were thus in joy and jollity and mirth and merriment such as confoundeth the wit and the sight and defieth description lo the Wazir awoke and missing his brother arose in affright and found the door open So he went up to the roof and hearing a noise of talk climbed over the parapet to the adjoining terrace and saw a light shining from the lodging He looked in from behind the wall and espied his brother and his tutor sitting at carouse but the Shaykh became aware of him and sang cup in hand to a lively measure these couplets He made me drain his wine of honeyed lips Toasting with cheeks which rose and myrtle smother Then nighted in embrace cheek to my cheek A loveling midst mankind without another When the full moon arose on us and shone Pray she traduce us not to the big brother And it proved the perfect politeness of the Wazir Badr al Din that when he heard this he said By Allah I will not betray you And he went away and left them to their diversions They also tell a tale concerning THE LOVES OF THE BOY AND GIRL AT SCHOOL A free boy and a slave girl once learnt together in school and the boy fell passionately in love with the girl And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eighty Fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the lad fell passionately in love with the slave lass so one day when the other boys were heedless he took her tablet FN one hundred four and wrote on it these two couplets What sayest thou of him by sickness waste Until he s clean distraught for love of thee Who in the transport of his pain complains Nor can bear load of heart in secrecy Now when the girl took her tablet she read the verses written thereon and understanding them wept for ruth of him then she wrote thereunder these two couplets An if we behold a lover love fordone Desiring us our favours he shall see Yea what he wills of us he shall obtain And so befal us what befalling be Now it chanced that the teacher came in on them and taking the tablet unnoticed read what was written thereon So he was moved to pity of their case and wrote on the tablet beneath those already written these two couplets addressed to the girl Console thy lover fear no consequence He is daft with loving lowe s insanity But for the teacher fear not aught from him Love pain he learned long before learnt ye Presently it so happened that the girl s owner entered the school about the same time and finding the tablet read the above verses indited by the boy the girl and the schoolmaster and wrote under them these two couplets May Allah never make you parting dree And be your censurer shamed wearily But for the teacher ne er by Allah eye Of mine beheld a bigger pimp than he Then he sent for the Kazi and witnesses and married them on the spot Moreover he made them a wedding feast and treated them with exceeding munificence and they ceased not abiding together in joy and happiness till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies And equally pleasant is the story of AL MUTALAMMIS AND HIS WIFE UMAYMAH It is related Al Mutalammis FN one hundred five once fled from Al Nu uman bin Munzir FN one hundred six and was absent so long that folk deemed him dead Now he had a beautiful wife Umaymah by name and her family urged her to marry again but she refused for that she loved her husband Al Mutalammis very dearly However they were urgent with her because of the multitude of her suitors and importuned with her till at last she consented albe reluctantly and they espoused her to a man of her own tribe Now on the night of the wedding Al Mutalammis came back and hearing in the camp a noise of pipes and tabrets and seeing signs of a wedding festival asked some of the children what was the merry making to which they replied They have married Umaymah wife of Al Mutalammis to such an one and he goes in to her this night When he heard this he planned to enter the house amongst the mob of women and saw the twain seated on the bridal couch FN one hundred seven By and by the bridegroom came up to her whereupon she sighed heavily and weeping recited this couplet Would Heaven I knew but many are the shifts of joy and woe In what far distant land thou art my Mutalammis oh Now Al Mutalammis was a renowned poet so he answered her saying Right near at hand Umaymah mine when er the caravan Halted I never ceased for thee to pine I would thou know When the bridegroom heard this he guess how the case stood and went forth from them in hast improvising I was in bestest luck but now my luck goes contrary A hospitable house and room contain your loves you two And he returned not but left the twain to their privacy So Al Mutalammis and his wife abode together in all comfort and solace of life and in all its joys and jollities till death parted them And glory be to Him at whose command the earth and the heavens shall arise And among other tales is that of THE CALIPH HARUM AL RASHID AND QUEEN ZUBAYDAH IN THE BATH The Caliph Harun al Rashid loved the Lady Zubaydah with exceeding love and laid out for her a pleasaunce wherein he made a great tank and set thereabouts a screen of trees and led thither water from all sides hence the trees grew and interlaced over the basin so densely that one could go in and wash without being seen of any for the thickness of the leafage It chanced one day that Queen Zubaydah entered the garden and coming to the swimming bath And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eighty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Queen Zubaydah entered the garden one day and coming to the swimming bath gazed upon its goodliness and the sheen of the water and the overshading of the trees pleased her Now it was a day of exceeding heat so she doffed her clothes and entering the tank which was not deep enough to cover the whole person fell to pouring the water over herself from an ewer of silver It also happened that the Caliph heard she was in the pool so he left his palace and came down to spy upon her through the screen of the foliage He stood behind the trees and espied her mother nude showing everything that is kept hidden Presently she became aware of him and turning saw him behind the trees and was ashamed that he should see her naked So she laid her hands on her parts but the Mount of Venus escaped from between them by reason of its greatness and plumpness and the Caliph at once turned and went away wondering and reciting this couplet I looked on her with loving eyne And grew anew my old repine But he knew not what to say next so he sent for Abu Nowas and said to him Make me a piece of verse commencing with this line I hear and obey replied the poet and in an eye twinkling extemporised these couplets I looked on her with longing eyne And grew anew my old repine For the gazelle who captured me Where the two lotus trees incline There was the water poured on it From ewer of the silvern mine And seen me she had hidden it But twas too plump for fingers fine Would Heaven that I were on it An hour or better two hours li en FN one hundred eight Thereupon the Commander of the Faithful smiled and made him a handsome present and he went away rejoicing And I have heard another story of HARUN AL RASHID AND THE THREE POETS The Prince of True Believers Caliph Harun al Rashid was exceeding restless one night so he rose and walked about his palace till he happened upon a handmaid overcome with wine Now he was prodigiously enamoured of this damsel so he played with her and pulled her to him whereupon her zone fell down and her petticoat trousers were loosed and he besought her of amorous favour But she said to him O Commander of the Faithful wait till to morrow night for I am unprepared for thee knowing not of thy coming So he left her and went away But when the morrow showed its light and the sun shone bright he sent a page to her saying The Commander of the Faithful is about to visit thine apartment but she replied Day doth away with the promise of night So he said to his courtiers Make me somewhat of verse introducing these words The Promise of Night is effaced by Day Answered they We hear and obey and Al Rakashi FN one hundred nine came forward and recited the following couplets By Allah couldst thou but feel my pain Thy rest had turned and had fled away Hath left me in sorrow and love distraught Unseen and unseeing that fairest may She promised me grace then jilted and said The promise of night is effaced by day Then Abu Mus ab came forward and recited these couplets When wilt thou be wise and love heat allay That from food and sleeping so leads astray Suffices thee not ever weeping eye And vitals on fire when thy name they say He must smile and laugh and in pride must cry The promise of Night is effaced by Day Last came Abu Nowas and recited the following couplets As love waxt longer less met we tway And fell out but ended the useless fray One night in the palace I found her fou Yet of modesty still there was some display The veil from her shoulders had slipt and showed Her loosened trousers Love s seat and stay And rattled the breezes her huge hind cheeks And the branch where two little pomegranates lay Quoth I Give me tryst whereto quoth she To morrow the fane shall wear best array Next day I asked her Thy word Said she The promise of Night is effaced by Day The Caliph bade give a myriad of money each to Al Rakashi and Abu Mus ab but bade strike off the head of Abu Nowas saying Thou wast with us yesternight in the palace Said he By Allah I slept not but in my own house I was directed to what I said by thine own words as to the subject of the verse and indeed quoth Almighty Allah and He is the truest of all speakers As for poets devils pursue them dost thou not see that they rove as bereft of their senses through every valley and that they say that which they do not FN one hundred ten So the Caliph forgave him and gave him two myriads of money And another tale is that of MUS AB BIN AL ZUBAYR AND AYISHAH HIS WIFE It is told of Mus ab bin al Zubayr FN one hundred eleven that he met in Al Medinah Izzah who was one of the shrewdest of women and said to her I have a mind to marry Ayishah FN one hundred twelve daughter of Talhah and I should like thee to go herwards and spy out for me how she is made So she went away and returning to Mus ab said I have seen her and her face is fairer than health she hath large and well opened eyes and under them a nose straight and smooth as a cane oval cheeks and a mouth like a cleft pomegranate a neck as a silver ewer and below it a bosom with two breasts like twin pomegranates and further down a slim waist and a slender stomach with a navel therein as it were a casket of ivory and back parts like a hummock of sand and plumply rounded thighs and calves like columns of alabaster but I saw her feet to be large and thou wilt fall short with her in time of need Upon this report he married her And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Eighty seventh Day She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Izzah this wise reported of Ayishah bint Talhah Mus ab married her and went in to her And presently Izzah invited Ayishah and the women of the tribe Kuraysh to her house when Ayishah sang these two couplets with Mus ab standing by And the lips of girls that are perfume sweet So nice to kiss when with smiles they greet Yet ne er tasted I them but in thought of him And by thought the Ruler rules worldly seat The night of Mus ab s going in unto her he departed not from her till after seven bouts and on the morrow a freewoman of his met him and said to him May I be thy sacrifice Thou art perfect even in this And a certain woman said I was with Ayishah when her husband came in to her and she lusted for him so he fell upon her and she snarked and snorted and made use of all wonder of movements and marvellous new inventions and I the while within hearing So when he came out from her I said to her How canst thou do thus with thy rank and nobility and condition and I in thy house Quoth she Verily a woman should bring her husband all of which she is mistress by way of excitement and rare buckings and wrigglings and motitations FN one hundred thirteen What dislikest thou of this And I answered I would have this by nights Rejoined she Thus is it by day and by night I do more than this for when he seeth me desire stirreth him up and he falleth in heat so he putteth it out to me and I obey him and it is as thou seest And there also hath reached me an account of ABU AL ASWAD AND HIS SLAVE GIRL Abu al Aswad bought a native born slave girl who was blind of an eye and she pleased him but his people decried her to him whereat he wondered and turning the palms of his hands upwards FN one hundred fourteen recited these two couplets They find me fault with her where I default ne er find Save haply that a speck in either eye may show But if her eyes have fault of fault her form hath none Slim built above the waist and heavily made below And this is also told of HARUN AL RASHID AND THE TWO SLAVE GIRLS The Caliph Harun al Rashid lay one night between two slave girls one from Al Medinah and the other from Cufa and the Cufite rubbed his hands whilst the Medinite rubbed his feet and made his concern FN one hundred fifteen stand up Quoth the Cufite I see thou wouldst keep the whole of the stock in trade to thyself give me my share of it And the other answered I have been told by Malik on the authority of Hisham ibn Orwah FN one hundred sixteen who had it of his grand father that the Prophet said Whoso quickeneth the dead the dead belongeth to him and is his But the Cufite took her unawares and pushing her away seized it all in her own hand and said Al A amash telleth us on the authority of Khaysamah who had it of Abdallah bin Mas ud that the Prophet declared Game belongeth to him who taketh it not to him who raiseth it And this is also related of THE CALIPH HARUN AL RASHID AND THE THREE SLAVE GIRLS The Caliph Harun al Rashid once slept with three slave girls a Meccan a Medinite and an Irakite The Medinah girl put her hand to his yard and handled it whereupon it rose and the Meccan sprang up and drew it to herself Quoth the other What is this unjust aggression A tradition was related to me by Malik FN one hundred seventeen after Al Zuhri after Abdallah ibn Salim after Sa id bin Zayd that the Apostle of Allah whom Allah bless and keep said Whoso enquickeneth a dead land it is his And the Meccan answered It is related to us by Sufyan from Abu Zanad from Al A araj from Abu Horayrah that the Apostle of Allah said The quarry is his who catcheth it not his who starteth it But the Irak girl pushed them both away and taking it to herself said This is mine till your contention be decided And they tell a tale of THE MILLER AND HIS WIFE There was a miller who had an ass to turn his mill and he was married to a wicked wife whom he loved while she hated him because she was sweet upon a neighbour who misliked her and held aloof from her One night the miller saw in his sleep one who said to him Dig in such a spot of the ass s round in the mill and thou shalt find a hoard When he awoke he told his wife the vision and bade her keep the secret but she told her neighbour And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three hundred and Eighty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the miller s wife told the secret to the neighbour whom she loved thinking to win his favour and he agreed with her to come to her by night So he came and they dug in the mill and found the treasure and took it forth Then he asked her How shall we do with this and she answered We will divide it into two halves and will share it equally between us and do thou leave thy wife and I will cast about to rid me of my husband Then shalt thou marry me and when we are conjoined we will join the two halves of the treasure one to other and all will be in our hands Quoth he I fear lest Satan seduce thee and thou take some other man other than myself for gold in the house is like the sun in the world I reck therefore it were right that the money be all in my hands so thou give thy whole mind to getting free of thy husband and coming to me Quoth she I fear even as thou fearest nor will I yield up my part to thee for it was I directed thee to it When he heard this greed of gain prompted him to kill her so he slew her and threw her body into the empty hoard hole but day overtook him and hindered him from covering it up he therefore took the money and went his way Now after a while the miller awoke and missing his wife went into the mill where he fastened the ass to the beam and shouted to it It went on a little then stopped whereupon he beat it grievously but the more he bashed it the more it drew back for it was affrighted at the dead woman and could not go forward Thereupon the Miller unknowing what hindered the donkey took out a knife and goaded it again and again but still it would not budge Then he was wroth with it knowing not the cause of its obstinacy and drove the knife into its flanks and it fell down dead But when the sun rose he saw his donkey lying dead and likewise his wife in the place of the treasure and great was his rage and sore his wrath for the loss of his hoard and the death of his wife and his ass All this came of his letting his wife into his secret and not keeping it to himself FN one hundred eighteen And I have heard this tale of THE SIMPLETON AND THE SHARPER A certain simpleton was once walking along haling his ass after him by the halter when a pair of sharpers saw him and one said to his fellow I will take that ass from yonder wight Asked the other How wilt thou do that Follow me and I will show thee how answered the first So the cony catcher went up to the ass and loosing it from the halter gave the beast to his fellow then he haltered his own head and followed Tom Fool till he knew the other had got clean off with the ass when he stood still The oaf haled at the halter but the rascal stirred not so he turned and seeing the halter on a man s neck said to him What art thou Quoth the sharper I am thine ass and my story is a wonderous one and tis this Know that I have a pious old mother and come in to her one day drunk and she said to me O my son repent to the Almighty of these thy transgressions But I took my staff and beat her whereupon she cursed me and Allah changed me into an ass and caused me fall into thy hands where I have remained till this moment However to day my mother called me to mind and her heart yearned towards me so she prayed for me and the Lord restored me to my former shape amongst the sons of Adam Cried the silly one There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Allah upon thee O my brother acquit me of what I have done with thee in the way of riding and so forth Then he let the cony catcher go and returned home drunken with chagrin and concern as with wine His wife asked him What aileth thee and where is the donkey and he answered Thou knowest not what was this ass but I will tell thee So he told her the story and she exclaimed Alack and alas for the punishment we shall receive from Almighty Allah How could we have used a man as a beast of burden all this while And she gave alms by way of atonement and prayed pardon of Heaven FN one hundred nineteen Then the man abode awhile at home idle and feckless till she said to him How long wilt thou sit at home doing naught Go to the market and buy us an ass and ply thy work with it Accordingly he went to the market and stopped by the ass stand where behold he saw his own ass for sale So he went up to it and clapping his mouth to its ear said to it Woe to thee thou ne er do well Doubtless thou hast been getting drunk again and beating thy mother But by Allah I will never buy thee more FN one hundred twenty and he left it and went away And they tell a tale concerning THE KAZI ABU YUSUF WITH HARUN AL RASHID AND QUEEN ZUBAYDAH The Caliph Harun al Rashid went up one noon tide to his couch to lie down and mounting found upon the bed clothes semen freshly emitted whereat he was startled and troubled with sore trouble So he called the Lady Zubaydah and said to her What is that spilt on the bed She looked at it and replied O Commander of the Faithful it is semen Quoth he Tell me truly what this meaneth or I will lay violent hands on thee forthright Quoth she By Allah O Commander of the Faithful indeed I know not how it came there and I am guiltless of that whereof you suspectest me So he sent for the Kazi Abu Yusuf and acquainted him of the case The Judge raised his eyes to the ceiling and seeing a crack therein said to the Caliph O Commander of the Faithful in very sooth the bat hath seed like that of a man FN one hundred twenty one and this is bat s semen Then he called for a spear and thrust it into the crevice whereupon down fell the bat In this manner the Caliph s suspicions were dispelled And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three hundred and Eighty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Kazi Abu Yusuf took the spear and thrust it into the crevice down fell the bat and thus the Caliph s suspicions were dispelled and the innocence of Zubaydah was made manifest whereat she gave loud and liberal vent to her joy and promised Abu Yusuf a magnificent reward Now there were with her certain delicious fruits out of their season and she knew of others in the garden so she asked Abu Yusuf O Imam of the Faith which wouldst thou rather have of the two kinds of fruits those that are here or those that are not here And he answered Our code forbiddeth us to pronounce judgement on the absent whenas they are present we will give our decision So she let bring the two kinds of fruits before him and he ate of both Quoth she What is the difference between them and quoth he As often as I think to praise one kind the adversary putteth in its claim The Caliph laughed at his answer FN one hundred twenty two and made him a rich present and Zubaydah also gave him what she had promised him and he went away rejoicing See then the virtues of this Imam and how his hands were manifest the truth and the innocence of the Lady Zubaydah And amongst other stories is that of THE CALIPH AL HAKIM FN one hundred twenty three AND THE MERCHANT The Caliph Al Hakim bi Amri llah was riding out in state procession one day when he passed along a garden wherein he saw a man surrounded by negro slaves and eunuchs He asked him for a draught of water and the man gave him to drink saying Belike the Commander of the Faithful will honour me by alighting in this my garden So the Caliph dismounted and with his suite entered the garden whereupon the said man brought out to them an hundred rugs and an hundred leather mats and an hundred cushions and set before them an hundred dishes of fruits an hundred bowls of sweetmeats and an hundred jars of sugared sherbets at which the Caliph marvelled with much amaze and said to his host O man verily this thy case is wondrous didst thou know of our coming and make this preparation for us He replied No by Allah O Commander of the Faithful I knew not of thy coming and I am a merchant of the rest of thy subjects but I have an hundred concubines so when the Commander of the Faithful honoured me by alighting with me I sent to each of them bidding her send me her morning meal in the garden So they sent me each of her furniture and the surplus of her meat and drink and every day each sendeth me a dish of meat and another of cooling marinades also a platter of fruits and a bowl of sweetmeats and a jar of sherbet This is my noon day dinner nor have I added aught thereto for thee Then the Commander of the Faithful Al Hakim bi Amri llah prostrated himself in thanksgiving to the Almighty extolled and exalted be His name and said Praise be Allah who hath been so bountiful to one of our lieges that he entertaineth the Caliph and his host without making ready for them nay he feedeth them with the surplusage of his day s provision Then he sent for all the dirhams in the treasury that had been struck that year and they were in number three thousand and seven hundred thousand nor did he mount until the money came when he gave it to the merchant saying Use this as thy state may require and thy generosity deserveth more than this Then he took horse and rode away And I have heard a story concerning KING KISRA ANUSHIRWAN FN one hundred twenty four AND THE VILLAGE DAMSEL The Just King Kisra Anushirwan one day rode forth to the chase and in pursuit of a deer became separated from his suite Presently he caught sight of a hamlet near hand and being sore athirst he made for it and presenting himself at the door of a house that lay by the wayside asked for a draught of water So a damsel came out and looked at him then going back into the house pressed the juice from a single sugar cane into a bowl and mixed it with water after which she strewed on the top some scented stuff as it were dust and carried it tot he King Thereupon he seeing in it what resembled dust drank it little by little till he came to the end when said he to her O damsel the drink is good and how sweet it had been but for this dust in it that troubleth it Answered she O guest I put in that powder for a purpose and he asked And why didst thou thus so she replied I saw thee exceedingly thirsty and feared that thou wouldst drain the whole at one draught and that this would thee mischief and but for this dust that troubled the drink so hadst thou done The Just King wondered at her words knowing that they came of her wit and good sense and said to her From how many sugar canes didst thou express this draught One answered she whereat Anushirwan marvelled and calling for the register of the village taxes saw that its assessment was but little and bethought him to increase it on his return to his palace saying in himself A village where they get this much juice out of one sugar cane why is it so lightly taxed He then left the village and pursued his chase and as he came back at the end of the day he passed alone by the same door and called again for drink whereupon the same damsel came out and knowing him at a look went in to fetch him water It was some time before she returned and Anushirwan wondered thereat and said to her Why hast thou tarried And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three hundred and Ninetieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Anushirwan hurried the damsel and asked her Why hast thou tarried she answered Because a single sugar cane gave not enough for thy need so I pressed three but they yielded not to much as one did before Rejoined he What is the cause of that and she replied The cause of it is that when the Sultan s FN one hundred twenty five mind is changed against a folk their prosperity ceaseth and their good waxeth less So Anushirwan laughed and dismissed from his mind that which he had purposed against the villagers Moreover he took the damsel to wife then and there being pleased with her much wit and acuteness and the excellence of her speech And they tell another tale of the WATER CARRIER FN one hundred twenty six AND THE GOLDSMITH S WIFE There was once in the city of Bokhara a water carrier who used to carry water to the house of a goldsmith and had done this thirty years Now that goldsmith had a wife of exceeding beauty and loveliness brilliancy and perfect grace and she was withal renowned for piety chastity and modesty One day the water carrier came as of custom and poured the water into the cisterns Now the woman was standing in the midst of the court so he went close up to her and taking her hand stroked it and pressed it then went away and left her When her husband came home from the bazar she said to him I would have thee tell me what thing thou hast done in the market this day to anger Almighty Allah Quoth he I have done nothing to offend the Lord Nay rejoined she but by Allah thou hast indeed done something to anger Him and unless thou tell me the whole truth I will not abide in thy house and thou shalt not see me nor will I see thee So he confessed I will tell thee the truth of what I did this day It so chanced that as I was sitting in my shop as of wont a woman came up to me and bade me make her a bracelet of gold Then she went away and I wrought her a bracelet and laid it aside But when she returned and I brought her out the bracelet she put forth her hand and I clasped the bracelet on her wrist and I wondered at the whiteness of her hand and the beauty of her wrist which would captivate any beholder and I recalled what the poet saith Her fore arms dight with their bangles show Like fire ablaze on the waves a flow As by purest gold were the water girt And belted around by a living lowe So I took her hand and pressed it and squeezed it Said the woman Great God Why didst thou this ill thing Know that the water carrier who hath come to our house these thirty years nor sawst thou ever any treason in him took my hand this day and pressed and squeezed it Said her husband O woman let us crave pardon of Allah Verily I repent of what I did and do thou ask forgiveness of the Lord for me She cried Allah pardon me and thee and receive us into his holy keeping And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three hundred and Ninety first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the goldsmith s wife cried out Allah pardon me and thee and receive us into his holy keeping And on the next day the water carrier came in to the jeweller s wife and throwing himself at her feet grovelled in the dust and besought pardon of her saying O my lady acquit me of that which Satan deluded me to do for it was he that seduced me and led me astray She answered Go thy ways the sin was not in thee but in my husband for that he did what he did in his shop and Allah hath retaliated upon him in this world And it related that the goldsmith when his wife told him how the water carrier had used her said Tit for tat and blow for blow had I done more the water carrier had done more which became a current byword among the folk Therefore it behoveth a wife to be both outward and inward with her husband contenting herself with little from him if he cannot give her much and taking pattern by Ayishah the Truthful and Fatimah the virgin mother Allah Almighty accept of them the twain that she may be of the company of the righteous ancestry FN one hundred twenty seven And I have heard the following tale of KHUSRAU AND SHIRIN AND THE FISHERMAN King Khusrau FN one hundred twenty eight Shahinshah of Persia loved fish and one day as he sat in his saloon he and Shirin his wife there came a fisherman with a great fish and he laid it before the King who was pleased and ordered the man four thousand dirhams FN one hundred twenty nine Thereupon Shirin said to the King Thou hast done ill Asked he And why and she answered Because if after this though give one of thy courtiers a like sum he will disdain it and say He hath but given me the like of what he gave the fisherman And if thou give him less the same will say He despiseth me and giveth me less than he gave the fisherman Rejoined Khusrau Thou art right but it would dishonour a king to go back on his gift and the thing is done Quoth Shirin If thou wilt I will contrive thee a means to get it back from him Quoth he How so and she said Call back if thou so please the fisherman and ask him if the fish be male or female If he say Male say thou We want a female and if he say Female say We want a male So the King sent for the fisherman who was a man of wit and astuteness and said to him Is this fish male or female whereupon the fisherman kissed the ground and answered This fish is an hermaphrodite FN one hundred thirty neither male nor female Khusrau laughed at his clever reply and ordered him other four thousand dirhams So the fisherman went to the treasurer and taking his eight thousand dirhams put them in a sack he had with him Then throwing it over his shoulder he was going away when he dropped a dirham so he laid the bag off his back and stooped down to pick it up Now the King and Shirin were looking on and the Queen said O King didst thou note the meanness of the man in that he must needs stoop down to pick up the one dirham and could not bring himself to leave it for any of the King s servants When the King heard these words he was exceeding wroth with the fisherman and said Thou art right O Shirin So he called the man back and said to him Thou low minded carle Thou art no man How couldst thou put the bag with all this money off thy back and bend thee groundwards to pick up the one dirham and grudge to leave it where it fell Thereupon the fisherman kissed the earth before him and answered May Allah prolong the King s life Indeed I did not pick up the dirham off the ground because of its value in my eyes but I raised it off the earth because on one of its faces is the likeness of the King and on the other his name and I feared lest any should unwittingly set foot upon it thus dishonouring the name and presentment of the King and I be blamed for this offence The King wondered at his words and approved of his wit and shrewdness and ordered him yet another four thousand dirhams Moreover he bade cry abroad in his kingdom saying It behoveth none to be guided by women s counsel for whoso followeth their advice loseth with his one dirham other twain FN one hundred thirty one And here is the tale they tell of YAHYA BIN KHALID THE BARMECIDE AND THE POOR MAN Yahya bin Khalid the Barmecide was returning home one day from the Caliph s palace when he saw at the gate of his mansion a man who rose as he drew near and saluted him saying O Yahya I am in sore need of that which is in they hand and I make Allah my intermediary with thee So Yahya caused a place to be set aside for him in his house and bade his treasurer carry him a thousand dirhams every day and ordered that his diet be of the choicest of his own meat The man abode in this case a whole month at the end of which time having received in all thirty thousand dirhams and fearing lest Yahya should take the money from him because of the greatness of the sum he departed by stealth And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the man taking with him the money departed by stealth But when they told Yahya of this he said By Allah though he had tarried with me to the end of his days yet had I not stinted him of my largesse nor cut off from him the bounties of my hospitality For indeed the excellences of the Barmecides were past count nor can their virtues be committed to description especially those of Yahya bin Khalid for he was an ocean FN one hundred thirty two of noble qualities even as saith the poet of him I asked of Bounty Art thou free Quoth she No I am slave to Yahya Khalid son Boughten asked I Allah forfend quoth she By heirship sire to sire s transmission And the following is related of MOHAMMED AL AMIN AND THE SLAVE GIRL Ja afar bin Musa al Hadi FN one hundred thirty three once had a slave girl a lutist called Al Badr al Kabir than whom there was not in her time a fairer of face nor shapelier of shape nor a more elegant of manners nor a more accomplished in the art of singing and striking the strings she was indeed perfect in beauty and extreme in every charm Now Mohammed al Amin FN one hundred thirty four son of Zubaydah heard of her and was urgent with Ja afar to sell her to him but he replied Thou knowest it beseemeth not one of my rank to sell slave girls nor set prices on concubines but were she not a rearling I would send her to thee as a gift not grudge her to thee And Mohammed al Amin some days after this went to Ja afar s house to make merry and the host set before him that which it behoveth to set before true friends and bade the damsel Al Badr al Kabir sing to him and gladden him So she tuned the lute and sang with a ravishing melody whilst Mohammed al Amin fell to drinking and jollity and bade the cupbearers ply Ja afar with much wine till they made him drunken when he took the damsel and carried her to his own house but laid not a finger on her And when the morrow dawned he bade invite Ja afar and when he came he set wine before him and made the girl sing to him from behind the curtain Ja afar knew her voice and was angered at this but of the nobleness of his nature and the magnanimity of his mind he showed no change Now when the carousal was at an end Al Amin commanded one of his servants to fill the boat wherein Ja afar had come with dirhams and dinars and all manner of jewels and jacinths and rich raiment and goods galore So he laid therein a thousand myriads of money and a thousand fine pearls each worth twenty thousand dirhams nor did he give over loading the barge with all manner of things precious and rare till the boatmen cried out for help saying The boat can t hold any more whereupon he bade them carry all this to Ja afar s palace Such are the exploits of the magnanimous Allah have mercy on them And a tale is related of THE SONS OF YAHYA BIN KHALID AND SA ID BIN SALIM AL BAHILI Quoth Sa id bin Salim al Bahili FN one hundred thirty five I was once in very narrow case during the days of Harun al Rashid and debts accumulated upon me burdening my back and these I had no means of discharging I was at my wits end what to do for my doors were blocking up with creditors and I was without cease importuned for payment by claimants who dunned me in crowds till at last I was sore perplexed and troubled So I betook myself to Abdallah bin Malik al Khuza i FN one hundred thirty six and besought him to extend the hand of aid with his judgement and direct me of his good counsel to the door of relief and he said None can save thee from this thy strait and sorrowful state save the Barmecides Quoth I Who can brook their pride and put up patiently with their arrogant pretensions and quoth he Thou wilt put up with all this for the bettering of thy case And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abdallah ibn Malik al Khuza i said to Sa id bin Salim Thou wilt put up with all this for the bettering of thy case So I left him suddenly continued Sa id and went straight to Al Fazl and Ja afar sons of Yahya bin Khalid to whom I related my circumstances whereto they replied Allah give thee His aid and render thee by His bounties independent of His creatures and vouchsafe thee abundant weal and bestow on thee what shall suffice thee without the need of any but Himself for whatso He willeth that He can and He is gracious with His servants and knoweth their wants So I went out from the twain and returned to Abdallah with straitened breast and mind perplexed and heavy of heart and repeated to him what they had said Quoth he Thou wouldst do well to abide with us this day that we may see what Allah Almighty will decree So I sat with him awhile when lo up came my servant who said to me O my lord there are at our door many laden mules and with them a man who says he is the agent of Al Fazl and Ja afar bin Yahya Quoth Abdallah I trust that relief is come to thee rise up and go see what is the matter So I left him and hastening to my house found at the door a man who gave me a note wherein was written the following After thou hadst been with us and we heard thy case we betook ourselves to the Caliph and informed him that ill condition had reduced thee to the humiliation of begging where upon he ordered us to supply thee with a thousand thousand dirhams from the Treasury We represented to him The debtor will spend this money in paying off creditors and wiping off debt whence then shall he provide for his subsistence So he ordered thee other three hundred thousand and each of us hath also sent thee of his proper wealth a thousand thousand dirhams so that thou hast now three thousand thousand and three hundred thousand dirhams wherewithal to order and amend thine estate See then the munificence of these magnificos Almighty Allah have mercy on them And a tale is told of THE WOMAN S TRICK AGAINST HER HUSBAND A man brought his wife a fish one Friday and bidding her to cook it against the end of the congregational prayers went out to his craft and business Meanwhile in came her friend who bade her to a wedding at his house so she agreed and laying the fish in a jar of water went off with him and was absent a whole week till the Friday following FN one hundred thirty seven whilst her husband sought her from house to house and enquired after her but none could give him any tidings of her Now on the next Friday she came home and he fell foul of her but she brought out to him the fish alive from the jar and assembled the folk against him and told them her tale And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the woman brought out the fish alive from the water jar and assembled the folk against her husband and told them her tale He also told his but they credited him not and said It cannot be that the fish should have remained alive all this while So they proved him mad and imprisoned him and mocked at him where upon he shed tears in floods and recited these two couplets Old hag of high degree in filthy life Whose face her monstrous lewdness witnesses When menstuous she bawds when clean she whores And all her time bawd or adulteress is And a tale is related of the THE DEVOUT WOMAN AND THE TWO WICKED ELDERS FN one hundred thirty eight There was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a virtuous woman among the children of Israel who was pious and devout and used every day to go out to the place of prayer first entering a garden which adjoined thereto and there making the minor ablution Now there were in this garden two old men its keepers and both Shaykhs fell in love with her and sought her favours but she refused whereupon said they Unless thou yield thy body to us we will bear witness against thee of fornication Quoth she Allah will preserve me from your frowardness Then they opened the garden gate and cried out and the folk came to them from all places saying What aileth you Quoth they We found this damsel in company with a youth who was doing lewdness with her but he escaped from our hands Now it was the wont of the people in those days to expose adulterer and adulteress to public reproach for three days and after stone them So they cried her name in the public streets for three days while the two elders came up to her daily and laying their hands on her head said Praised be Allah who hath sent down on thee His righteous indignation Now on the fourth day when they bore her away to stone her they were followed by a lad named Daniel who was then only twelve years old and this was to be the first of his miracles upon our Prophet and upon him the blessing and peace And he ceased not following them to the place of execution till he came up with them and said to them Hasten not to stone her till I judge between them So they set him a chair and he sat down and summoned the old men separately Now he was the first ever separated witnesses Then said he to the first What sawest thou FN one hundred thirty nine So he repeated to him his story and Daniel asked In what part of the garden did this befal and he answered On the eastern side under a pear tree Then he called the other old man and asked him the same question and he replied On the western side of the garden under an apple tree Meanwhile the damsel stood by with her hands and eyes raised heavenwards imploring the Lord for deliverance Then Allah Almighty sent down His blasting leven fire upon the elders and consumed them and on this wise the Lord made manifest the innocence of the damsel Such was the first of the miracles of the Prophet Daniel on whom be blessing and peace And they relate a tale of JA AFAR THE BARMECIDE AND THE OLD BADAWL The Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid went out one day with Abu Ya Kub the cup companion FN one hundred forty and Ja afar the Barmecide and Abu Nowas into the desert where they fell in with an old man propt against his ass The Caliph bade Ja afar learn of him whence he came so he asked him Whence comest thou and he answered From Bassorah And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety fifth Night She said it hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ja afar asked the man Whence comest thou he answered From Bassorah Quoth Ja afar And whither goest thou Quoth the other To Baghdad Then Ja afar enquired And what wilt thou do there and the old man replied I go to seek medicine for my eye Said the Caliph O Ja afar make thou sport with him and answered Ja afar I shall hear what I shall exceedingly mislike FN one hundred forty one But Al Rashid rejoined I charge thee on my authority jest with him Thereupon Ja afar said to the Badawi If I prescribe thee a medicine that shall profit thee what wilt thou give me in return Quoth the other Allah Almighty will requite the kindness with what is better for thee than any requital of mine Continued Ja afar Now lend me an ear and I will give thee a prescription which I have given to none but thee What is that asked the Badawi and Ja afar answered Take three ounces of wind breaths and the like of sunbeams and the same of moonshine and as much of lamp light mix them well together and let them lie in the wind three months Then place them three months in a mortar without a bottom and pound them to a fine powder and after trituration set them in a cleft platter and let it stand in the wind other three months after which use of this medicine three drachms every night in thy sleep and Inshallah thou shalt be healed and whole Now when the Badawi heard this he stretched himself out to full length on the donkey s back and let fly a terrible loud fart FN one hundred forty two and said to Ja afar Take this fart in payment of thy prescription When I have followed it if Allah grant me recovery I will give thee a slave girl who shall serve thee in they lifetime a service wherewith Allah shall cut short thy term and when thou diest and the Lord hurrieth thy soul to hell fire she shall blacken thy face with her skite of her mourning for thee and shall keen and beat her face saying O frosty beard what a fool thou wast FN one hundred forty three thereupon Harun al Rashid laughed till he fell backward and ordered the Badawi three thousand silver pieces And a tale is told of THE CALIPH OMAR BIN AL KHATTAB AND THE YOUNG BADAWI The Sharif Husayn bin Rayyan relateth that the Caliph Omar bin Al Khattab was sitting one day judging the folk and doing justice between his subjects attended by the best and wisest of his counsellors when there came up to him a youth comely and cleanly attired upon whom two very handsome youths had laid hold and were haling by the collar till they set him in the presence Whereupon the Commander of the Faithful Omar looked at him and them and bade them loose him then calling him near to himself asked the twain What is your case with him They answered O Prince of True Believers we are two brothers by one mother and as followers of verity known are we We had a father a very old man of good counsel honoured by the tribes sound of baseness renowned for goodliness who reared us tenderly in childhood and loaded us with favours in manhood And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the two youths said to the Commander of the Faithful Omar son of Al Khattab Our father was a man honoured by the tribes sound of baseness and renowned for goodliness who reared us delicately in childhood and loaded us with favours in manhood in fine a sea of noble and illustrious qualities worthy of the poet s praise Is Aub s Sakr of Shayban FN one hundred forty four they asked Quoth I Nay by my life of him s Shayban How many a sire rose high by a noble son As Allah s prophet glorified Adnan FN one hundred forty five Now he went forth this day to his garden to refresh himself amongst its trees and pluck the ripe fruits when this young man slew him wrongously and swerved from the road of righteousness wherefore we demand of thee the retribution of his crime and call upon thee to pass judgement upon him according to the commandment of Allah Then Omar cast a terrible look at the accused youth and said to him Verily thou hearest the complaint these two young men prefer what hast thou in reply to aver But he was brave of heart and bold of speech having doffed the robe of pusillanimity and put off the garb of cowardry so he smiled and spake in the most eloquent and elegant words and after paying the usual ceremonial compliments to the Caliph said By Allah O Commander of the Faithful I have indeed given ear to their complaint and they have told the truth in that which they tell so far as they have set out what befel and the commandment of Allah is a decreed decree FN one hundred forty six but I will forthright state my case between they hands and it is for thee to give commands Know then O Prince of the Faithful that I am a very Arab of the Arabies FN one hundred forty seven the noblest of those that are beneath the skies I grew up in the dwellings of the wold and fell till evil times my tribe befel when I came to the outskirts of this town with my family and whatso goods I own and as I went along one of the paths leading to its gardens orchards and garths with my she camels highly esteemed and by me most precious deemed and midst them a stallion of noble blood and shape right good a plenteous getter of brood by whom the females abundantly bore and who walked among them as though a kingly crown he wore one of the she camels broke away and running to the garden of these young men s father where the trees showed above the wall put forth her lips and began to feed as in stall 
6494_60774_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I ran to her to drive her away when behold there appeared at a breach of the wall an old man and grey whose eyes sparkled with angry ray holding in his right a stone to throw and swaying to and fro with a swing like a lion ready for a spring 
6494_60774_000027_000004	train-clean-360	He cast the stone at my stallion and it killed him for it struck a vital part 
none	none	When I saw the stallion drop dead beside me I felt live coals of anger kindled in my heart so I took up the very same stone and throwing it at the old man it was the cause of his bane and ban thus his own wrongful act returned to him anew and the man was slain of that wherewith he slew When the stone struck him he cried out with a great cry and shrieked out a terrible shriek whereupon I hastened from the spot but these two young men hurried after me and laid hands on me and before thee carried me Quoth Omar Almighty Allah accept of him Thou hast confessed what thou committedest and of acquittal there is no possible occasion for urgent is the law of retaliation and they cried for mercy but it was not a time to escape FN one hundred forty eight the youth answered I hear and obey the judgement of the Imam and I consent to all required by the law of Al Islam but I have a young brother whose old father before his decease appointed to him wealth in great store and gold galore and committed his affair to me before Allah saying I give this into thy hand for thy brother keep it for him with all thy might So I took the money and buried it nor doth any know of it but I Now if thou adjudge me to be justiced forthright the money will lost and thou shalt be the cause of its loss wherefore the child will sue thee for his due on the day when the Creator shall judge between His creatures But if thou wilt grant me three days delay I will appoint some guardian to administer the affairs of the boy and return to answer my debt and I have one who will be my surety for the fulfillment of this my promise So the Commander of the Faithful bowed his head awhile then raised it and looking round upon those present said Who will stand surety by me for his return to this place And the youth looked at the faces of those who were in company and pointing to Abu Zarr FN one hundred forty nine in preference to all present said This man shall answer for me and be my bail And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the youth pointed to Abu Zarr and said This man shall answer for me and be my bail Omar Allah accept of him said O Abu Zarr dost thou hear these words and wilt thou be surety to me for the return of this youth He answered Yes O Commander of the Faithful I will be surety for him for three days So the Caliph accepted his guarantee and let the young man go Now when the appointed time passed and the days of grace were nearly or quite at end yet the youth came not the Caliph took seat in his council with the Companions surrounding him like the constellations about the moon Abu Zarr and the plaintiffs being also present and the avengers said Where is the defendant O Abu Zarr and how shall he return having once fled But we will not stir from our places till thou bring him to us that we may take of him our blood revenge Replied Abu Zarr By the truth of the All Wise King if the three days of grace expire and the young man returneth not I will fulfill my warranty and surrender my person to the Imam and added Omar whom Allah accept By the Lord if the young man appear not I will assuredly execute on Abu Zarr that which is prescribed by the law of Al Islam FN one hundred fifty thereupon the eyes of the bystanders ran over with tears those who looked on groaned aloud and great was the clamour Then the chiefs of the Companions urged the plaintiffs to accept the blood wit and deserve the thanks of the folk but they both refused and would accept nothing save the talion However as the folk were swaying to and fro like waves and loudly bemoaning Abu Zarr behold up came the young Badawi and standing before the Imam saluted him right courteously with sweat beaded face and shining with the crescent s grace and said to him I have given the lad in charge to his mother s brothers and have made them acquainted with all that pertaineth to his affairs and let them into the secrets of his monies after which I braved the heats of noon and have kept my word as a free born man Thereupon the folk marvelled seeing his good faith and loyalty and his offering himself to death with so stout a heart and one said to him How noble a youth art thou and how loyal to thy word of honour and thy devoir Rejoined he Are ye not convinced that when death presenteth itself none can escape from it And indeed I have kept my word that it be not said Good faith is gone from among mankind Said Abu Zarr By Allah O Commander of the Faithful I became warrant for this young man without knowing to what tribe he belonged nor had I seen him before that day but when he turned away from all who were present and singled me out saying This man shall answer for me and be my bail I thought it not right to refuse him and generosity forbade to disappoint his desire there being no harm in compliance therewith that it be not bruited abroad Benevolence is gone from among mankind Then said the two young men O Commander of the Faithful we forgive this youth our father s blood seeing that he hath changed desolation into cheerfulness that it be not said Humanity is gone from among mankind So the Caliph rejoiced in the acquittance of the youth and his truth and good faith moreover he magnified the generosity of Abu Zarr extolling it over all his companions and approved the resolve of the two young men for its benevolence giving them praise with thanks and applying to their case the saying of the poet Who doth kindness to men shall be paid again Ne er is kindness lost betwixt God and men Then he offered to pay them from the Treasury the blood wit for their father but they refused saying We forgave him only of our desire unto Allah FN one hundred fifty one the Bountiful the Exalted and he who is thus intentioned followeth not his benefits with reproach or with mischief FN one hundred fifty two and amongst the tales they relate is that of THE CALIPH AL MAAMUN AND THE PYRAMIDS FN one hundred fifty three OF EGYPT It is told that the Caliph Al Maamun son of Harun al Rashid when he entered the God guarded city of Cairo was minded to pull down the Pyramids that he might take what was therein but when he went about to do this he could not succeed albeit his best was done He expended a mint of money in the attempt And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred Ninety eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Al Maamun attempting to pull down the Pyramids expended his mint of money but succeeded only in opening up a small tunnel in one of them where in it is said he found treasure to the exact amount of the monies he had spent in the works neither more nor less whereat he marvelled and taking what he found there desisted from his determination Now the Pyramids are three and they are one of the Wonders of the World nor is there on the face of earth aught like them for height and fashion and mysteries FN one hundred fifty four for they are built of huge rocks and the builders proceeded by piercing one block of stone and setting therein upright rods of iron FN one hundred fifty five after which they pierced a second block of stone and lowered it upon the first Then they poured melted lead upon the clamps and set the blocks in geometrical order till the building was complete Now the height of each pyramid was an hundred cubits of the normal measure of the day and it had four faces each three hundred cubits long from the base and thence battering upwards to a point The ancients say that in the western Pyramid are thirty chambers of parti coloured syenite full of precious gems and treasures galore and rare images and utensils and costly weapons which are anointed with egromantic unguents so that they may not rust until the day of Resurrection FN one hundred fifty six Therein also are vessels of glass which bend and break not containing various kinds of compound drugs and sympathetic waters In the second Pyramid are the records of the priests written on tablets of syenite to each priest his tablet whereon are engraved the wonders of his craft and his feats and on the walls are the human figures like idols working with their hands at all manner of mechanism and seated on stepped thrones Moreover to each Pyramid there is a guardian treasurer who keepeth watch over it and wardeth it to all eternity against the ravages of time and the shifts of events and indeed the marvels of these Pyramids astound all who have sight and insight Many are the poems that describe them thou shalt thereby profit no small matter and among the rest quoth one of them If Kings would see their high emprize preserved Twill be by tongues of monuments they laid Seest not the Pyramids These two endure Despite what change Time and Change have made And quoth another Look on the Pyramids and hear the twain Recount their annals of the long gone Past Could they but speak high marvels had they told Of what Time did to man from first to last And quoth a third My friend I prithee tell me neath the sky Is aught with Egypt s Pyramids can compare Buildings which frighten Time albe what dwells On back of earth in fear of Time must fare If on their marvels rest my sight no more Yet these I ever shall in memory bear And quoth a fourth Where is the man who built the Pyramids What was his tribe what day and where his tomb The monuments survive the men who built Awhile till overthrown by touch of Doom And men also tell a tale of THE THIEF AND THE MERCHANT There was once a thief who repented to Almighty Allah with sincere penitence so he opened himself a shop for the sale of stuffs where he continued to trade awhile It so chanced one day that he locked his shop and went home and in the night there came to the bazar an artful thief disguised in the habit of the merchant and pulling out keys from his sleeve said to the watchman of the market Light me this wax candle The watchman took the taper and went to light it And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Three Hundred and Ninety ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the watchman took the taper and went to light it whilst the thief opened the shop and lit another candle he had by him When the watchman came back he found him seated in the shop account books inhand and reckoning with his fingers nor did he cease to do thus till point of day when he said to the man Fetch me a camel driver and his camel to carry some goods for me So the man fetched him a camel and the thief took four bales FN one hundred fifty seven of stuffs and gave them to the cameleer who loaded them on his beast Then he gave the watchman two dirhams and went away after the camel driver leaving the watchman believing him to be the owner of the shop Now when the morning dawned and day broke the merchant came and the watchman began greeting him with blessings because of the two dirhams but the shop keeper wondered at his words as one not knowing what he meant When he opened his shop he saw the droppings of the wax and the account book lying on the floor and looking round found four bales of stuffs missing So he asked the watchman what had happened and he told him what has passed in the night and what had been said to the cameleer whereupon the merchant bade him fetch the man and asked him Whither didst thou carry the stuffs this morning Answered the driver To such a landing place and I stowed them on board such a vessel Said the merchant Come with me thither so the camel driver carried him to the landing place and said to him This be the barque and this be her owner Quoth the merchant to the seaman Whither didst thou carry the merchant and the stuff Answered the boat master To such a place where he fetched a camel driver and setting the bales on the camel went his ways I know not whither Fetch me the cameleer who carried the goods said the merchant so he fetched him and the merchant said to him Whither didst thou carry the bales of goods from the ship To such a Khan answered he and the merchant rejoined Come thither with me and show it to me So the camel man went with him to a place far distant from the shore and showed him the Khan where he had set down the stuffs and at the same time the false merchant s magazine which he opened and found therein his four bales bound up as they had been packed The thief had laid his cloak over them so the merchant took the cloak as well as the bales and delivered them to the camel driver who laid them on his camel after which he locked the magazine and went away with the cameleer On the way he was confronted with the thief who followed him till he had shipped the bales when he said to him O my brother Allah have thee in His holy keeping thou hast indeed recovered thy goods and naught of them is lost so give me back my cloak The merchant laughed and giving him back his cloak let him go unhindered whereupon both went their ways And they tell a tale of MASRUR THE EUNUCH AND IBN AL KARIBI The Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid was exceedingly restless one night so he said to his Wazir Ja afar I am sleepless to night and my breast is straitened and I know not what to do Now his castrato Masrur was standing before him and he laughed whereupon the Caliph said At whom laughest thou Is it to make mock of me or hath madness seized thee Answered Masrur Nay by Allah O Commander of the Faithful And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundredth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Harun al Rashid said to Masrur the Sworder Dost thou laugh to make mock of me or hath madness seized thee Answered Masrur Nay by Allah O Commander of the Faithful I swear by thy kinship to the Prince of Apostles I did it not of my free will but I went out yesterday to walk within sight of the palace and coming to the bank of the Tigris saw there the folk collected so I stopped and found a man Ibn al Karibi hight who was making them laugh but just now I recalled what he said and laughter got the better of me and I crave pardon of thee O Commander of the Faithful Quoth the Caliph Bring him to me forthright so Masrur repaired in all haste to Ibn al Karibi and said to him Answer the summons of the Commander of the Faithful whereto he replied I hear and obey But on condition added Masrur that if he give thee aught thou shalt have a quarter and the rest shall be mine Replied the droll Nay thou shalt have half and I half Rejoined Masrur Not so I will have three quarters Lastly said Ibn al Karibi Thou shalt have two thirds and I the other third to which Masrur agreed after much higgling and haggling and they returned to the palace together Now when Ibn al Karibi came into the Caliph s presence he saluted him as men greet the Caliphate and stood before him whereupon said Al Rashid to him If thou do not make me laugh I will give thee three blows with this bag Quoth Ibn al Karibi in his mind And a small matter were blows with that bag seeing that beating with whips hurteth me not for he thought the bag was empty Then he began to deal out his drolleries such as would make the dismallest jemmy guffaw and gave vent to all manner of buffooneries but the Caliph laughed not neither smiled whereat Ibn al Karibi marvelled and was chagrined and affrighted Then said the Commander of the Faithful Now hast thou earned the beating and gave him a blow with the bag wherein were four pebbles each two rotols in weight The blow fell on his neck and he gave a great cry then calling to mind his compact with Masrur said Pardon O Commander of the Faithful Hear two words from me Quoth the Caliph Say on and quoth Ibn al Karibi Masrur made it a condition with me and I a covenant with him that whatsoever largesse might come to me of the bounties of the Commander of the Faithful one third thereof should be mine and the rest his nor did he agree to leave me so much as one third save after much higgling and haggling I have had my share and here standeth he ready to receive his portion so pay him the two other blows Now when the Caliph heard this he laughed until he fell on his back then calling Masrur he gave him a blow whereat he cried out and said O Commander of the Faithful the one third sufficeth me give him the two thirds And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and First Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Masrur cried out O Commander of the Faithful The one third sufficeth me give him the two thirds So the Caliph laughed at them and ordered them a thousand dinars each and they went away rejoicing at the largesse And of the tales they tell is one of THE DEVOTEE PRINCE The Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid had a son who from the time he attained the age of sixteen renounced the world and walked in the way FN one hundred fifty eight of ascetics and devotees He was wont to go out to the graveyards and say Ye once ruled the world but that saved you not from death and now are ye come to your sepulchres Would Heaven I knew what ye said and what is said to you FN one hundred fifty nine and he wept as one weepeth who is troubled with fear and apprehension and repeated the worlds of the poet Affright me funerals at every time And wailing women grieve me to the soul Now it chanced one day as he sat among the tombs according to his custom his father passed by in all his state surrounded by his Wazirs and Lords of the realm and the Officers of his household who seeing the Caliph s son with a gown of woollen stuff on his body and a twist of wool on his head by way of turband said to one another Verily this youth dishonoureth the Commander of the Faithful among Kings but if he reproved him he would leave his present way of life The Caliph heard these words so quoth he to his son O my dear child of a truth thou disgracest me by thy present way of life The young man looked at him and made no reply then he beckoned to a bird perched on the battlements of the palace and said to it O thou bird I conjure thee by Him who created thee alight upon my hand Whereupon straightway it swooped down and perched on his finger Then quoth he Return to thy place and it did so Presently he said Alight on the hand of the Commander of the Faithful but it refused there to perch and he cried to his father It is thou that disgracest me amongst the Holy FN one hundred sixty Ones by the love of the world and now I am resolved to part from thee never to return to thee save in the world to come Then he went down to Bassorah where he took to working with those which wrought in clay FN one hundred sixty one receiving as his day s hire but a dirham and a danik FN one hundred sixty two and with the danik he fed himself and gave alms of the dirham Quoth Abu Amir of Bassorah There fell down a wall in my house so I went forth to the station of the artisans to find a man who should repair it for me and my eyes fell on a handsome youth of a radiant countenance So I saluted him and asked him O my friend dost thou seek work Yes answered he and I said Come with me and build a wall He replied On certain conditions I will make with thee Quoth I What are they O my friend and quoth he My wage must be a dirham and a danik and again when the Mu ezzin calleth to prayer thou shalt let me go pray with the congregation It is well answered I and carried him to my lace where he fell to work such work as I never saw the like of Presented I named to him the morning meal but he said No and I knew that he was fasting FN one hundred sixty three When he heard the call to prayer he said to me Thou knowest the condition Yes answered i So he loosed his girdle and applying himself to the lesser ablution made it after a fashion than which I never saw a fairer FN one hundred sixty four then he went to the mosque and prayed with the congregation and returned to his work He did the same upon the call to mid afternoon prayer and when I saw him fall to work again thereafterward I said to him O my friend verily the hours of labour are over a workman s day is but till the time of afternoon prayer But he replied Praise to the Lord my service is till the night And he ceased not to work till nightfall when I gave him two dirhams whereupon he asked What is this and I answered By Allah this is but part of thy wage because of thy diligence in my service But he threw them back to me saying I will have no more than was agreed upon between us twain I urged him to take them but could not prevail upon him so I gave him the dirham and the danik and he went away And when morning dawned I went to the station but found him not so I enquired for him and was told He cometh thither only on Sabbaths Accordingly when Saturday came I betook me to the market and finding him there said to him Bismillah do me the favour to come and work for me Said he Upon the conditions thou wottest and I answered Yes Then carrying him to my house I stood to watch him where he could not see me and he took a handful of puddled clay and laid it on the wall when behold the stones ranged themselves one upon other and I said On this wise are Allah s holy ones he worked out his day and did even more than before and when it was night I gave him his hire and he took it and walked away Now when the third Saturday came round I went to the place of standing but found him not so I asked after him and they told me He is sick and lying in the shanty of such a woman Now this was an old wife renowned for piety who had a hovel of reeds in the burial ground So I fared thither and found him stretched on the floor which was bare with a brick for a pillow and his face beaming like the new moon with light I saluted him and he returned my salam and I sat down at his head weeping over his fair young years and absence from home and submission to the will of his Lord Then said I to him Hast thou any need Yes answered he and I said What is it He replied Come hither to morrow in the forenoon and thou wilt find me dead Wash me and dig my grave and tell none thereof but shroud me in this my gown after thou hast unsewn it and taken out what thou shalt find in the bosom pocket which keep with thee Then when thou hast prayed over me and laid me in the dust go to Baghdad and watch for the Caliph Harun al Rashid till he come forth when do thou give him what thou shalt find in the breast of my gown and bear him my salutation Then he ejaculated the profession of the Faith and glorified his God in the most eloquent of words reciting these couplets Carry the trust of him whom death awaits To Al Rashid and God reward thy care And say An exile who desired thy sight Long loving from afar sends greeting fair Nor hate nor irk No him from thee withdrew Kissing thy right to Heaven brought him near FN one hundred sixty five But what estranged his soul O sire from thee Is that thy worldly joys it would not share Then he betook himself to prayer asking pardon of Allah And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the youth then betook himself to asking pardon of Allah and to invoking prayer and praise upon the Apostle and the Lord of the Just and repeating verses of the Koran after which he recited these couplets O sire be not deceived by worldly joys For life must pass and joy must learn to mourn When thou art told of folk in evil plight Think thou must answer for all hearts forlorn And when thou bear thy dead towards the tombs Know thou wilt likewise on that way be bourne Continued Abu the Basri Now when the youth had ended his charge and his verses I left him and went home On the morrow I returned at the appointed hour and found him indeed dead the mercy of Allah be upon him So I washed him and unsewing his gown found in the bosom a ruby worth thousands of gold pieces and said to myself By Allah this youth was indeed weaned from worldly things After I had buried him I made my way to Baghdad and going to the Caliph s palace waited till he came forth when I addressed him in one of the streets and gave him the ruby which when he saw he knew and fell down in a fainting fit His attendants laid hands on me but he revived and said to them Release him and bring him courteously to the palace They did his bidding and when he returned he sent for me and carrying me into his chamber said to me How doth the owner of this ruby Quoth I Verily he is dead and told him what had passed whereupon he fell a weeping and said The son hath gained but the sire hath lost Then he called out saying Ho such an one and behold there came out to him a lady who when she saw me would have withdrawn but he cried to her Come and mind him not So she entered and saluted and he threw her the ruby which when she saw and she knew she shrieked a great shriek and fell down in a swoon As soon as she came to herself she said O Commander of the Faithful what hath Allah done with my son and he said to me Do thou tell her his case as he could not speak for weeping Accordingly I repeated the story to her and she began to shed tears and say in a faint and wailing voice How I have longed for thy sight O solace of mine eyes FN one hundred sixty six Would I might have given thee to drink when thou hadst none to slake thy thirst Would I might have cheered thee whenas thou foundest never a cheerer And she poured forth tears and recited these couplets I weep for one whose lot a lonely death befel Without a friend to whom he might complain and moan And after glory and glad union with his friends He woke to desolation friendless lorn and lone What Fortune hides a while she soon to all men shall show Death never spared a man no not a single one O absent one my Lord decreed thee strangerhood Far from thy nearest friends and to long exile gone Though Death forbid my hope of meeting here again On Doom day s morrow we shall meet again my son FN one hundred sixty seven Quoth I O Commander of the Faithful was he indeed thy son Quoth he Yes and indeed before I succeeded to this office he was wont to visit the learned and company with the devout but when I became Caliph he grew estranged from me and withdrew himself apart FN one hundred sixty eight Then said I to his mother Verily this thy son hath cut the world and devoted his life to Almighty Allah and it may be that hard times shall befal him and he be smitten with trial of evil chance wherefore do thou given him this ruby which he may find useful in hour of need So she gave it him conjuring him to take it and he obeyed her bidding Then he left to us the things of our world and removed himself from us nor did he cease to be absent from us till he went to the presence of Allah to whom be Honour and Glory pious and pure Then said he Come show me his grave So I travelled with him to Bassorah and showed him his son s grave and when he saw it he wept and lamented till he fell down in a swoon after which he recovered and asked pardon of the Lord saying We are Allah s and unto Him we are returning and involved blessings on the dead Then he asked me to become his companion but I said to him O Commander of the Faithful verily in thy son s case is for me the most momentous of admonitions And I recited these couplets Tis I am the stranger visited by none I am the stranger though in town my own Tis I am the stranger Lacking kith and son And friend to whom I mote for aidance run I house in mosques which are my only home My heart there wones and shall for ever wone Then laud ye Allah Lord of Worlds as long As soul and body dwell in union And a famous tale is told of THE UNWISE SCHOOLMASTER WHO FELL IN LOVE BY REPORT Quoth one of the learned I passed once by a school wherein a schoolmaster was teaching children so I entered finding him a good looking man and a well dressed when he rose to me and made me sit with him Then I examined him in the Koran and in syntax and prosody and lexicography and behold he was perfect in all required of him so I said to him Allah strengthen thy purpose Thou art indeed versed in all that is requisite thereafter I frequented him a while discovering daily some new excellence in him and quoth I to myself This is indeed a wonder in any dominie for the wise are agreed upon a lack of wit in children s teachers Then I separated myself from him and sought him and visited him only every few days till coming to see him one day as of wont I found the school shut and made enquiry of his neighbors who replied Some one is dead in his house So I said in my mind It behoveth me to pay him a visit of condolence and going to his house knocked at the door when a slave girl came out to me and asked What dost thou want and I answered I want thy master She replied He is sitting alone mourning and I rejoined Tell him that his friend so and so seeketh to console him She went in and told him and he said Admit him So she brought me in to him and I found him seated alone and his head bound with mourning fillets So I said to him Allah requite thee amply this is a path all must perforce tread and it behoveth thee to take patience adding But who is dead unto thee He answered One who was dearest of the folk to me and best beloved Perhaps thy father No Thy brother No One of thy kindred No Then asked I What relation was the dead to thee and he answered My lover Quoth I to myself This is the first proof to swear by his lack of wit So I said to him Assuredly there be others than she and fairer and he made answer I never saw her that I might judge whether or no there be others fairer than she Quoth I to myself This is another proof positive Then I said to him And how couldst thou fall in love with one thou hast never seen He replied Know that I was sitting one day at the window when lo there passed by a man singing the following distich Umm Amr FN one hundred sixty nine thy boons Allah repay Give back my heart be t where it may And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the schoolmaster continued When I heard the man humming these words as he passed along the street I said to myself Except this Umm Amru were without equal in the world the poets had not celebrated her in ode and canzon So I fell in love with her but two days after the same man passed singing the following couplet Ass and Umm Amr went their way Nor she nor ass returned for aye Thereupon I knew she was dead and mourned for her This was three days ago and I have been mourning ever since So I left him concluded the learned one and fared forth having assured myself of the weakness of the gerund grinder s wit And they tell another and a similar tale of THE FOOLISH DOMINIE FN one hundred seventy Once upon a time a schoolmaster was visited by a man of letters who entered a school and sitting down by the host s side entered into discourse with him and found him an accomplished theologian poet grammarian philologist and poet intelligent well bred and pleasant spoken whereat he wondered saying in himself It cannot be that a man who teacheth children in a school should have a perfect wit Now when he was about to go away the pedant said to him Thou are my guest to night and he consented to receive hospitality and accompanied him to his house where he made much of him and set food before him They ate and drank and sat talking till a third part of the night was past when the host spread his guest a bed and went up to his Harim The stranger lay down and addressed himself to sleep when behold there arose a great clamour in the women s rooms He asked what was the matter and they said A terrible thing hath befallen the Shaykh and he is at the last gasp Said he Take me up to him so they took him up to the pedagogue whom he found lying insensible with his blood streaming down He sprinkled water on his face and when he revived he asked him What hath betided thee When thou leftest me thou wast in all good cheer and whole of body and he answered O my brother after I left thee I sat meditating on the creative works of Almighty Allah and said to myself In every thing the Lord hath created for man there is an use for He to Whom be glory made the hands to seize the feet to walk the eyes to see the ears to hear and the penis to increase and multiply and so on with all the members of the body except these two ballocks there is no use in them So I took a razor I had by me and cut them off and there befel me what thou seest So the guest left him and went away saying He was in the right who said Verily no schoolmaster who teacheth children can have a perfect wit though he know all the sciences And they tell a pleasant tale of the ILLITERATE WHO SET UP FOR A SCHOOLMASTER There was once among the menials FN one hundred seventy one of a certain mosque a man who knew not how to write or even to read and who gained his bread by gulling folk One day it occurred to him to open a school and teach children so he got together writing tablets and written papers and hung them up in a high place Then he greatened his turband FN one hundred seventy two and sat down at the door of the school and when the people who passed by saw his huge head gear and tablets and scrolls they thought he must be a very learned pedagogue so they brought him their children and he would say to this Write and to that Read and thus the little ones taught each other Now one day as he sat as of wont at the door of the school behold up came a woman letter in hand and he said in his mind This woman doubtless seeketh me that I may read her the missive she hath in her hand how shall I do with her seeing I cannot read writing And he would fain have gone down and fled from her but before he could do this she overtook him and said to him Whither away Quoth he I purpose to pray the noon prayer and return Quoth she Noon is yet distant so read me this letter He took the letter and turning it upside down fell to looking at it now shaking his head till his turband quivered then dancing his eyebrows and anon showing anger and concern Now the letter came from the woman s husband who was absent and when she saw the dominie do on this wise she said to herself Doubtless my husband is dead and this learned doctor of law and religion is ashamed to tell me so So she said to him O my lord if he be dead tell me but he shook his head and held his peace Then said she Shall I rend my raiment Rend replied he Shall I beat my face asked she and he answered Beat So she took the letter from his hand and returned home fell a weeping she and her children Presently one of her neighbours heard her sobbing and asking what aileth her was answered Of a truth she hath gotten a letter telling her that her husband is dead Quoth the man This is a falsehood for I had a letter from him but yesterday advising me that he is whole and in good health and will be with her after ten days So he rose forthright and going in to her said Where is the letter which came to thee She brought it to him and he took it and read it and lo it ran as follows After the usual salutations I am well and in good health and whole and will be with you all after ten days Meanwhile I send you a quilt and an extinguisher FN one hundred seventy three So she took the letter and returning to the schoolmaster said to him What induced thee to deal thus with me And she repeated to him what her neighbour had told her of her husband s well being and of his having sent her a quilt and an extinguisher Answered he Thou art in the right O good woman for I was at the time And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the pedagogue replied Verily I was at that time fashed and absent minded and seeing the extinguisher wrapped up in the quilt I thought that he was dead and they had shrouded him The woman not smoking the cheat said Thou art excused and taking the letter went her ways FN one hundred seventy four And they relate a story of THE KING AND THE VIRTUOUS WIFE A certain King once went forth in disguise to look into the affairs of his lieges Presently he came to a great village which he entered unattended and being athirst stopped at the door of a house and asked for water There came out to him a fair woman with a gugglet which she gave him and he drank When he looked at her he was ravished with her and besought her favours Now she knew him so she led him into the house and making him sit down brought out a book and said to him Look therein whilst I order my affair and return to thee So he looked into the book and behold it treated of the Divine prohibition against advoutry and of the punishments which Allah hath prepared for those who commit adulterous sin When he read this his flesh quaked and his hair bristled and he repented to Almighty Allah then he called the woman and giving her the book went away Now her husband was absent and when he returned she told him what had passed whereat he was confounded and said in himself I fear lest the King s desire have fallen upon her And he dared not have to do with her and know her carnally after this When some time had past the wife told her kinsfolk of her husband s conduct and they complained of him to the King saying Allah advance the King This man hired of us a piece of land for tillage and tilled it awhile then left it fallow and neither tilled it nor forsook it that we might let it to one who would till it Indeed harm is come to the field and we fear its corruption for such land as that if it be not sown spoileth Quoth the King to the man What hindereth thee from sowing thy land Answered he Allah advance the King It reached me that the lion entered the field wherefore I stood in awe of him and dared not draw near it since knowing that I cannot cope with the lion I stand in fear of him The King understood the parable and rejoined saying O man the lion trod and trampled not thy land and it is good for seed so do thou till it and Allah prosper thee in it for the lion hath done it no hurt Then he bade give the man and his wife a handsome present and sent them away FN one hundred seventy five And amongst the stories is that of ABD AL RAHMAN THE MAGHRIBI S STORY OF THE RUKH FN one hundred seventy six There was once a man of the people of West Africa who had journeyed far and wide and traversed many a desert and a tide He was once cast upon an island where he abode a long while and returning thence to his native country brought with him the quill of a wing feather of a young Rukh whilst yet in egg and unhatched and this quill was big enough to hold a goat skin of water for it is said that the length of the Rukh chick s wing when he cometh forth of the egg is a thousand fathoms The folk marvelled at this quill when they saw it and the man who was called Abd al Rahman the Moor and he was known to boot as the Chinaman for his long sojourn in Cathay related to them the following adventure one of many of his traveller s tales of marvel He was on a voyage in the China seas And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abd al Rahman the Moorman the Chinaman was wont to tell wondrous tales amongst which was the following He was on a voyage in the China seas with a company of merchants when they sighted an island from afar so they steered for it and making fast thereto saw that it was large and spacious The ship s crew went ashore to get wood and water taking with them hatchets and ropes and water skies the travellers accompanying them and presently espied a great dome white and gleaming an hundred cubits long So they made towards it and drawing near found that it was an egg of the Rukh and fell on it with axes and stones and sticks till they uncovered the young bird and found the chick as it were a firm set hill So they plucked out one of the wing feathers but could not do so save by helping one another for all the quills were not full grown after which they took what they could carry of the young bird s flesh and cutting the quill away from the vane returned to the ship Then they set sail and putting out to sea voyaged with a fair wind all that night till the sun rose and while everything went well they saw the Rukh come flying after them as he were a vast cloud with a rock in his talons like a great heap bigger than the ship As soon as he poised himself in air over the vessel he let fall the rock upon it but the craft having great way on her outwent the rock which fell into the sea with a loud crash and a horrible So Allah decreed their deliverance and saved them from doom and they cooked the young bird s flesh and ate it Now there were amongst them old white bearded men and when they awoke on the morrow they found that their beards had turned black nor did any who had eaten of the young Rukh grow gray ever after Some said the cause of the return of youth to them and the ceasing of hoariness from them was that they had heated the pot with arrow wood whilst others would have it that it came of eating the Rukh chick s flesh and this is indeed a wonder of wonders FN one hundred seventy seven And a story is related of ADI BIN ZAYD AND THE PRINCESS HIND Al Nu uman Bin Al Munzir King of the Arabs of Irak had a daughter named Hind who went out one Pasch which is a feast day of the Nazarenes to the White Church to take the sacrament she was eleven years old and was the loveliest woman of her age and time and it so chanced that on the same day came to Hirah FN one hundred seventy eight a young man called Adi bin Zayd FN one hundred seventy nine with presents from the Chosroe to Al Nu uman and he also went to the White Church to communicate He was tall of stature and fair of favour with handsome eyes and smooth cheeks and had with him a company of his people Now there was with Hind bint al Nu uman a slave girl named Mariyah who was enamoured of Adi but had not been able to foregather with him So when she saw him in the church she said to Hind Look at yonder youth By Allah he is handsomer than all thou seest Hind asked And who is he and Mariyah answered Adi bin Zayd Quoth Al Nu uman s daughter I fear lest he know me if I draw nearer to look on him Quoth Mariyah How should he know thee when he hath never seen thee So she drew near him and found him jesting with the youths his companions and indeed he surpassed them all not only in his personal charms but in the excellence of his speech the eloquence of his tongue and the richness of his raiment When the Princess saw him she was ravished with him her reason was confounded and her colour changed and Mariyah seeing her inclination to him said to her Speak him So she spoke to him and went away Now when he looked upon her and heard her speech he was captivated by her and his wit was dazed his heart fluttered and his colour changed so that his companions suspected him and he whispered one of them to follow her and find out who she was The young man went after her and returning informed him that she was princess Hind daughter of Al Nu uman So Adi left the church knowing not whither he went for excess of love and reciting these two couplets O friends of me one favour more I pray Unto the convents FN one hundred eighty find more your way Turn me that so I face the land of Hind Then go and fairest greetings for me say Then he went to his lodging and lay that night restless and without appetite for the food of sleep And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Adi ended his verses he went to his lodging and lay that night restless and without appetite for the food of sleep Now on the morrow Mariyah accosted him and he received her kindly though before he would not incline to her and said to her What is thy will Quoth she I have a want of thee and quoth he Name it for by Allah thou shalt not ask me aught but I will give it thee So she told him that she loved him and her want of him was that he would grant her a lover s privacy and he agreed to do her will on condition that she would serve him with Hind and devise some device to bring them together Then he took her into a vintner s tavern in one of the by streets of Hirah and lay with her after which she returned to Hind and asked her Dost thou not long to see Adi She answered How can this be Indeed my longing for him makes me restless and no repose is left me since yesterday Quoth Mariyah I will appoint him to be in such a place where thou canst look on him from the palace Quoth Hind Do what thou wilt and agreed with her upon the place So Adi came and the Princess looked out upon him and when she saw him she was like to topple down from the palace top and said O Mariyah except thou bring him in to me this night I shall die So saying she fell to the ground in a fainting fit and her serving women lifted her up and bore her into the palace whilst Mariyah hastened to Al Nu uman and discovered the whole matter to him with perfect truth telling him that indeed she was mad for the love of Adi and except he marry her to him she must be put to shame and die of love for him which would disgrace her father among the Arabs adding at the end There is no cure for this but wedlock The King bowed his head awhile in thought and exclaimed again and again Verily we are Allah s and unto Him we are returning Then said he Woe to thee How shall the marriage be brought about seeing I mislike to open the matter And she said He is yet more ardently in love and yet more desireful of her than she is of him and I will so order the affair that he shall be unaware of his case being known to thee but do not betray thyself O King Then she went to Adi and after acquainting him with everything said Make a feast and bid the King thereto and when the wine hath gotten the better of him ask of him his daughter for he will not refuse thee Quoth Adi I fear lest this enrage him against me and be the cause of enmity between us But quoth she I came not to thee till I had settled the whole affair with him Then she returned to Al Nu uman and said to him Seek of Adi that he entertain thee in his house Replied the King There is no harm in that and after three days besought Adi to give him and his lords the morning meal in his house He consented and the King went to him and when the wine had taken effect on Al Nu uman Adi rose and sought of him his daughter in wedlock He consented and married them and brought her to him after three days and they abode at Al Nu uman s court in all solace of life and its delight And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Adi abode with Hind bint Al Nu uman bin Munzir three years in all solace of life and its delight after which time the King was wroth with Adi and slew him Hind mourned for him with grievous mourning and built her an hermitage outside the city whither she retired and became a religious weeping and bewailing her husband till she died And her hermitage is seen to this day in the suburbs of Hirah They also tell a tale of DI IBIL AL KHUZA I WITH THE LADY AND MUSLIM BIN AL WALID Quoth Di ibil al Khuza i FN one hundred eighty one I was sitting one day at the gate of Al Karkh FN one hundred eighty two when a damsel came past Never saw I a fairer faced or better formed than she walking with a voluptuous swaying gait and ravishing all beholders with her lithe and undulating pace Now as my eyes fell on her I was captivated by her and my vitals trembled and meseemed my heart flew forth of my breast so I stood before her and I accosted her with this verse The tears of these eyes find easy release But sleep flies these eyelids without surcease Whereon she turned her face and looking at me straightway made answer with this distich A trifle this an his eyes be sore When her eyes say yes to his love s caprice I was astounded at the readiness of her reply and the fluency of her speech and rejoined with this verse Say cloth heart of my fair incline to him Whose tears like a swelling stream increase And she answered me without hesitation thus If thou crave our love know that love s a loan And a debt to be paid by us twain a piece Never entered my ears aught sweeter than her speech nor ever saw I brighter than her face so I changed rhyme and rhythm to try her in my wonder at her words and repeated this couplet Will Fate with joy of union ever bless our sight And one desireful one with other one unite She smiled at this never saw I fairer than her mouth nor sweeter than her lips and answered me without stay or delay in the following distich Pray tell me what hath Fate to do betwixt us twain Thou rt Elate so bless our eyne with union and delight At this I sprang up and fell to kissing her hands and cried I had not thought that Fortune would vouchsafe me such occasion Do thou follow me not of bidding or against thy will but of the grace of thee and thy favour to me Then I went on and she after me Now at that time I had no lodging I deemed fit for the like of her but Muslim bin al Walid FN one hundred eighty three was my fast friend and he had a handsome house So I made for his abode and knocked at the door whereupon he came out and I saluted him saying Tis for time like this that friends are treasured up and he replied With love and gladness Come in you twain So we entered but found money scarce with him however he gave me a kerchief saying Carry it to the bazar and sell it and buy food and what else thou needest I took the handkerchief and hastening to the market sold it and bought what we required of victuals and other matters but when I returned I found that Muslim had retired with her to an underground chamber FN one hundred eighty four When he heard my step he hurried out and said to me Allah requite thee the kindness thou hast done me O Abu Ali and reward thee in time to come and reckon it of thy good deeds on the Day of Doom So saying he took from me the food and wine and shut the door in my face His words enraged me and I knew not what to do but he stood behind the door shaking for mirth and when he saw me thus he said to me I conjure thee on my life O Abu Ali tell who it was composed this couplet I lay in her arms all night leaving him To sleep foul hearted but clean of staff At this my rage redoubled and I replied He who wrote this other couplet One I wish him in belt a thousand horns Exceeding in mighty height Manaf FN one hundred eighty five Then I began to abuse him and reproach him with the foulness of his action and his lack of honour and he was silent never uttering a word But when I had finished he smiled and said Out on thee O fool Thou hast entered my house and sold my kerchief and spent my silver so with whom art thou wroth O pimp FN one hundred eighty six Then he left me and went away to her whilst I said By Allah thou art right to twit me as nincompoop and pander Then I left his door and went away in sore concern and I feel its trace in my heart to this very day for I never had my will of her nor indeed ever heard of her more And amongst other tales is that about ISAAC OF MOSUL AND THE MERCHANT Quoth Ishak bin Ibrahim al Mausili It so chanced that one day feeling weary of being on duty at the Palace and in attendance upon the Caliph I mounted horse and went forth at break of dawn having a mind to ride out in the open country and take my pleasure So I said to my servants If there come a messenger from the Caliph or another say that I set out at day break upon a pressing business and that ye know not whither I am gone Then I fared forth alone and went round about the city till the sun waxed hot when I halted in a great thoroughfare known as Al Haram And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ishak bin Ibrahim the Mausili continued When the sun waxed hot I halted in a great thoroughfare known as Al Haram to take shelter in the shade and found it in a spacious wing of a house which projected over the street And I stood there but a little while before there came up a black slave leading an ass bestridden by a damsel and under her were housings set with gems and pearls and upon her were the richest of clothes richness can go no farther and I saw that she was elegant of make with languorous look and graceful mien I asked one of the passers by who she was and he said She is a singer so I fell in love with her at first sight hardly could I keep my seat on horseback She entered the house at whose gate I stood and as I was planning a device to gain access to her there came up two men young and comely who asked admission and the housemaster gave them leave to enter So they alighted and I also and they entered and I with them they supposing that the master of the house had invited me and we sat awhile till food was brought and we ate Then they set wine before us and the damsel came out with a lute in her hand She sang and we drank till I rose to obey a call of nature Thereupon the host questioned the two others of me and they replied that they knew me not whereupon quoth he This is a parasite FN one hundred eighty seven but he is a pleasant fellow so treat him courteously Then I came back and sat down in my place whilst the damsel sang to a pleasing air these two couplets Say to the she gazelle who s no gazelle And Kohl d ariel who s no ariel FN one hundred eighty eight Who lies with male and yet no female is Whose gait is female most unlike the male She sang it right well and the company drank and her song pleased them Then she carolled various pieces to rare measures and amongst the rest one of mine which consisted of this distich Bare hills and campground desolate And friends who all have ganged their gait How severance after union leaves Me and their homes in saddest state Her singing this time was even better than the first then she chanted other rare pieces old and new and amongst them another of mine with the following two couplets Say to angry lover who turns away And shows thee his side whatso thou Thou wroughtest all that by thee was wrought Albe twas haply thy sport and play I prayed her to repeat the song that I might correct it for her whereupon one of the two men accosted me and said Never saw we a more impudent lick platter than thou Art thou not content with sponging but thou must eke meddle and muddle Of very sooth in thee is the saying made true Parasite and pushing wight So I hung down my head for shame and made him no answer whilst his companion would have withheld him from me but he would not be restrained Presently they rose to pray but I lagged behind a little and taking the lute screwed up the sides and brought it into perfect tune Then I stood up in my place to pray with the rest and when we had ended praying the same man fell again to blaming me and reviling me and persisted in his rudeness whilst I held my peace Thereupon the damsel took the lute and touching it knew that it had been altered and said Who hath touched my lute Quoth they None of us hath touched it Quoth she Nay by Allah some one hath touched it and he is an artist a past master in the craft for he hath arranged the strings and tuned them like one who is a perfect performer Said I It was I tuned it and said she Then Allah upon thee take it and play on it So I took it and playing a piece so difficult and so rare that it went nigh to deaden the quick and quicken the dead I sang thereto these couplets I had a heart and with it lived my life Twas seared with fire and burnt with loving lowe I never won the blessing of her love God would not on His slave such boon bestow If what I ve tasted be the food of Love Must taste it all men who love food would know And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Ishak of Mosul thus continued Now when I had finished my verse there was not one of the company but sprang from his place and sat down like schoolboys before me saying Allah upon thee O our lord sing us another song With pleasure said I and playing another measure in masterly fashion sang thereto these couplets Ho thou whose heart is melted down by force of Amor s fire And griefs from every side against thy happiness conspire Unlawful is that he who pierced my vitals with his shaft My blood between my midriff and my breast bone FN one hundred eighty nine he desire Twas plain upon our severance day that he had set his mind On an eternal parting moved by tongue of envious liar He sheds my blood he ne er had shed except by wound of love Will none demand my blood of him my wreck of him require When I had made an end of this song there was not one of them but rose to his feet and threw himself upon the ground for excess of delight Then I cast the lute from my hand but they said Allah upon thee do not on this wise but let us hear another song so Allah Almighty increase thee of His bounty Replied I O folk I will sing you another song and another and another and will tell you who I am I am Ishak bin Ibrahim al Mausili and by Allah I bear myself proudly to the Caliph when he seeketh me Ye have today made me hear abuse from an unmannerly carle such as I loathe and by Allah I will not speak a word nor sit with you till ye put yonder quarrelsome churl out from among you Quoth the fellow s companion to him This is what I warned thee against fearing for thy good name So they hent him by the hand and thrust him out and I took the lute and sang over again the songs of my own composing which the damsel had sung Then I whispered the host that she had taken my heart and that I had no patience to abstain from her Quoth he She is thine on one condition I asked What is that and he answered It is that thou abide with me a month when the damsel and all belonging to her of raiment and jewellery shall be thine I rejoined It is well I will do this So I tarried with him a whole month whilst none knew where I was and the Caliph sought me everywhere but could come by no news of me and at the end of this time the merchant delivered to me the damsel together with all that pertained to her of things of price and an eunuch to attend upon her So I brought all that to my lodging feeling as I were lord of the whole world for exceeding delight in her then I rode forthright to Al Maamun And when I stood in the presence he said Woe to thee O Ishak where hast thou been So I acquainted him with the story and he said Bring me that man at once Thereupon I told him where he lived and he sent and fetched him and questioned him of the case when he repeated the story and the Caliph said to him Thou art a man of right generous mind and it is only fitting that thou be aided in thy generosity Then he ordered him an hundred thousand dirhams and said to me O Ishak bring the damsel before me So I brought her to him and she sang and delighted him and being greatly gladdened by her he said to me I appoint her turn of service every Thursday when she must come and sing to me from behind the curtain And he ordered her fifty thousand dirhams so by Allah I profited both myself and others by my ride And amongst the tales they tell is one of THE THREE UNFORTUNATE LOVERS Quoth Al Utbi FN one hundred ninety I was sitting one day with a company of educated men telling stories of the folk when the talk turned upon legends of lovers and each of us said his say thereanent Now there was in our company an old man who remained silent till all had spoken and had no more to say when quoth he Shall I tell you a thing the like of which you never heard no never Yes quoth we and he said Know then that I had a daughter who loved a youth but we knew it not while the youth loved a singing girl who in her turn loved my daughter One day I was present at an assembly wherein were also the youth And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Tenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Shaykh continued One day I was present at an assembly wherein were also the youth and the singing girl and she chanted to us these couplets Prove how Love bringeth low Lover those tears that run Lowering him still the more When pity finds he none Cried the youth By Allah thou hast said well O my mistress Dost thou incite me to die Answered the girl from behind the curtain Yes if thou be a true lover So he laid his head on a cushion and closed his eyes and when the cup came round to him we shook him and behold he was dead FN one hundred ninety one Therewith we all flocked to him and our pleasure was troubled and we grieved and broke up at once When I came home my people took in bad part my returning before the appointed time and I told them what had befallen the youth thinking that thereby I should greatly surprise them My daughter heard my words and rising went from the sitting chamber into another whither I followed her and found her lying with her head on a cushion even as I had told of the young man So I shook her and lo she was dead Then we laid her out and set forth next morning to bury her whilst the friends of the young man set forth in like guise to bury him As we were on the way to the burial place we met a third funeral and asking whose it was were told that it was that of the singing girl who hearing of my daughter s death had done even as she did and was dead So we buried them all three on one day and this is the rarest tale that ever was heard of lovers And they also tell a tale of HOW ABU HASAN BRAKE WIND They recount that in the City Kaukaban of Al Yaman there was a man of the Fazli tribe who had left Badawi life and become a townsman for many years and was a merchant of the most opulent merchants His wife had deceased when both were young and his friends were instant with him to marry again ever quoting to him the words of the poet Go gossip re wed thee for Prime draweth near A wife is an almanac good for the year So being weary of contention Abu Hasan entered into negotiations with the old women who procure matches and married a maid like Canopus when he hangeth over the seas of Al Hind He made high festival therefor bidding to the wedding banquet kith and kin Olema and Fakirs friends and foes and all his acquaintances of that countryside The whole house was thrown open to feasting there were rices of five several colours and sherbets of as many more and kids stuffed with walnuts and almonds and pistachios and a camel colt FN one hundred ninety two roasted whole So they ate and drank and made mirth and merriment and the bride was displayed in her seven dresses and one more to the women who could not take their eyes off her At last the bridegroom was summoned to the chamber where she sat enthroned and he rose slowly and with dignity from his divan but in so doing for that he was over full of meat and drink lo and behold he let fly a fart great and terrible Thereupon each guest turned to his neighbour and talked aloud and made as though he had heard nothing fearing for his life But a consuming fire was lit in Abu Hasan s heart so he pretended a call of nature and in lieu of seeking the bride chamber he went down to the house court and saddled his mare and rode off weeping bitterly through the shadow of the night In time he reached Lahej where he found a ship ready to sail for India so he shipped on board and made Calicut of Malabar Here he met with many Arabs especially Hazramis FN one hundred ninety three who recommended him to the King and this King who was a Kafir trusted him and advanced him to the captainship of his body guard He remained ten years in all solace and delight of life at the end of which time he was seized with home sickness and the longing to behold his native land was that of a lover pining for his beloved and he came near to die of yearning desire But his appointed day had not dawned so after taking the first bath of health he left the King without leave and in due course landed at Makalla of Hazramaut Here he donned the rags of a religious and keeping his name and case secret fared for Kaukaban afoot enduring a thousand hardships of hunger thirst and fatigue and braving a thousand dangers from the lion the snake and the Ghul But when he drew near his old home he looked down upon it from the hills with brimming eyes and said in himself Haply they might know thee so I will wander about the outskirts and hearken to the folk Allah grant that my case be not remembered by them He listened carefully for seven nights and seven days till it so chanced that as he was sitting at the door of a hut he heard the voice of a young girl saying O my mother tell me the day when I was born for such an one of my companions is about to take an omen FN one hundred ninety four for me And the mother answered Thou was born O my daughter on the very night when Abu Hasan farted Now the listener no sooner heard these words than he rose up from the bench and fled away saying to himself Verily thy fart hath become a date which shall last for ever and ever even as the poet said As long as palms shall shift the flower As long as palms shall sift the flour FN one hundred ninety five And he ceased not travelling and voyaging and returned to India and there abode in self exile till he died and the mercy of Allah be upon him FN one hundred ninety six And they tell another story of THE LOVERS OF THE BANU TAYY Kasim son of Adi was wont to relate that a man of the Banu Tamim spake as follows I went out one day in search of an estray and coming to the waters of the Banu Tayy saw two companies of people near one another and behold those of one company were disputing among themselves even as the other So I watched them and observed in one of the companies a youth wasted with sickness as he were a worn out dried up waterskin And as I looked on him lo he repeated these couplets What ails the Beauty she returneth not Is t Beauty s irk or grudging to my lot I sickened and my friends all came to call What stayed thee calling with the friendly knot Hadst thou been sick I had come running fast To thee nor threats had kept me from the spot Mid them I miss thee and I lie alone Sweetheart to lose thy love sad loss I wot His words were heard by a damsel in the other company who hastened towards him and when her people followed her she fought them off Then the youth caught sight of her and sprang up and ran towards her whilst the people of his party ran after him and laid hold of him However he haled and freed himself from them and she in like manner loosed herself and when they were free each ran to other and meeting between the two parties embraced and fell dead upon the ground And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred ante Eleventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the young man and the maid met between the two parties and embraced and both fell dead upon the ground whereat came there out an old man from one of the tents and stood over them exclaiming Verily we are Allah s and unto Him we are returning Then weeping sore he said Allah have ruth on you both by the Almighty though you were not united in your lives I will at least unite you after your deaths And he bade lay them out so they washed them and shrouded them in one shroud and dug for them one grave and prayed one prayer over them both and buried them in one tomb nor was there man or woman in the two parties but I saw weeping over them and buffeting their faces Then I questioned the Shaykh of them and he said She was my daughter and he my brother s son and love brought them to the pass thou seest I exclaimed Allah amend thee but why didst thou not marry them to each other Quoth he I feared shame FN one hundred ninety seven and dishonour and now I am fallen into both And they tell a tale of THE MAD LOVER Quoth Abu l Abbas al Mubarrad FN one hundred ninety eight I set out one day with a company to Al Barid on an occasion and coming to the monastery of Hirakl FN one hundred ninety nine we alighted in its shade Presently a man came out to us and said There are madmen in the monastery FN two hundred and amongst them one who speaketh wisdom if ye saw him ye would marvel at his speech So we arose all and went into the monastery where we saw a man seated on a skin mat in one of the cells with bare head and eyes intently fixed upon the wall We saluted him and he returned our salaam without looking at us and one said to us Repeat some verses to him for when he heareth verse he speaketh So I repeated these two couplets O best of race to whom gave Hawwa FN two hundred one boon of birth Except for thee the world were neither sweet nor fair Thou rt he whose face by Allah shown to man Doth ward off death decay and hoary hair When he heard from me this praise of the Apostle he turned towards us and repeated these lines Well Allah wotteth I am sorely plagued Nor can I show my pain to human sight Two souls have I one soul is here contained While other woneth in another site Meseems the absent soul s like present soul And that she suffers what to me is dight Then he asked us Have I said well or said ill And we answered Thou hast said the clean contrary of ill well and right well Then he put out his hand to a stone that was by him and took it up whereupon thinking he would throw it at us we fled from him but he fell to beating upon his breast therewith violent blows and said to us Fear not but draw near and hear somewhat from me and receive it from me So we came back and he repeated these couplets When they made their camels yellow white kneel down at dawning grey They mounted her on crupper and the camel went his way Mine eye balls through the prison wall beheld them and I cried With streaming eyelids and a heart that burnt in dire dismay O camel driver turn thy beast that I farewell my love In parting and farewelling her I see my doomed day I m faithful to my vows of love which I have never broke Would Heaven I kenned what they have done with vows that vowed they Then he looked at me and said Say me dost thou know what they did FN two hundred two Answered I Yes they are dead Almighty Allah have mercy on them At this his face changed and he sprang to his feet and cried out How knowest thou they be dead and I replied Were they alive they had not left thee thus Quoth he By Allah thou art right and I care not to live after them Then his side muscles quivered and he fell on his face and we ran up to him and shook him and found him dead the mercy of the Almighty be on him At this we marvelled and mourned for him and sore mourning laid him out and buried him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twelfth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that al Mubarrad thus continued When the man fell we mourned over him with sore mourning and laid him out and buried him And when I returned to Baghdad and went in to the Caliph al Mutawakkil he saw the trace of tears on my face and said to me What is this So I told him what had passed and it was grievous to him and he cried What moved thee to deal thus with him FN two hundred three By Allah if I thought thou didst not repent it and regret him I would punish thee therefor And he mourned for him the rest of the day And amongst the tales they tell is one of THE PRIOR WHO BECAME A MOSLEM Quoth Abu Bakr Mohammed ibn Al Anbari FN two hundred four I once left Anbar on a journey to Amuriyah FN two hundred five where there came out to me the prior of the monastery and superior of the monkery Abd al Masih hight and brought me into the building There I found forty religious who entertained me that night with fair guest rite and I left them after seeing among them such diligence in adoration and devotion as I never beheld the like of in any others Next day I farewelled them and fared forth and after doing my business at Amuriyah I returned to my home at Anbar And next year I made pilgrimage to Meccah and as I was circumambulating the Holy House I saw Abd al Masih the monk also compassing the Ka abah and with him five of his fellows the shavelings Now when I was sure that it was indeed he I accosted him saying Art thou not Abd al Masih the Religious and he replied Nay I am Abdallah the Desirous FN two hundred six Therewith I fell to kissing his grey hairs and shedding tears then taking him by the hand I led him aside into a corner of the Temple and said to him Tell me the cause of thy conversion to al Islam and he made reply Verily twas a wonder of wonders and befell thus A company of Moslem devotees came to the village wherein is our convent and sent a youth to buy them food He saw in the market a Christian damsel selling bread who was of the fairest of women and he was struck at first sight with such love of her that his senses failed him and he fell on his face in a fainting fit When he revived he returned to his companions and told them what had befallen him saying Go ye about your business I may not go with you They chided him and exhorted him but he paid no heed to them so they left him whilst he entered the village and seated himself at the door of the woman s booth FN two hundred seven She asked him what he wanted and he told her that he was in love with her whereupon she turned from him but he abode in his place three days without tasting food keeping his eyes fixed on her face Now whenas she saw that he departed not from her she went to her people and acquainted them with his case and they set on him the village boys who stoned him and bruised his ribs and broke his head but for all this he would not budge Then the villagers took counsel together to slay him but a man of them came to me and told me of his case and I went out to him and found him lying prostrate on the ground So I wiped the blood from his face and carried him to the convent and dressed his wounds and there he abode with me fourteen days But as soon as he could walk he left the monastery And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abdallah the Religious continued So I carried him to the convent and dressed his wounds and he abode with me fourteen days But as soon as he could walk he left the monastery and returned to the door of the woman s booth where he sat gazing on her as before When she saw him she came out to him and said By Allah thou movest me to pity wilt thou enter my faith that I may marry thee He cried Allah forbid that I should put off the faith of Unity and enter that of Plurality FN two hundred eight Quoth she Come in with me to my house and take thy will of me and wend thy ways in peace Quoth he Not so I will not waste the worship of twelve years for the lust of an eye twinkle Said she Then depart from me forthwith and he said My heart will not suffer me to do that whereupon she turned her countenance from him Presently the boys found him out and began to pelt him with stones and he fell on his face saying Verily Allah is my protector who sent down the Book of the Koran and He protecteth the Righteous FN two hundred nine At this I sallied forth and driving away the boys lifted his head from the ground and heard him say Allah mine unite me with her in Paradise Then I carried him to the monastery but he died before I could reach it and I bore him without the village and I dug for him a grave and buried him And next night when half of it was spent the damsel cried with a great cry and she in her bed so the villagers flocked to her and questioned her of her case Quoth she As I slept behold the Moslem man came in to me and taking me by the hand carried me to the gate of Paradise but the Guardian denied me entrance saying Tis forbidden to unbelievers So I embraced Al Islam at his hands and entering with him beheld therein pavilions and trees such as I cannot describe to you Moreover he brought me to a pavilion of jewels and said to me Of a truth this is my pavilion and thine nor will I enter it save with thee but after five nights thou shalt be with me therein if it be the will of Allah Almighty Then he put forth his hand to a tree which grew at the door of the pavilion and plucked there from two apples and gave them to me saying Eat this and keep the other that the monks may see it So I ate one of them and never tasted I aught sweeter And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fourteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the woman continued So he plucked two apples and gave them to me saying Eat this and keep the other that the monks may see it So I ate one of them and never tasted I aught sweeter Then he took my hand and fared forth and carried me back to my house and when I awoke I found the taste of the apple in my mouth and the other in my hand So saying she brought out the apple and in the darkness of the night it shone as it were a sparkling star So they carried her and the apple with her to the monastery where she repeated her vision and showed it to us never saw we its like among all the fruits of the world Then I took a knife and cut the apple into pieces according as we were folk in company and never knew we aught more delicious than its savour nor more delightsome than its scent but we said Haply this was a devil that appeared unto her to seduce her from her faith Thereupon her people took her and went away but she abstained from eating and drinking and on the fifth night she rose from her bed and going forth the village to the grave of her Moslem lover threw herself upon it and died her family not knowing what was come of her But on the morrow there came to the village two Moslem elders clad in hair cloth and with them two women in like garb and said O people of the village with you is a woman Saint a Waliyah of the friends of Allah who died a Moslemah and we will take charge of her in lieu of you So the villagers sought her and found her dead on the Moslem s grave and they said This was one of us and she died in our faith so we will take charge of her Rejoined the two old men Nay she died a Moslemah and we claim her And the dispute waxed to a quarrel between them till one of the Shaykhs said Be this the test of her faith the forty monks of the monastery shall come and try to lift her from the grave If they succeed then she died a Nazarene if not one of us shall come and lift her up and if she be lifted by him she died a Moslemah The villagers agreed to this and fetched the forty monks who heartened one another and came to her to lift her but could not Then we tied a great rope round her middle and haled at it but the rope broke in sunder and she stirred not and the villagers came and did the like but could not move her from her place FN two hundred ten At last when all means failed we said to one of the two Shaykhs Come thou and lift her So he went up to the grave and covering her with his mantle said In the name of Allah the Compassionating the Compassionate and of the Faith of the Apostle of Allah on whom be prayers and peace Then he lifted her and taking her in his bosom betook himself with her to a cave hard by where they laid her and the two women came and washed her and shrouded her Then the two elders bore her to her Moslem lover s grave and prayed over her and buried her by his side and went their ways Now we were eye witnesses of all this and when we were alone with one another we said In sooth the truth is most worthy to be followed FN two hundred eleven and indeed the verity hath been made manifest to us nor is there a proof more patent of the truth of al Islam than that we have seen this day with our eyes So I and all the monks became Moslems and on like wise did the villagers and we sent to the people of Mesopotamia for a doctor of the law to instruct us in the ordinances of al Islam and the canons of the Faith They sent us a learned man and a pious who taught us the rites of prayer and the tenets of the faith and we are now in ease abounding so to Allah be the praise and the thanks And they also tell a tale of THE LOVES OF ABU ISA AND KURRAT AL AYN Quoth Amru bin Masa dah FN two hundred twelve Abu Isa son of al Rashid and brother to al Maamun was enamoured of one Kurrat al Ayn a slave girl belonging to Ali bin Hisham FN two hundred thirteen and she also loved him but he concealed his passion complaining of it to none neither discovering his secret to anyone of his pride and magnanimity for he had used his utmost endeavour to purchase her of her master but he had failed At last when his patience was at an end and his passion was sore on him and he was helpless in the matter he went in to al Maamun one day of state after the folk had retired and said to him O Commander of the Faithful if thou wilt this day make trial of thine Alcaydes by taking them unawares thou wilt know the generous from the mean and note each one s place after the quality of his mind But in saying this he purposed only to sit with Kurrat al Ayn in her lord s house Quoth al Maamun Right is thy recking and bade make ready a barge called the Flyer wherein he embarked with Abu Isa and a party of his chief officers The first mansion he visited unexpectedly was that of Hamid al Tawil of Tus whom he found seated And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fifteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that al Maamun embarked with his chief officers and fared on till they reached the mansion of Hamid al Tawil of Tus and unexpectedly entering they found him seated on a mat and before him singers and players with lutes and flageolets and other instruments of music in their hands So Al Maamun sat with him awhile and presently he set before him dishes of nothing but flesh meat with no birds among them The Caliph would not taste thereof and Abu Isa said to him O Commander of the Faithful we have taken the owner of this place unawares and he knew not of thy coming but now let us go to another place which is prepared for thee and fitted for thee Thereupon the Caliph arose and betook himself with his brother Abu Isa and his suite to the abode of Ali son of Hisham who on hearing of their approach came out and received them with the goodliest of reception and kissed the earth before the King Then he brought them into his mansion and opened to them a saloon than which seer never saw a goodlier Its floors pillars and walls were of many coloured marbles adorned with Greek paintings and it was spread with matting of Sind FN two hundred fourteen whereon were carpets and tapestry of Bassorah make fitted to the length and breadth of the room So the Caliph sat awhile examining the house and its ceilings and walls then said Give us somewhat to eat So they brought him forthwith nearly an hundred dishes of poultry besides other birds and brewises fritters and cooling marinades When he had eaten he said Give us some thing to drink O Ali and the host set before him in vessels of gold and silver and crystal raisin wine boiled down to one third with fruits and spices and the cupbearers were pages like moons clad in garments of Alexandrian stuff interwoven with gold and bearing on their breasts beakers of crystal full of rose water mingled with musk So al Maamun marvelled with exceeding marvel at all he saw and said Ho thou Abu al Hasan Whereupon Ali sprang to the Caliph s carpet and kissing it said At thy service O Commander of the Faithful and stood before him Quoth al Maamun Let us hear some pleasant and merry song Replied Ali I hear and obey O Commander of the Faithful and said to one of his eunuchs Fetch the singing women So the slave went out and presently returned followed by ten castratos bearing ten stools of gold which they set down in due order and after these came ten damsels concubines of the master as they were shining full moons or gardens full of bloom clad in black brocade with crowns of gold on their heads and they passed along the room till they sat down on the stools when sang they sundry songs Al Maamun looked at one of them and being captivated by her elegance and fair favour asked her What is thy name O damsel and she answered My name is Sajahi FN two hundred fifteen O Commander of the Faithful and he said Sing to us O Sajahi So she played a lively measure and sang these couplets I walk for fear of interview the weakling s walk Who sees two lion whelps the

Quoth the Caliph Thou hast done well O damsel whose are these lines She answered Written by Amru bin Ma di Karib al Zubaydi FN two hundred sixteen and the air is Ma abid s FN two hundred seventeen Then the Caliph and Abu Isa and Ali drank and the damsels went away and were succeeded by other ten all clad in flowered silk of Al Yaman brocaded with gold who sat down on the chairs and sang various songs The Caliph looked at one of the concubines who was like a wild heifer of the waste and said to her What is thy name O damsel She replied My name is Zabiyah FN two hundred eighteen zero Commander of the Faithful and he Sing to us Zabiyah so she warbled like a bird with many a trill and sang these two couplets Houris and highborn Dames who feel no fear of men Like Meccan game forbidden man to slam FN two hundred nineteen Their soft sweet voices make you deem them whores But bars them from all whoring Al Islam When she had finished al Maamun cried favoured of Allah art thou And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the slave girl finished her song al Maamun cried Favoured of Allah art thou Whose is this verse and she answered Jarir s FN two hundred twenty and the air is By Ibn Surayj Then the Caliph and his company drank whilst the girls went away and there came forth yet other ten as they were rubies robed in red brocade inwoven with gold and purfled with pearls and jewels whilst all their heads were bare They sat down on the stools and sang various airs so the Caliph looked at one of them who was like the sun of the day and asked her What is thy name O damsel and she answered O Commander of the Faithful my name is Fatin Sing to us O Fatin quoth he whereat she played a lively measure and sang these couplets Deign grant thy favours since tis time I were engraced Tnough of severance hath it been my lot to taste Thou rt he whose face cloth every gift and charm unite Yet is my patience spent for that twas sore misplaced I ve wasted life in loving thee and would high Heaven Grant me one meeting hour for all this wilful waste Well sung O Fatin exclaimed the Caliph whose verse is this And she answered Adi bin Zayd s and the air is antique Then all three drank whilst the damsels retired and were succeeded by other ten maidens as they were sparkling stars clad in flowered silk embroidered with red gold and girt with jewelled zones They sat down and sang various motives and the Caliph asked one of them who was like a wand of willow What is thy name O damsel and she answered My name is Rashaa FN two hundred twenty one zero Commander of the Faithful Sing to us O Rashaa quoth he so she played a lively measure and sang these couplets And wand like Houri who can passion heal Like young gazelle that paceth o er the plain I drain this wine cup on the toast her cheek Each cup disputing till she bends in twain Then sleeps the night with me the while I cry This is the only gain my Soul would gain Said the Caliph Well done O damsel Sing us something more So she rose and kissing the ground before him sang the following distich She came out to gaze on the bridal at ease In a shift that reeked of ambergris The Caliph was highly pleased with this couplet and when the slave girl saw how much it delighted him she repeated it several times Then said al Maamun Bring up the Flyer being minded to embark and depart but Ali bin Hisham said to him O Commander of the Faithful I have a slave girl whom I bought for ten thousand diners she hath taken my heart in whole and part and I would fain display her to the Commander of the Faithful If she please him and he will accept of her she is his and if not let him hear something from her Said the Caliph Bring her to me and forth came a damsel as she were a branchlet of willow with seducing eyes and eyebrows set like twin bows and on her head she wore a crown of red gold crusted with pearls and jewelled under which was a fillet bearing this couplet wrought in letters of chrysolite A Jinniyah this with her Jinn to show How to pierce man s heart with a stringless bow The handmaiden walked with the gait of a gazelle in flight and fit to damn a devotee till she came to a chair whereon she seated herself And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventeenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the hand maiden walked with the gait of a gazelle in flight fit to damn a devotee till she came to a chair whereon she seated herself And Al Maamun marvelled at her beauty and loveliness but when Abu Isa saw her his heart throbbed with pain his colour changed to pale and wan and he was in evil case Asked the Caliph O Abu Isa what aileth thee to change thus and he answered O Commander of the Faithful it is because of a twitch that seizeth me betimes Quoth the Caliph Hast thou known yonder damsel before to day Quoth he Yes O Commander of the Faithful can the moon be concealed Then said al Maamun to her What is thy name O damsel and she replied My name is Kurrat al Ayn O Commander of the Faithful and he rejoined Sing to us O Kurrat al Ayn So she sang these two couplets The loved ones left thee in middle night And fared with the pilgrims when dawn shone bright The tents of pride round the domes they pitched And with broidered curtains were veiled fro sight Quoth the Caliph Favoured of Heaven art thou O Kurrat al Ayn Whose song is that whereto she answered The words are by Di ibil al Khuza i and the air by Zurzur al Saghir Abu Isa looked at her and his tears choked him so that the company marvelled at him Then she turned to al Maamun and said to him O Commander of the Faithful wilt thou give me leave to change the words Said he Sing what thou wilt so she played a merry measure and carolled these couplets If thou should please a friend who pleaseth thee Frankly in public practise secrecy And spurn the slanderer s tale who seldom FN two hundred twenty two seeks Except the severance of true love to see They say when lover s near he tires of love And absence is for love best remedy Both cures we tried and yet we are not cured Withal we judge that nearness easier be Yet nearness is of no avail when he Thou lovest lends thee love unwillingly But when she had finished Abu Isa said O Commander of the Faithful And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Kurrat al Ayn had finished her verse Abu Isa said O Commander of the Faithful though we endure disgrace we shall be at ease FN two hundred twenty three Dost thou give me leave to reply to her Quoth the Caliph Yes say what thou wilt to her So he swallowed his tears and sang these two distichs Silent I woned and never owned my love But from my heart I hid love s blissful boon Yet if my eyes should manifest my love Tis for my nearness to the shining moon Then Kurrat al Ayn took the lute and played a lively tune and rejoined with these couplets An what thou claimest were the real truth With only Hope content thou hadst not been Nor couldest patient live without the girl So rare of inner grace and outward mien But there is nothing in the claim of thee At all save tongue and talk that little mean When Abu Isa heard this he fell to weeping and wailing and evidencing his trouble and anguish Then he raised his eyes to her and sighing repeated these couplets Under my raiment a waste body lies And in my spirit all comprising prize I have a heart whose pain shall aye endure And tears like torrents pour these woeful eyes Whene er a wise man spies me straight he chides Love that misleads me thus in ways unwise O Lord I lack the power this dole to bear Come sudden Death or joy in bestest guise When he had ended Ali bin Hisham sprang up and kissing his feet said O my lord Allah hearing thy secret hath answered thy prayer and consenteth to thy taking her with all she hath of things rare and fair so the Commander of the Faithful have no mind to her Quoth Al Maamun Had we a mind to her we would prefer Abu Isa before ourselves and help him to his desire So saying he rose and embarking went away whilst Abu Isa tarried for Kurrat al Ayn whom he took and carried to his own house his breast swelling with joy See then the generosity of Ali son of Hisham And they tell a tale of AL AMIN SON OF AL RASHID AND HIS UNCLE IBRAHIM BIN AL MAHDI Al Amin FN two hundred twenty four brother of al Maamun once entered the house of his uncle Ibrahim bin al Mahdi where he saw a slave girl playing upon the lute and she being one of the fairest of women his heart inclined to her Ibrahim seeing how it was with him sent the girl to him with rich raiment and precious ornaments When he saw her he thought that his uncle had lain with her so he was loath to have to do with her because of that and accepting what came with her sent her back to Ibrahim His uncle learnt the cause of this from one of al Amin s eunuchs so he took a shift of watered silk and worked upon its skirt in letters of gold these two couplets No I declare by Him to whom all bow Of nothing neath her petticoat I trow Nor meddle with her mouth nor aught did I But see and hear her and it was enow Then he clad her in the shift and giving her a lute sent her back again to his nephew When she came into al Amin s presence she kissed ground before him and tuning the lute sang thereto these two couplets Thy breast thou baredst sending back the gift Showing unlove for me withouten shift An thou bear spite of Past the Past forgive And for the Caliphate cast the Past adrift When she had made an end of her verse Al Amin looked at her and seeing what was upon her skirt could no longer control him self And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Nineteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Al Amin looked at the damsel and saw what was upon her skirt he could no longer control himself but drew near unto her and kissed her and appointed her a separate lodging in his palace Moreover he thanked his uncle for this and bestowed on him the government of Rayy And a tale is told of AL FATH BIN KHAKAN AND THE CALIPH AL MUTAWAKKIL Al Mutawakkil FN two hundred twenty five was once taking medicine and folk sent him by way of solace all sorts of presents and rarities and things costly and precious Amongst others al Fath bin Khakan FN two hundred twenty six sent him a virgin slave high breasted of the fairest among women of her time and with her a vase of crystal containing ruddy wine and a goblet of red gold whereon were graven in black these couplets Since our Imam came forth from medicine Which made him health and heartiness rewin There is no healing draught more sovereign Than well boiled wine this golden goblet in Then let him break the seal for him secured Tis best prescription after medicine FN two hundred twenty seven Now when the damsel entered the physician Yohanna FN two hundred twenty eight was with the Caliph and as he read the couplets he smiled and said By Allah O Commander of the Faithful Fath is better versed than I in the art of healing so let not the Prince of True Believers gainsay his prescription Accordingly the Caliph followed the recipe contained in the poetry and was made whole by the blessing of Allah and won his every wish And among tales they tell is one of THE MAN S DISPUTE WITH THE LEARNED WOMAN CONCERNING THE RELATIVE EXCELLENCE OF MALE AND FEMALE Quoth a certain man of learning I never saw amongst woman kind one wittier and wiser better read and by nature more generously bred and in manners and morals more perfected than a preacher of the people of Baghdad by name Sitt al Masha ikh FN two hundred twenty nine It chanced that she came to Hamah city in the year of the Flight five hundred and sixty and one FN two hundred thirty and there delivered salutary exhortations to the folk from the professorial chair Now there used to visit her house a number of students of divinity and persons of learning and polite letters who would discuss with her questions of theology and dispute with her on controversial points I went to her one day with a friend of mine a man of years and education and when we had taken our seats she set before us a dish of fruit and seated herself behind a curtain Now she had a brother a handsome youth who stood behind us to serve us And when we had eaten we fell to disputing upon points of divinity and I propounded to her a theological question bearing upon a difference between the Imams the Founders of the Four Schools She proceeded to speak in answer whilst I listened but all the while my friend fell to looking upon her brother s face and admiring his beauties without paying any heed to what she discoursed Now as she was watching him from behind the curtain when she had made an end of her speech she turned to him and said Methinks thou be of those who give men the preference over women He replied Assuredly and she asked And why so whereto he answered For that Allah hath made the masculine worthier than the feminine And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twentieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Shaykh replied For that Allah hath made the masculine worthier than the feminine and I like the excelling and mislike the excelled She laughed and presently said Wilt thou deal fairly with me in debate if I battle the matter with thee and he rejoined Yes Then quoth she What is the evidence of the superiority of the male to the female Quoth he It is of two kinds traditional and reasonable The authoritative part deriveth from the Koran and the Traditions of the Apostle As for the first we have the very words of Almighty Allah Men shall have the pre eminence above women because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other FN two hundred thirty one and again If there be not two men let there be one man and two women FN two hundred thirty two and again when treating of inheritance If there be brothers and sisters let a male have as much as the portion of two females FN two hundred thirty three Thus Allah extolled and exalted be He hath in these places preferred the male over the female and teacheth that a woman is as the half of a man for that he is worthier than she As for the Sunnah traditions is it not reported of the Prophet whom Allah save and assain that he appointed the blood money for a woman to be half that of a man And as for the evidence of reason the male is the agent and active and the female the patient and passive FN two hundred thirty four Rejoined she Thou hast said well O my lord but by Allah thou hast proved my contention with thine own lips and hast advanced evidence which telleth against thee and not for thee And thus it is Allah extolled and exalted be He preferred the male above the female solely because of the inherent condition and essential quality of masculinity and in this there is no dispute between us Now this quality of male hood is common to the child the boy the youth the adult and the old man nor is there any distinction between them in this If then the superior excellence of male masculant belong to him solely by virtue of manhood it behoveth that thy heart incline and thy sole delight in the graybeard equally with the boy seeing that there is no distinction between them in point of male hood But the difference between thee and me turneth upon the accident of qualities that are sought as constituting the pleasure of intercourse and its enjoyment and thou hast adduced no proof of the superiority of the youth over the young girl in this matter of non essentials He made answer O reverend lady knowest thou not that which is peculiar to the youth of limber shape and rosy cheeks and pleasant smile and sweetness of speech Youths are in these respects superior to women and the proof of this is what they traditionally report of the Prophet whom Allah bless and preserve that he said Stay not thy gaze upon the beardless for in them is a momentary eye glance at the black eyed girls of Paradise Nor indeed is the superiority of the lad over the lass hidden to any of mankind and how well saith Abu Nowas FN two hundred thirty five The least of him is the being free From monthly courses and pregnancy And the saying of another poet Quoth our Imam Abu Nowas who was For mad debauch and waggishness renowned O tribe that loves the cheeks of boys take fill Of joys in Paradise shall ne er be found So if any one enlarge in praise of a slave girl and wish to enhance her value by the mention of her beauties he likeneth her to a youth And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twenty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Shaykh continued So if any one enlarge in praise of a slave girl and wish to enhance her value by the mention of her beauties he likeneth her to a youth because of the illustrious qualities that belong to the male even as saith the poet Boy like of backside in the deed of kind She sways as sways the wand like boughs a wind An youths then were not better and fairer than girls why should these be likened to them And know also Almighty Allah preserve thee that a youth is easy to be led adapting himself to every rede pleasant of converse and manners inclining to assent rather than dissent especially when his side face is newly down d and his upper lip is first embrowned and the purple lights of youth on his cheeks abound so that he is like the full moon sound and how goodly is the saying of Abu Tammam FN two hundred thirty six The slanderers said There s hair upon his cheeks Quoth I Exceed not that s no blemish there When he could bear that haling of his hips And pearl beads shaded by mustachio hair FN two hundred thirty seven And Rose swore solemn holiest oath that is From that fair cheek she nevermore would fare I spoke with eyelids without need of speech And they who answered me

Jeweller the Baghdadi fell sick and made sure of death he called to him his son named Ali of Cairo and said O my son verily this world passeth away but the next world endureth for aye Every soul shall taste of death FN two hundred fifty eight and now O my son my decease is at hand and I desire to charge thee with a charge which if thou observe thou shalt abide in safety and prosperity till thou meet Almighty Allah but if thou follow it not there shall befal thee much weariness and thou wilt repent of having transgressed mine injunctions Replied Ali O my father how shall I do other than hearken to thy words and act according to thy charge seeing that I am bounden by the law of the Faith to obey thee and give ear to thy command Rejoined his father O my son I leave thee lands and houses and goods and wealth past count so that wert thou each day to spend thereof five hundred dinars thou wouldst miss naught of it But O my son look that thou live in the fear of Allah and follow His Chosen One Mustafa whom may He bless and preserve in whatso he is reported to have bidden and forbidden in his traditional law FN two hundred fifty nine Be thou constant in alms deeds and the practice of beneficence and in consorting with men of worth and piety and learning and look that thou have a care for the poor and needy and shun avarice and meanness and the conversation of the wicked or those of suspicious character Look thou kindly upon thy servants and family and also upon thy wife for she is of the daughters of the great and is big with child by thee haply Allah will vouchsafe thee virtuous issue by her And he ceased not to exhort him thus weeping and saying O my son I beseech Allah the Bountiful the Lord of the glorious Empyrean FN two hundred sixty to deliver thee from all straits that may encompass thee and grant thee His ready relief Thereupon his son wept with sore weeping and said O my father I am melted by thy words for these are as the words of one that saith farewell Replied the merchant Yes O my son I am aware of my condition forget thou not my charge Then he fell to repeating the two professions of the Faith and to reciting verses of the Koran until the appointed hour arrived when he said Draw near unto me O my son So Ali drew near and he kissed him then he sighed and his soul departed his body and he went to the mercy of Almighty Allah FN two hundred sixty one Therewith great grief fell upon Ali the clamour of keening arose in his house and his father s friends flocked to him Then he betook himself to preparing the body for burial and made him a splendid funeral They bore his bier to the place of prayer and prayed over him then to the cemetery where they buried him and recited over him what suited of the sublime Koran after which they returned to the house and condoled with the dead man s son and wended each his own way Moreover Ali prayed the Friday prayer for his father and had perlections of the Koran every day for the normal forty during which time he abode in the house and went not forth save to the place of prayer and every Friday he visited his father s tomb So he ceased not from his praying and reciting for some time until his fellows of the sons of the merchants came in to him one day and saluting him said How long this thy mourning and neglecting thy business and the company of thy friends Verily this is a fashion which will bring thee weariness and thy body will suffer for it exceedingly Now when they came in to him Iblis the Accursed was with them prompting them and they went on to recommend him to accompany them to the bazar whilst Iblis tempted him to consent to them till he yielded And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twenty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the sons of the merchants went in to Ali the Cairene son of Hasan the Jeweller they recommended him to accompany them to the bazar till he yielded that the will of Allah extolled and exalted be He might be fulfilled and he left the house of mourning with them Presently they said Mount thy she mule and ride with us to such a garden that we may solace us there and that thy grief and despondency may depart from thee So he mounted and taking his slave went with them to the garden in question and when they entered one of them went and making ready the morning meal brought it to them there So they ate and were merry and sat in talk till the end of the day when they mounted and returned each to his own lodging where they passed the night As soon as the morrow dawned they again visited Ali and said Come with us Asked he Whither and they answered To such a garden for it is finer than the first and more pleasurable So he went with them to the garden and one of them going away made ready the morning meal and brought it to them together with strong heady wine and after eating they brought out the wine when quoth Ali What is this and quoth they This is what dispelleth sadness and brighteneth gladness And they ceased not to commend it to him till they prevailed upon him and he drank with them Then they sat drinking and talking till the end of the day when each returned home But as for Ali the Cairene he was giddy with wine and in this plight went in to his wife who said to him What aileth thee that thou art so changed He said We were making merry to day when one of my companions brought us liquor so my friends drank and I with them and this giddiness came upon me And she replied O my lord say me hast thou forgotten thy father s injunction and done that from which he forbade thee in consorting with doubtful folk Answered he These be of the sons of the merchants they are no suspicious folk only lovers of mirth and good cheer And he continued to lead this life with his friends day after day going from place to place and feasting with them and drinking till they said to him Our turns are ended and now it is thy turn Well come and welcome and fair cheer cried he so on the morrow he made ready all that the case called for of meat and drink two fold what they had provided and taking cooks and tent pitchers and coffee makers FN two hundred sixty two repaired with the others to Al Rauzah FN two hundred sixty three and the Nilometer where they abode a whole month eating and drinking and hearing music and making merry At the end of the month Ali found that he had spent a great sum of money but Iblis the Accursed deluded him and said to him Though thou shouldst spend every day a like sum yet wouldst thou not miss aught of it So he took no account of money expenses and continued this way of life for three years whilst his wife remonstrated with him and reminded him of his father s charge but he hearkened not to her words till he had spent all the ready monies he had when he fell to selling his jewels and spending their price until they also were all gone Then he sold his houses fields farms and gardens one after other till they likewise were all gone and he had nothing left but the tenement wherein he lived So he tore out the marble and wood work and sold it and spent of its price till he had made an end of all this also when he took thought with himself and finding that he had nothing left to expend sold the house itself and spent the purchase money After that the man who had bought the house came to him and said Seek out for thyself a lodging as I have need of my house So he bethought himself and finding that he had no want of a house except for his wife who had borne him a son and daughter he had not a servant left he hired a large room in one of the mean courts FN two hundred sixty four and there took up his abode after having lived in honour and luxury with many eunuchs and much wealth and he soon came to want one day s bread Quoth his wife Of this I warned thee and exhorted thee to obey thy father s charge and thou wouldst not hearken to me but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Whence shall the little ones eat Arise then go round to thy friends the sons of the merchants belike they will give thee somewhat on which we may live this day So he arose and went to his friends one by one but they all hid their faces from him and gave him injurious words revolting to hear but naught else and he returned to his wife and said to her They have given me nothing Thereupon she went forth to beg of her neighbours the wherewithal to keep themselves alive And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twenty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the wife of Ali the Cairene seeing her husband return empty handed went forth to beg of her neighbours the wherewithal to keep themselves alive and repaired to a woman whom she had known in former days When she came in to her and she saw her case she rose and receiving her kindly wept and said What hath befallen you So she told her all that her husband had done and the other replied Well come and welcome and fair cheer whatever thou needest Seek it of me without price Quoth she Allah requite thee abundantly FN two hundred sixty five Then her friend gave her as much provision as would suffice herself and her family a whole month and she took it and returned to her lodging When her husband saw her he wept and asked Whence hadst thou that and she answered I got it of such a woman for when I told her what had befallen us she failed me not in aught but said Seek of me all thou needest Whereupon her husband rejoined Since thou hast this much I will betake myself to a place I have in my mind peradventure Allah Almighty will bring us relief FN two hundred sixty six With these words he took leave of her and kissed his children and went out not knowing whither he should go and he continued walking on till he came to Bulak where he saw a ship about to sail for Damietta FN two hundred sixty seven Here he met a man between whom and his father there had been friendship and he saluted him and said to him Whither now Replied Ali To Damietta I have friends there whom I would enquire after and visit them and then return The man took him home and treated him honourably then furnishing him with vivers for the voyage and giving him some gold pieces embarked him on board the vessel bound for Damietta When they reached it Ali landed not knowing whither to go but as he was walking along a merchant saw him and had pity on him and carried him to his house Here he abode awhile after which he said in himself How long this sojourning in other folk s homes Then he left the merchant s place and walked to the wharf where after enquiry he found a ship ready to sail for Syria His hospitable host provided him with provision and embarked him in the ship and it set sail and Ali reached in due season the Syrian shores where he disembarked and journeyed till he entered Damascus As he walked about the great thoroughfare behold a kindly man saw him and took him to his house where he tarried for a time till one day going abroad he saw a caravan about to start for Baghdad and bethought himself to journey thither with it Thereupon he returned to his host and taking leave of him set out with the Cafilah Now Allah extolled and exalted be He inclined to him the heart of one of the merchants so that he took him with him and Ali ate and drank with him till they came within one day s journey of Baghdad Here however a company of highwaymen fell upon the caravan and took all they had and but few of the merchants escaped These made each for a separate place of refuge but as for Ali the Cairene he fared for Baghdad where he arrived at sundown as the gatekeepers were about to shut the gates and said to them Let me in with you They admitted him and asked him Whence come and whither wending and he answered I am a man from Cairo city and have with me mules laden with merchandise and slaves and servants I forewent them to look me out a place wherein to deposit my goods but as I rode along on my she mule there fell upon me a company of banditti who took my mule and gear nor did I escape from them but at my last gasp The gate guard entreated him honourably and bade him be of good cheer saying Abide with us this night and in the morning we will look thee out a place befitting thee Then he sought in his breast pocket and finding a dinar of those given to him by the merchant at Bulak handed it to one of the gatekeepers saying Take this and change it and bring us something to eat The man took it and went to the market where he changed it and brought Ali bread and cooked meat so he ate he and the gate guards and he lay the night with them Now on the morrow one of the warders carried him to a certain of the merchants of Baghdad to whom he told the same story and he believed him deeming that he was a merchant and had with him loads of merchandise Then he took him up into his shop and entreated him with honour moreover he sent to his house for a splendid suit of his own apparel for him and carried him to the Hammam So quoth Ali of Cairo I went with him to the bath and when we came out he took me and brought me to his house where he set the morning meal before us and we ate and made merry Then said he to one of his black slaves Ho Mas dd take this thy lord show him the two houses standing in such a place and whichever pleaseth him give him the key of it and come back So I went with the slave till we came to a street road where stood three houses side by side newly built and yet shut up He opened the first and I looked at it and we did the same to the second after which he said to me Of which shall I give thee the key To whom doth the big house belong To us Open it that I may view it Thou hast no business there Wherefore Because it is haunted and none nighteth there but in the morning he is a dead man nor do we use to open the door when removing the corpse but mount the terrace roof of one of the other two houses and take it up thence For this reason my master hath abandoned the house and saith I will never again give it to any one Open it I cried that I may view it and I said in my mind This is what I seek I will pass the night there and in the morning be a dead man and be at peace from this my case So he opened it and I entered and found it a splendid house without its like and I said to the slave I will have none other than this house give me its key But he rejoined I will not give thee this key till I consult my master And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twenty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the negro continued Ali of Cairo rejoined I will not give thee its key till I consult my master and going to him reported The Egyptian trader saith I will lodge in none but the big house Now when the merchant heard this he rose and coming to Ali spake thus to him O my lord thou hast no need of this house But he answered I will lodge in none other than this for I care naught for this silly saying Quoth the other Write me an acknowledgment that if aught happen to thee I am not responsible Quoth Ali So be it whereupon the merchant fetched an assessor from the Kazi s court and taking the prescribed acknowledgment delivered to him the key wherewith he entered the house The merchant sent him bedding by a blackamoor who spread it for him on the built bench behind the door FN two hundred sixty eight and walked away Presently Ali went about and seeing in the inner court a well with a bucket let this down and drew water wherewith he made the lesser ablution and prayed the obligatory prayers Then he sat awhile till the slave brought him the evening meal from his master s house together with a lamp a candle and candlestick a basin and ewer and a gugglet FN two hundred sixty nine after which he left him and returned home Ali lighted the candle supped at his ease and prayed the night prayer and presently he said to himself Come take the bedding and go upstairs and sleep there twill be better than here So he took the bed and carried it upstairs where he found a splendid saloon with gilded ceiling and floor and walls cased with coloured marbles He spread his bed there and sitting down began to recite somewhat of the Sublime Koran when ere he was ware he heard one calling to him and asking O Ali O son of Hasan say me shall I send thee down the gold And he answered Where be the gold thou hast to send But hardly had he spoken when gold pieces began to rain down on him like stones from a catapult nor ceased till the saloon was full Then after the golden shower said the Voice Set me free that I may go my way for I have made an end of my service and have delivered unto thee that which was entrusted to me for thee Quoth Ali I adjure thee by Allah the Almighty to tell me the cause of this gold rain Replied the Voice This is a treasure that was talisman d to thee of old time and to every one who entered the house we used to come and say O Ali O son of Hasan shall we send thee down the gold Whereat he would be affrighted and cry out and we would come down to him and break his neck and go away But when thou camest and we accosted thee by thy name and that of thy father saying Shall we send thee down the gold and thou madest answer to us And where be the gold we knew thee for the owner of it and sent it down Moreover there is yet another hoard for thee in the land of Al Yaman and thou wouldst do well to journey thither and fetch it And now I would fain have thee set me free that I may go my way Said Ali By Allah I will not set thee free till thou bring me hither the treasure from the land of Al Yaman Said the Voice An I bring it to thee wilt thou release me and eke the servant of the other hoard Yes replied Ali and the Voice cried Swear to me So he swore to him and he was about to go away when Ali said to him I have one other need to ask of thee and he What is that Quoth Ali I have a wife and children at Cairo in such a place thou needs must fetch them to me at their ease and without their unease Quoth he I will bring them to thee in a mule litter FN two hundred seventy and much state with a train of eunuchs and servants together with the treasure from Al Yaman Inshallah FN two hundred seventy one Then he took of him leave of absence for three days when all this should be with him and vanished As soon as it was morning Ali went round about the saloon seeking a place wherein to store the gold and saw on the edge of the dais a marble slab with a turning pin so he turned the pin and the slab sank and showed a door which he opened and entering found a great closet full of bags of coarse stuff carefully sewn So he began taking out the bags and fell to filling them with gold and storing them in the closet till he had transported thither all the hoarded gold whereupon he shut the door and turning the pin the slab returned to its place Then he went down and seated himself on the bench behind the door and presently there came a knock so he opened and found the merchant s slave who seeing him comfortably sitting returned in haste to his master And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Twenty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the house owner s black slave returned and knocked at the door Ali the Cairene son of the merchant Hasan opened it to him and the negro seeing him comfortably sitting returned in haste to his master with the good tidings saying O my Lord the merchant who is lodged in the house inhabited by the Jinn FN two hundred seventy two is alive and well and sitteth on the bench behind the door Then the merchant rose joyfully and went to the house taking breakfast with him and when he saw Ali he embraced him and kissed him between the eyes asking How hath Allah dealt with thee and Ali answered Right well I slept upstairs in the marble saloon Quoth the merchant Did aught come to thee or didst thou see any thing and quoth Ali No I recited some little of the Sublime Koran and slept till morning when I arose and after making the minor ablution and praying seated myself on the bench behind the door Praised be Allah for safety exclaimed the merchant then left him and presently sent him black slaves and white Mamelukes and handmaidens with household gear They swept the house from top to bottom and furnished it with magnificent furniture after which three white slaves and three blacks and four slave girls remained with him to serve him while the rest returned to their master s house Now when the merchants heard of him they sent him presents of all manner things of price even to food and drink and clothes and took him with them to the market asking When will thy baggage arrive And he answered After three days it will surely come When the term had elapsed the servant of the first hoard the golden rain came to him and said Go forth and meet the treasure I have brought thee from Al Yaman together with thy Harim for I bring part of the wealth in the semblance of costly merchandise but the eunuchs and Mamelukes and the mules and horses and camels are all of the Jann Now the Jinni when he betook himself to Cairo found Ali s wife and children in sore misery naked and hungry so he carried them out of the city in a travelling litter and clad them in sumptuous raiment of the stuffs which were in the treasure of Al Yaman So when Ali heard this he arose and repairing to the merchants said to them Rise and go forth with us from the city to meet the caravan bringing my merchandise and honour us with the presence of your Harims to meet my Harim Hearkening and obedience answered they and sending for their Harims went forth all together and took seat in one of the city gardens and as they sat talking behold a dust cloud arose out of the heart of the desert and they flocked forth to see what it was Presently it lifted and discovered mules and muleteers tent pitchers and linkmen who came on singing and dancing till they reached the garden when the chief of the muleteers walked up to Ali and kissing his hand said to him O my master we have been long on the way for we purposed entering yesterday but we were in fear of the bandits so abode in our station four days till Almighty Allah rid us of them Thereupon the merchants mounted their mules and rode forward with the caravan the Harims waiting behind till Ali s wife and children mounted with them and they all entered in splendid train The merchants marvelled at the number of mules laden with chests whilst the women of the merchants wondered at the richness of the apparel of his wife and the fine raiment of her children and kept saying each to other Verily the King of Baghdad hath no such gear no nor any other of the kings or lords or merchants So they ceased not to fare forwards in high great state the men with Ali of Cairo and the Harims with his Harim till they came to the mansion And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that they ceased not to fare forwards in high state the men with Ali s men and the women with his wife till they came to the mansion where they alighted and brought the mules and their burdens into the midst of the courtyard Then they unloaded them and warehoused the goods whilst the merchants wives went up with Ali s family to the saloon which they found as it were a luxuriant garden spread with magnificent furniture They sat in mirth and good cheer till noon when they brought them up the midday meal all manner meats and sweetmeats of the very best and they ate and drank costly sherbets and perfumed themselves thereafter with rose water and scented woods Then they took leave and went home men and women and when the merchants returned to their places they sent presents to the husband according to their conditions and their wives likewise sent presents to the wife so that there came to them great store of handmaids and negroes and Mamelukes and all kinds of goods such as grain sugar and so forth in abundance beyond account As for the Baghdad merchant the landlord of the house he abode with Ali and quitted him not but said to him Let the black slaves and servants take the mules and the common cattle into one of my other houses to rest Quoth Ali They set out again to night for such a place Then he gave them leave to go forth and camp outside the city that they might start on their journey at night come whereupon hardly believing that they were dismissed they took leave of him and departing to the outliers of the city flew off through the air to their several abodes So Ali and his house owner sat together till a third of the night was past when their colloquy ended and the merchant returned to his own house and Ali went up to his wife and children and after saluting them said What hath befallen you in my absence all this time So she told him what they had suffered of hunger and nakedness and travail and he said Praised be Allah for safety How did ye come Answered she O my lord I was asleep with my children yesternight when suddenly and unexpectedly one raised us from the ground and flew with us through the firmament without doing us any hurt nor did he leave flying with us till he set us down in a place as it were an Arab camping ground where we saw laden mules and a travelling litter borne upon two great mules and around it servants all boys and men So I asked them Who are ye and what are these loads and where are we and they answered We are the servants of the merchant Ali of Cairo son of the merchant jeweller who hath sent us to fetch you to him at Baghdad Quoth I Tell me is it far or near hence to Baghdad They replied Near there lieth between us and the city but the darkness of the night Then they mounted us in the litter and when the morrow dawned we found ourselves with thee without having suffered any hurt whatever Quoth he Who gave you these dresses and quoth she The chief of the caravan opened one of the boxes on the mules and taking out thereof these clothes clad me and thy children each in a suit after which he locked the case and gave me the key saying Take care of it till thou give it to thy husband And here it is safe by me So saying she gave him the key and he said Dost thou know the chest Said she Yes I know it So he took her down to the magazine and showed her the boxes when she cried This is the one whence the dresses were taken upon which he put the key in the lock and opened the chest wherein he found much raiment and the keys of all the other cases So he took them and fell to opening them one after another and feasting his eyes upon the gems and precious ores they contained whose like was not found with any of the kings after which he locked them again took the keys and returned to the saloon saying to his wife This is of the bounty of Almighty Allah Then bringing her to the secret slab he turned the pin and opened the door of the closet into which he entered with her and showed her the gold he had laid up therein Quoth she Whence came all this to thee It came to me by the grace of my Lord answered he And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Ali s wife had looked upon the gold she said to him Whence came all this to thee It came to me by the grace of my Lord answered he When I left thee in my trouble I shipped at Bulak for Damietta and met a friend there who forwarded me to Damascus in brief he told her all that had befallen him from first to last Said she O my lord all this cometh by boon of thy father s blessing and orisons when he prayed for thee before his death saying I beseech Allah to cast thee into no straits except He grant thee ready relief So praised be Allah Almighty for that He hath brought thee deliverance and hath requited thee with more than went from thee But Allah upon thee O my lord return not to thy practice of associating with doubtful folk but look thou fear Allah whose name be exalted both in private and in public And as she went on to admonish him he said I accept thine admonition and beg the Almighty to remove the froward from amongst us and stablish us in His obedience and in the observance of the law and practice of His Prophet on whom be blessings and peace After that Ali and his wife and children were in all solace of life and gladness and he opened him a shop in the merchants bazar and stocking it with a somewhat of jewels and bullion sat therein with his children and white servants Presently he became the most considerable of the merchants of Baghdad and his report reached the King of that city FN two hundred seventy three who sent a messenger to command his attendance saying Answer the summons of the King who requireth thee He replied I hear and obey and straightway prepared his present and he took four trays of red gold and filling them with jewels and precious metals such as no King possessed went up to the palace and presenting himself before the presence kissed the ground between his hands and wished him endurance of goods and glory in the finest language he could command Said the King O merchant thou cheerest our city with thy presence and Ali rejoined O King of the age thy slave hath brought thee a gift and hopeth for acceptance thereof from thy favour Then he laid the four trays before the King who uncovered them and seeing that they contained gems whose fellows he possessed not and whose worth equalled treasuries of money said Thy present is accepted O merchant and Inshallah we will requite thee with its like And Ali kissed his hands and went away whereupon the King called his grandees and said to them How many of the Kings have sought my daughter in marriage Many answered they and he asked Hath any of them given me the like of this gift whereto they replied Not one for that none of them hath its like and he said I have consulted Allah Almighty by lot as to marrying my daughter to this merchant What say ye Be it as thou reckest answered they Then he bade the eunuch carry the four trays into his serraglio and going in to his wife laid them before her She uncovered them and seeing therein that whose like she possessed not no nor a fraction thereof said to him From which of the Kings hadst thou these perchance of one of the royalties that seek thy daughter in marriage Said he Not so I had them of an Egyptian merchant who is lately come to this our city Now when I heard of his coming I sent to command him to us thinking to make his acquaintance so haply we might find with him somewhat of jewels and buy them of him for our daughter s trousseau He obeyed our summons and brought us these four trays as a present and I saw him to be a handsome youth of dignified aspect and intelligent as elegant almost such as should be the sons of Kings Wherefore my heart inclined to him at sight and my heart rejoiced in him and I thought good to marry my daughter to him So I showed the gift to my grandees who agreed with me that none of the Kings hath the like of these and I told them my project But what sayst thou And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty second Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King of Baghdad after showing the presents to his wife and highly praising Ali the merchant jeweller and informing her of the proposed marriage asked But what sayst thou She replied O King of the age the ordering this affair is in Allah s hand and thine and whatso Allah willeth shall come to pass Rejoined the King If it be His will I will marry her to none other than this young man He slept on this resolve and on the morrow he went out to his Divan and summoned Ali and the rest of the merchants of Baghdad and when all came bade them be seated Then said he Bring me the Kazi of the Divan and they brought him whereupon the King said to him O Kazi write the contract of marriage between my daughter and the merchant Ali the Cairene But Ali said Thy pardon O our lord the Sultan It befitteth not that a trader such as I be the King s son in law Quoth the King It is my will to bestow this favour upon thee as well as the Wazirate and he invested him forthwith in the Wazir s office and ministerial robes Then Ali sat down in the chair of the Wazirate and said O King of the age thou hast bestowed on me this and indeed I am honoured by thy bounties but hear one word I have to say to thee He replied Say on and fear not Quoth Ali Since it is thine august resolution to marry thy daughter thou wouldst do better to marry her to my son Quoth the King Hast thou then a son and Ali replied Yes Send for him forthwith said the King Thereupon answered Ali Hearkening and obedience and despatched a servant to fetch his son who came and kissing the ground before the King stood in an attitude of respect The King looked at him and seeing him to be yet comelier than his daughter and goodlier than she in stature and proportion and brightness and perfection said to him What is thy name O my son My name is Hasan O our lord the Sultan replied the young man who was then fourteen years old Then the Sultan said to the Kazi Write the contract of marriage between my daughter Husn al Wujdd and Hasan son of the merchant Ali the Cairene So he wrote the marriage contract between them and the affair was ended in the goodliest fashion after which all in the Divan went their ways and the merchants followed the Wazir Ali escorting him to his house where they gave him joy of his advancement and departed Then he went in to his wife who seeing him clad in the Wazir s habit exclaimed What is this when he told her all that had passed from first to last and she joyed therein with exceeding joy So sped the night and on the morrow he went up to the Divan where the King received him with especial favour and seating him close by his side said O Wazir we purpose to begin the wedding festivities and bring thy son in to our daughter Replied Ali O our lord the Sultan whatso thou deemest good is good So the Sultan gave orders to celebrate the festivities and they decorated the city and held high festival for thirty days in all joy and gladness at the end of which time Hasan son of the Wazir Ali went in to the Princess and enjoyed her beauty and loveliness When the Queen saw her daughter s husband she conceived a warm affection for him and in like manner she rejoiced greatly in his mother Then the King bade build for his son in law Hasan Ali son a palace beside his own so they built him with all speed a splendid palace in which he took up his abode and his mother used to tarry with him some days and then go down to her own house After awhile the Queen said to her husband O King of the age Hasan s lady mother cannot take up her abode with her son and leave the Wazir neither can she tarry with the Wazir and leave her son Thou sayest sooth replied the King and bade edify a third palace beside that of Hasan which being done in a few days he caused remove thither the goods of the Wazir and the Minister and his wife took up their abode there Now the three palaces communicated with one another so that when the King had a mind to speak with the Wazir by night he would go to him or send to fetch him and so with Hasan and his father and mother On this wise they dwelt in all solace and in the greatest happiness And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King 
6346-60784-0000	train-other-500	that the King and the Wazir and his son ceased not to dwell in all solace and in the greatest happiness awhile till the King fell ill and his sickness grew on him So he summoned the lords of his realm and said to them
6346-60784-0001	train-other-500	There is come upon me a sore malady peradventure a mortal and I have therefore summoned you to consult you respecting a certain matter on which I would have you counsel me as you deem well They asked
6346-60784-0002	train-other-500	What is the matter of which thou wouldst take counsel with us O King and he answered I am old and sickly and I fear for the realm after me from its enemies
6346-60784-0003	train-other-500	so I would have you all agree upon some one that I may proclaim him King in my lifetime and so ye may be at ease Whereupon quoth they with one voice We all approve of thy daughter s husband Hasan
6346-60784-0004	train-other-500	son of the Wazir Ali for we have seen his wit and perfect understanding and he knoweth the place of all great and small Asked the King Are ye indeed agreed upon this and they answered Yes
none	none	 Rejoined he Peradventure ye all say this to my face of respect for me but behind my back ye will say otherwise However they all replied By Allah our word is one and the same in public and in private and we accept him frankly and with heartiness of heart and breadth of breast Quoth he Since the case is thus bring the Kazi of the Holy Law and all the Chamberlains and Viceroys and Officers of state before me to morrow and we will order the affair after the goodliest fashion We hear and we obey answered they and withdrawing notified all the Olema FN two hundred seventy four the doctors of the law and the chief personages among the Emirs So when the morrow dawned they came up to the Divan and having craved and obtained permission to enter they saluted the King saying Here are we all in thy presence Whereto he made reply O Emirs of Baghdad whom will ye have to be King over you after me that I may inaugurate him during my lifetime before the presence of you all Quoth they with one voice We are agreed upon thy daughter s husband Hasan son of the Wazir Ali Quoth he If it be so go all of you and bring him before me So they all arose and repairing to Hasan s palace said to him 
6346-60784-0005	train-other-500	Rise come with us to the King Wherefore asked he and they answered For a thing that will benefit both us and thee So he went in with them to the King and kissed the ground before his father in law who said to him
6346-60784-0006	train-other-500	Be seated O my son He sat down and the King continued
none	none	 O Hasan all the Emirs have approved of thee and agreed to make thee King over them after me 
6346-60784-0007	train-other-500	and it is my purpose to proclaim thee whilst I yet live and so make an end of the business But Hasan stood up and kissing the ground once more before the King said to him
none	none	 O our lord the King among the Emirs there be many who are older than I and greater of worth 
6346-60784-0008	train-other-500	acquit me therefore of this thing But all the Emirs cried out saying We consent not but that thou be King over us Then said Hasan My father is older than I and I and he are one thing
6346-60784-0009	train-other-500	and it befits not to advance me over him But Ali said I will consent to nothing save whatso contenteth my brethren and they have all chosen and agreed upon thee
6346-60784-0010	train-other-500	wherefore gainsay thou not the King s commandment and that of thy brethren And Hasan hung his head abashed before the King and his father Then said the King to the Emirs
none	none	 Do ye all accept of him We do answered they and recited thereupon seven Fatihahs FN two hundred seventy five So the King said O Kazi draw up a legal instrument testifying of these Emirs that they are agreed to make King over them my daughter s husband Hasan The Kazi wrote the act and made it binding on all men FN two hundred seventy six after they had sworn in a body the oath of fealty to Hasan Then the King did likewise and bade him take his seat on the throne of kingship whereupon they all arose and kissed King Hasan s hands and did homage to him and swore lealty to him And the new King dispensed justice among the people that day in fashion right royal and invested the grandees of the realm in splendid robes of honour When the Divan broke up he went in to and kissed the hands of his father in law who spake thus to him O my son 
6346-60784-0011	train-other-500	look thou rule the lieges in the fear of Allah

none	none	 It hath reached me O auspicious King 
6346-60784-0013	train-other-500	that when King Hasan was quit of the Divan
none	none	 he went in to and kissed the hands of his wife s father who spake thus to him O my son look thou rule the lieges in the fear of Allah whereto he replied O my father through thy prayers for me the grace and guidance of Allah will come to me Then he entered his own palace and was met by his wife and her mother and their attendants who kissed his hands and gave him joy of his advancement saying Be this day blessed Next he went in to his father and mother who joyed with exceeding joy in that which Allah had vouchsafed him of his advancement to the kingship and his father charged him to fear Allah and to deal mercifully with his subjects He passed the night in glee and gladness and on the morrow having prayed the obligatory prayers ending with the usual short chapters FN two hundred seventy seven of the Koran he went up to the Divan whither came all his officers and dignitaries He passed the day in dispensing justice among the folk bidding to graciousness and forbidding ungraciousness and appointing to place and displacing 
6346-60784-0014	train-other-500	till day end when the Divan broke up after the goodliest fashion and all the troops withdrew and each went his own way Then he arose and repaired to the palace where he found his father in law s sickness grown heavy upon him
6346-60784-0015	train-other-500	and said to him May no ill befal thee At this the old King opened his eyes and said
none	none	 O Hasan 
6346-60784-0016	train-other-500	and he replied At thy service O my lord Quoth the old King Mine appointed hour is at hand be thou careful of thy wife and her mother

6346-60784-0017	train-other-500	And King Hasan replied I hear and obey Now after this the old King lingered three days and then departed into the mercy of Almighty Allah So they laid him out
6346-60784-0018	train-other-500	and shrouded and buried him and held over him readings and perlections of the Koran to the end of the customary forty days And King Hasan son of the Wazir reigned in his stead and his subjects joyed in him
6346-60784-0019	train-other-500	and all his days were gladness moreover his father ceased not to be his chief Wazir on his right hand and he took to himself another Wazir to be at his left hand His reign was a prosperous and well ordered
6346-60784-0020	train-other-500	and he lived a long life as King of Baghdad and Allah blessed him by the old King s daughter with three sons who inherited the kingdom after him and they abode in the solace of life and its pleasures

6346-60784-0022	train-other-500	A man of the pilgrims once slept a long sleep and awaking found no trace of the caravan So he rose up and walked on
6346-60784-0023	train-other-500	but lost his way and presently came to a tent where he saw an old woman standing at the entrance and by her side a dog asleep He went up to the tent and saluting the old woman sought of her food when she replied
6346-60784-0024	train-other-500	Go to yonder Wady and catch thy sufficiency of serpents that I may broil of them for thee and give thee to eat Rejoined the pilgrim I dare not catch serpents nor did I ever eat them
none	none	 Quoth the old woman I will go with thee and catch some fear not So she went with him followed by the dog to the valley and catching a sufficient number of serpents proceeded to broil them He saw nothing for it saith the story teller but to eat in fear of hunger and exhaustion so he ate of the serpents FN two hundred seventy eight Then he was athirst and asked for water to drink and she answered Go to the spring and drink Accordingly he went to the spring and found the water thereof bitter yet needs must he drink of it despite its bitterness because of the violence of his thirst Presently he returned to the old woman and said to her I marvel O ancient dame at thy choosing to sojourn in this place And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty fifth Night She said it hath reached me O auspicious King 
6346-60784-0025	train-other-500	that when the palmer man drank the bitter draught for stress of thirst he returned and said I marvel O ancient dame at thy choosing to sojourn in this place and thy putting up with such meat and drink She asked And how is it then in thy country
none	none	 whereto he answered 
6346-60784-0026	train-other-500	In my country are houses wide and spacious and fruits ripe and delicious
none	none	 and waters sweet and viands savorous and of goodly use 
6346-60784-0027	train-other-500	and meats fat and full of juice and flocks innumerous and all things pleasant and all the goods of life the like whereof are not
none	none	 save in the Paradise which Allah the Omnipotent hath promised to His servants pious 
6346-60784-0028	train-other-500	Replied she All this have I heard but tell me have ye a Sultan who ruleth over you and is tyrannical in his rule and under whose hand you are one who if any of you commit an offence taketh his goods and ruineth him
none	none	 and who whenas he will turneth you out of house and home 
6346-60784-0029	train-other-500	and uprooteth you stock and branch Replied the man Indeed that may be
none	none	 and she rejoined If so by Allah these your delicious food and life of daintyhood and gifts however good 
6346-60784-0030	train-other-500	with tyranny and oppression are but a searching poison while our coarse meat which in freedom and safety we eat
none	none	 is a healthful medicine Hast thou not heard that the best of boons after Al Islam the true Faith are sanity and security FN two hundred seventy nine Now such boons quoth he who telleth the tale may be by the just rule of the Sultan Vice regent of Allah on His earth and the goodness of his polity The Sultan of time past needed but little awfulness for when the lieges saw him they feared him but the Sultan of these days hath need of the most accomplished polity and the utmost majesty because men are not as men of by gone time and this our age is one of folk opprobrious and is greatly calamitous noted for folly and hardness of heart and inclined to hate and enmity If therefore the Sultan which Almighty Allah forfend be weak or wanting in polity and majesty this will be the assured cause of his country s ruin Quoth the proverb 
6346-60784-0031	train-other-500	An hundred years of the Sultan s tyranny but not one year of the people s tyranny one over other When the lieges oppress one another Allah setteth over them a tyrannical Sultan and a terrible King
6346-60784-0032	train-other-500	Thus it is told in history that one day there was sent to Al Hajjaj bin Yusuf a slip of paper whereon was written Fear Allah and oppress not His servants with all manner of oppression When he read this
6346-60784-0033	train-other-500	he mounted the pulpit for he was eloquent and ever ready of speech and said O folk Allah Almighty hath made me ruler over you by reason of your frowardness
none	none	 And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hajjaj Yousuf son read the paper he mounted the pulpit and said O folk Allah Almighty hath made me ruler over you by reason of your frowardness and indeed though I die yet will ye not be delivered from oppression with these your ill deeds for the Almighty hath created like unto me many an one If it be not I twill be one more mischievous than I and a mightier in oppression and a more merciless in his majesty even as saith the poet FN two hundred eighty For not a deed the hand can try Save neath the hand of God on high Nor tyrant harsh work tyranny Uncrushed by tyrant harsh as he Tyranny is feared but justice is the best of all things We beg Allah to better our case And among tales is that of ABU AL HUSN AND HIS SLAVE GIRL TAWADDUD FN two hundred eighty one There was once in Baghdad a man of consequence and rich in monies and immoveables who was one of the chiefs of the merchants and Allah had largely endowed him with worldly goods but had not vouchsafed him what he longed for of offspring and there passed over him a long space of time without his being blessed with issue male or female His years waxed great his bones became wasted and his back bent weakness and weariness grew upon him and he feared the loss of his wealth and possessions seeing he had no child whom he might make his heir and by whom his name should be remembered So he betook himself with supplication to Almighty Allah 
6346-60784-0034	train-other-500	fasting by day and praying through the night Moreover he vowed many vows to the Living the Eternal and visited the pious and was constant in supplication
none	none	 to the Most Highest till He gave ear to him and accepted his prayer and took pity on his straining and complaining so that before many days were past he knew carnally one of his women and she conceived by him the same night In due time she finished her months and casting her burden bore a male child as he were a slice of the moon whereupon the merchant fulfilled his vows in his gratitude to Allah to whom be honour and glory and gave alms and clothed the widow and the orphan On the seventh night after the boy s birth he named him Abu al Husn FN two hundred eighty two and the wet nurses suckled him and the dry nurses dandled him and the servants and the slaves carried him and handled him till he shot up and grew tall and throve greatly and learnt the Sublime Koran and the ordinances of Al Islam and the Canons of the True Faith and calligraphy and poetry and mathematics and archery On this wise he became the union pearl of his age and the goodliest of the folk of his time and his day 
6346-60784-0035	train-other-500	fair of face and of tongue fluent
none	none	 carrying himself with a light and graceful gait and glorying in his stature proportionate and amorous graces which were to many a bait 
6346-60784-0036	train-other-500	and his cheeks were red and flower white was his forehead and his side face waxed brown with tender down even as saith one describing him The spring of the down on cheeks right clearly shows
none	none	 And how when the Spring is gone shall last the rose 
6346-60784-0037	train-other-500	Dost thou not see that the growth upon his cheek Is violet bloom that from its leaves outgrows He abode awhile in ease and happiness with his father who rejoiced and delighted in him till he came to man s estate

6346-60784-0040	train-other-500	Not long after he sickened and died
none	none	 so his son ordered his funeral FN two hundred eighty three after the goodliest wise and burying him returned to his house and sat mourning for him many days and nights But behold certain of his friends came in to him and said to him Whoso leaveth a son like thee is not dead indeed what is past is past and fled and mourning beseemeth none but the young maid and the wife cloistered And they ceased not from him till they wrought on him to enter the Hammam and break off his mourning And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Abu al Husn was visited by his friends and taken to the Hamman and persuaded to break off his mourning he presently forgot his father s charge and his head was turned by his riches he thought fortune would always wone with him as it was and that wealth would ever wax and never wane So he ate and drank and made merry and took his pleasure and gave gifts of gear and coin and was profuse with gold and addrest himself up to eating fowls and breaking the seals of wine flasks and listening to the giggle of the daughter of the vine as she gurgled from the flagon and enjoying the jingle of the singing girls nor did he give over this way of life till his wealth was wasted and the case worsened and all his goods went from him and he bit his hands FN two hundred eighty four in bitter penitence For of a truth he had nothing left after that which he had squandered but a concubine a slave girl whom his father had bequeathed to him with the rest of his estate and she had no equal in beauty and loveliness and brightness and liveliness and symmetric stature and perfect grace She was past mistress in every manner of arts and accomplishments and endowed with many excellences surpassing all the folk of her age and time She was grown more notorious than a way mark FN two hundred eighty five for her seductive genius and outdid the fair both in theory and practice and she was noted for her swimming gait flexile and delicate albeit she was full five feet in height and by all the boons of fortune deckt and dight with strait arched brows twain as they were the crescent moon of Sha aban FN two hundred eighty six and eyes like gazelles eyne and nose like the edge of scymitar fine and cheeks like anemones of blood red shine and mouth like Solomon s seal and sign and teeth like necklaces of pearls in line and navel holding an ounce of oil of benzoin and waist more slender than his body whom love hath wasted and whom concealment hath made sick with pine and hind parts heavier than two hills of sand briefly she was a volume of charms after his saying who saith Her fair shape ravisheth if face to face she did appear And if she turn for severance from her she slayeth sheer Sun like full moon like sapling like unto her character Estrangement no wise appertains nor cruelty austere Under the bosom of her shift the garths of Eden are And the full moon revolveth still upon her neck rings sphere FN two hundred eighty seven She seemed a full moon rising and a gazelle browsing a girl of nine plus five FN two hundred eighty eight shaming the moon and sun even as saith of her the sayer eloquent and ingenious Semblance of full moon Heaven bore When five and five are conjoined by four Tis not my sin if she made of me Its like when it riseth horizon o er FN two hundred eighty nine Clean of skin odoriferous of breath it seemed as if she were of fire fashioned and of crystal moulded rose red was the cheek of her and perfect the shape and form of her even as one saith of her describing her Scented with sandal FN two hundred ninety and musk right proudly doth she go With gold and silver and rose and saffron colour aglow A flower in a garden she is a pearl in an ouch of gold Or an image in chapel FN two hundred ninety one set for worship of high and low Slender and shapely she is vivacity bids her arise But the weight of her hips says Sit or softly and slowly go Whenas her favours I seek and sue for my heart s desire Be gracious her beauty says but her coquetry answers No Glory to Him who made beauty her portion and that Of her lover to be the prate of the censurers heigho FN two hundred ninety two She captivated all who saw her with the excellence of her beauty and the sweetness of her smile FN two hundred ninety three and shot them down with the shafts she launched from her eyes and withal she was eloquent of speech and excellently skilled in verse Now when Abu al Husn had squandered all his gold and his ill plight all could behold and there remained to him naught save this slave girl he abode three days without tasting meat or taking rest in sleep and the handmaid said to him O my lord carry me to the Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the slave girl to her master O my lord carry me to Harun al Rashid fifth of the sons of Abbas and seek of him to my price ten thousand dinars If he deem me dear say to him O Prince of True Believers my handmaid is worth more than this do but prove her and her value will be magnified in thine eyes for this slave girl hath not her equal and she were unfit to any but thou And she added Beware O my lord of selling me at less than the sum I have named indeed tis but little for the like of me Now her owner knew not her worth nor that she had no equal in her day but he carried her to the Caliph and set her in the presence and repeated what she had bidden him say The Caliph asked her What is thy name to which she answered My name is Tawaddud FN two hundred ninety four He then enquired O Tawaddud in what branches of knowledge dost thou excel and she replied O my lord I am versed in syntax and poetry and jurisprudence and exegesis and philosophy and I am skilled in music and the knowledge of the Divine ordinances and in arithmetic and geodesy and geometry and the fables of the ancients I know the Sublime Koran by heart and have read it according to the seven the ten and the fourteen modes I know the number of its chapters and versets and sections and words and its halves and fourths and eighths and tenths the number of prostrations which occur in it and the sum total of its letters and I know what there is in it of abrogating and abrogated FN two hundred ninety five also what parts of it were revealed at Al Medinah and what at Meccah and the cause of the different revelations I know the Holy Traditions of the Apostle s sayings historical and legendary the established and those whose ascription is doubtful and I have studied the exact sciences geometry and philosophy and medicine and logic and rhetoric and composition and I have learnt many things by rote and am passionately fond of poetry I can play the lute and know its gamut and notes and notation and the crescendo and diminuendo If I sing and dance I seduce and if I dress and scent myself I slay In fine I have reached a pitch of perfection such as can be estimated only by those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge FN two hundred ninety six Now when the Caliph heard these words spoken by one so young he wondered at her eloquence and turning to Abu al Husn said I will summon those who shall discuss with her all she claimeth to know if she answer correctly I will give thee the price thou askest for her and more and if not thou art fitter to have her than I With gladness and goodly gree O Commander of the Faithful replied Abu al Husn So the Caliph wrote to the Viceroy of Bassorah to send him Ibrahim bin Siyyar the prosodist who was the first man of his day in argument and eloquence and poetry and logic and bade him bring with him readers of the Koran and learned doctors of the law and physicians and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and philosophers and Ibrahim was more learned than all In a little while they arrived at the palace of the Caliphate knowing not what was to do and the Caliph sent for them to his sitting chamber and ordered them to be seated So they sat down and he bade bring the damsel Tawaddud who came and unveiling showed herself as she were a sparkling star FN two hundred ninety seven The Caliph set her a stool of gold and she saluted and speaking with an eloquent tongue said O Commander of the Faithful bid the Olema and the doctors of law and leaches and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and all here present contend with me in argument So he said to them I desire of you that ye dispute with this damsel on the things of her faith and stultify her argument in all she advanceth and they answered saying We hear and we obey Allah and thee O Commander of the Faithful Upon this Tawaddud bowed her head and said Which of you is the doctor of the law the scholar versed in the readings of the Koran and in the Traditions Quoth one of them I am the man thou seekest Quoth she Then ask me of what thou wilt Said the doctor Hast thou read the precious book of Allah and dost thou know its cancelling and cancelled parts and hast thou meditated its versets and its letters Yes answered she Then said he I will proceed to question thee of the obligations and the immutable ordinances so tell me of these O damsel and who is thy Lord who thy prophet who thy Guide what is thy point of fronting in prayer and who be thy brethren Also what thy spiritual path and what thy highway Whereto she replied Allah is my Lord and Mohammed whom Allah save and assain my prophet and the Koran is my guide and the Ka abah my fronting and the True believers are my brethren The practice of good is my path and the Sunnah my highway The Caliph again marvelled at her words so eloquently spoken by one so young and the doctor pursued O damsel with what do we know Almighty Allah Said she With the understanding Said he And what is the understanding Quoth she It is of two kinds natural and acquired And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Thirty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the damsel continued The understanding is of two kinds natural and acquired The natural is that which Allah to whom be honour and glory created for the right direction of His servants after His will and the acquired is that which men accomplish by dint of study and fair knowledge He rejoined Thou hast answered well Q Where is the seat of the understanding Allah casteth it in the heart whence its lustrous beams ascend to the brain and there become fixed Q How knowest thou the Prophet of Allah By the reading of Allah s Holy Book and by signs and proofs and portents and miracles Q What are the obligations and the immutable ordinances The obligations are five one

Q What deserveth he who neglecteth prayer It is reported among the authentic Traditions of the Prophet that he said Whoso neglecteth prayer wilfully and purposely hath no part in Al Islam And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fortieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that after the damsel had repeated the words of that Holy Tradition the doctor cried Thou hast replied aright now say me what is prayer Prayer is communion between the slave and his lord and in it are ten virtues one it illumineth the heart two it maketh the face shine three it pleaseth the Compassionate One four it angereth Satan five it conjureth calamity six it wardeth off the mischief of enemies seven it multiplieth mercy eight

of use unto men but their sinfulness is greater than their use FN four hundred six Hence quoth the poet O bibber of liquor art not ashamed To drink what Allah forbade thee drain Put it far from thee and approach it not It holds what Allah forbade as bane And quoth another to the same purport I drank the sin till my reason fled Ill drink that reason to loss misled As for the advantages that be

permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the damsel enumerated the benefits of cupping quoth the doctor What is the best time for cupping One should be cupped on the spittle that is in the morning before eating for this fortifieth the wit and the memory It is reported of the Prophet that when anyone complained to him of

Caliph s majesty then said By Allah O Commander of the Faithful it is not that I am at fault but that I am ashamed though indeed the answer is on the edge of my tongue Said the Caliph Speak O damsel whereupon said she Copulation hath in it many and exceeding virtues and praiseworthy qualities amongst which are that it lighteneth a body full of black bile and calmeth the heat of love and induceth affection and dilateth the heart and dispelleth the sadness of solitude and the excess of it is more harmful in summer and autumn than in spring and winter Q What are its good effects It banisheth trouble and disquiet calmeth love and wrath and is good for ulcers especially in a cold and dry humour on the other hand excess of it weakeneth the sight and engendereth pains in the legs and head and

Commander of the Faithful he hath questioned me till he is tired out and now I will ask him one question which if he answer not I will take his clothes as lawful prize And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty fourth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the damsel said to the Commander of the Faithful Verily he hath questioned me till he is tired out and now I will ask him one question which if he answer not I will take his clothes as lawful prize the Caliph cried Ask on So quoth she to the physician What is that thing which resembleth the earth in roundness whose resting place and whose spine are hidden from men s eyes little of price and estimation narrow of chest and shackled as to throat though it be nor runaway slave nor pestilent thief thrust through and through though not in fray and wounded though not in fight time eateth its vigour and water wasteth it away now it is beaten without blemish and then made to serve without stint united after separation submissive but not to him who caresseth it pregnant without child in belly drooping yet not leaning on its side becoming dirty yet purifying itself cleaving to its fere yet changing copulating without a yard wrestling without arms resting and taking its ease bitten yet not crying out now more complaisant than a cup companion and then more troublesome than summer heat leaving its mate by night and embracing her by day and having its abode in the corners of the mansions of the noble The physician was silent awhile in perplexity and his colour changed and he bowed his head and made no reply whereupon she said to him Ho sir doctor speak or doff thy dress At this he rose and said O Commander of the Faithful bear witness against me that this damsel is more learned than I in medicine and what else and that I cannot cope with her And he put off his clothes and fled forth Quoth the Caliph to Tawaddud Ree us thy riddle and she replied O Commander of the Faithful it is the button and the button loop FN four hundred fourteen Then she undertook the astronomers and said Let him of you who is an astronomer

who hath ordained the sun to shine by day and the moon for a light by night and hath appointed her station that ye might know the number of years and the computation of time FN four hundred sixteen The moon is Sultan of the night and the sun Sultan of the day and they vie with each other in their courses and follow without overtaking each other Quoth Almighty Allah It is not expedient that the sun overtake the moon in her course neither doth the night outstrip the day but each of these luminaries moveth in a peculiar orbit FN four hundred seventeen Q When the day cometh what becometh of the night and what of the day when the night cometh He causeth the night to enter in upon the day and He causeth the day to enter in upon the night FN four hundred eighteen Q Enumerate to me the mansions

fair answers he bethought him for a sleight to confound her before the Commander of the Faithful and said to her O damsel tell me will rain fall this month At this she bowed her head and pondered so long that the Caliph thought her at a loss for an answer and the astronomer said to her Why dost thou not speak Quoth she I will not speak except the Commander of the Faithful give me leave So the Caliph laughed and said How so Cried she I would have thee give me a sword that I may strike off his head for he is an Infidel an Agnostic an Atheist FN four hundred twenty one At this loud laughed

It is related of the Apostle that he said God spoke to Moses fifteen hundred and fifteen words Q Tell me of fourteen things that speak to the Lord of the Worlds The seven heavens and the seven earths when they say We come obedient to Thy command FN four hundred forty five And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Fifty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the damsel made the answer the philosopher continued Tell me of Adam and how he was first created and she said Allah created Adam of clay the clay He made of foam and the foam of the sea the sea of darkness darkness of light light of a fish the fish of a rock the rock of a ruby the ruby of water and the water He created by His Omnipotence

barred from every joy and bliss Who through the livelong night embracing lie They guard the folk from all calamities But with the rising sun apart they fly She answered The leaves of a door Quoth he Tell me of the gates of Gehenna Quoth she They are seven in number and their names are comprised in these two couplets Jahannam next Laza and third Hatim Then count Sa ir and Sakar eke five fold Sixth comes Jahim and Hawiyah the seventh Here are seven Hells in four lines briefly told Quoth he To what doth the poet refer when he saith She wears a pair of ringlets long let down Behind her as she

Quoth she A needle Q What is the length and what the breadth of the bridge Al Sirat Its length is three thousand years journey a thousand in descent and a thousand in ascent and a thousand level it is sharper than a sword and finer than a hair And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the damsel had described to him Al Sirat the philosopher said Inform me how many intercessions with Allah hath the Prophet for each soul FN four hundred forty seven Three Q Was Abu Bakr the first who embraced Al Islam Yes Q Yet Ali became a Moslem before him Ali came to the Prophet when he was a boy of seven years old for Allah vouchsafed him knowledge of the way of salvation in his tender youth so that he never prostrated himself to idols Quoth he Tell me which is the more excellent Ali or Abbas Now she knew that in propounding this question Ibrahim was laying a trap for her for if she said Ali is more excellent than Abbas she would lack excuse with the Caliph for undervaluing his ancestor so she bowed her head awhile now reddening then paling and lastly said Thou askest me of two excellent men each having his own excellence Let us return to what we were about When the Caliph Harun al Rashid heard her he stood up and said Thou hast spoken well by the Lord of the Ka abah O Tawaddud Then quoth Ibrahim the rhetorician What meaneth the poet when he saith Slim wasted one whose taste is sweetest sweet Likest a lance whereon no head we scan And all the lieges find it work them weal Eaten of afternoon in Ramazan She answered The sugar cane and he said Tell me of many things Asked she What are they and he said What is sweeter than honey what is sharper than the sword what is swifter than poison what is the delight of a moment and what the contentment of three days what is the pleasantest of days what is the joy of a week what is that debt the worst debtor denieth not what is the prison of the tomb what is the joy of the heart what is the snare of the soul what is death in life what is the disease that may not be healed what is the shame that may not be wiped off what is the beast that woneth not in cultivated fields but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong and violent beasts Quoth she Hear what I shall say in reply then put off thy clothes that I may explain to thee and the Caliph said Expound and he shall doff his clothes So she said Now that which is sweeter than honey is the love of pious children to their two parents that which is sharper than the sword is the tongue that which is swifter than poison is the Envier s eye the delight of a moment is carnal copulation and the contentment of three days is the depilatory for women the pleasantest of days is that of profit on merchandise the joy of a week is the bride the debt which the worst debtor denieth not is death the prison of the tomb is a bad son the joy of the heart is a woman obedient to her husband and it is said also that when fleshmeat descendeth upon the heart it rejoiceth therein the snare of the soul is a disobedient slave death in life is poverty the disease that may not be healed is an ill nature and the shame that may not be wiped away is an ill daughter lastly the beast that woneth not in cultivated fields but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong and violent beasts is the locust whose head is as the head of a horse its neck as the neck of the bull its wings as the wings of the vulture its feet as the feet of the camel its tail as the tail of the serpent its belly as the belly of the scorpion and its horns as the horns of the gazelle The Caliph was astounded at her quickness and understanding and said to the rhetorician Doff thy clothes So he rose up and cried I call all who are present in this assembly to witness that she is more learned than I and every other learned man And he put off his clothes and gave them to her saying Take them and may Allah not bless them to thee So the Caliph ordered him fresh clothes and said O Tawaddud there is one thing left of that for which thou didst engage namely chess And he sent for experts of chess and cards FN four hundred forty eight and trictrac The chess player sat down before her and they set the pieces and he moved and she moved but every move he made she speedily countered And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the damsel was playing chess with the expert in presence of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid whatever move he made was speedily countered by her till she beat him and he found himself checkmated Quoth he I did but lead thee on that thou mightest think thyself skilful but set up again and thou shalt see So they placed the pieces a second time when he said in himself Open thine eyes or she will beat thee And he fell to moving no piece save after calculation and ceased not to play till she said Thy King is dead Checkmate When he saw this he was confounded at her quickness and understanding but she laughed and said O professor I will make a wager with thee on this third game I will give thee the queen and the right hand castle and the left hand knight if thou beat me take my clothes and if I beat thee I will take thy clothes Replied he I agree to this and they replaced the pieces she removing queen castle and knight FN four hundred forty nine Then said she Move O master So he moved saying to himself I cannot but beat her with such odds and planned a combination but behold she moved on little by little till she made one of her pawns FN four hundred fifty a queen and pushing up to him pawns and other pieces to take off his attention set one in his way and tempted him to take it Accordingly he took it and she said to him The measure is meted and the loads equally balanced FN four hundred fifty one Eat till thou are over full naught shall be thy ruin O son of Adam save thy greed Knowest thou not that I did but tempt thee that I might finesse thee See this is check mate adding So doff off thy clothes Quoth he Leave me my bag trousers so Allah repay thee and he swore by Allah that he would contend with none so long as Tawaddud abode in the realm of Baghdad Then he stripped off his clothes and gave them to her and went away Thereupon came the backgammon player and she said to him If I beat thee this day what wilt thou give me Quoth he I will give thee ten suits of brocade of Constantinople figured with gold and ten suits of velvet and a thousand gold pieces and if I beat thee I ask nothing but that thou write me an acknowledgment of my victory Quoth she To it then and do thy best So they played and he lost and went away chattering in Frankish jargon and saying By the bounty of the Commander of the Faithful there is not her like in all the regions of the world Then the Caliph summoned players on instruments of music and asked her Dost thou know aught of music when she answered Even so He bade bring a worn lute polished by use whose owner forlorn and lone was by parting trodden down and of which quoth one describing it Allah watered a land and upsprang a tree Struck root deep down and raised head a sky The birds o ersang it when green its wood And the Fair o ersing now the wood is dry So they brought the lute in a bag of red satin with tassels of saffron coloured silk and she opened the bag and took it out and behold on it was graven Oft hath a tender bough made lute for maid whose swift sweet lays at feast men s hearts invade She sings it follows on her song as though The Bulbuls FN four hundred fifty two taught her all the modes she played She laid her lute in her lap and with bosom inclining over it bent to it with the bending of a mother who suckleth her child then she preluded in twelve different modes till the whole assembly was agitated with delight like a waving sea and she sang the following Cut short this strangeness leave unruth of you My heart shall love you aye by youth of you Have ruth on one who sighs and weeps and moans Pining and yearning for the troth of you The Caliph was ravished and exclaimed Allah bless thee and be merciful to him who taught thee whereupon she rose and kissed the ground before him Then he sent for money and paid her master Abu al Husn an hundred thousand gold pieces to her price after which he said to her O Tawaddud ask a boon of me Replied she I ask of thee that thou restore me to my lord who sold me Tis well answered the Caliph and restored her to her master and gave her five thousand dinars for herself Moreover he appointed Abu al Husn one of his cup companions for a permanence And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Caliph gave the damsel five thousand dinars for herself and restored her to her master whom he appointed one of his cup companions for a permanence and assigned him a monthly stipend of a thousand dinars so long as he should live and he abode with the damsel Tawaddud in all solace and delight of life Marvel then O King at the eloquence of this damsel and the hugeness of her learning and understanding and her perfect excellence in all branches of art and science and consider the generosity of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al Rashid in that he gave her master this money and said to her Ask a boon of me and she besought him to restore her to her lord So he restored her to him and gave her five thousand dinars for herself and made him one of his boon companions Where is such generosity to be found after the Abbaside Caliphs May Allah Almighty have mercy upon them one and all And they tell a tale of THE ANGEL OF DEATH WITH THE PROUD KING AND THE DEVOUT MAN It is related O auspicious King that one of the olden monarchs was once minded to ride out in state with the Officers of his realm and the Grandees of his retinue and display to the folk the marvels of his magnificence So he ordered his Lords and Emirs equip them therefor and commanded his keeper of the wardrobe to bring him of the richest of raiment such as befitted the King in his state and he bade them bring his steeds FN four hundred fifty three of the finest breeds and pedigrees every man heeds which being done he chose out of the raiment what rejoiced him most and of the horses that which he deemed best and donning the clothes together with a collar set with margarites and rubies and all manner jewels mounted and set forth in state making his destrier prance and curvet among his troops and glorying in his pride and despotic power And Iblis came to him and laying his hand upon his nose blew into his nostrils the breath of hauteur and conceit so that he magnified and glorified himself and said in his heart Who among men is like unto me And he became so puffed up with arrogance and self sufficiency and so taken up with the thought of his own splendour and magnificence that he would not vouchsafe a glance to any man Presently there stood before him one clad in tattered clothes and saluted him but he returned not his salam whereupon the stranger laid hold of his horse s bridle Lift thy hand cried the King thou knowest not whose bridle rein it is whereof thou takest hold Quoth the other I have a need of thee Quoth the King Wait till I alight and then name thy need Rejoined the stranger It is a secret and I will not tell it but in thine ear So the King bowed his head to him and he said I am the Angel of Death and I purpose to take thy soul Replied the King Have patience with me a little whilst I return to my house and take leave of my people and children and neighbours and wife By no means so answered the Angel thou shalt never return nor look on them again for the fated term of thy life is past So saying he took the soul of the King who fell off his horse s back dead and departed thence Presently the Death Angel met a devout man of whom Almighty Allah had accepted and saluted him He returned the salute and the Angel said to him O pious man I have a need of thee which must be kept secret Tell it in my ear quoth the devotee and quoth the other I am the Angel of Death Replied the man Welcome to thee and praised be Allah for thy coming I am aweary of awaiting thine arrival for indeed long hath been thine absence from the lover which longeth for thee Said the Angel If thou have any business make an end of it but the other answered saying There is nothing so urgent to me as the meeting with my Lord to whom be honour and glory And the Angel said How wouldst thou fain have me take thy soul I am bidden to take it as thou willest and choosest He replied Tarry till I make the Wuzu ablution and pray and when I prostrate myself then take my soul while my body is on the ground FN four hundred fifty four Quoth the Angel Verily my Lord be He extolled and exalted commanded me not to take thy soul but with thy consent and as thou shouldst wish so I will do thy will Then the devout man made the minor ablution FN four hundred fifty five and prayed and the Angel of Death took his soul in the act of prostration and Almighty Allah transported it to the place of mercy and acceptance and forgiveness And they tell another tale of THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND THE RICH KING A certain King had heaped up coin beyond count and gathered store of all precious things which Allah the Most Highest hath created So in order that he might take his pleasure whenas he should find leisure to enjoy all this abounding wealth he had collected he built him a palace wide and lofty such as befitteth and beseemeth Kings and set thereto strong doors and appointed for its service and its guard servants and soldiers and doorkeepers to watch and ward One day he bade the cooks dress him somewhat of the goodliest of food and assembled his household and retainers and boon companions and servants to eat with him and partake of his bounty Then he sat down upon the sofa of his kingship and dominion and propping his elbow upon the cushion addressed himself saying O soul thou hast gathered together all the wealth of the world so now take thy leisure therein and eat of this good at thine ease in long life and prosperity ever rife And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that hardly had the King made an end of saying to himself Eat of this weal at thine ease in long life and prosperity ever rife when a man clad in tattered raiment with an asker s wallet hanging at his neck as he were one who came to beg food knocked with the door ring a knock so loud and terrible that the whole palace shook as with quake of earth and the King s throne trembled The servants were affrighted and rushed to the door and when they saw the man who had knocked they cried out at him saying Woe to thee what manner of unmannerly fashion be this Wait till the King eateth and we will then give thee of what is left Quoth he Tell your lord to come out and speak with me for I have of him a pressing need and a matter to heed They cried Away fool who art thou that we should bid our lord come forth to thee But he said Tell him of this So they went in and told the King who said Did ye not rebuke him and draw upon him and threaten him Now as he spoke behold there came another knock at the gate louder than the first knock whereupon the servants sprang at the stranger with staves and weapons to fall upon him and slay him but he shouted at them saying Bide in your steads for I am the Angel of Death Hereat their hearts quaked and their wits forsook them their understandings were in confusion their side muscles quivered in perturbation and their limbs lost the power of motion Then said the King to them Tell him to take a substitute FN four hundred fifty six in my place and one to relieve me in this case But the Angel answered saying I will take no substitute and I come not but on thine account to cause separation between thee and the goods thou hast gathered together and the riches thou hast heaped up and entreasured When the King heard this he wept and groaned saying Allah curse the treasure which hath deluded and undone me and diverted me from the service of my Lord I deemed it would profit me but to day it is a regret for me and a calamity to me and behold I go forth empty handed of it and leave it to my foes Thereupon Allah caused the Treasure to speak out and it said Wherefore cursest thou me FN four hundred fifty seven Curse thyself for Allah created both me and eke thyself of the dust and appointed me to be in thine hand that thou mightest provide thee with me a viaticum for the next world and give alms with me to the poor and the needy and the sick and build mosques and hospices and bridges and aqueducts so might I be an aidance unto thee in the world to come But thou didst garner me and hoard me up and on thine own vanities bestowedst me neither gavest thou thanks for me as was due but wast ungrateful to me and now thou must leave me to thy foes and thou hast naught save thy regretting and thy repenting But what is my sin that thou shouldest revile me Then the Angel of Death took the King s soul as he sat on his throne before he ate of the food and he fell down dead Quoth Allah Almighty While they were rejoicing for that which had been given them we suddenly laid hold on them and behold they were seized with despair FN four hundred fifty eight And they tell another tale of THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND THE KING OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL There was a puissant despot among the Kings of the Banu Israil who sat one day upon the throne of his kingship when he saw come in to him by the gate of the hall a man of forbidding aspect and horrible presence The King was affrighted at his sudden intrusion and his look terrified him so he sprang up before him and said Who art thou O man Who gave thee leave to come in to me and who invited thee to enter my house Quoth the stranger Verily the Lord of the House sent me to thee nor can any doorkeeper exclude me nor need I leave to come in to Kings for I reck not of a Sultan s majesty neither of the multitude of his guards I am he from whom no tyrant is at rest nor can any man escape from my grasp I am the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies Now when the King heard this a palsy crept over him FN four hundred fifty nine and he fell on his face in a swoon but presently coming to himself he asked Art thou then the Angel of Death and the stranger answered Yes I conjure thee by Allah quoth the King grant me one single day s respite that I may pray pardon of my sins and ask absolution of my Lord and restore to their rightful owners the monies which are in my treasures so I may not be burdened with the woe of a reckoning nor with the misery of punishment therefor Replied the Angel Well away well away this may be in no way And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth the Death messenger to the King Well away well away this may be in no way How can I grant thee a reprieve when the days of thy life are counted and thy breaths numbered and thy moments fixed and written Grant me an hour asked the King but the Angel answered saying The hour was in the account and hath sped and thou unheeding aught and hath fled and thou taking no thought and now thy breathings are accomplished and there remaineth to thee but one breath Quoth the King Who will be with me when I am transported to my tomb Quoth the Angel Naught will be with thee but thy works good or evil I have no works said the King and the Angel Doubtless thy long home will be in hell fire and thy doom the wrath of the Almighty Then he seized the soul of the King and he fell off his throne and dropped on the earth dead And there arose a mighty weeping and wailing and clamour of keening for him among the people of his court and had they known that to which he went of the wrath of his Lord their weeping for him had been sorer and their wailing louder and more abounding And a story is told of ISKANDAR ZU AL KARNAYN FN four hundred sixty AND A CERTAIN TRIBE OF POOR FOLK It is related that Iskandar Zu al Karnayn FN four hundred sixty one once came in his journeyings upon a tribe of small folk who owned naught of the weals of the world and who dug their graves over against the doors of their houses and were wont at all times to visit them and sweep the earth from them and keep them clean and pray at them and worship Almighty Allah at them and they had no meat save grasses and the growth of the ground So Iskandar sent a man to summon their King but he refused to come saying I have no need of him Thereupon Iskandar went to him and said How is it with you and what manner of men are ye for I see with you forsooth naught of gold or silver nor find I with you aught of the weals of the world Answered the King None hath his fill of the weals of the world Iskandar then asked Why do you dig your graves before your house doors and the King answered That they may be the prospective of our eye glances so we may look on them and ever renew talk and thought of death neither forget the world to come and on this wise the love of the world be banished from our hearts and we be not thereby distracted from the service of our Lord the Almighty Quoth Iskandar Why do ye eat grasses and the other replied Because we abhor to make our bellies the tombs of animals and because the pleasure of eating outstrippeth not the gullet Then putting forth his hand he brought out a skull of a son of Adam and laying it before Iskandar said O Zu al Karnayn Lord of the Two Horns knowest thou who owned this skull Quoth he Nay and quoth the other He who owned this skull was a King of the Kings of the world who dealt tyrannously with his subjects specially wronging the weak and wasting his time in heaping up the rubbish of this world till Allah took his sprite and made the fire his abiding site and this is his head He then put forth his hand and produced another skull and laying it before Iskandar said to him Knowest thou this No answered the conqueror and the other rejoined This is the skull of another King who dealt justly by his lieges and was kindly solicitous for the folk of his realm and his dominions till Allah took his soul and lodged him in His Garden and made high his degree in Heaven Then laying his hands on Iskandar s head he said Would I knew which of these two art thou Whereupon Iskandar wept with sore weeping and straining the King to his bosom cried If thou be minded to company with me I will commit to thee as Wazir the government of my affairs and share with thee my kingdom Cried the other Well away well away I have no mind to this And why so asked Iskandar and the King answered Because all men are thy foes by reason of the wealth and the worlds thou hast won while all men are my true friends because of my contentment and pauperdom for that I possess nothing neither covet aught of the goods of life I have no desire to them nor wish for them neither reck I aught save contentment So Iskandar pressed him to his breast and kissed him between the eyes and went his way FN four hundred sixty two And among the tales they tell is one concerning THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF KING ANUSHIRWAN FN four hundred sixty three It is told of Anushirwan the Just King that once upon a time he feigned himself sick and bade his stewards and intendants go round about the provinces of his empire and the quarters of his dominion and seek him out a mud brick thrown away from some ruined village that he might use it as medicine informing his intimates that the leaches had prescribed this to him So they went the round of the provinces of his reign and of all the lands under his sway and said to him on return In all the realm we have found nor ruined site nor castaway mud brick At this Anushirwan rejoiced and rendered thanks to the Lord saying I was but minded to try my kingdom and prove mine empire that I might know if any place therein remained ruined and deserted so I might rebuild and repeople it but since there be no place in it but is inhabited the affairs of the reign are best conditioned and its ordinance is excellent and its populousness FN four hundred sixty four hath reached the pitch of perfection And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the high officials returned and reported We have found in the empire nor ruined site nor rotten brick the Just King thanked his God and said Verily the affairs of the realm are best conditioned and its ordinance is excellent and its populousness hath reached the pink of perfection And ken thou O King continued Shahrazad that these olden Kings strave not and toiled not for the peopling of their possessions but because they knew that the more populous a country is the more abundant is that which is desired therein and because they wist the saying of the wise and the learned to be true without other view namely Religion dependeth on the King the King on the troops the troops on the treasury the treasury on the populousness of the country and its prosperity on the justice done to the lieges Wherefore they upheld no one in tyranny or oppression neither suffered their dependants and suite to work injustice knowing that kingdoms are not established upon tyranny but that cities and places fall into ruin when oppressors are set as rulers over them and their inhabitants disperse and flee to other governments whereby ruin falleth upon the realm the imports fail the treasuries become empty and the pleasant lives of the subjects are perturbed for that they love not a tyrant and cease not to offer up successive prayers against him so that the King hath no ease of his kingdom and the vicissitudes of fortune speedily bring him to destruction And they tell a tale concerning THE JEWISH KAZI AND HIS PIOUS WIFE Among the Children of Israel one of the Kazis had a wife of surpassing beauty constant in fasting and abounding in patience and long suffering and he being minded to make the pilgrimage to Jerusalem appointed his own brother Kazi in his stead during his absence and commended his wife to his charge Now this brother had heard of her beauty and loveliness and had taken a fancy to her So no sooner was his brother gone than he went to her and sought her love favours but she denied him and held fast to her chastity The more she repelled him the more he pressed his suit upon her till despairing of her and fearing lest she should acquaint his brother with his misconduct whenas he should return he suborned false witnesses to testify against her of adultery and cited her and carried her before the King of the time who adjudged her to be stoned So they dug a pit and seating her therein stoned her till she was covered with stones and the man said Be this hole her grave But when it was dark a passer by making for a neighbouring hamlet heard her groaning in sore pain and pulling her out of the pit carried her home to his wife whom he bade dress her wounds The peasant woman tended her till she recovered and presently gave her her child to be nursed and she used to lodge with the child in another house by night Now a certain thief saw her and lusted after her So he sent to her seeking her love favours but she denied herself to him wherefore he resolved to slay her and making his way into her lodging by night and she sleeping thought to strike at her with a knife but it smote the little one and killed it Now when he knew his misdeed fear overtook him and he went forth the house and Allah preserved from him her chastity But as she awoke in the morning she found the child by her side with throat cut and presently the mother came and seeing her boy dead said to the nurse Twas thou didst murther him Therewith she beat her a grievous beating and purposed to put her to death but her husband interposed and delivered the woman saying By Allah thou shalt not do on this wise So the woman who had somewhat of money with her fled forth for her life knowing not whither she should wend Presently she came to a village where she saw a crowd of people about a man crucified to a tree stump but still in the chains of life What hath he done she asked and they answered He hath committed a crime which nothing can expiate but death or the payment of such a fine by way of alms So she said to them Take the money and let him go and when they did so he repented at her hands and vowed to serve her for the love of Almighty Allah till death should release him Then he built her a cell and lodged her therein after which he betook himself to woodcutting and brought her daily her bread As for her she was constant in worship so that there came no sick man or demoniac to her but she prayed for him and he was straightway healed And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the woman s cell was visited by folk and she constant in worship it befel by decree of the Almighty that He sent down upon her husband s brother the same who had caused her to be stoned a cancer in the face and smote the villager s wife the same who had beaten her with leprosy and afflicted the thief the same who had murthered the child with palsy Now when the Kazi returned from his pilgrimage he asked his brother of his wife and he told him that she was dead whereat he mourned sore and accounted her with her Maker After awhile very many folk heard of the pious recluse and flocked to her cell from all parts of the length and breadth of the earth whereupon said the Kazi to his brother O my brother wilt thou not seek out yonder pious woman Haply Allah shall decree thee healing at her hands and he replied O my brother carry me to her Moreover the husband of the leprous woman heard of the pious devotee and carried his wife to her as did also the people of the paralytic thief and they all met at the door of the hermitage Now she had a place wherefrom she could look out upon those who came to her without their seeing her and they waited till her servant came when they begged admittance and obtained permission Presently she saw them all and recognized them so she veiled and cloaked face and body and went out and stood in the door looking at her husband and his brother and the thief and the peasant woman but they could not recognize her Then said she to them Ho folk ye shall not be relieved of what is with you till ye confess your sins for when the creature confesseth his sins the Creator relenteth towards him and granteth him that wherefore he resorteth to him Quoth the Kazi to his brother O my brother repent to Allah and persist not in thy frowardness for it will be more helpful to thy relief And the tongue of the case spake this speech This day oppressor and oppressed meet And Allah sheweth secrets we secrete This is a place where sinners low are brought And Allah raiseth saint to highest seat Our Lord and Master shows the truth right clear Though sinner froward be or own defeat Alas FN four hundred sixty five for those who rouse the Lord to wrath As though of Allah s wrath they nothing weet O whoso seekest honours know they are From Allah and His fear with love entreat Saith the relator Then quoth the brother Now I will tell the truth I did thus and thus with thy wife and he confessed the whole matter adding And this is my offence Quoth the leprous woman As for me I had a woman with me and imputed to her that of which I knew her to be guiltless and beat her grievously and this is my offence And quoth the paralytic And I went in to a woman to kill her after I had tempted her to commit adultery and she had refused and I slew a child that lay by her side and this is my offence Then said the pious woman O my God even as Thou hast made them feel the misery of revolt so show them now the excellence of submission for Thou over all things art Omnipotent And Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might made them whole Then the Kazi fell to looking on her and considering her straitly till she asked him why he looked so hard and he said I had a wife and were she not dead I had said thou art she Hereupon she made herself known to him and both began praising Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might for that which He had vouchsafed them of the reunion of their loves but the brother and the thief and the villager s wife joined in imploring her forgiveness So she forgave them one and all and they worshipped Allah in that place and rendered her due service till Death parted them And one of the Sayyids FN four hundred sixty six hath related this tale of THE SHIPWRECKED WOMAN AND HER CHILD I was circuiting the Ka abah one dark night when I heard a plaintive voice speaking from a contrite heart and saying O Bountiful One Thy past boon Indeed by my heart shall Thy covenant never be undone Hearing this voice my heart fluttered so that I was like to die but I followed the sound and behold it came from a woman to whom I said Peace be with thee O handmaid of Allah whereto she replied And with thee be peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings Quoth I I conjure thee by Allah the Most Great tell me what is the covenant to which thy heart is constant Quoth she But that thou adjurest me by the Omnipotent I would not tell thee my secrets See what is before me So I looked and lo there was a child lying asleep before her and breathing heavily in his slumber Said she Know that I set forth being big with this boy to make the pilgrimage to this House and took passage in a ship but the waves rose against us and the winds blew contrary and the vessel broke up I saved myself on a plank and on that bit of wood I gave birth to this child and while he lay on my bosom and the waves beating upon me And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the woman continued Now while the boy lay on my bosom and the waves beat upon me there swam up to me one of the sailors who climbed on the plank and said By Allah I desired thee whilst thou wast yet in the ship and now I have come at thee so yield thy body to me or I will throw thee into the sea Said I Out on thee hast thou no memory of that which thou hast seen and is it no warning to thee Quoth he I have seen the like of this many a time and come off safe and care not Quoth I O fellow we are now in a calamity whence we hope to be delivered by obedience to Allah and not by disobedience But he persisted with me and I feared him and thought to put him off so I said to him Wait till this babe shall sleep but he took the child off my lap and threw him into the sea Now when I saw this desperate deed my heart sank and sorrow was sore upon me so I raised my eyes heavenwards and said O Thou that interposest between a man and his heart intervene between me and this leonine brute for Thou over all things art Omnipotent And by Allah hardly had I spoken when a beast rose out of the sea and snatched him off the plank When I saw myself alone my sorrows redoubled and my grief and longing for my child and I recited My coolth of eyes the darling child of me Is lost and racked my heart with agony My body wrecked and red hot coals of love Burning my liver with sore pangs I see In this my sorrow shows no gleam of joy Save Thy high grace and my expectancy Hast seen O Lord what unto me befel My son aye lost and parting pangs I dree Take ruth on us and make us meet again For now my stay and only hope s in Thee I abode in this condition a day and a night and when morning dawned I caught sight of the sails of a vessel shining afar off nor did the waves cease to drive me and the winds to waft me on till I reached the ship whose sails I had sighted The sailors took me up and I looked and behold my babe was amongst them so I threw myself upon him and said O folk this is my child how and whence came ye by him Quoth they Whilst we were sailing along the seas the ship suddenly stood still and lo that which stayed us was a beast as it were a great city and this babe on its back sucking his thumbs So we took him up Now when I heard this I told them my tale and all that had betided me and returned thanks to my Lord for His goodness and vowed to Him that never whilst I lived would I stir from His House nor swerve from His service and since then I have never asked of Him aught but He hath given it me Now when she had made an end of her story quoth the Sayyid I put my hand to my alms pouch and would have given to her but she exclaimed Away from me thou idle man Have I not told thee of His mercies and the graciousness of His dealings and shall I take an alms from other than His hand And I could not prevail with her to accept aught of me so I left her and went away reciting these couplets How many boons conceals the Deity Eluding human sight in mystery How many graces come on heels of stresses And fill the burning heart with jubilee How many a sorrow in the morn appears And turns at night tide into gladdest gree If things go hard with thee some day yet trust Th Eterne th Almighty God of Unity And pray the Prophet that he intercede Through intercession every wish shalt see And she left not the service of her Lord cleaving unto His House till death came to her And a tale is also told by Malik bin Dinar FN four hundred sixty seven Allah have mercy on him of THE PIOUS BLACK SLAVE We were once afflicted with drought at Bassorah and went forth sundry times to pray for rain but saw no sign of our prayers being accepted So I went I and Itaa al Salami and Sabit al Banani and Naja al Bakaa and Mohammed bin Wasi a and Ayyub al Sukhtiyani and Habib al Farsi and Hassan bin Abi Sinan and Otbah al Ghulam and Salih al Muzani FN four hundred sixty eight till we reached the oratory FN four hundred sixty nine when the boys came out of the schools and we prayed for rain but saw no sign of acceptance So about mid day the people went away and I and Sabit al Banani tarried in the place of prayer till nightfall when we saw a black of comely face slender of shank FN four hundred seventy and big of belly approach us clad in a pair of woollen drawers if all he wore had been priced it would not have fetched a couple of dirhams He brought water and made the minor ablution then going up to the prayer niche prayed two inclinations deftly his standing and bowing and prostration being exactly similar in both Then he raised his glance heavenwards and said O my God and my Lord and Master how long wilt Thou reject Thy servants in that which offereth no hurt to Thy sovereignty Is that which is with Thee wasted or are the treasuries of Thy Kingdom annihilated I conjure Thee by Thy love to me forthwith to pour out upon us Thy rain clouds of grace He spake and hardly had he made an end of speaking when the heavens clouded over and there came a rain as if the mouths of waterskins had been opened and when we left the oratory we were knee deep in water And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that hardly had he spoken when the heavens clouded over and there came a rain as if the mouths of waterskins had been opened And when we left the oratory we were knee deep in water and we were lost in wonder at the black So I accosted him and said to him Woe to thee O black art thou not ashamed of what thou saidst He turned to me and asked What said I and I Thy saying to Allah By Thy love of me and what giveth thee to know that He loveth thee Replied he Away from me O thou distracted by the world from the care of thine own soul Where was I when He gave me strength to profess the unity of the Godhead and vouchsafed unto me the knowledge of Him How deemest thou that He aided me thus except of His love to me adding Verily His love to me is after the measure of my love to Him Quoth I Tarry awhile with me so may Allah have mercy on thee But he said I am a chattel and the Book enjoineth me to obey my lesser master So we followed him afar off till we saw him enter the house of a slave broker Now the first half of the night was past and the last half was longsome upon us so we went away but next morning we repaired to the slave dealer and said to him Hast thou a lad to sell us for service He answered Yes I have an hundred lads or so and they are all for sale Then he showed us slave after slave till he had shown us some seventy but my friend was not amongst them and the dealer said These are all I have But as we were going out from him we saw a ruinous hut behind his house and going in behold we found the black standing there I cried Tis he by the Lord of the Ka abah and turning to the dealer said to him Sell me yonder slave Replied he O Abu Yahya this is a pestilent unprofitable fellow who hath no concern by night but weeping and by day but repentance I rejoined It is for that I want him So the dealer called him and he came out showing drowsiness Quoth his master Take him at thine own price so thou hold me free of all his faults I bought him for twenty dinars and asked What is his name and the dealer answered Maymun the monkey and I took him by the hand and went out with him intending to go home but he turned to me and said O my lesser lord why and wherefore didst thou buy me By Allah I am not fit for the service of God s creatures Replied I I bought thee that I might serve thee myself and on my head be it Asked he Why so and I answered Wast thou not in company with us yesterday in the place of prayer Quoth he And didst thou hear me and quoth I It was I accosted thee yesterday and spoke with thee Thereupon he advanced till we came to a mosque where he entered and prayed a two bow prayer after which he said O my God and my Lord and Master the secret that was between me and Thee Thou hast discovered unto Thy creatures and hast brought me to shame before the worldling How then shall life be sweet to me now that other than Thou hath happened upon that which is between Thee and me I conjure Thee to take my soul to Thee forthright FN four hundred seventy one So saying he prostrated himself and I awaited awhile without seeing him raise his head so I shook him and behold he was indeed dead the mercy of Almighty Allah be upon him I laid him out stretching his arms and legs and looked at him and lo he was smiling Moreover whiteness had got the better of blackness on his brow and his face was radiant with light like a young moon As we wondered at his case the door opened and a young man came in to us and said Peace be with you May Allah make great our reward and yours for our brother Maymun Here is his shroud wrap him in it So saying he gave us two robes never had we seen the like of them and we shrouded him therein And now his tomb is a place whither men resort to pray for rain and ask their requirements of Allah be He extolled and exalted and how excellently well saith the poet on this theme The heart of Gnostic FN four hundred seventy two homed in heavenly Garth Heaven decks and Allah s porters aid afford Lo here they drink old wine commingled with Tasnim FN four hundred seventy three the wine of union with the Lord Safe is the secret twixt the Friend and them Safe from all hearts but from that Heart adored And they recount another anecdote of THE DEVOUT TRAY MAKER AND HIS WIFE There was once among the Children of Israel a man of the worthiest who was strenuous in the service of his Lord and abstained from things worldly and drave them away from his heart He had a wife who was a helpmate meet for him and who was at all times obedient to him They earned their living by making trays FN four hundred seventy four and fans whereat they wrought all through the light hours and at nightfall the man went out into the streets and highways seeking a buyer for what they had made They were wont to fast continually by day FN four hundred seventy five and one morning they arose fasting and worked at their craft till the light failed them when the man went forth according to custom to find purchasers for his wares and fared on till he came to the door of the house of a certain man of wealth one of the sons of this world high in rank and dignity Now the tray maker was fair of face and comely of form and the wife of the master of the house saw him and fell in love with him and her heart inclined to him with exceeding inclination so her husband being absent she called her handmaid and said to her Contrive to bring yonder man to us Accordingly the maid went out to him and and called him and stopped him as though she would buy what he held in hand And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Sixty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the maid servant went out to the man and asked him Come in my lady hath a mind to buy some of thy wares after she hath tried them and looked at them The man thought she spoke truly and seeing no harm in this entered and sat down as she bade him and she shut the door upon him Whereupon her mistress came out of her room and taking him by the gaberdine FN four hundred seventy six drew him within and said How long shall I seek union of thee Verily my patience is at an end on thine account See now the place is perfumed and provision prepared and the householder is absent this night and I give to thee my person without reserve I whose favours kings and captains and men of fortune have sought this long while but I have regarded none of them And she went on talking thus to him whilst he raised not his eyes from the ground for shame before Allah Almighty and fear of the pains and penalties of His punishment even as saith the poet Twixt me and riding many a noble dame Was naught but shame which kept me chaste and pure My shame was cure to her but haply were Shame to depart she ne er had known a cure The man strove to free himself from her but could not so he said to her I want one thing of thee She asked What is that and he answered I wish for pure water that I may carry it to the highest place of thy house and do somewhat therewith and cleanse myself of an impurity which I may not disclose to thee Quoth she The house is large and hath closets and corners and privies at command But he replied I want nothing but to be at a height So she said to her slave girl Carry him up to the belvedere on the house terrace Accordingly the maid took him up to the very top and giving him a vessel of water went down and left him Then he made the ablution and prayed a two bow prayer after which he looked at the ground thinking to throw himself down but seeing it afar off feared to be dashed to pieces by the fall FN four hundred seventy seven Then he bethought him of his disobedience to Allah and the consequences of his sin so it became a light matter to him to offer up his life and shed his blood and he said O my God and my Lord Thou seest that which is fallen on me neither is my case hidden from Thee Thou indeed over all things art Omnipotent and the tongue of my case reciteth and saith I show my heart and thoughts to Thee and Thou Alone my secret s secrecy canst know If I address Thee fain I cry aloud Or if I m mute my signs for speech I show O Thou to whom no second be conjoined A wretched lover seeks Thee in his woe I have a hope my thoughts as true confirm And heart that fainteth as right well canst trow To lavish life is hardest thing that be Yet easy an Thou bid me life forego But an it be Thy will to save from stowre Thou O my Hope to work this work hast power Then the man cast himself down from the belvedere but Allah sent an angel who bore him up on his wings and brought him down to the ground whole and without hurt or harm Now when he found himself safe on the ground he thanked and praised Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might for His merciful protection of his person and his chastity and he went straight to his wife who had long expected him and he empty handed Then seeing him she asked him why he had tarried and what was come of that he had taken with him and why he returned empty handed whereupon he told her of the temptation which had befallen him and she said Alhamdolillah praised be God for delivering thee from seduction and intervening between thee and such calamity Then she added O man the neighbours use to see us light our oven every night and if they see us fireless this night they will know that we are destitute Now it behoveth in gratitude to Allah that we hide our destitution and conjoin the fast of this night to that of the past and continue it for the sake of Allah Almighty So she rose and filling the oven with wood lighted it to baffle the curiosity of her woman neighbours reciting these couplets Now I indeed will hide desire and all repine And light up this my fire that neighbours see no sign Accept I what befals by order of my Lord Haply He too accept this humble act of mine And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that after the goodwife had lit the fire to baffle the curiosity of her women neighbours she and her husband made the Wuzu ablution and stood up to pray when behold one of the neighbours wives came and asked leave to take a fire brand from the oven Do what thou wilt with the oven answered they but when she came to the fire she cried out saying Ho such an one to the tray maker s wife take up thy bread ere it burn Quoth the wife to her husband Hearest thou what she saith Quoth he Go and look So she went up to the oven and behold it was full of fine bread and white She took up the scones and carried them to her husband thanking Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might for His abounding good and great bounty and they ate of the bread and drank water and praised the Almighty Then said the woman to her husband Come let us pray to Allah the Most Highest so haply He may vouchsafe us what shall enable us to dispense with the weariness of working for daily bread and devote ourselves wholly to worshipping and obeying Him The man rose in assent and prayed whilst his wife said Amen to his prayer when the roof clove in sunder and down fell a ruby which lit the house with its light Hereat they redoubled in praise and thanksgiving to Allah praying what the Almighty willed FN four hundred seventy eight and rejoiced at the ruby with great joy And the night being far spent they lay down to sleep and the woman dreamt that she entered Paradise and saw therein many chairs ranged and stools set in rows She asked what the seats were and it was answered her These are the chairs of the prophets and those are the stools of the righteous and the pious Quoth she Which is the stool of my husband such an one and it was said to her It is this So she looked and seeing a hole in its side asked What may be this hole and the reply came It is the place of the ruby that dropped upon you from your house roof Thereupon she awoke weeping and bemoaning the defect in her husband s stool among the seats of the Righteous so she told him the dream and said to him Pray Allah O man that this ruby return to its place for endurance of hunger and poverty during our few days here were easier than a hole in thy chair among the just in Paradise FN four hundred seventy nine Accordingly he prayed to his Lord and lo the ruby flew up to the roof and away whilst they looked at it And they ceased not from their poverty and their piety till they went to the presence of Allah to whom be Honour and Glory And they also tell a tale of AL HAJJAJ AND THE PIOUS MAN Al Hajjaj bin Yusuf al Sakafi had been long in pursuit of a certain man of the notables and when at last he was brought before him he said O enemy of Allah He hath delivered thee over to me and cried Hale him to prison and lay him by the heels in heavy fetters and build a closet over him that he may not come forth of it nor any go into him So they bore him to jail and summoned the blacksmith with the irons and every time the smith gave a stroke with his hammer the prisoner raised his eyes to heaven and said Is not the whole Creation and the Empire thereof His FN four hundred eighty Then the gaolers built the cage FN four hundred eighty one over him and left him therein lorn and lone whereupon longing and consternation entered into him and the tongue of his case recited in extempore verse O Wish of wistful men for Thee I yearn My heart seeks grace of one no heart shall spurn Unhidden from thy sight is this my case And for one glance of thee I pine and burn They jailed and tortured me with sorest pains Alas for lone one can no aid discern But albe lone I find Thy name befriends And cheers though sleep to eyes shall ne er return An thou accept of me I care for naught And only Thou what s in my heart canst learn Now when night fell dark the gaoler left his watchmen to guard him and went to his house and on the morrow when he came to the prison he found the fetters lying on the ground and the prisoner gone whereat he was affrighted and made sure of death So he returned to his place and bade his family farewell after which he took in his sleeve his shroud and the sweet herbs for his corpse and went in to Al Hajjaj And as he stood before the presence the Governor smelt the perfumes and asked What is that when the gaoler answered O my lord it is I who have brought it And what moved thee to that enquired the Governor whereupon he told him his case And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the gaoler told his case to Al Hajjaj the Governor cried Woe to thee Didst thou hear him say aught Answered the gaoler Yes whilst the blacksmith was hammering his irons he ceased not to look up heavenwards and say Is not the whole Creation and the Empire thereof His Rejoined Al Hajjaj Dost thou not know that He on whom he called in thy presence delivered him in thine absence And the tongue of the case recited on this theme O Lord how many a grief from me hast driven Nor can I sit or stand without Thy hold How many many things I cannot count Thou sav saint from many many and manifold And they also tell a tale of THE BLACKSMITH WHO COULD HANDLE FIRE WITHOUT HURT It reached the ears of a certain pious man that there abode in such a town a blacksmith who could put his hand into the fire and pull out the iron red hot without the flames doing him aught of hurt FN four hundred eighty two So he set out for the town in question and asked for the blacksmith and when the man was shown to him he watched him at work and saw him do as had been reported to him He waited till he had made and end of his day s work then going up to him saluted him with the salam and said I would be thy guest this night Replied the smith With gladness and goodly gree and carried him to his place where they supped together and lay down to sleep The guest watched but saw no sign in his host of praying through the night or of special devoutness and said in his mind Haply he hideth himself from me So he lodged with him a second and a third night but found that he did not exceed the devotions prescribed by the law and custom of the Prophet and rose but little in the dark hours to pray At last he said to him O my brother I have heard of the gift with which Allah hath favoured thee and have seen the truth of it with mine eyes Moreover I have taken note of thine assiduity in religious exercises but find in thee no such piety as distinguisheth those who work saintly miracles whence then cometh this to thee I will tell thee answered the smith Know that I was once passionately enamoured of a slave girl and ofttimes sued her for love liesse but could not prevail upon her because she still held fast by her chastity Presently there came a year of drought and hunger and hardship food failed and there befel a sore famine As I was sitting one day at home somebody knocked at the door so I went out and behold she was standing there and she said to me O my brother I am sorely an hungered and I lift mine eyes to thee beseeching thee to feed me for Allah s sake Quoth I Wottest thou not how I love thee and what I have suffered for thy sake Now I will not give thee one bittock of bread except thou yield thy person to me Quoth she Death but not disobedience to the Lord Then she went away and returned after two days with the same prayer for food as before I made her a like answer and she entered and sat down in my house being nigh upon death I set food before her whereupon her eyes brimmed with tears and she cried Give me meat for the love of Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory But I answered Not so by Allah except thou yield thyself to me Quoth she Better is death to me than the wrath and wreak of Allah the Most Highest and she rose and left the food untouched And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the man set food before her the woman said Give me meat for the love of Allah to whom be Honour and Glory But I answered Not so by Allah except thou yield to me thy person Quoth she Better is death than the wrath and wreak of Allah and she rose and left the food untouched and went away repeating these couplets O Thou the One whose grace doth all the world embrace Thine ears have heard Thine eyes have seen my case Privation and distress have dealt me heavy blows The woes that weary me no utterance can trace I am like one athirst who eyes the landscape s eye Yet may not drink a draught of streams that rail and race My flesh would tempt me by the sight of savoury food Whose joys shall pass away and pangs maintain their place She then disappeared for two days when she again came and knocked at the door so I went out to her and lo hunger had taken away her voice but after a rest she said O my brother I am worn out with want and know not what to do for I cannot show my face to any man but to thee Say wilt thou feed me for the love of Allah Almighty But I answered Not so except thou yield to me thy person And she entered my house and sat down Now I had no food ready but when the meat was dressed and I laid it in a saucer behold the grace of Almighty Allah entered into me and I said to myself Out on thee This woman weak of wit and faith hath refrained from food till she can no longer for stress of hunger and while she refuseth time after time thou canst not forbear from disobedience to the Lord And I said O my God I repent to Thee of that which my flesh purposed Then I took the food and carrying it to her said Eat for no harm shall betide thee this is for the love of Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory Then she raised her eyes to heaven and said O my God if this man say sooth I pray Thee forbid fire to harm him in this world and the next for Thou over all things art Omnipotent and Prevalent in answering the prayer of the penitent Then I left her and went to put out the fire in the brasier FN four hundred eighty three Now the season was winter and the weather cold and a live coal fell on my body but by the decree of Allah to whom be Honour and Glory I felt no pain and it became my conviction that her prayer had been answered So I took the coal in my hand and it burnt me not and going in to her I said Be of good cheer for Allah hath granted thy prayer And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the blacksmith continued So I went in to her and said Be of good cheer for Allah hath granted thy prayer Then she dropped the morsel from her hand and said O my God now that Thou hast shown me my desire of him and hast granted me my prayer for him take Thou my soul for Thou over all things art Almighty And straightway He took her soul to Him the mercy of Allah be upon her And the tongue of the case extemporised and spake on this theme She prayed the Lord of grace her prayer obeyed And spared the sinner who for sin had prayed He showed her all she prayed Him to grant And Death as prayed she her portion made Unto his door she came and prayed for food And sued his ruth for what her misery made He leant to error following his lusts And hoped to enjoy her as her wants persuade But he knew little of what Allah willed Nor was Repentance though unsought denayed Fate comes to him who flies from Fate O Lord And lot and daily bread by Thee are weighed And they also tell of THE DEVOTEE TO WHOM ALLAH GAVE A CLOUD FOR SERVICE AND THE DEVOUT KING There was once among the children of Israel a man of the devout for piety acclaimed and for continence and asceticism enfamed whose prayers were ever granted and who by supplication obtained whatso he wanted and he was a wanderer in the mountains and was used to pass the night in worship Now Almighty Allah had subjected to him a cloud which travelled with him wherever he went and poured on him its water treasures in abundance that he might make his ablutions and drink After a long time when things were thus his fervour somewhat abated whereupon Allah took the cloud away from him and ceased to answer his prayers On this account great was his grief and long was his woe and he ceased not to regret the time of grace and the miracle vouchsafed to him and to lament and bewail and bemoan himself till he saw in a dream one who said to him An thou wouldest have Allah restore to thee thy cloud seek out a certain King in such a town and beg him to pray for thee so will Allah be He extolled and exalted give thee back thy cloud and bespread it over thee by virtue of his pious prayers And he began repeating these couplets Wend to that pious prayerful Emir Who can with gladness thy condition cheer An he pray Allah thou shalt win thy wish And heavy rain shall drop from welkin clear He stands all Kings above in potent worth Nor to compare with him doth aught appear Near him thou soon shalt hap upon thy want And see all joy and gladness draw thee near Then cut the wolds and wilds unfounted till The goal thou goest for anigh shalt speer So the hermit set out for the town named to him in the dream and coming thither after long travel enquired for the King s palace which was duly shown to him And behold at the gate he found a slave officer sitting on a great chair and clad in gorgeous gear so he stood to him and saluted him and he returned his salam and asked him What is thy business Answered the devotee I am a wronged man and come to submit my case to the King Quoth the officer Thou hast no access to him this day for he hath appointed unto petitioners and enquirers one day in every seven naming the day on which they may go in to him so wend thy ways in welfare till then The hermit was vexed with the King for thus veiling himself from the folk and said in thought How shall this man be a saint of the saints of Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might and he on this wise Then he went away and awaited the appointed day Now quoth he when it came I repaired to the palace where I found a great number of folk at the gate expecting admission and I stood with them till there came out a Wazir robed in gorgeous raiment and attended by guards and slaves who said Let those who have petitions to present enter So I entered with the rest and found the King seated facing his officers and grandees who were ranged according to their several ranks and degrees The Wazir took up his post and brought forward the petitioners one by one till it came to my turn when the King looked on me and said Welcome to the Lord of the Cloud Sit thee down till I make leisure for thee I was confounded at his words and confessed his dignity and superiority and when the King had answered the petitioners and had made an end with them he rose and dismissed his Wazirs and Grandees then taking my hand he led me to the door of the private palace where we found a black slave splendidly arrayed with helm on head and on his right hand and his left bows and coats of mail He rose to the King and hastening to obey his orders and forestall his wishes opened the door We went in hand in hand till we came to a low wicket which the King himself opened and led me into a ruinous place of frightful desolation and thence passed into a chamber wherein was naught but a prayer carpet an ewer for ablution and some mats of palm leaves Here the King doffed his royal robes and donned a coarse gown of white wool and a conical bonnet of felt Then he sat down and making me sit called out to his wife Ho such an one and she answered from within saying Here am I Quoth he Knowest thou who is our guest to day Replied she Yes it is the Lord of the Cloud The King said Come forth it mattereth not for him And behold there entered a woman as she were a vision with a face that beamed like the new moon and she wore a gown and veil of wool And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King called to his wife she came forth from the inner room and her face beamed like the new moon and she wore a gown and a veil of wool Then said the King O my brother dost thou desire to hear our story or that we should pray for thee and dismiss thee Answered the hermit Nay I wish to hear the tale of you twain for that to me were preferable Said the King My forefathers handed down the throne one to the other and it descended from great one to great one in unbroken succession till the last died and it came to me Now Allah had made this hateful to me for I would fain have gone awandering over earth and left the folk to their own affairs but I feared lest they should fall into confusion and anarchy and misgovernment so as to swerve from divine law and the union of the Faith be broken up Wherefore abandoning my own plans I took the kingship and appointed to every head of them a regular stipend and donned the royal robes and posted slave officers at the doors as a terror to the dishonest and for the defence of honest folk and the maintenance of law and limitations Now when free of this I entered this place and doffing my royal habit donned these clothes thou seest and this my cousin the daughter of my father s brother hath agreed with me to renounce the world and helpeth me to serve the Lord So we are wont to weave these palm leaves and earn during the day a wherewithal to break our fast at nightfall and we have lived on this wise nigh upon forty years Abide thou with us so Allah have mercy on thee till we sell our mats and thou shalt sup and sleep with us this night and on the morrow wend thy ways with that thou wishest Inshallah So he tarried with them till the end of the day when there came a boy five years old who took the mats they had made and carrying them to the market sold them for a carat FN four hundred eighty four and with this bought bread and beans and returned with them to the King The hermit broke his fast and lay down to sleep with them but in the middle of the night they both arose and fell to praying and weeping When daybreak was near the King said O my God this Thy servant beseecheth Thee to return him his cloud and to do this Thou art able so O my God let him see his prayer granted and restore him his cloud The Queen amen d to his orisons and behold the cloud grew up in the sky whereupon the King gave the hermit joy and the man took leave of them and went away the cloud companying him as of old And whatsoever he required of Allah after this in the names of the pious King and Queen He granted it without fail and the man made thereon these couplets My Lord hath servants fain of piety Hearts in the Wisdom garden ranging free Their bodies lusts at peace and motionless For breasts that bide in purest secresy Thou seest all silent awesome of their Lord For hidden things unseen and seen they see And they tell a tale of THE MOSLEM CHAMPION AND THE CHRISTIAN DAMSEL The Commander of the Faithful Omar bin al Khattab whom Allah accept once levied for holy war an army of Moslems to encounter the foe before Damascus and they laid close siege to one of the Christians strongholds Now there were amongst the Moslems two men brothers whom Allah had gifted with fire and bold daring against the enemy so that the commander of the besieged fortress said to his chiefs and braves Were but yonder two Moslems ta en or slain I would warrant you against the rest of their strain Wherefore they left not to set for them all manner of toils and snares and ceased not to manoeuvre and lie in wait and ambush for them till they took one of them prisoner and slew the other who died a martyr They carried the captive to the Captain of the fort who looked at him and said Verily to kill this man were indeed a pity but his return to the Moslem would be a calamity And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the enemy carried their Moslem captive before the Captain of the fort the Christian looked at him and said Verily to kill this man were a pity indeed but his return to the Moslem would be a calamity Oh that he might be brought to embrace the Nazarene Faith and be to us an aid and an arm Quoth one of his Patrician Knights O Emir I will tempt him to abjure his faith and on this wise we know that the Arabs are much addicted to women and I have a daughter a perfect beauty whom when he sees he will be seduced by her Quoth the Captain I give him into thy charge So he carried him to his place and clad his daughter in raiment such as added to her beauty and loveliness Then he brought the Moslem into the room and set before him food and made the fair girl stand in his presence as she were a handmaid obedient to her lord and awaiting his orders that she might do his bidding When the Moslem saw the evil sent down upon him he commended himself to Allah Almighty and closing his eyes applied himself to worship and to reciting the Koran Now he had a pleasant voice and a piercing wit and the Nazarene damsel presently loved him with passionate love and pined for him with extreme repine This lasted seven days at the end of which she said to herself Would to Heaven he would admit me into the Faith of Al Islam And the tongue of her case recited these couplets Wilt turn thy face from heart that s all thine own This heart thy ransom and this soul thy wone I m ready home and kin to quit for aye And every Faith for that of sword FN four hundred eighty five disown I testify that Allah hath no mate This proof is stablished and this truth is known Haply shall deign He union grant with one Averse and hearten heart love overthrown For ofttimes door erst shut is opened wide And after evil case all good is shown At last her patience failed her and her breast was straitened and she threw herself on the ground before him saying I conjure thee by thy Faith that thou give ear to my words Asked he What are they and she answered Expound unto me Al Islam So he expounded to her the tenets of the Faith and she became a Moslemah after which she was circumcised FN four hundred eighty six and he taught her to pray Then said she to him O my brother I did but embrace Al Islam for thy sake and to win thy favours Quoth he The law of Al Islam forbiddeth sexual commerce save after a marriage before two legal witnesses and a dowry and a guardian are also requisite Now I know not where to find witnesses or friend or parapherne but an thou can contrive to bring us out of this place I may hope to make the land of Al Islam and pledge myself to thee that none other than thou in all Al Islam shall be wife to me Answered she I will manage that and calling her father and mother said to them Indeed this Moslem s heart is softened and he longeth to enter the faith so I will grant him that which he desireth of my person but he saith It befitteth me not to do this in a town where my brother was slain Could I but get outside it my heart would be solaced and I would do that which is wanted of me Now there is no harm in letting me go forth with him to another town and I will be a surety to you both and to the Emir for that which ye wish of him Therefore her father went to their Captain and told him this whereat he joyed with exceeding joy and bade him carry them forth to a village that she named So they went out and made the village where they abode the rest of their day and when night fell they got ready for the march and went their way even as saith the poet The time of parting cry they draweth nigh How oft this parting threat I but reply I ve naught to do but cross the wild and wold And mile by mile o er fountless wastes to fly If the beloved seek another land Sons of the road whereso they wend wend I I make desire direct me to their side The guide to show me where the way doth lie And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the prisoner and the lady abode in the village the rest of their day and when night fell made ready for the march and went upon their way and travelled all night without stay or delay The young Moslem mounting a swift blood horse and taking up the maiden behind him ceased not devouring the ground till it was bright morning when he turned aside with her from the highway and alighting they made the Wuzu ablution and prayed the dawn prayer Now as they were thus engaged behold they heard the clank of swords and clink of bridles and men s voices and tramp of horse whereupon he said to her Ho such an one the Nazarenes are after us What shall we do the horse is so jaded and broken down that he cannot stir another step Exclaimed she Woe to thee art thou then afraid and affrighted Yes answered he and she said What didst thou tell me of the power of thy Lord and His readiness to succour those who succour seek Come let us humble ourselves before Him and beseech Him haply He shall grant us His succour and endue us with His grace extolled and exalted be He Quoth he By Allah thou sayest well So they began humbling themselves and supplicating Almighty Allah and he recited these couplets Indeed I hourly need thy choicest aid And should though crown were placed upon my head Thou art my chiefest want and if my hand Won what it wisheth all my wants were sped Thou hast not anything withholdest Thou Like pouring rain Thy grace is showered I m shut therefrom by sins of me yet Thou O Clement deignest pardon light to shed O Care Dispeller deign dispel my grief None can save Thou dispel a grief so dread Whilst he was praying and she was saying Amen and the thunder of horse tramp nearing them lo the brave heard the voice of his dead brother the martyr speaking and saying O my brother fear not nor grieve for the host whose approach thou hearest is the host of Allah and His Angels whom He hath sent to serve as witnesses to your marriage Of a truth Allah hath made His Angels glorify you and He bestoweth on you the meed of the meritorious and the martyrs and He hath rolled up the earth for you as it were a rug so that by morning you will be in the mountains of Al Medinah And thou when thou foregatherest with Omar bin al Khattab of whom Allah accept give him my salutation and say to him Allah abundantly requite thee for Al Islam because thou hast counselled faithfully and hast striven diligently Thereupon the Angels lifted up their voices in salutation to him and his bride saying Verily Almighty Allah appointed her in marriage to thee two thousand years before the creation of your father Adam with whom be peace evermore Then joy and gladness and peace and happiness came upon the twain confidence was confirmed and established was the guidance of the pious pair So when dawn appeared they prayed the accustomed prayer and fared forward Now it was the wont of Omar son of Al Khattab Allah accept him to rise for morning prayer in the darkness before dawn and at times he would stand in the prayer niche with two men behind him and begin reciting the Chapter entitled Cattle FN four hundred eighty seven or that entitled Women FN four hundred eighty eight whereupon the sleeper awoke and he who was making his Wuzu ablution accomplished it and he who was afar came to prayer nor had he made an end of the first bow ere the mosque was full of folk then he would pray his second bow quickly repeating a short chapter But on that morning he hurried over both first and second inclinations repeating in each a short chapter then after the concluding salutation turning to his companions he said to them Come let us fare forth to meet the bride and bridegroom at which they wondered not understanding his words But he went out and they followed him till they came to the gate of the city where they met the young Moslem who when the day broke and the standards of Al Medinah appeared to him had pushed forward for the gate closely followed by his bride There he was met by Omar who bade make a marriage feast and the Moslems came and ate Then the young Moslem went in unto his bride and Almighty Allah vouchsafed him children And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Omar on whom be peace bade make a marriage feast and the Moslems came and ate Then the young Moslem went in unto his bride and Almighty Allah vouchsafed him children who fought in the Lord s way and preserved genealogies for they gloried therein And how excellent is what is said on such theme I saw thee weep before the gates and plain Whilst only curious wight reply would deign Hath eye bewitcht thee or hath evil lot Twixt thee and door of friend set bar of bane Wake up this day O wretch persist in prayer Repent as wont repent departed men Haply shall wash thy sins Forgiveness showers And on thine erring head some ruth shall rain And prisoner shall escape despite his bonds And slave from thraldom freedom shall attain And they ceased not to be in all solace and delight of life till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies And a tale is told by Sidi Ibrahim bin Al Khawwas FN four hundred eighty nine on whom be the mercy of Allah concerning himself and THE CHRISTIAN KING S DAUGHTER AND THE MOSLEM My spirit urged me once upon a time to go forth into the country of the Infidels and I strove with it and struggled to put away from me this inclination but it would not be rejected So I fared forth and journeyed about the land of the Unbelievers and traversed it in all its parts for divine grace enveloped me and heavenly protection encompassed me so that I met not a single Nazarene but he turned away his eyes and drew off from me till I came to a certain great city at whose gate I found a gathering of black slaves clad in armour and bearing iron maces in their hands When they saw me they rose to their feet and asked me Art thou a leach and I answered Yes Quoth they Come speak to our King and carried me before their ruler who was a handsome personage of majestic presence When I stood before him he looked at me and said Art a physician thou Yes quoth I and quoth he to his officers Carry him to her and acquaint him with the condition before he enter So they took me out and said to me Know that the King hath a daughter and she is stricken with a sore disease which no doctor hath been able to cure and no leach goeth in to her and treateth without healing her but the King putteth him to death So bethink thee what thou seest fitting to do I replied The King drove me to her so carry me to her Thereupon they brought me to her door and knocked and behold I heard her cry out from within saying Admit to me the physician lord of the wondrous secret And she began reciting Open the door the leach now draweth near And in my soul a wondrous secret speer How many of the near far distant are FN four hundred ninety How many distant far are nearest near I was in strangerhood amidst you all But willed the Truth FN four hundred ninety one my solace should appear Joined us the potent bonds of Faith and Creed We met as dearest fere greets dearest fere He sued for interview whenas pursued The spy and blamed us envy s jibe and jeer Then leave your chiding and from blame desist For fie upon you not a word I ll hear I care for naught that disappears and fleets My care s for Things nor fleet nor disappear And lo a Shaykh a very old man opened the door in haste and said to me Enter So I entered and found myself in a chamber strewn with sweet scented herbs and with a curtain drawn across one corner from behind which came a sound of groaning and grame weak as from an emaciated frame I sat down before the curtain and was about to offer my salam when I bethought me of his words whom Allah save and assain Accost not a Jew nor a Christian with the salam salutation FN four hundred ninety two and when ye meet them in the way constrain them to the straitest part thereof So I withheld my salutation but she cried out from behind the curtain saying Where is the salutation of Unity and Indivisibility O Khawwas I was astonished at her speech and asked How knowest thou me whereto she answered When the heart and thoughts are whole the tongue speaketh eloquently from the secret recesses of the soul I begged Him yesterday to send me one of His saints at whose hands I might have deliverance and behold it was cried to me from the dark places of my house Grieve not for we soon will send thee Ibrahim the Basket maker Then I asked her What of thee and she answered It is now four years since there appeared to me the Manifest Truth and He is the Relator and the Ally and the Uniter and the Sitter by whereupon my folk looked askance upon me with an evil eye and taxed me with insanity and suspected me of depravity and there came not in to me doctor but terrified me nor visitor but confounded me Quoth I And who led thee to the knowledge of what thou wottest Quoth she The manifest signs and visible portents of Allah and when the path is patent to thee thou espiest with thine own eyes both proof and prover Now whilst we were talking behold in came the old man appointed to guard her and said What doth thy doctor and she replied He knoweth the hurt and hath hit upon the healing And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Shaykh her guardian went in to her he said What doth thy doctor and she replied He knoweth the hurt and hath hit upon the healing Hereupon he manifested joy and gladness and accosted me with a cheerful countenance then went and told the King who enjoined to treat me with all honour and regard So I visited her daily for seven days at the end of which time she said to me O Abu Ishak when shall be our flight to the land of Al Islam How canst thou go forth replied I and who would dare to aid thee Rejoined she He who sent thee to me driving thee as it were and I observed Thou sayest sooth So when the morrow dawned we fared forth by the city gate and all eyes were veiled from us by commandment of Him who when He desireth aught saith to it Be and it becometh FN four hundred ninety three so that I journeyed with her in safety to Meccah where she made a home hard by the Holy House of Allah and lived seven years till the appointed day of her death The earth of Meccah was her tomb and never saw I any more steadfast in prayer and fasting than she Allah send down upon her His mercies and have compassion on him who saith When they to me had brought the leach and surely showed The signs of flowing tears and pining malady The face veil he withdrew from me and neath it naught Save breath of one unsouled unbodied could he see Quoth he This be a sickness Love alone shall cure Love hath a secret from all guess of man wide free Quoth they An folk ignore what here there be with him Nature of ill and eke its symptomology How then shall medicine work a cure At this quoth I Leave me alone I have no guessing specialty And they tell a tale of THE PROPHET AND THE JUSTICE OF PROVIDENCE A certain Prophet FN four hundred ninety four made his home for worship on a lofty mountain at whose foot was a spring of running water and he was wont to sit by day on the summit that no man might see him calling upon the name of Allah the Most Highest and watching those who frequented the spring One day as he sat looking upon the fountain behold he espied a horseman who came up and dismounted thereby and taking a bag from his neck set it down beside him after which he drank of the water and rested awhile then he rode away leaving behind him the bag which contained gold pieces Presently up came another man to drink of the spring who saw the bag and finding it full of money took it up then after satisfying his thirst he made off with it in safety A little after came a woodcutter wight with a heavy load of fuel on his back and sat down by the spring to drink when lo back came the first horseman in great trouble and asked him Where is the bag which was here and when he answered I know nothing of it the rider drew his sword and smote him and slew him Then he searched his clothes but found naught so he left him and wended his ways Now when the Prophet saw this he said O Lord one man hath taken a thousand dinars and another man hath been slain unjustly But Allah answered him saying Busy thyself with thy devotions for the ordinance of the universe is none of thine affair The father of this horseman had violently despoiled of a thousand dinars the father of the second horseman so I gave the son possession of his sire s money As for the woodcutter he had slain the horseman s father wherefore I enabled the son to obtain retribution for himself Then cried the Prophet There is none other god than Thou Glory be to Thee only Verily Thou art the Knower of Secrets FN four hundred ninety five And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Seventy ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Prophet was bidden by inspiration of Allah to busy himself with his devotions and learned the truth of the case he cried There is none other god but Thou Glory be to Thee only Verily Thou and Thou alone wottest hidden things Furthermore one of the poets hath made these verses on the matter The Prophet saw whatever eyes could see And fain of other things enquired he And when his eyes saw things misunderstood Quoth he O Lord this slain from sin was free This one hath won him wealth withouten work Albe appeared he garbed in penury And that in joy of life was slain although O man s Creator free of sin he be God answered Twas his father s good thou saw saint Him take by heirship not by roguery Yon woodman too that horseman s sire had slain Whose son avenged him with just victory Put off O slave of Me this thought for I In men have set mysterious secrecy Bow to Our Law and humble thee and learn For good and evil issues Our decree FN four hundred ninety six And a certain pious man hath told us the tale of THE FERRYMAN OF THE NILE AND THE HERMIT I was once a ferryman on the Nile and used to ply between the eastern and the western banks Now one day as I sat in my boat there came up to me an old man of a bright and beaming countenance who saluted me and I returned his greeting and he said to me Wilt thou ferry me over for the love of Allah Almighty I answered Yes and he continued Wilt thou moreover give me food for Allah s sake to which again I answered With all my heart So he entered the boat and I rowed him over to the eastern side remarking that he was clad in a patched gown and carried a gourd bottle and a staff When he was about to land he said to me I desire to lay on thee a heavy trust Quoth I What is it Quoth he It hath been revealed to me that my end is nearhand and that to morrow about noon thou wilt come and find me dead under yonder tree Wash me and wrap me in the shroud thou wilt see under my head and after thou hast prayed over me bury me in this sandy ground and take my gown and gourd and staff which do thou deliver to one who shall come and demand them of thee I marvelled at his words and I slept there On the morrow I awaited till noon the event he had announced and then I forgot what he had said till near the hour of afternoon prayer when I remembered it and hastening to the appointed place found him under the tree dead with a new shroud under his head exhaling a fragrance of musk So I washed him and shrouded him and prayed over him then dug a hole in the sand and buried him after I had taken his ragged gown and bottle and staff with which I crossed the Nile to the western side and there nighted As soon as morning dawned and the city gate opened I sighted a young man known to me as a loose fellow clad in fine clothes and his hands stained with Henna who said to me Art thou not such an one Yes answered I and he said Give me the trust Quoth I What is that Quoth he The gown the gourd and the staff I asked him Who told thee of them and he answered I know nothing save that I spent yesternight at the wedding of one of my friends singing and carousing till daylight when I lay me down to sleep and take my rest and behold there stood by me a personage who said Verily Allah Almighty hath taken such a saint to Himself and hath appointed thee to fill his place so go thou to a certain person naming the ferryman and take of him the dead man s gown and bottle and staff for he left them with him for thee So I brought them out and gave them to him whereupon he doffed his clothes and donning the gown went his way and left me FN four hundred ninety seven And when the glooms closed around me I fell a weeping but that night while sleeping I saw the Lord of Holiness glorified and exalted be He in a dream saying O my servant is it grievous to thee that I have granted to one of My servants to return to Me Indeed this is of My bounty that I vouchsafe to whom I will for I over all things am Almighty So I repeated these couplets Lover with loved FN four hundred ninety eight loseth will and aim All choice an couldst thou know were sinful shame Or grant He favour and with union grace Or from thee turn away He hath no blame An from such turning thou no joy enjoy Depart the place for thee no place became Or canst His near discern not from His far Then Love s in vain and thou rt a rear and lame If pine for Thee afflict my sprite or men Hale me to death the rein Thy hand shall claim So turn Thee to or fro to me tis one What Thou ordainest none shall dare defame My love hath naught of aim but Thine approof And if Thou say we part I say the same And of the tales they tell is one concerning THE ISLAND KING AND THE PIOUS ISRAELITE There was once a notable of the Children of Israel a man of wealth who had a pious and blessed son When his last hour drew nigh his son sat down at his head and said to him O my lord give me an injunction Quoth the father O dear son I charge thee swear not by Allah or truly or falsely Then he died and certain lewd fellows of the Children of Israel heard of the charge he had laid on his son and began coming to the latter and saying Thy father had such and such monies of mine and thou knowest it so give me what was entrusted to him or else make oath that there was no trust The good son would not disobey his sire s injunction so gave them all they claimed and they ceased not to deal thus with him till his wealth was spent and he fell into straitest predicament Now the young man had a pious and blessed wife who had borne him two little sons so he said to her The folk have multiplied their demands on me and while I had the wherewithal to free myself of debt I rendered it freely but naught is now left us and if others make demands upon me we shall be in absolute distress I and thou our best way were to save ourselves by fleeing to some place where none knoweth us and earn our bread among the lower of the folk Accordingly he took ship with her and his two children knowing not whither he should wend but When Allah judgeth there is none to reverse His judgment FN four hundred ninety nine and quoth the tongue of the case O flier from thy home when foes affright Whom led to weal and happiness such flight Grudge not this exile when he flees abroad Where he on wealth and welfare may alight An pearls for ever did abide in shell The kingly crown they ne er had deckt and dight The ship was wrecked yet the man saved himself on a plank and his wife and children also saved themselves but on other planks The waves separated them and the wife was cast up in one country and one of the boys in another The second son was picked up by a ship and the surges threw the father on a desert island where he landed and made the Wuzu ablution Then he called the prayer call And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eightieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the man landed upon the island he made the Wuzu ablution to free himself from the impurities of the sea and called the call to prayer and stood up to his devotions when behold there came forth of the sea creatures of various kinds and prayed with him When he had finished he went up to a tree and stayed his hunger with its fruits after which he found a spring of water and drank thereof and praised Allah to whom be honour and glory He abode thus three days and whenever he stood up to pray the sea creatures came out and prayed in the same manner as he prayed Now after the third day he heard a voice crying aloud and saying O thou just man and pious who didst so honour thy father and revere the decrees of thy Lord grieve not for Allah be He extolled and exalted shall restore to thee all which left thy hand In this isle are hoards and monies and things of price which the Almighty willeth thou shalt inherit and they are in such a part of this place So bring thou them to light and verily we will send ships unto thee and do thou bestow charity on the folk and bid them to thee So he sought out that place and the Lord discovered to him the treasures in question Then ships began resorting to him and he gave abundant largesse to the crews saying to them Be sure ye direct the folk unto me and I will give them such and such a thing and appoint to them this and that Accordingly there came folk from all parts and places nor had ten years passed over him ere the island was peopled and the man became its King FN five hundred No one came to him but he entreated him with munificence and his name was noised abroad through the length and breadth of the earth Now his elder son had fallen into the hands of a man who reared him and taught him polite accomplishments and in like manner the younger was adopted by one who gave him a good education and brought him up in the ways of merchants The wife also happened upon a trader who entrusted to her his property and made a covenant with her that he would not deal dishonestly by her but would aid her to obey Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might and he used to make her the companion of his voyages and his travels Now the elder son heard the report of the King and resolved to visit him without knowing who he was so he went to him and was well received by the King who made him his secretary Presently the other son heard of the King s piety and justice and was also taken into his service as a steward Then the brothers abode awhile neither knowing the other till it chanced that the merchant in whose home was their mother also hearing of the King s righteous and generous dealing with the lieges freighted a ship with rich stuffs and other excellent produce of the land and taking the woman with him set sail for the island He made it in due course and landing presented himself with his gift before the King who rejoiced therein with exceeding joy and ordered him a splendid return present Now there were among the gifts certain aromatic roots of which he would have the merchant acquaint him with the names and uses so he said to him Abide with us this night And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the King said Abide with us this night the merchant replied We have in the ship one to whom I have promised to entrust the care of her to none save myself and the same is a holy woman whose prayers have brought me weal and I have felt the blessing of her counsels Rejoined the King I will send her some trusty men who shall pass the night in the ship and guard her and all that is with her The merchant agreed to this and abode with the King who called his secretary and steward and said to them Go and pass the night in this man s ship and keep it safe Inshallah So they went up into the ship and seating themselves this on the poop and that on the bow passed a part of the night in repeating the names of Allah to whom belong Majesty and Might Then quoth one to the other Ho such an one The King bade us keep watch and I fear lest sleep overtake us so come let us discourse of stories of fortune and of the good we have seen and the trials of life Quoth the other O my brother as for my trials Fate parted me from my mother and a brother of mine whose name was even as thine and the cause of our parting was this My father took ship with us from such a place and the winds rose against us and were contrary so that the ship was wrecked and Allah broke our fair companionship Hearing this the first asked What was the name of thy mother O my brother and the second answered So and so Thereat brother threw himself upon brother saying By Allah thou art my very brother And each fell to telling the other what had befallen him in his youth whilst the mother heard all they said but held her peace and in patience possessed her soul Now when it was morning one said to the other Come brother let us go to my lodging and talk there and the other said Tis well So they went away and presently the merchant came back and finding the woman in great trouble said to her What hath befallen thee and why this concern Quoth she Thou sentest to me yesternight men who tempted me to evil and I have been in sore annoy with them At this he was wroth and repairing to the King reported the conduct of his two trusty wights The King summoned the twain forthwith as he loved them for their fidelity and piety and sending for the woman that he might hear from her own lips what she had to say against them thus bespake her O woman what hath betided thee from these two men in whom I trust She replied O King I conjure thee by the Almighty the Bountiful One the Lord of the Empyrean bid them repeat the words they spoke yesternight So he said to them Say what ye said and conceal naught thereof Accordingly they repeated their talk and lo the King rising from his throne gave a great cry and threw himself upon them embracing them and saying By Allah ye are my very sons Therewith the woman unveiled her face and said And by Allah I am their very mother So they were united and abode in all solace of life and its delight till death parted them and so glory be to Him who delivereth His servant when he restoreth to Him and disappointeth not his hope in Him and his trust And how well saith the poet on the subject Each thing of things hath his appointed tide When tis O brother granted or denied Repine not an affliction hit thee hard For woe and welfare aye conjoint abide How oft shall woman see all griefs surround Yet feel a joyance thrill what lies inside How many a wretch on whom the eyes of folk Look down shall grace exalt to pomp and pride This man is one long suffering grief and woe Whom change and chance of Time hath sorely tried The World divided from what held he dearest After long union scattered far and wide But deigned his Lord unite them all again And in the Lord is every good descried Glory to Him whose Providence rules all Living as surest proofs for us decide Near is the Near One but no wisdom clearer Shows him nor distant wayfare brings Him nearer And this tale is told of ABU AL HASAN AND ABU JA AFAR THE LEPER FN five hundred one I had been many times to Meccah Allah increase its honour and the folk used to follow me for my knowledge of the road and remembrance of the water stations It happened one year that I was minded to make the pilgrimage to the Holy House and visitation of the Tomb of His Prophet on whom be blessing and peace and I said in myself I well know the way and will fare alone So I set out and journeyed till I came to Al Kadisiyah FN five hundred two and entering the mosque there saw a man suffering from black leprosy seated in the prayer niche Quoth he on seeing me O Abu al Hasan I crave thy company to Meccah Quoth I to myself I fled from all my companions and how shall I company with lepers So I said to him I will bear no man company and he was silent at my words Next day I walked on alone till I came to Al Akabah FN five hundred three where I entered the mosque and found the leper seated in the prayer niche So I said to myself Glory be to Allah how hath this fellow preceded me hither But he raised his head to me and said with a smile O Abu al Hasan He doth for the weak that which surpriseth the strong I passed that night confounded at what I had seen and as soon as morning dawned set out again by myself but when I came to Arafat FN five hundred four and entered the mosque behold there was the leper seated in the niche So I threw myself upon him and kissing his feet said O my lord I crave thy company But he answered This may in no way be Then I began weeping and wailing at the loss of his converse when he said Spare thy tears which will avail thee naught And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Abu al Hasan continued Now when I saw the leper man seated in the prayer niche I threw myself upon him and said O my lord I crave thy company and fell to kissing his feet But he answered This may in no way be Then I began weeping and wailing at the loss of his company when he said Spare thy tears which will avail thee naught and he recited these couplets Why dost thou weep when I depart and thou didst parting claim And cravest union when we ne er shall reunite the same Thou lookedest on nothing save my weakness and disease And saidst Nor goes nor comes or night or day this sickly frame Seest not how Allah glorified His glory ever be Deigneth to grant His slave s petition wherewithal he came If I to eyes of men be that and only that they see And this my body show itself so full of grief and grame And have I naught of food that shall supply me to the place Where crowds unto my Lord resort impelled by single aim I have a high Creating Lord whose mercies aye are hid A Lord who hath none equal and no fear is known to Him So fare thee safe and leave me lone in strangerhood to wone For He the only One consoles my loneliness so lone Accordingly I left him but every station I came to I found he had foregone me till I reached Al Medinah where I lost sight of him and could hear no tidings of him Here I met Abu Yazid al Bustami and Abu Bakr al Shibli and a number of other Shaykhs and learned men to whom with many complaints I told my case and they said Heaven forbid that thou shouldst gain his company after this He was Abu Ja afar the leper in whose name folk at all times pray for rain and by whose blessing prayers their end attain When I heard their words my desire for his company redoubled and I implored the Almighty to reunite me with him Whilst I was standing on Arafat FN five hundred five one pulled me from behind so I turned and behold it was my man At this sight I cried out with a loud cry and fell down in a fainting fit but when I came to myself he had disappeared from my sight This increased my yearning for him and the ceremonies were tedious to me and I prayed Almighty Allah to give me sight of him nor was it but a few days after when lo one pulled me from behind and I turned and it was he again Thereupon he said Come I conjure thee and ask thy want of me So I begged him to pray for me three prayers first that Allah would make me love poverty secondly that I might never lie down at night upon provision assured to me and thirdly that He would vouchsafe me to look upon His bountiful Face So he prayed for me as I wished and departed from me And indeed Allah hath granted me what the devotee asked in prayer to begin with He hath made me so love poverty that by the Almighty there is naught in the world dearer to me than it and secondly since such a year I have never lain down to sleep upon assured provision withal hath He never let me lack aught As for the third prayer I trust that He will vouchsafe me that also even as He hath granted the two precedent for right Bountiful and Beneficent is His Godhead and Allah have mercy on him who said FN five hundred six Garb of Fakir renouncement lowliness His robe of tatters and of rags his dress And pallor ornamenting brow as though Twere wanness such as waning crescents show Wasted him prayer a through the long lived night And flooding tears ne er cease to dim his sight Memory of Him shall cheer his lonely room Th Almighty nearest is in nightly gloom The Refuge helpeth such Fakir in need Help e en the cattle and the winged breed Allah for sake of him of wrath is fain And for the grace of him shall fall the rain And if he pray one day for plague to stay Twill stay and bate man s wrong and tyrants slay While folk are sad afflicted one and each He in his mercy s rich the generous leach Bright shines his brow an thou regard his face Thy heart illumined shines by light of grace O thou who shunnest souls of worth innate Departs thee woe to thee of sins the weight Thou thinkest to overtake them while thou bearest Follies which slay thee whatso way thou farest Didst wot their worth thou hadst all honour showed And tears in streamlets from thine eyes had flowed To catarrh troubled men flowers lack their smell And brokers ken for how much clothes can sell So haste and with thy Lord reunion sue And haply Fate shall lend thee aidance due Rest from rejection and estrangement stress And Joy thy wish and will shall choicely bless His court wide open for the suer is dight One very God the Lord th Almighty might And they also tell a tale of THE QUEEN OF THE SERPENTS FN five hundred seven There was once in days of yore and in ages and times long gone before a Grecian sage called Daniel who had disciples and scholars and the wise men of Greece were obedient to his bidding and relied upon his learning Withal had Allah denied him a man child One night as he lay musing and weeping over the lack of a son who might inherit his lore he bethought him that Allah extolled and exalted be He heareth the prayer of those who resort to Him and that there is no doorkeeper at the door of His bounties and that He favoureth whom He will without compt and sendeth no supplicant empty away nay He filleth their hands with favours and benefits So he besought the Almighty the Bountiful to vouchsafe him a son to succeed him and to endow him abundantly with His beneficence Then he returned home and carnally knew his wife who conceived by him the same night And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Grecian sage returned home and knew his wife who conceived by him the same night A few days after this he took ship for a certain place but the ship was wrecked and he saved himself on one of her planks while only five leaves remained to him of all the books he had When he returned home he laid the five leaves in a box and locking it gave the key to his wife who then showed big with child and said to her Know that my decease is at hand and that the time draweth nigh for my translation from this abode temporal to the home which is eternal Now thou art with child and after my death wilt haply bear a son if this be so name him Hasib Karim al Din FN five hundred eight and rear him with the best of rearing When the boy shall grow up and shall say to thee What inheritance did my father leave me give him these five leaves which when he shall have read and understood he will be the most learned man of his time Then he farewelled her and heaving one sigh departed the world and all that is therein the mercy of Allah the Most Highest be upon Him His family and friends wept over him and washed him and bore him forth in great state and buried him after which they wended their ways home But few days passed ere his widow bare a handsome boy and named him Hasib Karim al Din as her husband charged her and immediately after his birth she summoned the astrologers who calculated his ascendants and drawing his horoscope said to her Know O woman that this birth will live many a year but that will be after a great peril in the early part of his life wherefrom can he escape he will be given the knowledge of all the exact sciences So saying they went their ways She suckled him two years FN five hundred nine then weaned him and when he was five years old she placed him in a school to learn his book but he would read nothing So she took him from school and set him to learn a trade but he would not master any craft and there came no work from his hands The mother wept over this and the folk said to her Marry him haply he will take heart for his wife and learn him a trade So she sought out a girl and married him to her but despite marriage and the lapse of time he remained idle as before and would do nothing One day some neighbours of hers who were woodcutters came to her and said Buy thy son an ass and cords and an axe and let him go with us to the mountain and we will all of us cut wood for fuel The price of the wood shall be his and ours and he shall provide thee and his wife with his share When she heard this she joyed with exceeding joy and bought her son an ass and cords and hatchet then carrying him to the woodcutters delivered him into their hands and solemnly committed him to their care Said they Have no concern for the boy our Lord will provide for him he is the son of our Shaykh So they carried him to the mountain where they cut firewood and loaded their asses therewith then returned to the city and selling what they had cut spent the monies on their families This they did on the next day and the third and ceased not for some time till it chanced one day a violent storm of rain broke over them and they took refuge in a great cave till the downfall should pass away Now Hasib Karim al Din went apart from the rest into a corner of the cavern and sitting down fell to smiting the floor with his axe Presently he noted that the ground sounded hollow under the hatchet so he dug there awhile and came to a round flagstone with a ring in it When he saw this he was glad and called his comrades the woodcutters And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasib Karim al Din saw the flagstone with the ring he was glad and called his comrades the woodcutters who came to him and finding it was fact soon pulled up the stone and discovered under it a trap door which being opened showed a cistern full of bees honey FN five hundred ten Then said they to one another This is a large store and we have nothing for it but to return to the city and fetch vessels wherein to carry away the honey and sell it and divide the price whilst one of us stands by the cistern to guard it from outsiders Quoth Hasib I will stay and keep watch over it till you bring your pots and pans So they left him on guard there and repairing to the city fetched vessels which they filled with honey and loading their asses therewith carried them to the streets and sold the contents They returned on the morrow and thus they did several days in succession sleeping in the town by night and drawing off the stuff by day whilst Hasib abode on guard by it till but little remained when they said one to other It was Hasib Karim al Din found the honey and tomorrow he will come down to the city and complain against us and claim the price of it saying Twas I found it nor is there escape for us but that we let him down into the cistern to bale out the rest of the honey and leave him there so will he die of hunger and none shall know of him They all fell in with this plot as they were making for the place and when they reached it one said to him O Hasib go down into the pit and bale out for us the rest of the honey So he went down and passed up to them what remained of the honey after which he said to them Draw me up for there is nothing left They made him no answer but loading their asses went off to the city and left him alone in the cistern Thereupon he fell to weeping and crying There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Such was his case but as regards his comrades when they reached the city and sold the honey they repaired to Hasib s mother weeping and said to her May thy head outlive thy son Hasib She asked What brought about his death and they answered We were cutting wood on the mountain top when there fell on us a heavy downfall of rain and we took shelter from it in a cavern and suddenly thy son s ass broke loose and fled into the valley and he ran after it to turn it back when there came out upon them a great wolf who tore thy son in pieces and ravined the ass When the mother heard this she beat her face and strewed dust on her head and fell to mourning for her son and she kept life and soul together only by the meat and drink which they brought her every day As for the woodcutters they opened them shops and became merchants and spent their lives in eating and drinking and laughing and frolicking Meanwhile Hasib Karim al Din who ceased not to weep and call for help sat down upon the cistern edge when behold a great scorpion fell down on him so he rose and killed it Then he took thought and said The cistern was full of honey how came this scorpion here Accordingly he got up and examined the well right and left till he found a crevice from which the scorpion had fallen and saw the light of day shining through it So he took out his woodman s knife and enlarged the hole till it was big as a window then he crept through it and after walking for some time came to a vast gallery which led him to a huge door of black iron bearing a padlock of silver wherein was a key of gold He stole up to the door and looking through the chink saw a great light shining within so he took the key and opening the door went on for some time till he came to a large artificial lake wherein he caught sight of something that shimmered like silver He walked up to it and at last he saw hard by a hillock of green jasper and on the hill top a golden throne studded with all manner gems And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Hasib reached the hillock he found it of green jasper surmounted by a golden throne studded with all manner gems round which were set many stools some of gold some of silver and others of leek green emerald He clomb the hillock and counting the stools found them twelve thousand in number then he mounted the throne which was set on the centre and seating himself thereon fell to wondering at the lake and the stools and he marvelled till drowsiness overcame him and he drops asleep Presently he was aroused by a loud snorting and hissing and rustling so he opened his eyes and sitting up saw each stool occupied by a huge serpent an hundred cubits in length At this sight great fear get hold of him his spittle dried up for the excess of his dread and he despaired of life as all their eyes were blazing like live coals Then he turned towards the lake and saw that what he had taken for shimmering water was a multitude of small snakes none knoweth their compt save Allah the Most High After awhile there came up to him a serpent as big as a mule bearing on its back a tray of gold wherein lay another serpent which shone like crystal and whose face was as that of a woman FN five hundred eleven and who spake with human speech And as soon as she was brought up to Hasib she saluted him and he returned the salutation There upon one of the serpents seated on the stools came up and lifting her off the tray set her on one of the seats and she cried out to the other serpents in their language whereupon they all fell down from their stools and did her homage But she signed to them to sit and they did so Then she addressed Hasib saying Have no fear of us O youth for I am the Queen of the Serpents and their Sultanah When he heard her speak on this wise he took heart and she bade the serpents bring him somewhat of food FN five hundred twelve So they brought apples and grapes and pomegranates and pistachio nuts and filberts and walnuts and almonds and bananas and set them before him and the Queen serpent said Welcome O youth What is thy name Answered he Hasib Karim al Din and she rejoined O Hasib eat of these fruits for we have no other meat and fear thou have nothing from us at all Hearing this he ate his fill and praised Allah Almighty and presently they took away the trays from before him and the Queen said Tell me O Hasib whence thou art and how camest thou hither and what hath befallen thee So he told her his story from first to last the death of his father his birth his being sent to school where he learnt nothing his becoming a wood cutter his finding the honey cistern his being abandoned therein his killing the scorpion his widening the crevice his finding the iron door and his coming upon the Queen and he ended his long tale with saying These be my adventures from beginning to end and only Allah wotteth what will betide me after all this Quoth the Queen after listening to his words Nothing save good shall betide thee And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Serpent queen had heard his story she said Nothing save good shall betide thee but I would have thee O Hasib abide with me some time that I may tell thee my history and acquaint thee with the wondrous adventures which have happened to me I hear and obey thy hest answered he and she began to tell in these words The Adventures of Bulukiya Know thou O Hasib there was once in the city of Cairo a King of the Banu Isra il a wise and a pious who was bent double by poring over books of learning and he had a son named Bulukiya When he grew old and weak and was nigh upon death his Grandees and Officers of state came up to salute him and he said to them O folk know that at hand is the hour of my march from this world to the next and I have no charge to lay on you save to commend to your care my son Bulukiya Then said he I testify that there is no god save the God and heaving one sigh departed the world the mercy of Allah be upon him They laid him out and washed him and buried him with a procession of great state Then they made his son Bulukiya Sultan in his stead and he ruled the kingdom justly and the people had peace in his time Now it befell one day that he entered his father s treasuries to look about him and coming upon an inner compartment and finding the semblance of a door opened it and passed in And lo he found himself in a little closet wherein stood a column of white marble on the top of which was a casket of ebony he opened this also and saw therein another casket of gold containing a book He read the book and found in it an account of our lord Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve and how he should be sent in the latter days FN five hundred thirteen and be the lord of the first Prophets and the last On seeing the personal description Bulukiya s heart was taken with love of him so he at once assembled all the notables of the Children of Israel the Cohens or diviners the scribes and the priests and acquainted them with the book reading portions of it to them and adding O folk needs must I bring my father out of his grave and burn him The lieges asked Why wilt thou burn him and he answered Because he hid this book from me and imparted it not to me Now the old King had excerpted it from the Torah or Pentateuch and the Books of Abraham and had set it in one of his treasuries and concealed it from all living Rejoined they O King thy father is dead his body is in the dust and his affair is in the hands of his Lord thou shalt not take him forth of his tomb So he knew that they would not suffer him to do this thing by his sire and leaving them he repaired to his mother to whom said he O my mother I have found in one of my father s treasuries a book containing a description of Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep a prophet who shall be sent in the latter days and my heart is captivated with love of him Wherefore am I resolved to wander over the earth till I foregather with him else I shall die of longing for his love Then he doffed his clothes and donned an Aba gown of goat s hair and coarse sandals saying O my mother forget me not in thy prayers She wept over him and said What will become of us after thee but Bulukiya answered I can endure no longer and I commit my affair and thine to Allah who is Almighty Then he set out on foot Syria wards without the knowledge of any of his folk and coming to the sea board found a vessel whereon he shipped as one of the crew They sailed till he made an island where Bulukiya landed with the crew but straying away from the rest he sat down under a tree and sleep got the better of him When he awoke he sought the ship but found that she had set sail without him and in that island he saw serpents as big as camels and palm trees which repeated the names of Allah be He extolled and exalted and blessed Mohammed whom the Lord assain and save proclaiming the Unity and glorifying the Glorious whereat he wondered And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Bulukiya saw the serpents glorifying God and proclaiming the Unity he wondered with extreme wonder When they saw him they flocked to him and one of them said to him Who and whence art thou and whither goest thou and what is thy name Quoth he My name is Bulukiya I am of the Children of Israel and being distracted for love of Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep I come in quest of him But who are ye O noble creatures Answered they We are of the dwellers in the Jahannam hell and Almighty Allah created us for the punishment of Kafirs And how came ye hither asked he and the Serpents answered Know O Bulukiya that Hell FN five hundred fourteen of the greatness of her boiling breatheth twice a year expiring in the summer and inspiring in the winter and hence the summer heat and winter cold When she exhaleth she casteth us forth of her maw and we are drawn in again with her inhaled breath Quoth Bulukiya Say me are there greater serpents than you in Hell and they said Of a truth we are cast out with the expired breath but by reason of our smallness for in Hell every serpent is so great that were the biggest of us to pass over its nose it would not feel us FN five hundred fifteen Asked Bulukiya Ye sing the praises of Allah and invoke blessings on Mohammed whom the Almighty assain and save Whence wot ye of Mohammed and they answered O Bulukiya verily his name is written on the gates of Paradise and but for him Allah had not created the worlds FN five hundred sixteen nor Paradise nor heaven nor hell nor earth for He made all things that be solely on his account and hath conjoined his name with His own in every place wherefore we love Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve Now hearing the serpents converse did but inflame Bulukiya s love for Mohammed and yearning for his sight so he took leave of them and making his way to the sea shore found there a ship made fast to the beach he embarked therein as a seaman and sailed nor ceased sailing till he came to another island Here he landed and walking about awhile found serpents great and small none knoweth their number save Almighty Allah and amongst them a white Serpent clearer than crystal seated in a golden tray borne on the back of another serpent as big as an elephant Now this O Hasib was the Serpent queen none other than myself Quoth Hasib And what answer didst thou make him Quoth she Know O Hasib that when I saw Bulukiya I saluted him with the salam and he returned my salutation and I said to him Who and what art thou and what is thine errand and whence comest thou and whither goest thou Answered he I am of the Children of Israel my name is Bulukiya and I am a wanderer for the love of Mohammed whose description I have read in the revealed scriptures and of whom I go in search But what art thou and what are these serpents about thee Quoth I O Bulukiya I am the Queen of the Serpents and when thou shalt foregather with Mohammed whom Allah assain and save bear him my salutation Then Bulukiya took leave of me and journeyed till he came to the Holy City which is Jerusalem Now there was in that stead a man who was deeply versed in all sciences more especially in geometry and astronomy and mathematics as well as in white magic FN five hundred seventeen and Spiritualism and he had studied the Pentateuch and the Evangel and the Psalms and the Books of Abraham His name was Affan and he had found in certain of his books that whoso should wear the seal ring of our lord Solomon men and Jinn and birds and beasts and all created things would be bound to obey him Moreover he had discovered that our lord Solomon had been buried in a coffin which was miraculously transported beyond the Seven Seas to the place of burial And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Affan had found in certain books that none mortal or spirit could pluck the seal ring from the lord Solomon s finger and that no navigator could sail his ship upon the Seven Seas over which the coffin had been carried Moreover he had found out by reading that there was a herb of herbs and that if one express its juice and anoint therewith his feet he should walk upon the surface of any sea that Allah Almighty had created without wetting his soles but none could obtain this herb without he had with him the Serpent queen When Bulukiya arrived at the Holy City he at once sat down to do his devotions and worship the Lord and whilst he was so doing Affan came up and saluted him as a True Believer Then seeing him reading the Pentateuch and adoring the Almighty he accosted him saying What is thy name O man and whence comest thou and whither goest thou He answered My name is Bulukiya I am from the city of Cairo and am come forth wandering in quest of Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve Quoth Affan Come with me to my lodging that I may entertain thee To hear is to obey replied Bulukiya So the devotee took him by the hand and carried him to his house where he entreated him with the utmost honour and presentry said to him Tell me thy history O my brother and how thou camest by the knowledge of Mohammed whom Allah assain and save that thy heart hath been taken with love of him and compelled thee to fare forth and seek him and lastly tell me who it was directed thee in this road So he related to him his tale in its entirety whereupon Affan who well nigh lost his wits for wonder said to him Make tryst for me with the Queen of the Serpents and I will bring thee in company with Mohammed albeit the date of his mission is yet far distant We have only to prevail upon the Queen and carry her in a cage to a certain mountain where the herbs grow and as long as she is with us the plants as we pass them will parley with human speech and discover their virtues by the ordinance of Allah the Most High For I have found in my books that there is a certain herb and all who express its juice and anoint therewith their feet shall walk upon whatsoever sea Almighty Allah hath made without wetting sole When we have found the magical herb we will let her go her way and then will we anoint our feet with the juice and cross the Seven Seas till we come to the burial place of our lord Solomon Then we will take the ring off his finger and rule even as he ruled and win all our wishes we will enter the Main of Murks FN five hundred eighteen and drink of the Water of Life and so the Almighty will let us tarry till the End of Time and we shall foregather with Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve Hearing these words Bulukiya replied O Affan I will make tryst for thee with the Serpent queen and at once show thee her abiding place So Affan made him a cage of iron and providing himself with two bowls one full of wine and the other of milk took ship with Bulukiya and sailed till they came to the island where they landed and walked upon it Then Affan set up the cage in which he laid a noose and withdrew after placing in it the two bowls when he and Bulukiya concealed themselves afar off Presently up came the Queen of the Serpents that is myself and examined the cage When she that is I smelt the savour of the milk she came down from the back of the snake which bore her tray and entering the cage drank up the milk Then she went to the bowl of wine and drank of it whereupon her head became giddy and she slept When Affan saw this he ran up and locking the cage upon her set it on his head and made for the ship he and Bulukiya After awhile she awoke and finding herself in a cage of iron on a man s head and seeing Bulukiya walking beside the bearer said to him This is the reward of those who do no hurt to the sons of Adam Answered he O Queen have no fear of us for we will do thee no hurt at all We wish thee only to show us the herb which when pounded and squeezed yieldeth a juice and this rubbed upon the feet conferreth the power of walking dryshod upon what sea soever Almighty Allah hath created and when we have found that we will return thee to thy place and let thee wend thy way Then Affan and Bulukiya fared on for the hills where grew the herbs and as they went about with the Queen each plant they passed began to speak and avouch its virtues by permission of Allah the Most High As they were thus doing and the herbs speaking right and left behold a plant spoke out and said I am the herb ye seek and all who gather and crush me and anoint their feet with my juice shall fare over what sea soever Allah Almighty hath created and yet ne er wet sole When Affan heard this he set down the cage from his head and gathering what might suffice them of the herb crushed it and filling two vials with the juice kept them for future use and with what was left they anointed their feet Then they took up the Serpent queen s cage and journeyed days and nights till they reached the island where they opened the cage and let out her that is me When I found myself at liberty I asked them what use they would make of the juice and they answered We design to anoint our feet and to cross the Seven Seas to the burial place of our lord Solomon FN five hundred nineteen and take the seal ring from his finger Quoth I Far far is it from your power to possess yourselves of the ring They enquired Wherefore and I replied Because Almighty Allah vouchsafed unto our lord Solomon the gift of this ring and distinguished him thereby for that he said to him O Lord give me a kingdom which may not be obtained after me for Thou verily art the Giver of kingdoms FN five hundred twenty So that ring is not for you And I added Had ye twain taken the herb whereof all who eat shall not die until the First Blast FN five hundred twenty one it had better availed you than this ye have gotten for ye shall nowise come at your desire thereby Now when they heard this they repented them with exceeding penitence and went their ways And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Eighty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Bulukiya and Affan heard these words they repented them with exceeding penitence and went their ways Such was their case but as regards myself continued the Serpent queen I went in quest of my host and found it fallen in piteous case the stronger of them having grown weak in my absence and the weaker having died When they saw me they rejoiced and flocking about me asked What hath befallen thee and where hast thou been So I told them what had passed after which I gathered my forces to ether and repaired with them to the mountain Kaf where I was wont to winter summer freshing in the place where thou now seest me O Hasib Karim al Din This then is my story and what befell me Thereupon Hasib marvelled at her words and said to her I beseech thee of thy favour bid one of thy guards bear me forth to the surface of the earth that I may go to my people She replied O Hasib thou shalt not have leave to depart from us till winter come and needs must thou go with us to the Mountain Kaf and solace thyself with the sight of the hills and sands and trees and birds magnifying the One God the Victorious and look upon Marids and Ifrits and Jinn whose number none knoweth save Almighty Allah When Hasib heard this he was sore chafed and chagrined then he said to her Tell me of Affan and Bulukiya when they departed from thee and went their way did they cross the Seven Seas and reach the burial place of our lord Solomon or not and if they did had they power to take the ring or not Answered she Know that when they left me they anointed their feet with the juice and walking over the water fared on from sea to sea diverting themselves with the wonders of the deep nor ceased they faring till they had traversed the Seven Seas and came in sight of a mountain soaring high in air whose stones were emeralds and whose dust was musk and in it was a stream of running water When they made it they rejoiced saying each to the other Verily we have won our wish and they entered the passes of the mountain and walked on till they saw from afar a cavern surmounted by a great dome shining with light So they made for the cavern and entering it beheld therein a throne of gold studded with all manner jewels and about it stools whose number none knoweth save Allah Almighty And they saw lying at full length upon the throne our lord Solomon clad in robes of green silk inwoven with gold and broidered with jewels and precious minerals his right hand was passed over his breast and on the middle finger was the seal ring whose lustre outshone that of all other gems in the place Then Affan taught Bulukiya adjurations and conjurations galore and said to him Repeat these conjurations and cease not repeating until I take the ring Then he went up to the throne but as he drew near unto it lo c mighty serpent came forth from beneath it and cried out at him with so terrible a cry that the whole place trembled and sparks flew from its mouth saying Begone or thou art a dead man But Affan busied himself with his incantations and suffered himself not to be startled thereby Then the serpent blew such a fiery blast at him that the place was like to be set on fire and said to him Woe to thee Except thou turn back I will consume thee Hearing these words Bulukiya left the cave but Affan who suffered himself not to be troubled went up to the Prophet then he put out his hand to the ring and touched it and strove to draw it off the lord Solomon s finger and behold the serpent blew on him once more and he became a heap of ashes Such was his case but as regards Bulukiya he fell down in a swoon And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninetieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen continued When Bulukiya saw Affan burnt up by the fire and become a heap of ashes he fell down in a swoon Thereupon the Lord magnified be His Majesty bade Gabriel descend earthwards and save him ere the serpent should blow on him So Gabriel descended without delay and finding Affan reduced to ashes and Bulukiya in a fit aroused him from his trance and saluting him asked How camest thou hither Bulukiya related to him his history from first to last adding Know that I came not hither but for the love of Mohammed whom Allah assain and save of whom Affan informed me that his mission would take place at the End of Time moreover that none should foregather with him but those who endured to the latter days by drinking of the Water of Life through means of Solomon s seal So I companied him hither and there befell him what befell but I escaped the fire and now it is my desire that thou inform me where Mohammed is to be found Quoth Gabriel O Bulukiya go thy ways for the time of Mohammed s coming is yet far distant Then he ascended up to heaven forthright and Bulukiya wept with sore weeping and repented of that which he had done calling to mind my words whenas I said to them Far is it from man s power to possess himself of the ring Then he descended from the mountain and returned in exceeding confusion to the sea shore and passed the night there marvelling at the mountains and seas and islands around him When morning dawned he anointed his feet with the herb juice and descending to the water set out and fared on over the surface of the seas days and nights astonied at the terrors of the main and the marvels and wonders of the deep till he came to an island as it were the Garden of Eden So he landed and finding himself in a great and pleasant island paced about it and saw with admiration that its dust was saffron and its gravel carnelian and precious minerals its hedges were of jessamine its vegetation was of the goodliest of trees and of the brightest of odoriferous shrubs its brushwood was of Comorin and Sumatran aloes wood and its reeds were sugar canes Round about it were roses and narcissus and amaranths and gilly flowers and chamomiles and white lilies and violets and other flowers of all kinds and colours Of a truth the island was the goodliest place abounding in space rich in grace a compendium of beauty material and spiritual The birds warbled on the boughs with tones far sweeter than chaunt of Koran and their notes would console a lover whom longings unman And therein the gazelle frisked free and fain and wild cattle roamed about the plain Its trees were of tallest height its streams flowed bright its springs welled with waters sweet and light and all therein was a delight to sight and sprite Bulukiya marvelled at the charms of the island but knew that he had strayed from the way he had first taken in company with Affan He wandered about the place and solaced him with various spectacles until nightfall when he climbed into a tree to sleep but as he sat there musing over the beauty of the site behold the sea became troubled and there rose up to the surface a great beast which cried out with a cry so terrible that every living thing upon the isle trembled As Bulukiya gazed upon him from the tree and marvelled at the bigness of his bulk he was presently followed unexpectedly by a multitude of other sea beasts in kind manifolds each holding in his fore paw a jewel which shone like a lamp so that the whole island became as light as day for the lustre of the gems After awhile there appeared from the heart of the island wild beasts of the land none knoweth their number save Allah the Most High amongst which Bulukiya noted lions and panthers and lynxes and other ferals and these land beasts flocked down to the shore and foregathering with the sea beasts conversed with them till daybreak when they separated and each went his own way Thereupon Bulukiya terrified by what he had seen came down from the tree and making the sea shore anointed his feet with the magical juice and set out once more upon the surface of the water He fared on days and nights over the Second Sea till he came to a great mountain skirting which ran a Wady without end the stones whereof were magnetic iron and its beasts lions and hares and panthers He landed on the mountain foot and wandered from place to place till nightfall when he sat down sheltered by one of the base hills on the sea side to eat of the dried fish thrown up by the sea Presently he turned from his meal and behold a huge panther was creeping up to rend and ravin him so he anointed his feet in haste with the juice and descending to the surface of the water fled walking over the Third Sea in the darkness for the night was black and the wind blew stark Nor did he stay his course till he reached another island whereon he landed and found there trees bearing fruits both fresh and dry FN five hundred twenty two So he took of these fruits and ate and praised Allah Almighty after which he walked for solace about the island till eventide And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Bulukiya continued the Queen walked for solace about the island till eventide when he lay down to sleep As soon as day brake he began to explore the place and ceased not for ten days after which he again made the shore and anointed his feet and setting out over the Fourth Sea walked upon it many nights and days till he came to a third island of fine white sand without sign of trees or grass He walked about it awhile but finding its only inhabitants sakers which nested in the sand he again anointed his feet and trudged over the Fifth Sea walking night and day till he came to a little island whose soil and hills were like crystal Therein were the veins wherefrom gold is worked and therein also were marvellous trees whose like he had never seen in his wanderings for their blossoms were in hue as gold He landed and walked about for diversion till it was nightfall when the flowers began to shine through the gloom like stars Seeing this sight he marvelled and said Assuredly the flowers of this island are of those which wither under the sun and fall to the earth where the winds smite them and they gather under the rocks and become the Elixir FN five hundred twenty three which the folk collect and thereof make gold He slept there all that night and at sunrise he again anointed his feet and descending to the shore fared on over the Sixth Sea nights and days till he came to a fifth island Here he landed and found after walking an hour or so two mountains covered with a multitude of trees whose fruits were as men s heads hanging by the hair and others whose fruits were green birds hanging by the feet also a third kind whose fruits were like aloes if a drop of the juice fell on a man it burnt like fire and others whose fruits wept and laughed besides many other marvels which he saw there Then he returned to the sea shore and finding there a tall tree sat down beneath it till supper time when he climbed up into the branches to sleep As he sat considering the wonderful works of Allah behold the waters became troubled and there rose therefrom the daughters of the sea each mermaid holding in her hand a jewel which shone like the morning They came ashore and foregathering under the trees sat down and danced and sported and made merry whilst Bulukiya amused himself with watching and wondering at their gambols which were prolonged till the morning when they returned to the sea and disappeared Then he came down and anointing his feet set out on the surface of the Seventh Sea over which he journeyed two whole months without getting sight of highland or island or broadland or lowland or shoreland till he came to the end thereof And so doing he suffered exceeding hunger so that he was forced to snatch up fishes from the surface of the sea and devour them raw for stress of famine In such case he pushed on till in early forenoon he came to the sixth island with trees a growing and rills a flowing where he landed and walked about looking right and left till he came to an apple tree and put forth his hand to pluck of the fruit when lo one cried out to him from the tree saying An thou draw near to this tree and cut of it aught I will cut thee in twain So he looked and saw a giant forty cubits high being the cubit of the people of that day whereat he feared with sore fear and refrained from that tree Then said he to the giant Why cost thou forbid me to eat of this tree Replied the other Because thou art a son of Adam and thy father Adam forgot the covenant of Allah and sinned against Him and ate of the tree Quoth Bulukiya What thing art thou and to whom belongeth this island with its trees and how art thou named Quoth the tall one My name is Sharahiya and trees and island belong to King Sakhr FN five hundred twenty four I am one of his guards and in charge of his dominion presently adding But who art thou and whence comest thou hither Bulukiya told him his story from beginning to end and Sharahiya said Be of good cheer and brought him to eat So he ate his fill and taking leave of the giant set out again and ceased not faring on over the mountains and sandy deserts for ten days at the end of which time he saw in the distance a dust cloud hanging like a canopy in air and making towards it he heard a mighty clamour cries and blows and sounds of mellay Presently he reached a great Wady two months journey long and looking whence the shouts came he saw a multitude of horse men engaged in fierce fight and the blood running from them till it railed like a river Their voices were thunderous and they were armed with lance and sword and iron mace and bow and arrow and all fought with the utmost fury At this sight he felt sore affright And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen continued When Bulukiya saw the host in fight he felt sore affright and was perplexed about his case but whilst he hesitated behold they caught sight of him and held their hands one from other and left fighting Then a troop of them came up to him wondering at his make and one of the horsemen said to him What art thou and whence camest thou hither and whither art wending and who showed thee the way that thou hast come to our country Quoth he I am of the sons of Adam and am come out distracted for the love of Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve but I have wandered from my way Quoth the horseman Never saw we a son of Adam till now nor did any ever come to this land And all marvelled at him and at his speech But what are ye O creatures asked Bulukiya and the rider replied We are of the Jann So he said O Knight what is the cause of the fighting amongst you and where is your abiding place and what is the name of this valley and this land He replied Our abiding place is the White Country and every year Allah Almighty commandeth us to come hither and wage war upon the unbelieving Jann Asked Bulukiya And where is the White Country and the horseman answered It is behind the mountain Kaf and distant seventy five years journey from this place which is termed the Land of Shaddad son of Ad we are here for Holy War and we have no other business when we are not doing battle than to glorify God and hallow him More over we have a ruler King Sakhr highs and needs must thou go with us to him that he may look upon thee for his especial delight Then they fared on and he with them till they came to their abiding place where he saw a multitude of magnificent tents of green silk none knoweth their number save Allah the Most High and in their midst a pavilion of red satin some thousand cubits in compass with cords of blue silk and pegs of gold and silver Bulukiya marvelled at the sight and accompanied them as they fared on and behold this was the royal pavilion So they carried him into the presence of King Sakhr whom he found seated upon a splendid throne of red gold set with pearls and studded with gems the Kings and Princes of the Jann being on his right hand and on his left his Councillors and Emirs and Officers of state and a multitude of others The King seeing him bade introduce him which they did and Bulukiya went up to him and saluted him after kissing the ground before him The King returned his salute and said Draw near me O mortal and Bulukiya went close up to him Hereupon the King commanding a chair to be set for him by his royal side bade him sit down and asked him Who art thou and Bulukiya answered I am a man and one of the Children of Israel Tell me thy story cried King Sakhr and acquaint me with all that hath befallen thee and how thou camest to this my land So Bulukiya related to him all that had occurred in his wanderings from beginning to end And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen continued When Bulukiya related to Sakhr what befell him in his wanderings he marvelled thereat Then he bade the servants bring food and they spread the tables and set on one thousand and five hundred platters of red gold and silver and copper some containing twenty and some fifty boiled camels and others some fifty head of sheep at which Bulukiya marvelled with exceeding marvel Then they ate and he ate with them till he was satisfied and returned thanks to Allah Almighty after which they cleared the tables and set on fruits and they ate thereof glorifying the name of God and invoking blessings on His prophet Mohammed whom Allah bless and preserve When Bulukiya heard them make mention of Mohammed he wondered and said to King Sakhr I am minded to ask thee some questions Rejoined the King Ask what thou wilt and Bulukiya said O King what are ye and what is your origin and how came ye to know of Mohammed whom Allah assain and save that ye draw near to him and love him King Sakhr answered O Bulukiya of very sooth Allah created the fire in seven stages one above the other and each distant a thousand years journey from its neighbour The first stage he named Jahannam FN five hundred twenty five and appointed the same for the punishment of the transgressors of the True believers who die unrepentant the second he named Laza and appointed for Unbelievers the name of the third is Jahim and is appointed for Gog and Magog FN five hundred twenty six The fourth is called Sa ir and is appointed for the host of Iblis The fifth is called Sakar and is prepared for those who neglect prayer The sixth is called Hatamah and is appointed for Jews and Christians The seventh is named Hawiyah and is prepared for hypocrites Such be the seven stages Quoth Bulukiya Haply Jahannam hath least of torture for that it is the uppermost Yes quoth King Sakhr the most endurable of them all is Jahannam natheless in it are a thousand mountains of fire in each mountain seventy thousand cities of fire in each city seventy thousand castles of fire in each castle seventy thousand houses of fire in each house seventy thousand couches of fire and in each couch seventy thousand manners of torment As for the other hells O Bulukiya none knoweth the number of kinds of torment that be therein save Allah Most Highest When Bulukiya heard this he fell down in a fainting fit and when he came to himself he wept and said O King what will be my case Quoth Sakhr Fear not and know thou that whoso loveth Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep the fire shall not burn him for he is made free therefrom for his sake and whoso belongeth to his Faith the fire shall fly him As for us the Almighty Maker created us of the fire for the first that he made in Jahannam were two of His host whom he called Khalit and Malit Now Khalit was fashioned in the likeness of a lion with a tail like a tortoise twenty years journey in length and ending in a member masculine while Malit was like a pied wolf whose tail was furnished with a member feminine Then Almighty Allah commanded the tails to couple and copulate and do the deed of kind and of them were born serpents and scorpions whose dwelling is in the fire that Allah may there with torment those whom He casteth therein and these increased and multiplied Then Allah commanded the tails of Khalit and Malit to couple and copulate a second time and the tail of Malit conceived by the tail of Khalit and bore fourteen children seven male and seven female who grew up and intermarried one with the other All were obedient to their sire save one who disobeyed him and was changed into a worm which is Iblis the curse of Allah be upon him Now Iblis was one of the Cherubim for he had served Allah till he was raised to the heavens and cherished FN five hundred twenty seven by the especial favour of the Merciful One who made him chief of the Cherubim And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen continued Iblis served God and became chief of Cherubim When however the Lord created Adam with whom be peace He commanded Iblis to prostrate himself to him but he drew back so Allah Almighty expelled him from heaven and cursed him FN five hundred twenty eight This Iblis had issue and of his lineage are the devils and as for the other six males who were his elders they are the ancestors of the true believing Jann and we are their descendants Such O Bulukiya is our provenance FN five hundred twenty nine Bulukiya marvelled at the King s words and said O King I pray thee bid one of thy guards bear me back to my native land Naught of this may we do answered Sakhr save by commandment of Allah Almighty however an thou desire to leave us and return home I will mount thee on one of my mares and cause her carry thee to the farthest frontiers of my dominions where thou wilt meet with the troops of another King Barakhiya highs who will recognize the mare at sight and take thee off her and send her back to us and this is all we can do for thee and no more When Bulukiya heard these words he wept and said Do whatso thou wilt So King Sakhr caused bring the mare and setting Bulukiya on her back said to him Beware lest thou alight from her or strike her or cry out in her face for if thou do so she will slay thee but abide quietly riding on her back till she stop with thee then dismount and wend thy ways Quoth Bulukiya I hear and I obey he then mounted and setting out rode on a long while between the rows of tents and stinted not riding till he came to the royal kitchens where he saw the great cauldrons each holding fifty camels hung up over the fires which blazed fiercely under them So he stopped there and gazed with a marvel ever increasing till King Sakhr thinking him to be anhungered bade bring him two roasted camels and they carried them to him and bound them behind him on the mare s crupper Then he took leave of them and fared on till he came to the end of King Sakhr s dominions where the mare stood still and Bulukiya dismounted and began to shake the dust of the journey from his raiment And behold there accosted him a party of men who recognising the mare carried her and Bulukiya before their King Barakhiya So he saluted him and the King returned his greeting and seated him beside himself in a splendid pavilion in the midst of his troops and champions and vassal Princes of the Jann ranged to right and left after which he called for food and they ate their fill and pronounced the Alhamdolillah Then they set on fruits and when they had eaten thereof King Barakhiya whose estate was like that of King Sakhr asked his guest When didst thou leave King Sakhr And Bulukiya answered Two days ago Quoth Barakhiya Dost thou know how many days journey thou hast come in these two days Quoth he No and the King rejoined Thou hast come a journey of threescore and ten months And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen continued Barakhiya said to Bulukiya In two days thou hast come a journey of threescore and ten months moreover when thou mountedst the mare she was affrighted at thee knowing thee for a son of Adam and would have thrown thee so they bound on her back these two camels by way of weight to steady her When Bulukiya heard this he marvelled and thanked Allah Almighty for safety Then said the King Tell me thy adventures and what brought thee to this our land So he told him his story from first to last and the King marvelled at his words and kept Bulukiya with him two months Upon this Hasib Karim al Din after he had marvelled at her story again besought the Serpent queen saying I pray thee of thy goodness and graciousness command one of thy subjects conduct me to the surface of the earth that I may return to my family but she answered O Hasib I know that the first thing thou wilt do after seeing the face of the earth will be to greet thy family and then repair to the Hammam bath and bathe and the moment thou endest thine ablutions will see the last of me for it will be the cause of my death Quoth Hasib I swear that I will never again enter the Hammam bath so long as I live but when washing is incumbent on me I will wash at home Rejoined the Queen I would not trust thee though thou shouldst swear to me an hundred oaths for such abstaining is not possible and I know thee to be a son of Adam for whom no oath is sacred Thy father Adam made a covenant with Allah the most High who kneaded the clay whereof He fashioned him forty mornings and made His angels prostrate themselves to him yet after all his promise did he forget and his oath violate disobeying the commandment of his Lord When Hasib heard this he held his peace and burst into tears nor did he leave weeping for the space of ten days at the end of which time he said to the Queen Prithee acquaint me with the rest of Bulukiya s adventures Accordingly she began again as follows Know O Hasib that Bulukiya after abiding two months with King Barakhiya farewelled him and fared on over wastes and deserts nights and days till he came to a high mountain which he ascended On the summit he beheld seated a great Angel glorifying the names of God and invoking blessings on Mohammed Before him lay a tablet covered with characters these white and those black FN five hundred thirty whereon his eyes were fixed and his two wings were outspread to the full one to the western and the other to the eastern horizon Bulukiya approached and saluted the Angel who returned his salam adding Who art thou and whence comest thou and whither wendest thou and what is thy story Accordingly he repeated to him his history from first to last and the Angel marvelled mightily thereat whereupon Bulukiya said to him I pray thee in return acquaint me with the meaning of this tablet and what is writ thereon and what may be thine occupation and thy name Replied the Angel My name is Michael and I am charged with the shifts of night and day and this is my occupation till the Day of Doom Bulukiya wondered at his words and at his aspect and the vastness of his stature and taking leave of him fared onwards night and day till he came to a vast meadow over which he walked observing that it was traversed by seven streams and abounded in trees He was struck by its beauty and in one corner thereof he saw a great tree and under it four Angels So he drew near to them and found the first in the likeness of a man the second in the likeness of a wild beast the third in the likeness of a bird and the fourth in the likeness of a bull engaged in glorifying Almighty Allah and saying O my God and my Master and my Lord I conjure Thee by Thy truth and by the decree of Thy Prophet Mohammed on whom be blessings and peace to vouchsafe Thy mercy and grant Thy forgiveness to all things created in my likeness for Thou over all things art Almighty Bulukiya marvelled at what he heard but continued his journey till he came to another mountain and ascending it found there a great Angel seated on the summit glorifying God and hallowing Him and invoking blessings on Mohammed whom Allah assain and save and he saw that Angel continually opening and shutting his hands and bending and extending his fingers He accosted him and saluted him whereupon the Angel returned his salam and enquired who he was and how he came thither So Bulukiya acquainted him with his adventures including his having lost the way and besought him to tell him in turn who he was and what was his function and what mountain was that Quoth the Angel Know O Bulukiya that this is the mountain Kaf which encompasseth the world and all the countries the Creator hath made are in my grasp When the Almighty is minded to visit any land with earthquake or famine or plenty or slaughter or prosperity He biddeth me carry out His commands and I carry them out without stirring from my place for know thou that my hands lay hold upon the roots of the earth And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Queen continued When the angel said And know thou that my hands lay hold upon the roots of the earth he asked And hath Allah created other worlds than this within the mountain Kaf The Angel answered Yes He hath made a world white as silver whose vastness none knoweth save Himself and hath peopled it with Angels whose meat and drink are His praise and hallowing and continual blessings upon His Prophet Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep Every Thursday night FN five hundred thirty one they repair to this mountain and worship in congregation Allah until the morning and they assign the future recompense of their lauds and litanies to the sinners of the Faith of Mohammed whom Allah assain and save and to all who make the Ghusl ablution of Friday and this is their function until the Day of Resurrection Asked Bulukiya And hath Allah created other mountains behind the mountain Kaf whereto he answered Yes behind this mountain is a range of mountains five hundred years journey long of snow and ice and this it is that wardeth off the heat of Jahannam from the world which verily would else be consumed thereby Moreover behind the mountain Kaf are forty worlds each one the bigness of this world forty times told some of gold and some of silver and others of carnelian Each of these worlds hath its own colour and Allah hath peopled them with angels that know not Eve nor Adam nor night nor day and have no other business than to celebrate His praises and hallow Him and make profession of His Unity and proclaim His Omnipotence and supplicate Him on behalf of the followers of Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep And know also O Bulukiya that the earths were made in seven stages one upon another and that Allah hath created one of His Angels whose stature and attributes none knoweth but Himself and who beareth the seven stages upon his shoulders Under this Angel Almighty Allah hath created a great rock and under the rock a bull and under the bull a huge fish and under the fish a mighty ocean FN five hundred thirty two God once told Isa with whom be peace of this fish and he said O Lord show me the fish that I may look upon it So the Almighty commanded an angel to take Isa and show him the fish Accordingly he took him up and carried him with whom be peace to the sea wherein the fish dwelt and said Look O Isa upon the fish He looked but at first saw nothing when suddenly the fish darted past like lightning At this sight Isa fell down aswoon and when he came to himself Allah spake to him by inspiration saying O Isa hast thou seen the fish and comprehended its length and its breadth He replied By Thy honour and glory O Lord I saw no fish but there passed me by a great bull whose length was three days journey and I know not what manner of thing this bull is Quoth Allah O Isa this that thou sawest and which was three days in passing by thee was but the head of the fish FN five hundred thirty three and know that every day I create forty fishes like unto this And Isa hearing this marvelled at the power of Allah the Almighty Asked Bulukiya What hath Allah made beneath this sea which containeth the fish and the Angel answered Under the sea the Lord created a vast abyss of air under the air fire and under the fire a mighty serpent by name Falak and were it not for fear of the Most Highest this serpent would assuredly swallow up all that is above it air and fire and the Angel and his burden without sensing it And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Four Hundred and Ninety seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the angel said to Bulukiya when describing the serpent And were it not for fear of the Most Highest this serpent would assuredly swallow up all that is above it air and fire and the Angel and his burden without sensing it When Allah created this serpent He said to it by inspiration I will give thee somewhat to keep for me so open thy mouth The serpent replied Do whatso Thou wilt and opened his mouth and God placed Hell into his maw saying Keep it until the Day of Resurrection When that time comes the Almighty will send His angels with chains to bring Hell and bind it until the Day when all men shall meet and the Lord will order Hell to go open its gates and there will issue therefrom sparks bigger than the mountains When Bulukiya heard these things he wept with sore weeping and taking leave of the Angel fared on westwards till he came in sight of two creatures sitting before a great shut gate As he drew near he saw that one of the gatekeepers had the semblance of a lion and the other that of a bull so he saluted them and they returned his salam and enquired who and whence he was and whither he was bound Quoth he I am of the sons of Adam a wanderer for the love of Mohammed whom Allah assain and save and I have strayed from my way Then he asked them what they were and what was the gate before which they sat and they answered We are the guardians of this gate thou seest and we have no other business than the praise and hallowing of Allah and the invocation of blessings on Mohammed whom may He bless and keep Bulukiya wondered and asked them What is within the gate and they answered We wot not Then quoth he I conjure you by the truth of your glorious Lord open to me the gate that I may see that which is therein Quoth they We cannot and none may open this gate of all created beings save Gabriel the Faithful One with whom be peace Then Bulukiya lifted up his voice in supplication to Allah saying O Lord send me thy messenger Gabriel the Faithful One to open for me this gate that I may see what be therein and the Almighty gave ear unto his prayer and commanded the Archangel to descend to earth and open to him the gate of the Meeting place of the Two Seas 
6494_60800_000001_000004	train-clean-360	So Gabriel descended and saluting Bulukiya opened the gate to him saying Enter this door for Allah commandeth me to open to thee So he entered and Gabriel locked the gate behind him and flew back to heaven 
6494_60800_000001_000005	train-clean-360	When Bulukiya found himself within the gate he looked and beheld a vast ocean half salt and half fresh bounded on every side by mountain ranges of red ruby whereon he saw angels singing the praises of the Lord and hallowing Him

6494_60800_000009_000008	train-clean-360	They all ran at her to take her as their quarry but she escaped from them and throwing herself into the waves And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say 
6494_60801_000002_000000	train-clean-360	When it was the Five Hundred and First Night 
none	none	She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Janshah and the Mamelukes ran at the gazelle to take her as their quarry she escaped from them and throwing herself into the waves swam out to a fishing bark that was moored near the shore and sprang on board Janshah and his followers dismounted and boarding the boat made prize of the gazelle and were minded to return to shore with her when the Prince espied a great island in the offing and said to his merry men I have a longing to visit yonder island They answered We hear and obey and sailed on till they came to the island where they landed and amused themselves with exploring the place 
6494_60801_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Then they again embarked and taking with them the gazelle set out to return homeward but the murk of evening overtook them and they missed their way on the main 
6494_60801_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Moreover a strong wind arose and crave the boat into mid ocean so that when they awoke in the morning they found themselves lost at sea 
none	none	Such was their case but as regards King Teghmus when he missed his son he commanded his troops to make search for him in separate bodies so they dispersed on all sides and a company of them coming to the sea shore found there the Prince s white slave whom he had left in charge of the horses They asked him what was become of his master and the other six and he told them what had passed whereupon they took him with them and returned to the King and acquainted him with what they had learnt When Teghmus heard their report he wept with sore weeping and cast the crown from his head biting his hands for vexation 
6494_60801_000003_000007	train-clean-360	Then he rose forthright and wrote letters and despatched them to all the islands of the sea 
none	none	Moreover he got together an hundred ships and filling them with troops sent them to sail about in quest of Janshah while he himself withdrew with his troops to his capital where he abode in sore concern As for Janshah s mother when she heard of his loss she buffeted her face and began the mourning ceremonies for her son making sure that he was dead Meanwhile Janshah and his men ceased not driving before the wind and those in search of them cruised about for ten days till finding no trace they returned and reported failure to the King 
6494_60801_000003_000011	train-clean-360	But a stiff gale caught the Prince s craft which went spooning till they made a second island where they landed and walked about 
6494_60801_000003_000012	train-clean-360	Presently they came upon a spring of running water in the midst of the island and saw from afar a man sitting hard by it 
none	none	So they went up to him and saluted him and he returned their salam speaking in a voice like the whistle FN five hundred thirty eight of birds Whilst Janshah stood marvelling at the man s speech he looked right and left and suddenly split himself in twain and each half went a different way FN five hundred thirty nine Then there came down from the hills a multitude of men of all kinds beyond count and reckoning and they no sooner reached the spring than each one divided into two halves and rushed on Janshah and his Mamelukes to eat them 
6494_60801_000003_000015	train-clean-360	When the voyagers saw this they turned and fled seawards but the cannibals pursued them and caught and ate three of the slaves leaving only three slaves who with Janshah reached the boat in safety then launching her made for the water and sailed nights and days without knowing whither their ship went 
6494_60801_000003_000016	train-clean-360	They killed the gazelle and lived on her flesh till the winds drove them to a third island which was full of trees and waters and flower gardens and orchards laden with all fashion of fruits and streams strayed under the tree shade brief the place was a Garden of Eden 
6494_60801_000003_000017	train-clean-360	The island pleased the Prince and he said to his companions Which of you will land and explore Then said one of the slaves That will I do but he replied This thing may not be you must all land and explore the place while I abide in the boat So he set them ashore And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say 
none	none	When it was the Five Hundred and Second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Prince set them ashore and they searched the island East and West but found no one then they fared on inland to the heart thereof till they came to a Castle compassed about with ramparts of white marble within which was a palace of the clearest crystal and set in its centre a garden containing all manner fruits beyond description both fresh and dry and flowers of grateful odour and trees and birds singing upon the boughs Amiddlemost the garden was a vast basin of water and beside it a great open hall with a raised dais whereon stood a number of stools surrounding a throne of red gold studded with all kinds of jewels and especially rubies and seeing the beauty of the Castle and of the Garden they entered and explored in all directions but found no one there so after rummaging the Castle they returned to Janshah and told him what they had seen 
6494_60801_000005_000002	train-clean-360	When he heard their report he cried Needs must I solace myself with a sight of it so he landed and accompanied them to the palace which he entered marvelling at the goodliness of the place 
none	none	They then visited every part of the gardens and ate of the fruits and continued walking till it waxed dark when they returned to the estrade and sat down Janshah on the throne in the centre and the three others on the stools ranged to the right and left Then the Prince there seated called to mind his separation from his father s throne city FN five hundred forty and country and friends and kinsfolk and fell a weeping and lamenting over their loss whilst his men wept around him 
6494_60801_000005_000005	train-clean-360	And as they were thus sorrowing behold they heard a mighty clamour that came from seaward and looking in the direction of the clamour saw a multitude of apes as they were swarming locusts 
none	none	Now the castle and the island belonged to these apes who finding the strangers boat moored to the strand had scuttled it and after repaired to the palace where they came upon Janshah and his men seated Here the Serpent queen again broke off her recital saying All this O Hasib was told to Bulukiya by the young man sitting between the two tombs Quoth Hasib And what did Janshah do with the apes so the Queen resumed her tale He and his men were sore affrighted at the appearance of the apes but a company of them came up to the throne whereon he sat and kissing the earth before him stood awhile in his presence with their paws upon their breasts in posture of respect Then another troop brought to the castle gazelles which they slaughtered and skinned and roasting pieces of the flesh till fit for food they laid them on platters of gold and silver and spreading the table made signs to Janshah and his men to eat 
6494_60801_000005_000008	train-clean-360	The Prince and his followers came down from their seats and ate and the apes ate with them till they were satisfied when the apes took away the meat and set on fruits of which they partook and praised Allah the most Highest 
6494_60801_000005_000009	train-clean-360	Then Janshah asked the apes by signs what they were and to whom the palace belonged and they answered him by signals Know ye that this island belonged of yore to our lord Solomon son of David on both of whom be peace and he used to come hither once every year for his solace And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say 
none	none	When it was the Five Hundred and Third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Janshah asked the apes by signs to whom the palace belonged they answered him by signals Of a truth this place belonged of yore to our lord Solomon son of David on both of whom be peace who used to come hither once every year for his solace and then wend his ways Presently the apes continued And know O King that thou art become our Sultan and we are thy servants so eat and drink and whatso thou ever bid us that will we do So saying they severally kissed the earth between the hands of Janshah and all took their departure 
6494_60801_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The Prince slept that night on the throne and his men on the stools about him and on the morrow at daybreak the four Wazirs or Captains of the apes presented themselves before him attended by their troops who ranged themselves about him rank after rank until the place was crowded 
6494_60801_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Then the Wazirs approached and exhorted him by signs to do justice amongst them and rule them righteously after which the apes cried out to one another and went away all save a small party which remained in presence to serve him 
none	none	After awhile there came up a company of apes with huge dogs in the semblance of horses each wearing about his head a massive chain and signed to Janshah and his three followers to mount and go with them 
6494_60801_000007_000004	train-clean-360	So they mounted marvelling at the greatness of the dogs and rode forth attended by the four Wazirs and a host of apes like swarming locusts some riding on dogs and others afoot till they came to the sea shore 
none	none	Janshah looked for the boat which brought him and finding it scuttled turned to the Wazirs and asked how this had happened to it whereto they answered Know O King that when thou camest to our island we kenned that thou wouldst be Sultan over us and we feared lest ye all flee from us in our absence and embark in the boat so we sank it When Janshah heard this he turned to his Mamelukes and said to them We have no means of escaping from these apes and we must patiently await the ordinance of the Almighty Then they fared on inland and ceased not faring till they came to the banks of a river on whose other side rose a high mountain whereon Janshah saw a multitude of Ghuls 
6494_60801_000007_000006	train-clean-360	So he turned to the apes and asked them What are these Ghuls and they answered Know O King that these Ghuls are our mortal foes and we come hither to do battle with them Janshah marvelled to see them riding horses and was startled at the vastness of their bulk and the strangeness of their semblance for some of them had heads like bulls and others like camels 
none	none	As soon as the Ghuls espied the army of the apes they charged down to the river bank and standing there fell to pelting them with stones as big as maces and between them there befell a sore fight Presently Janshah seeing that the Ghuls were getting the better of the apes cried out to his men saying Unease your bows and arrows and shoot at them your best shafts and keep them off from us They did so and slew of the Ghuls much people when there fell upon them sore dismay and they turned to flee but the apes seeing Janshah s prowess forded the river and headed by their Sultan chased the Ghuls killing many of them in the pursuit till they reached the high mountain where they disappeared 
6494_60801_000007_000009	train-clean-360	And while exploring the said mountain Janshah found a tablet of alabaster whereon was written O thou who enterest this land know that thou wilt become Sultan over these apes and that from them there is no escape for thee except by the passes that run east and west through the mountains 
none	none	If thou take the eastern pass thou wilt fare through a country swarming with Ghuls and wild beasts Marids and Ifrits and thou wilt come after three months journeying to the ocean which encompasseth the earth but if thou travel by the western pass it will bring thee after four months journeying to the head of the Wady of Emmets FN five hundred forty one When thou hast followed the road that leads through this mountain ten days And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say 
6494_60801_000008_000000	train-clean-360	When it was the Five Hundred and Fourth Night 
none	none	She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Janshah read this much upon the tablet and found at the end of the inscription Then thou wilt come to a great river whose current is so swift that it blindeth the eyes Now this river drieth up every Sabbath FN five hundred forty two and on the opposite bank lies a city wholly inhabited by Jews who the faith of Mohammed refuse there is not a Moslem among the band nor is there other than this city in the land 
6494_60801_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Better therefore lord it over the apes for so long as thou shalt tarry amongst them they will be victorious over the Ghuls 
6494_60801_000009_000003	train-clean-360	And know also that he who wrote this tablet was the lord Solomon son of David on both be peace When Janshah read these words he wept sore and repeated them to his men 
6494_60801_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Then they mounted again and surrounded by the army of the apes who were rejoicing in their victory returned to the castle 
6494_60801_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Here Janshah abode Sultaning over them for a year and a half 
none	none	And at the end of this time he one day commanded the ape army to mount and go forth a hunting with him and they rode out into the woods and wilds and fared on from place to place till they approached the Wady of Emmets which Janshah knew by the description of it upon the alabaster tablet Here he bade them dismount and they all abode there eating and drinking a space of ten days after which Janshah took his men apart one night and said I purpose we flee through the Valley of Emmets and make for the town of the Jews it may be Allah will deliver us from these apes and we will go God s ways They replied We hear and we obey so he waited till some little of the night was spent then donning his armour and girding his sword and dagger and such like weapons and his men doing likewise they set out and fared on westwards till morning 
6494_60801_000009_000008	train-clean-360	When the apes awoke and missed Janshah and his men they knew that they had fled 
6494_60801_000009_000009	train-clean-360	So they mounted and pursued them some taking the eastern pass and others that which led to the Wady of Emmets nor was it long before the apes came in sight of the fugitives as they were about to enter the valley and hastened after them 
none	none	When Janshah and his men saw them they fled into the Emmet valley but the apes soon overtook them and would have slain them when behold there rose out of the earth a multitude of ants like swarming locusts as big as dogs and charged home upon the apes 
6494_60801_000009_000011	train-clean-360	They devoured many of their foes and these also slew many of the ants but help came to the emmets now an ant would go up to an ape and smite him and cut him in twain whilst ten apes could hardly master one ant and bear him away and tear him in sunder 
6494_60801_000009_000012	train-clean-360	The sore battle lasted till the evening but the emmets were victorious 
none	none	In the gloaming Janshah and his men took to flight and fled along the sole of the Wady And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that in the gloaming Janshah and his men took to flight and fled along the sole of the Wady till the morning With the break of day the apes were up and at them which when the Prince saw he shouted to his men Smite with your swords So they bared their blades and laid on load right and left till there ran at them an ape with tusks like an elephant and smote one of the Mamelukes and cut him in sunder Then the apes redoubled upon Janshah and he fled with his followers into the lower levels of the valley where he saw a vast river and by its side a mighty army of ants When the emmets espied Janshah they pushed on and surrounded him and one of the slaves fell to smiting them with his sword and cutting them in twain whereupon the whole host set upon him and slew him At this pass behold up came the apes from over the mountain and fell in numbers upon Janshah but he tore off his clothes and plunging into the river with his remaining servant struck out for the middle of the stream Presently he caught sight of a tree on the other bank so he swam up to it and laying hold of one of its branches hung to it and swung himself ashore but as for the last Mameluke the current carried him away and dashed him to pieces against the mountain Thereupon Janshah fell to wringing his clothes and spreading them in the sun to dry what while there befell a fierce fight between the apes and the ants until the apes gave up the pursuit and returned to their own land Meanwhile Janshah who abode alone on the river bank could do naught but shed tears till nightfall when he took refuge in a cavern and there passed the dark hours in great fear and feeling desolate for the loss of his slaves At daybreak awaking from his sleep he set out again and fared on nights and days eating of the herbs of the earth till he came to the mountain which burnt like fire and thence he made the river which dried up every Sabbath Now it was a mighty stream and on the opposite bank stood a great city which was the capital of the Jews mentioned in the tablet Here he abode till the next Sabbath when the river dried up and he walked over to the other side and entered the Jew city but saw none in the streets So he wandered about till he came to the door of a homestead which he opened and entering espied within the people of the house sitting in silence and speaking not a syllable Quoth he I am a stranger and anhungered and they signed to him as to say Eat and drink but speak not FN five hundred forty three So he ate and drank and slept that night and when morning dawned the master of the house greeted him and bade him welcome and asked him Whence comest thou and whither art thou bound At these words Janshah wept sore and told him all that had befallen him and how his father was King of Kabul whereat the Jew marvelled and said Never heard we of that city but we have heard from the merchants of the caravans that in that direction lieth a land called Al Yaman How far is that land from this place asked Janshah and the Jew answered The Cafilah merchants pretend that it is a two years and three months march from their land hither Quoth Janshah And when doth the caravan come Quoth the Jew Next year twill come And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the Jew was questioned anent the coming of the caravan he replied Next year twill come At these words the Prince wept sore and fell a sorrowing for himself and his Mamelukes and lamenting his separation from his mother and father and all which had befallen him in his wanderings Then said the Jew O young man do not weep but sojourn with us till the caravan shall come when we will send thee with it to thine own country So he tarried with the Jew two whole months and every day he went out walking in the streets for his solace and diversion Now it chanced one day whilst he paced about the main thoroughfares as of wont and was bending his steps right and left he heard a crier crying aloud and saying Who will earn a thousand gold pieces and a slave girl of surpassing beauty and loveliness by working for me between morning and noontide But no one answered him and Janshah said in his mind Were not this work dangerous and difficult he would not offer a thousand diners and a fair girl for half a day s labour Then he accosted the crier and said I will do the work so the man carried him to a lofty mansion where they found one who was a Jew and a merchant seated on an ebony chair to whom quoth the crier standing respectfully before him O merchant I have cried every day these three months and none hath answered save this young man Hearing his speech the Jew welcomed Janshah led him into a magnificent sitting room and signalled to bring food So the servants spread the table and set thereon all manner meats of which the merchant and Janshah ate and washed their hands Then wine was served up and they drank after which the Jew rose and bringing Janshah a purse of a thousand diners and a slave girl of rare beauty said to him Take maid and money to thy hire Janshah took them and seated the girl by his side when the trader resumed To morrow to the work and so saying he withdrew and Janshah slept with the damsel that night As soon as it was morning the merchant bade his slaves clothe him in a costly suit of silk whenas he came out of the Hammam Bath So they did as he bade them and brought him back to the house whereupon the merchant called for harp and lute and wine and they drank and played and made merry till the half of the night was past when the Jew retired to his Harim and Janshah lay with his slave girl till the dawn Then he went to the bath and on his return the merchant came to him and said Now I wish thee to do the work for me I hear and obey replied Janshah So the merchant bade his slaves bring two she mules and set Janshah on one mounting the other himself Then they rode forth from the city and fared on from morn till noon when they made a lofty mountain to whose height was no limit Here the Jew dismounted ordering Janshah to do the same and when he obeyed the merchant gave him a knife and a cord saying I desire that thou slaughter this mule So Janshah tucked up his sleeves and skirts and going up to the mule bound her legs with the cord then threw her and cut her throat after which he skinned her and lopped off her head and legs and she became a mere heap of flesh Then said the Jew Slit open the mule s belly and enter it and I will sew it up on thee There must thou abide awhile and whatsoever thou seest in her belly acquaint me therewith So Janshah slit the mule s belly and crept into it whereupon the merchant sewed it up on him and withdrew to a distance And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Seventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the merchant sewed up the mule s belly on Janshah and withdrawing to a distance hid himself in the skirts of the mountain After a while a huge bird swooped down on the dead mule and snatching it up flew up with it to the top of the mountain where it set down the quarry and would have eaten it but Janshah feeling the bird begin to feed slit the mule s belly and came forth When the bird saw him it took fright at him and flew right away whereupon he stood up and looking right and left saw nothing but the carcasses of dead men mummied by the sun and exclaimed There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious the Great Then he looked down the precipice and espied the merchant standing at the mountain foot looking for him As soon as the Jew caught sight of him he called out to him Throw me down of the stones which are about thee that I may direct thee to a way whereby thou mayst descend So Janshah threw him down some two hundred of the stones which were all rubies FN five hundred forty four chrysolites and other gems of price after which he called out to him saying Show me the way down and I will throw thee as many more But the Jew gathered up the stones and binding them on the back of the mule went his way without answering a word and left Janshah alone on the mountain top When the Prince found himself deserted he began to weep and implore help of Heaven and thus he abode three days after which he rose and fared on over the mountainous ground two month s space feeding upon hill herbs and he ceased not faring till he came to its skirts and espied afar off a Wady full of fruitful trees and birds harmonious singing the praises of Allah the One the Victorious At this sight he joyed with great joy and stayed not his steps till after an hour or so he came to a ravine in the rocks through which the rain torrents fell into the valley He made his way down the cleft till he reached the Wady which he had seen from the mountain top and walked on therein gazing right and left nor ceased so doing until he came in sight of a great castle towering high in air As he drew near the gates he saw an old man of comely aspect and face shining with light standing thereat with a staff of carnelian in his hand and going up to him saluted him The Shaykh returned his salam and bade him welcome saying Sit down O my son So he sat down at the door of the castle and the old man said to him How camest thou to this land untrodden by son of Adam before thee and whither art thou bound When Janshah heard his words he wept bitterly at the thought of all the hardships he had suffered and his tears choked his speech Quoth the Shaykh O my son leave weeping for indeed thou makest my heart ache So saying he rose and set somewhat of food before him and said to him Eat He ate and praised Allah Almighty after which the old man besought him saying O my son I would have thee tell me thy tale and acquaint me with thine adventures So Janshah related to him all that had befallen him from first to last whereat the Shaykh marvelled with exceeding marvel Then said the Prince Prithee inform me who is the lord of this valley and to whom doth this great castle belong Answered the old man Know O my son this valley and all that is therein and this castle with all it containeth belong to the lord Solomon son of David on both be peace As for me my name is Shaykh Nasr FN five hundred forty five King of the Birds for thou must know that the lord Solomon committed this castle to my charge And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Shaykh Nasr pursued Thou must know that the lord Solomon com misted this castle to my charge and taught me the language of birds and made me ruler over all the fowls which be in the world wherefore each and every come hither once in the twelvemonth and I pass them in review then they depart and this is why I dwell here When Janshah heard this he wept sore and said to the Shaykh O my father how shall I do to get back to my native land Replied the old man Know O my son that thou art near to the mountain Kaf and there is no departing for thee from this place till the birds come when I will give thee in charge to one of them and he will bear thee to thy native country Meanwhile tarry with me here and eat and drink and divert thyself with viewing the apartments of this castle So Janshah abode with Shaykh Nasr taking his pleasure in the Wady and eating of its fruits and laughing and making merry with the old man and leading a right joyous life till the day appointed for the birds to pay their annual visit to the Governor Thereupon the Shaykh said to him O Janshah take the keys of the castle and solace thyself with exploring all its apartments and viewing whatever be therein but as regards such a room beware and again beware of opening its door and if thou gainsay me and open it and enter there through nevermore shalt thou know fair fortune He repeated this charge again and again with much instance then he went forth to meet the birds which came up kind by kind and kissed his hands Such was his case but as regards Janshah he went round about the castle opening the various doors and viewing the apartments into which they led till he came to the room which Shaykh Nasr had warned him not to open or enter He looked at the door and its fashion pleased him for it had on it a padlock of gold and he said to himself This room must be goodlier than all the others would Heaven I wist what is within it that Shaykh Nasr should forbid me to open its door There is no help but that I enter and see what is in this apartment for whatso is decreed unto the creature perforce he must fulfil So he put out his hand and unlocked the door and entering found himself before a great basin and hard by it stood a little pavilion builded all of gold and silver and crystal with lattice windows of jacinth The floor was paved with green beryl and balas rubies and emeralds and other jewels set in the ground work mosaic fashion and in the midmost of the pavilion was a jetting fountain in a golden basin full of water and girt about with figures of beasts and birds cunningly wrought of gold and silver and casting water from their mouths When the zephyr blew on them it entered their ears and therewith the figures sang out with birdlike song each in its own tongue Beside the fountain was a great open saloon with a high dais whereon stood a vast throne of carnelian inlaid with pearls and jewels over which was spread a tent of green silk fifty cubits in width and embroidered with gems fit for seal rings and purfled with precious metals Within this tent was a closet containing the carpet of the lord Solomon on whom be peace and the pavilion was compassed about with a vast garden full of fruit trees and streams while near the palace were beds of roses and basil and eglantine and all manner sweet smelling herbs and flowers And the trees bore on the same boughs fruits fresh and dry and the branches swayed gracefully to the wooing of the wind All this was in that one apartment and Janshah wondered thereat till he was weary of wonderment and he set out to solace himself in the palace and the garden and to divert himself with the quaint and curious things they contained And first looking at the basin he saw that the gravels of its bed were gems and jewels and noble metals and many other strange things were in that apartment And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Janshah saw many strange things and admirable in that apartment Then he entered the pavilion and mounting the throne fell asleep under the tent set up thereover He slept for a time and presently awaking walked forth and sat down on a stool before the door As he sat marvelling at the goodliness of that place there flew up from mid sky three birds in dove form but big as eagles and lighted on the brink of the basin where they sported awhile Then they put off their feathers and became three maidens FN five hundred forty six as they were moons that had not their like in the whole world They plunged into the basin and swam about and disported themselves and laughed while Janshah marvelled at their beauty and loveliness and the grace and symmetry of their shapes Presently they came up out of the water and began walking about and taking their solace in the garden and Janshah seeing them land was like to lose his wits He rose and followed them and when he overtook them he saluted them and they returned his salam after which quoth he Who are ye O illustrious Princesses and whence come ye Replied the youngest damsel We are from the invisible world of Almighty Allah and we come hither to divert ourselves He marvelled at their beauty and said to the youngest Have ruth on me and deign kindness to me and take pity on my case and on all that hath befallen me in my life Rejoined she Leave this talk and wend thy ways whereat the tears streamed from his eyes and he sighed heavily and repeated these couplets She shone out in the garden in garments all of green With open vest and collars and flowing hair beseen What is thy name I asked her and she replied I m she Who roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen Of passion and its anguish to her made my moan Upon a rock she answered thy plaints are wasted clean Even if thy heart I told her be rock in very deed Yet hath God made fair water well from the rock I ween FN five hundred forty seven When the maidens heard his verses they laughed and played and sang and made merry Then he brought them somewhat of fruit and they ate and drank and slept with him till the morning when they donned their feather suits and resuming dove shape flew off and went their way But as he saw them disappearing from sight his reason well nigh fled with them and he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit and lay a swooning all that day While he was in this case Shaykh Nasr returned from the Parliament of the Fowls and sought for Janshah that he might send him with them to his native land but found him not and knew that he had entered the forbidden room Now he had already said to the birds With me is a young man a mere youth whom destiny brought hither from a distant land and I desire of you that ye take him up and carry him to his own country And all answered We hear and we obey So he ceased not searching for Janshah till he came to the forbidden door and seeing it open he entered and found the Prince lying a swoon under a tree He fetched scented waters and sprinkled them on his face whereupon he revived and turned And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Tenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Shaykh Nasr saw Janshah lying a swoon under the tree he fetched him somewhat of scented waters and sprinkled them on his face Thereupon he revived and turned right and left but seeing none by him save the Shaykh sighed heavily and repeated these couplets Like fullest moon she shines on happiest night Soft sided fair with slender shape bedight Her eye babes charm the world with gramarye Her lips remind of rose and ruby light Her jetty locks make night upon her hips Ware lovers ware ye of that curl s despight Yea soft her sides are but in love her heart Outhardens flint surpasses syenite And bows of eyebrows shower glancey shafts Despite the distance never fail to smite Then ah her beauty all the fair it passes Nor any rival her who see the light When Shaykh Nasr heard these verses he said O my son did I not warn thee not to open that door and enter that room But now O my son tell me what thou sawest therein and acquaint me with all that betided thee So Janshah related to him all that had passed between him and the three maidens and Shaykh Nasr who sat listening in silence said Know O my son that these three maidens are of the daughters of the Jann and come hither every year for a day to divert themselves and make merry until mid afternoon when they return to their own country Janshah asked And where is their country and the old man answered By Allah O my son I wot not presently adding but now take heart and put away this love from thee and come with me that I may send thee to thine own land with the birds When Janshah heard this he gave a great cry and fell down in a trance and presently he came to himself and said O my father indeed I care not to return to my native land all I want is to foregather with these maidens and know O my father that I will never again name my people though I die before thee Then he wept and cried Enough for me that I look upon the face of her I love although it be only once in the year And he sighed deeply and repeated these couplets Would Heaven the Phantom FN five hundred forty eight spared the friend at night And would this love for man were ever dight Were not my heart afire for love of you Tears ne er had stained my cheeks nor dimmed my sight By night and day I bid my heart to bear Its griefs while fires of love my body blight Then he fell at Shaykh Nasr s feet and kissed them and wept sore crying Have pity on me so Allah take pity on thee and aid me in my strait so Allah aid thee Replied the old man By Allah O my son I know nothing of these maidens nor where may be their country but O my son if thy heart be indeed set on one of them tarry with me till this time next year for they will assuredly reappear and when the day of their coming draweth near hide thyself under a tree in the garden As soon as they have alighted and doffed their feather robes and plunged into the lake and are swimming about at a distance from their clothes seize the vest of her whom thy soul desireth When they see thee they will come a bank and she whose coat thou hast taken will accost thee and say to thee with the sweetest of speech and the most witching of smiles Give me my dress O my brother that I may don it and veil my nakedness withal But if thou yield to her prayer and give her back the vest thou wilt never win thy wish nay she will don it and fly away to her folk and thou wilt nevermore see her again Now when thou hast gained the vest clap it under thine armpit and hold it fast till I return from the Parliament of the Fowls when I will make accord between thee and her and send thee back to thy native land and the maiden with thee And this O my son is all I can do for thee nothing more And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Eleventh Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth Shaykh Nasr to Janshah Hold fast the feather robe of her thy soul desireth and give it not back to her till I return from the Parliament of the Fowls And this O my son is all I can do for thee nothing more When Janshah heard this his heart was solaced and he abode with Shaykh Nasr yet another year counting the days as they passed until the day of the coming of the birds And when at last the appointed time arrived the old man said to him Do as I enjoined thee and charged thee with the maidens in the matter of the feather dress for I go to meet the birds and Janshah replied I hear and I obey O my father Then the Shaykh departed whilst the Prince walked into the garden and hid himself under a tree where none could see him Here he abode a first day and a second and a third but the maidens came not whereat he was sore troubled and wept and sighed from a heart hard tried and he ceased not weeping and wailing till he fainted away When he came to himself he fell to looking now at the basin and now at the welkin and anon at the earth and anon at the open country whilst his heart grieved for stress of love longing As he was in this case behold the three doves appeared in the firmament eagle sized as before and flew till they reached the garden and lighted down beside the basin They turned right and left but saw no one man or Jann so they doffed their feather suits and became three maidens Then they plunged into the basin and swam about laughing and frolicking and all were mother naked and fair as bars of virgin silver Quoth the eldest O my sister I fear lest there be some one lying ambushed for us in the pavilion Answered the second O sister since the days of King Solomon none hath entered the pavilion be he man or Jann and the youngest added laughing By Allah O my sisters if there be any hidden there he will assuredly take none but me Then they continued sporting and laughing and Janshah s heart kept fluttering for stress of passion but he hid behind the tree so that he saw without being seen Presently they swam out to the middle of the basin leaving their clothes on the bank Hereupon he sprang to his feet and running like the darting levee to the basin s brink snatched up the feather vest of the youngest damsel her on whom his heart was set and whose name was Shamsah the Sun maiden At this the girls turned and seeing him were affrighted and veiled their shame from him in the water Then they swam near the shore and looking on his favour saw that he was bright faced as the moon on the night of fullness and asked him Who art thou and how camest thou hither and why hast thou taken the clothes of the lady Shamsah and he answered Come hither to me and I will tell you my tale Quoth Shamsah What deed is this and why hast thou taken my clothes rather than those of my sisters Quoth he O light of mine eyes come forth of the water and I will recount thee my case and acquaint thee why I chose thee out Quoth she O my lord and coolth of my eyes and fruit of my heart give me my clothes that I may put them on and cover my nakedness withal then will I come forth to thee But he replied O Princess of beautiful ones how can I give thee back thy clothes and slay myself for love longing Verily I will not give them to thee till Shaykh Nasr the king of the birds shall return Quoth she If thou wilt not give me my clothes withdraw a little apart from us that my sisters may land and dress themselves and lend me somewhat wherewithal to cover my shame I hear and obey answered he and walked away from them into the pavilion whereupon the three Princesses came out and the two elder donning their dress gave Shamsah somewhat thereof not enough to fly withal and she put it on and came forth of the water and stood before him as she were the rising full moon or a browsing gazelle Then Shamsah entered the pavilion where Janshah was still sitting on the throne so she saluted him and taking seat near him said O fair of face thou hast undone thyself and me but tell us thy adventures that we may ken how it is with thee At these words he wept till he drenched his dress with his tears and when she saw that he was distracted for love of her she rose and taking him by the hand made him sit by her side and wiped away the drops with her sleeve and said she O fair of face leave this weeping and tell us thy tale So he related to her all that had befallen him and described to her all he had seen And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twelfth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the lady Shamsah said to Janshah Tell us thy tale so he related to her all that had befallen him and after she had lent attentive ear she sighed and said O my lord since thou art so fondly in love with me give me my dress that I may fly to my folk I and my sisters and tell them what affection thou hast conceived for me and after I will come back to thee and carry thee to thine own country When he heard this he wept sore and replied Is it lawful to thee before Allah to slay me wrongfully She asked O my lord why should I do such wrongous deed and he answered If I give thee thy gear thou wilt fly away from me and I shall die forthright Princess Shamsah laughed at this and so did her sisters then said she to him Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear for I must needs marry thee So saying she bent down to him and embraced him and pressing him to her breast kissed him between the eyes and on his cheeks They clipped and clasped each other awhile after which they drew apart and sat down on the throne Then the eldest Princess went out into the garden and plucking somewhat of fruits and flowers brought them into the pavilion and they ate and drank and laughed and sported and made merry Now Janshah was singular in beauty and loveliness and slender shape and symmetry and grace and the Princess Shamsah said to him O my beloved by Allah I love thee with exceeding love and will never leave thee When he heard her words his breast broadened and he laughed for joy till he showed his teeth and they abode thus awhile in mirth and gladness and frolic And when they were at the height of their pleasure and joyance behold Shaykh Nasr returned from the Parliament of the Fowls and came in to them whereupon they all rose to him and saluted him and kissed his hands He gave them welcome and bade them be seated So they sat down and he said to Princess Shamsah Verily this youth loveth thee with exceeding love Allah upon thee deal kindly with him for he is of the great ones of mankind and of the sons of the kings and his father ruleth over the land of Kabul and his reign compasseth a mighty empire Quoth she I hear and I obey thy behest and kissing the Shaykh s hands stood before him in respect Quoth he If thou say sooth swear to me by Allah that thou wilt never betray him what while thou abidest in the bonds of life So she swore a great oath that she would never betray Janshah but would assuredly marry him and added Know O Shaykh Nasr that I never will forsake him The Shaykh believed in her oath and said to Janshah Thanks be to Allah who hath made you arrive at this understanding Hereupon the Prince rejoiced with exceeding joy and he and Shamsah abode three months with Shaykh Nasr feasting and toying and making merry And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Janshah and the lady Shamsah abode three months with Shaykh Nasr feasting and toying and making merry And at the end of that time she said to Janshah I wish to go with thee to thy mother land where thou shalt marry me and we will abide there To hear is to obey answered he and took counsel with Shaykh Nasr who said to him Go thou home I commend her to thy care Then said she O Shaykh Nasr bid him render me my feather suit So the Shaykh bade Janshah give it to her and he went straightways into the pavilion and brought it out for her There upon she donned it and said to him Mount my back and shut thine eyes and stop thine ears so thou mayst not hear the roar of the revolving sphere and keep fast hold of my feathers lest thou fall off He did as she bade him and as she stretched her wings to fly Shaykh Nasr said Wait a while till I describe to thee the land Kabul lest you twain miss your way So she delayed till he had said his say and had bidden them farewell commending the Prince to her care She took leave of her sisters and bade them return to her folk and tell them what had befallen her with Janshah then rising into the air without stay or delay she flew off like the wafts of the wind or the ramping leven Her sisters also took flight and returning home delivered her message to their people And she stayed not her course from the forenoon till the hour of mid afternoon prayer Janshah being still on her back when she espied afar off a Wady abounding in trees and streams and she said to Janshah I am thinking to alight in this valley that we may solace ourselves amongst its trees and herbage and here rest for the night Quoth he Do what seemeth meet to thee So she swooped down from the lift and alighted in the Wady when Janshah dismounted and kissing her between the eyes FN five hundred forty nine sat with her awhile on the bank of a river there then they rose and wandered about the valley taking their pleasure therein and eating of the fruits of the trees until nightfall when they lay down under a tree and slept till the morning dawned As soon as it was day the Princess arose and bidding Janshah mount flew on with him till noon when she perceived by the appearance of the buildings which Shaykh Nasr had described to her that they were nearing the city Kabul So she swooped down from the welkin and alighted in a wide plain a blooming champaign wherein were gazelles straying and springs playing and rivers flowing and ripe fruits growing So Janshah dismounted and kissed her between the eyes and she asked him O my beloved and coolth of mine eyes knowest thou how many days journey we have come since yesterday and he answered No when she said We have come thirty months journey Quoth he Praised be Allah for safety Then they sat down side by side and ate and drank and toyed and laughed And whilst they were thus pleasantly engaged behold there came up to them two of the King s Mamelukes of those who had been of the Prince s company one of them was he whom he had left with the horses when he embarked in the fishing boat and the other had been of his escort in the chase As soon as they saw Janshah both knew him and saluted him then said they With thy leave we will go to thy sire and bear him the glad tidings of thy coming Replied the Prince Go ye to my father and acquaint him with my case and fetch us tents for we will tarry here seven days to rest ourselves till he make ready his retinue to meet us that we may enter in stateliest state And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Fourteenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Janshah said to the two Mamelukes Go ye to my sire and acquaint him with my case and fetch us tents for we will abide here seven days to rest ourselves till he make ready his retinue to meet us that we may enter in the stateliest state So the officers hastened back to King Teghmus and said to him Good news O King of the age Asked he What good tidings bring ye is my son Janshah come back and they answered Yes thy son Janshah hath returned from his strangerhood and is now near at hand in the Kirani mead Now when the King heard this he joyed with great joy and fell down in a swoon for excess of gladness then coming to himself he bade his Wazir give each of the Mamelukes a splendid suit of honour and a sum of money The minister replied I hear and obey and forthright did his bidding and said to them Take this in turn for the good tidings ye bring whether ye lie or say sooth They replied Indeed we lie not for but now we sat with him and saluted him and kissed his hands and he bade us fetch him tents for that he would sojourn in the meadow seven days till such time as the Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees should come out to meet him Quoth the King How is it with my son and quoth they He hath with him a Houri as he had brought her out of Paradise At this King Teghmus bade beat the kettledrums and sound the trumpets for gladness and despatched messengers to announce the good news to Janshah s mother and to the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Lords of the realm so the criers spread themselves about the city and acquainted the people with the coming of Prince Janshah Then the King made ready and setting out for the Kirani meadow with his horsemen and footmen came upon Janshah who was sitting at rest with the lady Shamsah beside him and behold all suddenly drew in sight The Prince rose to his feet and walked forward to meet them and the troops knew him and dismounted to salute him and kiss his hands after which he set out preceded by the men in single file till he came to his sire who at sight of his son threw himself from his horse s back and clasped him to his bosom and wept flooding tears of joy Then they took horse again with the retinue riding to the right and left and fared forward till they came to the river banks when the troops alighted and pitched their tents and pavilions and standards to the blare of trump and the piping of fife and the dub a dub of drum and tom tom Moreover the King bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion of red silk for the Princess Shamsah who put off her scanty raiment of feathers for fine robes and entering the pavilion there took seat And as she sat in her beauty behold the King and his son Janshah came in to her and when she saw Teghmus she rose and kissed the ground before him The King sat down and seating Janshah on his right hand and Princess Shamsah on his left bade her welcome and said to his son Tell me all that hath befallen thee in this thy long strangerhood So Janshah related to him the whole of his adventures from first to last whereat he marvelled with exceeding marvel and turning to the Princess said Laud to Allah for that He hath caused thee to reunite me with my son Verily this is of His exceeding bounty FN five hundred fifty And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Fifteenth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Teghmus said to the lady Shamsah Laud to Allah for that He hath caused thee to reunite me with my son Verily this is of His exceeding bounty And now I would have thee ask of me what thou wilt that I may do it in thine honour Quoth she I ask of thee that thou build me a palace in the midst of a flower garden with water running under it And the King answered I hear and obey And behold up came Janshah s mother attended by all the wives of the Wazirs and Emirs and nobles and city notables When her son had sight of her he rose and leaving the tent went forth to meet her and they embraced a long while whilst the Queen wept for excess of joy and with tears trickling from her eyes repeated the following verses Joy so o ercometh me for stress of joy In that which gladdeneth me I fain shed tears Tears are become your nature O my eyes Who weep for joyance as for griefs and fears And they complained to each other of all their hearts had suffered from the long separation Then the King departed to his pavilion and Janshah carried his mother to his own tent where they sat talking till there came up some of the lady Shamsah s attendants who said The Princess is now walking hither in order to salute thee When the Queen heard this she rose and going to meet Shamsah saluted her and seated her awhile by her side Presently the Queen and her retinue of noble women the spouses of the Emirs and Grandees returned with Princess Shamsah to the tent occupied by her daughter in law and sat there Meanwhile King Teghmus gave great largesse to his levies and liege and rejoiced in his son with exceeding joy and they tarried there ten days feasting and merry making and living a most joyous life At the end of this time the King commanded a march and they all returned to the capital so he took horse surrounded by all the troops with the Wazirs and Chamberlains to his right and left nor ceased they faring till they entered the city which was decorated after the goodliest fashion for the folk had adorned the houses with precious stuffs and jewellery and spread costly bro cedes under the hoofs of the horses The drums beat for glad tidings and the Grandees of the kingdom rejoiced and brought rich gifts and the lookers on were filled with amazement Furthermore they fed the mendicants and Fakirs and held high festival for the space of ten days and the lady Shamsah joyed with exceeding joy whenas she saw this Then King Teghmus summoned architects and builders and men of art and bade them build a palace in that garden So they straightway proceeded to do his bidding and when Janshah knew of his sire s command he caused the artificers to fetch a block of white marble and carve it and hollow it in the semblance of a chest which being done he took the feather vest of Princess Shamsah wherewith she had flown with him through the air then sealing the cover with melted lead he ordered them to bury the box in the foundations and build over it the arches whereon the palace was to rest They did as he bade them nor was it long before the palace was finished then they furnished it and it was a magnificent edifice standing in the midst of the garden with streams flowing under its walls FN five hundred fifty one Upon this the King caused Janshah s wedding to be celebrated with the greatest splendour and they brought the bride to the castle in state procession and went their ways When the lady Shamsah entered she smelt the scent of her feather gear And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Sixteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when the lady Shamsah entered the new palace she smelt the scent of her flying feather gear and knew where it was and determined to take it So she waited till midnight when Janshah was drowned in sleep then she rose and going straight to the place where the marble coffer was buried under the arches she hollowed the ground alongside till she came upon it when she removed the lead where with it was soldered and taking out the feather suit put it on Then she flew high in air and perching on the pinnacle of the palace cried out to those who were therein saying I pray you fetch me Janshah that I may bid him farewell So they told him and he came out and seeing her on the terrace roof of the palace clad in her feather raiment asked her Why hast thou done this deed and she answered O my beloved and coolth of mine eyes and fruit of my heart by Allah I love thee passing dear and I rejoice with exceeding joy in that I have restored thee to thy friends and country and thou hast seen thy mother and father And now if thou love me as I love thee come to me at Takni the Castle of Jewels So saying she flew away forthright to find her family and friends and Janshah fell down fainting being well nigh dead for despair They carried the news to King Teghmus who mounted at once and riding to the palace found his son lying senseless on the ground whereat he wept knowing that the swoon was caused by the loss of his love and sprinkled rose water on his face FN five hundred fifty two When the Prince came to himself and saw his sire sitting at his head he wept at the thought of losing his wife and the King asked what had befallen him So he replied Know O my father that the lady Shamsah is of the daughters of the Jann and she hath done such and such telling him all that had happened and the King said O my son be not troubled and thus concerned for I will assemble all the merchants and wayfarers in the land and enquire of them anent that castle If we can find out where it is we will journey thither and demand the Princess Shamsah of her people and we hope in Allah the Almighty that He will give her back to thee and thou shalt consummate thy marriage Then he went out and calling his four Wazirs without stay or delay bade them assemble all the merchants and voyagers in the city and question them of Takni the Castle of Jewels adding Whoso knoweth it and can guide us thither I will surely give him fifty thousand gold pieces The Wazirs accordingly went forth at once and did as the King bade them but neither trader nor traveller could give them news of Takni the Castle of Jewels so they returned and told the King Thereupon he bade bring beautiful slave girls and concubines and singers and players upon instruments of music whose like are not found but with the Kings and sent them to Janshah so haply they might divert him from the love of the lady Shamsah Moreover he despatched couriers and spies to all the lands and islands and climes to enquire for Takni the Castle of Jewels and they made quest for it two months long but none could give them news thereof So they returned and told the King whereupon he wept bitter tears and going in to his son found Janshah sitting amidst the concubines and singers and players on harp and zither and so forth not one of whom could console him for the lady Shamsah Quoth Teghmus O my son I can find none who knoweth this Castle of Jewels but I will bring thee a fairer one than she When Janshah heard this his eyes ran over with tears and he recited these two couplets Patience hath fled but passion fareth not And all my frame with pine is fever hot When will the days my lot with Shamsah join Lo all my bones with passion lowe go rot Now there was a deadly feud between King Teghmus and a certain King of Hind by name Kafid who had great plenty of troops and warriors and champions and under his hand were a thousand puissant chieftains each ruling over a thousand tribes whereof every one could muster four thousand cavaliers He reigned over a thousand cities each guarded by a thousand forts and he had four Wazirs and under him ruled Emirs Princes and Sovereigns and indeed he was a King of great might and prowess whose armies filled the whole earth Now King Teghmus had made war upon him and ravaged his reign and slain his men and of his treasures had made gain But when it came to King Kafid s knowledge that King Teghmus was occupied with the love of his son so that he neglected the affairs of the state and his troops were grown few and weak by reason of his care and concern for his son s state he summoned his Wazirs and Emirs and said to them Ye all know that whilom King Teghmus invaded our dominions and plundered our possessions and slew my father and brethren nor indeed is there one of you but he hath harried his lands and carried off his goods and made prize of his wives and slain some kinsmen of his Now I have heard this day that he is absorbed in the love of his son Janshah and that his troops are grown few and weak and this is the time to take our blood revenge on him So make ready for the march and don ye your harness of battle and let nothing stay or delay you and we will go to him and fall upon him and slay him and his son and possess ourselves of his reign And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Seventeenth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Kafid King of Hind commanded his troops and armies to mount and make for the dominions of King Teghmus saying Get ye ready for the march and don ye your harness of war and let nothing stay or delay you so we will go to him and fall upon him and slay him and his son and possess ourselves of his reign They all answered with one voice saying We hear and obey and fell at once to equipping themselves and levying troops and they ceased not their preparations for three months and when all was in readiness they beat the drums and sounded the trumps and flew the flags and banners then King Kafid set out at the head of his host and they fared on till they reached the frontiers of the land of Kabul the dominions of King Teghmus where they began to harry the land and do havoc among the folk slaughtering the old and taking the young prisoners When the news reached King Teghmus he was wroth with exceeding wrath and assembling his Grandees and officers of state said to them Know that Kafid hath come to our land and hath entered the realm we command and is resolved to fight us hand to hand and he leadeth troops and champions and warriors whose number none knoweth save Allah Almighty what deme deem ye Replied they O King of the age let us go out to him and give him battle and drive him forth of our country and thus deem we So he bade them prepare for battle and brought forth to them hauberks and cuirasses and helmets and swords and all manner of warlike gear such as lay low warriors and do to death the champions of mankind So the troops and braves and champions flocked together and they set up the standards and beat the drums and sounded the trumpets and clashed the cymbals and piped on the pipes and King Teghmus marched out at the head of his army to meet the hosts of Hind And when he drew near the foe he called a halt and encamping with his host in the Zahran Valley FN five hundred fifty three hard by the frontier of Kabul despatched to King Kafid by messenger the following letter Know that what thou hast done is of the doings of the villain rabble and wert thou indeed a King the son of a King thou hadst not done thus nor hadst thou invaded my kingdom and slain my subjects and plundered their property and wrought upright upon them Knowest thou not that all this is the fashion of a tyrant Verily had I known that thou durst harry my dominions I had come to thee before thy coming and had prevented thee this long while since Yet even now if thou wilt retire and leave mischief between us and thee well and good but if thou return not meet me in the listed field and measure thyself with me in cut and thrust Lastly he sealed his letter and committed to an officer of his army and sent with him spies to spy him out news The messenger fared forth with the missive and drawing near the enemy s camp he descried a multitude of tents of silk and satin with pennons of blue sendal and amongst them a great pavilion of red satin surrounded by a host of guards He ceased not to advance till he made this tent and found on asking that it was that of King Kafid whom he saw seated on a chair set with jewels in the midst of his Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees So he brought out the letter and straightway there came up to him a company of guards who took it from him and carried it to the King and Kafid read it and wrote a reply to this purport After the usual invocations We let King Teghmus know that we mean to take our blood revenge on thee and wash out our stain and waste thy reign and rend the curtain in twain and slay the old men and enslave the young men But to morrow come thou forth to combat in the open plain and to show thee thrust and fight will I deign Then he sealed the letter and delivered it to the messenger who carried it to King Teghmus And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Eighteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Kafid delivered the answering letter to the messenger who carried it to King Teghmus and delivered it after kissing the ground between his hands Then he reported all that he had seen saying O King of the age I espied warriors and horsemen and footmen beyond count nor can I assist thee to the amount When Teghmus read the reply and comprehended its contents he was with furious rage enraged and bade his Wazir Ayn Zar take horse and fall upon the army of Kafid with a thousand cavaliers in the middle watch of the night when they would easily ride home and slay all before them Ayn Zar replied I hear and I obey and at once went forth to do his bidding Now King Kafid had a Wazir Ghatrafan FN five hundred fifty four by name whom he bade take five thousand horse and attack the host of King Teghmus in like manner So Ghatrafan did his bidding and set out on his enterprise marching till midnight Thus the two parties met halfway and the Wazir Ghatrafan fell upon the Wazir Ayn Zar Then man cried out against man and there befell sore battle between them till break of day when Kafid s men were routed and fled back to their King in confusion As Kafid saw this he was wroth beyond measure and said to the fugitives Woe to you What hath befallen you that ye have lost your captains and they replied O King of the age as the Wazir Ghatrafan rode forth to fall upon King Teghmus there appeared to us halfway and when night was half over the Wazir Ayn Zar with cavaliers and champions and we met on the slopes of Wady Zahran but ere we were where we found ourselves in the enemy s midst eye meeting eye and we fought a fierce fight with them from midnight till morning many on either side being slain Then the Wazir and his men fell to shouting and smiting the elephants on the face till they took fright at their furious blows and turning tail to flee trampled down the horsemen whilst none could see other for the clouds of dust The blood ran like a rain torrent and had we not fled we had all been cut off to the last man When King Kafid heard this he exclaimed May the sun not bless you and may he be wroth with you and sore be his wrath Meanwhile Ayn Zar the Wazir returned to King Teghmus and told him what had happened The King gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced greatly and bade beat the drums and sound the trumpets in honour of the victory after which he called the roll of his troops and behold two hundred of his stoutest champions had fallen Then King Kafid marched his army into the field and drew them out ordered for battle in fifteen lines of ten thousand horses each under the command of three hundred captains mounted on elephants and chosen from amongst the doughtiest of his warriors and his champions So he set up his standards and banners and beat the drums and blew the trumpets whilst the braves sallied forth offering battle As for King Teghmus he drew out his troops line after line and lo there were ten of ten thousand horses each and with him were an hundred champions riding on his right hand and on his left Then fared forward to the fight each renowned knight and the hosts clashed together in their might whilst the earth for all its wideness was straitened because of the multitude of the cavaliers and ears were deafened by drums and cymbals beating and pipes and hautboys sounding and trumpets blaring and by the thunder of horse tramp and the shouting of men The dust arched in canopy over their heads and they fought a sore fight from the first of the day till the fall of darkness when they separated and each army drew off to its own camp And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Nineteenth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that each army drew off to its own camp Then King Kafid called the roll of his troops and finding that he had lost five thousand men raged with great rage and King Teghmus mustered his men and seeing that of them were slain three thousand riders the bravest of his braves was wroth with exceeding wrath On the morrow King Kafid again pushed into the plain and did duty as before while each man strove his best to snatch victory for himself and Kafid cried out to his men saying Is there any of you will sally forth into the field and open us the chapter of fray and fight And behold came out from the ranks a warrior named Barkayk a mighty man of war who when he reached the King alighted from his elephant and kissing the earth before him sought of him leave to challenge the foe to combat singular Then he mounted his elephant and driving into mid field cried out Who is for duello who is for derring do who is for knightly devoir When King Teghmus heard this he said to his troops Which of you will do single battle with this sworder And behold a cavalier came out from the ranks mounted on a charger mighty of make and driving up to the King kissed the earth before him and craved his permission to engage Barkayk Then he mounted again and charged at Barkayk who said to him Who art thou and what art thou called that thou makest mock of me by coming out against me and challenging me alone My name is Ghazanfar FN five hundred fifty five son of Kamkhil replied the Kabul champion and the other I have heard tell of thee in my own country so up and do battle between the ranks of the braves Hearing these words Ghazanfar drew a mace of iron from under his thigh and Barkayk took his good sword in hand and they laid on load till Barkayk smote Ghazanfar on the head with his blade but the morion turned the blow and no hurt befell him therefrom whereupon Ghazanfar in his turn dealt Barkayk so terrible a stroke on the head with his mace that he levelled him down to his elephant s back and slew him With this out sallied another and crying to Ghazanfar Who be thou that thou shouldst slay my brother hurled a javelin at him with such force that it pierced his thigh and nailed his coat of mail to his flesh Then Ghazanfar feeling his hurt hent his sword in hand and smote at Barkayk s brother and cut him in sunder and he fell to the earth wallowing in his life blood whilst the challenger of Kabul galloped back to King Teghmus Now when Kafid saw the death of his champions he cried out to his troops saying Down with you to the plain and strike with might and main as also did King Teghmus and the two armies fought the fiercest of fights Horse neighed against horse and man cried out upon man and brands were bared whilst the drums beat and the trumpets blared and horseman charged upon horseman and every brave of renown pushed forward whilst the faint of heart fled from the lunge of lance and men heard nought but slogan cry and the clash and clang of armoury Slain were the warriors that were slain FN five hundred fifty six and they stayed not from the mellay till the decline of the sun in the heavenly dome when the Kings drew off their armies and returned each to its own camp FN five hundred fifty seven Then King Teghmus took tally of his men and found that he had lost five thousand and four standards had been broken to bits whereat he was sore an angered whilst King Kafid in like manner counted his troops and found that he had lost six hundred the bravest of his braves and nine standards were wanting to the full tale The two armies ceased joining battle and rested on their arms three days space after which Kafid wrote a letter and sent it by messenger to a King called Fakun al Kalb with whom he claimed kinship by the spindle side and this kinsman forthwith mustered his men and marched to meet the King of Hind And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twentieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Fakun mustered his men and marched to meet the King of Hind and whileas King Teghmus was sitting at his pleasance there came one in to him and said I see from afar a cloud of dust spireing high in air and overspreading the lift So he commanded a company to fare forth and learn the meaning of this and crying To hear is to obey they sallied out and presently returned and said to him O King when we drew near the cloud of dust the wind rent it and it lifted and showed seven standards and under each standard three thousand horse making for King Kafid s camp Then King Fakun joined himself to the King of Hind and saluting him asked How is it with thee and what be this war in which thou arrest and Kafid answered Knowest thou not that King Teghmus is my enemy and the murtherer of my father and brothers Wherefore I am come forth to do battle with him and take my brood wreak on him Quoth Fakun The blessing of the sun be upon thee and the King of Hind carried King Fakun al Kalb to his tent and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy Such was the case of the two hostile Kings but as regards King Janshah he abode two months shut up in his palace without seeing his father or allowing one of the damsels in his service to come in to him at the end of which time he grew troubled and restless and said to his attendants What aileth my father that he cometh not to visit me They told him that he had gone forth to do battle with King Kafid whereupon quoth Janshah Bring me my steed that I may go to my sire They replied We hear and obey and brought his horse but he said in himself I am taken up with the thought of myself and my love and I deem well to mount and ride for the city of the Jews where haply Allah shall grant me the boon to meet the merchant who hired me for the ruby business and may be he will deal with me as he dealt before for none knoweth whence good cometh So he took with him a thousand horse and set out the folk saying At last Janshah hath fared forth to join his father in the field and to fight by his side and they stinted not pushing on till dusk when they halted for the night in a vast meadow As soon as he knew that all his men were asleep the Prince rose privily and girding his waist mounted his horse and rode away intending to make Baghdad because he had heard from the Jews that a caravan came thence to their city once in every two years and he made up his mind to journey thither with the next cafilah When his men awoke and missed the Prince and his horse they mounted and sought him right and left but finding no trace of him rejoined his father and told him what his son had done whereat he was wroth beyond measure and cast the crown from his head whilst the sparks were like to fly from his mouth and he said There is no Majesty and there is no Might but in Allah Verily I have lost my son and the enemy is still before me But his Wazirs and vassals said to him Patience O King of the age Patience bringeth weal in wake Meanwhile Janshah parted from his lover and pained for his father was in sore sorrow and dismay with heart seared and eyes tear bleared and unable to sleep night or day But when his father heard the loss his host had endured he declined battle and fled before King Kafid and retiring to his city closed the gates and strengthened the walls Thereupon King Kafid followed him and sat down before the town offering battle seven nights and eight days after which he withdrew to his tents to tend his wounded while the citizens defended themselves as they best could fortifying the place and setting up mangonels and other engines on the walls Such was the condition of the two Kings and war raged between them for a space of seven years And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Kings Teghmus and Kafid continued in this condition for seven years but as regards Janshah he rode through wild and wold and when ever he came to a town he asked anent Takni the Castle of Jewels but none knew of it and all answered Of a truth we never heard of such place not even by name At last he happened to enquire concerning the city of the Jews from a merchant who told him that it was situated in the extreme Orient adding A caravan will start this very month for the city of Mizrakan in Hind whither do thou accompany us and we will fare on to Khorasan and thence to the city of Shima un and Khwarazm from which latter place the City of the Jews is distant a year and three months journey So Janshah waited till the departure of the caravan when he joined himself thereto and journeyed till he reached the city of Mizrakan whence after vainly asking for Takni the Castle of Jewels he set out and enduring on the way great hardships and perils galore and the extreme of hunger and thirst he arrived at the town of Shima un Here he made enquiry for the City of the Jews and they directed him to the road thither So he fared forth and journeyed days and nights till he came to the place where he had given the apes the slip and continued his journey thence to the river on the opposite bank of which stood the City of the Jews He sat down on the shore and waited till the Sabbath came round and the river dried up by decree of Allah Almighty when he crossed over to the opposite bank and entering the city betook himself to the house wherein he had lodged on his former journey The Jew and his family saluted him and rejoiced in his return and setting meat and drink before him asked Where hast thou been during thine absence and he answered In the kingdom of Almighty Allah FN five hundred fifty eight He lay with them that night and on the morrow he went out to solace himself with a walk about the city and presently heard a crier crying aloud and saying O folk who will earn a thousand gold pieces and a fair slave girl and do half a day s work for us So Janshah went up to him and said I will do this work FN five hundred fifty nine Quoth the crier Follow me and carrying him to the house of the Jew merchant where he had been afore time said This young man will do thy need The merchant not recognising him gave him welcome and carried him into the Harim where he set meat and drink before him and he ate and drank Then he brought him the money and formally made over to him the handsome slave girl with whom he lay that night As soon as morning dawned he took the diners and the damsel and committing them to his Jew host with whom he had lodged afore time returned to the merchant who mounted and rode out with him till they came to the foot of the tall and towering mountain where the merchant bringing out a knife and cords said to Janshah Throw the mare So he threw her and bound her four legs with the cords and slaughtered her and cut off her head and four limbs and slit her belly as ordered by the Jew whereupon quoth he Enter her belly till I sew it up on thee and whatsoever thou seest therein tell me of it for this is the work whose wage thou hast taken So Janshah entered the mare s belly and the merchant sewed it up on him then withdrawing to a fair distance hid himself And after an hour a great bird swooped down from the lift and snatching up the carcass in his pounces soared high toward the sky Then he perched upon the mountain peak and would have eaten the prey but Janshah sensing his intent took out his knife and slit the mare s belly and came forth The bird was scared at his sight and flew away and Janshah went up to a place whence he could see below and looking down espied the merchant standing at the foot of the mountain as he were a sparrow So he cried out to him What is thy will O merchant Replied the Jew Throw me down of the stones that lie about thee that I may direct thee in the way down Quoth Janshah Thou art he who didst with me thus and thus five years ago and through thee I suffered hunger and thirst and sore toil and much trouble and now thou hast brought me hither once more and thinkest to destroy me By Allah I will not throw thee aught So saying he turned from him and set out for where lived Shaykh Nasr the King of the Birds And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that Janshah took the way for where lived Shaykh Nasr the King of the Birds And he ceased not faring on many days and nights tearful eyed and heavy hearted eating when he was anhungered of the growth of the ground and drinking when he thirsted of its streams till he came in sight of the Castle of the lord Solomon and saw Shaykh Nasr sitting at the gate So he hastened up to him and kissed his hands and the Shaykh saluted him and bade him welcome and said to him O my son what aileth thee that thou returnest to this place after I sent thee home with the Princess Shamsah cool of eyes and broad of breast Janshah wept and told him all that had befallen him and how she had flown away from him saying An thou love me come to me in Takni the Castle of Jewels at which the old man marvelled and said By Allah O my son I know it not nor by the virtue of our lord Solomon have I ever in my life heard its name Quoth Janshah What shall I do I am dying of love and longing Quoth Shaykh Nasr Take patience until the coming of the birds when we will enquire at them of Takni the Castle of Jewels haply one of them shall wot thereof So Janshah s heart was comforted and entering the Palace he went straight to the chamber which gave upon the Lake in which he had seen the three maidens After this he abode with Shaykh Nasr for a while and one day as he was sitting with him the Shaykh said O my son rejoice for the time of the birds coming draweth nigh Janshah gladdened to hear the news and after a few days the birds began to come and Shaykh Nasr said to him O my son learn these names FN five hundred sixty and address thyself with me to meet the birds Presently the fowls came flying up and saluted Shaykh Nasr kind after kind and he asked them of Takni the Castle of Jewels but they all made answer Never heard we of such a place At these words Janshah wept and lamented till he swooned away whereupon Shaykh Nasr called a huge volatile and said to him Carry this youth to the land of Kabul and described to him the country and the way thither Then he set Janshah on the bird s back saying Be careful to sit straight and beware of leaning to either side else thou wilt be torn to pieces in the air and stop thine ears from the wind lest thou be dazed by the noise of the revolving sphere and the roaring of the seas Janshah resolved to do his bidding and the bird took flight high in sky and flew with him a day and a night till he set him down by the King of the Beasts whose name was Shah Badri and said to his rider We have gone astray from the way directed by Shaykh Nasr And he would have taken him up again and flown on with him but Janshah said Go thy ways and leave me here till I die on this spot or I find Takni the Castle of Jewels I will not return to my country So the fowl left him with Shah Badri King of the Beasts and flew away The King thereupon said to him O my son who art thou and whence comest thou with yonder great bird So Janshah told him his story from beginning to end whereat Shah Badri marvelled and said By the virtue of the lord Solomon I know not of this castle but if any one of the beasts my subjects know it we will reward him bountifully and send thee by him thither Hereat Janshah wept bitterly but presently he took patience and abode with Shah Badri and after a short time the King of the Beasts said to him O my son take these tablets and commit to memory that which is therein and when the beasts come we will question them of the Castle of Jewels And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty third Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the King of the Beasts said to Janshah Commit to memory what is in these tablets and whenas the beasts come we will ask them anent that castle He did as the King bade him and before long up came the beasts kind after kind and saluted Shah Badri who questioned them of Takni the Castle of Jewels but they all replied We know not this castle nor ever heard we of it At this Janshah wept and lamented for that he had not gone with the bird that brought him from Shaykh Nasr s castle but Shah Badri said to him Grieve not O my son for I have a brother King Shimakh highs who is older than I he was once a prisoner to King Solomon for that he rebelled against him nor is there among the Jinn one elder than he and Shaykh Nasr Belike he knoweth of this castle at any rate he ruleth over all the Jinn in this country side So saying he set Janshah on the back of a beast and gave him a letter to his brother commending him to his care The beast set off with the Prince forthwith and fared on days and nights till it came to King Shimakh s abiding place And when it caught sight of the King it stood still afar off whereupon Janshah alighted and walked on till he found himself in the presence Then he kissed hands and presented his brother s letter The King read the missive and having mastered the meaning welcomed the Prince saying By Allah O my son in all my born days I never saw nor heard of this castle adding as Janshah burst into tears but tell me thy story and who and whence thou art and whither thou art bound So Janshah related to him his history from beginning to end at which Shimakh marvelled and said O my son I do not believe that even the lord Solomon ever saw this castle or heard thereof but O my son FN five hundred sixty one I know a monk in the mountains who is exceeding old and whom all birds and beasts and Jann obey for he ceased not his conjurations against the Kings of the Jann till they submitted themselves to him in their own despite by reason of the might of his oaths and his magic and now all the birds and the beasts are his servants I myself once rebelled against King Solomon and he sent against me this monk the only being who could overcome me with his craft and his conjurations and his gramarye then he imprisoned me and since that time I have been his vassal He hath travelled in all countries and quarters and knoweth all ways and regions and places and castles and cities nor do I think there is any place hidden from his ken So needs must I send thee to him haply he may direct thee to the Castle of Jewels and if he cannot do this none can for all things obey him birds and beasts and the very mountains and come at his beck and call by reason of his skill in magic Moreover by the might of his egromancy he hath made a staff in three pieces and this he planteth in the earth and conjureth over it whereupon flesh and blood issue from the first piece sweet milk from the second and wheat and barley from the third then he withdraweth the staff and returneth to his place which is highs the Hermitage of Diamonds And this magical monk is a cunning inventor and artificer of all manner strange works and he is a crafty warlock full of guiles and wiles an arch deceiver of wondrous wickedness who hath mastered every kind of magic and witchcraft His name is Yaghmus and to him I must needs send thee on the back of a big bird with four wings And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty fourth Night She pursued It hath reached me O auspicious King that Shimakh said to Janshah I must needs send thee to the monk Yaghmus on the back of a big bird with four wings each measuring thirty Hashimi FN five hundred sixty two cubits in length and it hath feet like those of an elephant but it flieth only twice a year And there was with King Shimakh an officer by name Timshun who used every day to carry off two Bactrian FN five hundred sixty three camels from the land of Irak and cut them up for the bird that it might eat them So King Shimakh bade the fowl take up Janshah and bear him to the cell of the hermit Yaghmus and it rose into the air and flew on days and nights till it came to the Mountain of the Citadels and the Hermitage of Diamonds where Janshah alighted and going up to the hermitage found Yaghmus the Monk at his devotions So he entered the chapel and kissing the ground stood respectfully before the hermit When Yaghmus saw him he said Welcome O my son O parted from thy home and garred ferforth to roam Tell me the cause of thy coming hither So Janshah wept and acquainted him with all that had befallen him from beginning to end and that he was in quest of the Castle of Jewels The Monk marvelled greatly at his story and said By Allah O my son never in my life heard I of this castle nor ever saw I one who had heard of it or had seen it for all I was alive in the days of Noah Allah s Prophet on whom be peace FN five hundred sixty four and I have ruled the birds and beasts and Jinn ever since his time nor do I believe that Solomon David son himself knew of it But wait till the birds and beasts and chiefs of the Jann come to do their homage to me and I will question them of it peradventure some one of them may be able to give us news of it and Allah Almighty shall make all things easy to thee So Janshah homed with the hermit until the day of the assembly when all the birds and beasts and Jann came to swear fealty and Yaghmus and his guest questioned them anent Takni the Castle of Jewels but they all replied We never saw or heard of such a place At this Janshah fell a weeping and lamenting and humbled himself before the Most High but as he was thus engaged behold there flew down from the heights of air another bird big of bulk and black of blee which had tarried behind the rest and kissed the hermit s hands Yaghmus asked it of Takni the Castle of Jewels and it answered saying O Monk when I and my brothers were small chicks we abode behind the Mountain Kaf on a hill of crystal in the midst of a great desert and our father and mother used to set out for it every morning and in the evening come back with our food They went out early one day and were absent from us a sennight and hunger was sore upon us but on the eighth day they returned both weeping and we asked them the reason of their absence Quoth they A Marid swooped down on us and carried us off in his claws to Takni the Castle of Jewels and brought us before King Shahlan who would have slain us but we told him that we had left behind us a brood of fledgelings so he spared our lives and let us go And were my parents yet in the bonds of life they would give thee news of the castle When Janshah heard this he wept bitter tears and said to the hermit Prithee bid the bird carry me to his father and mother s nest on the crystal hill behind the Mountain Kaf So the hermit said O bird I desire thee to obey this youth in whatsoever he may command thee I hear and obey thy bidding replied the fowl and taking Janshah on its back flew with him days and nights without ceasing till it set him down on the Hill of Crystal and there alighted And having delayed there a resting while it again set him on its back and flew off and ceased not flying for two whole days till it reached the spot where the nest was And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the fowl ceased not flying with Janshah two full days till it reached the spot where the nest was and set him down there and said O Janshah this is where our nest was He wept sore and replied I pray thee bear me farther on to where thy parents used to forage for food The bird consented so it took him up again and flew on with him seven nights and eight days till it set him down on the top of a high hill Karmus highs and left him there saying I know of no land behind this hill Then it flew away and Janshah sat down on the hill top and fell asleep When he awoke he saw a something gleaming afar off as it were lightning and filling the firmament with its flashings and he wondered what this sheen could be without wotting that it was the Castle he sought So he descended the mountain and made towards the light which came from Takni the Castle of Jewels distant two months journey from Karmus the hill whereon he had alit and its foundations were fashioned of red rubies and its buildings of yellow gold Moreover it had a thousand turrets builded of precious metals and stones of price studded and set in the minerals brought from the Main of Murks and on this account it was named the Castle of Jewels Takni It was a vast great castle and the name of its king was King Shahlan the father of the lady Shamsah and her sisters Such was the case with Janshah but as regards Princess Shamsah when she fled from Janshah she made straight for the Castle of Jewels and told her father and mother all that had passed between the Prince and herself how he had wandered the world and seen its marvels and wonders and how fondly he loved her and how dearly she loved him Quoth they Thou hast not dealt righteously with him as Allah would have thee deal Moreover King Shahlan repeated the story to his guards and officers of the Marids of the Jinn and bade them bring him every mortal they should see For the lady Shamsah had said to her parents Janshah loveth me with passionate love and forsure he will follow me for when flying from his father s roof I cried to him An thou love me seek me at Takni the Castle of Jewels Now when Janshah beheld that sheen and shine he made straight for it wishing to find out what it might be And as chance would have it Shamsah had that very day despatched a Marid on an occasion in the direction of the hill Karmus and on his way thither he caught sight of a man a mortal so he hastened up to him and saluted him Janshah was terrified at his sight but returned his salam and the Marid asked What is thy name and he answered My name is Janshah and I have fallen madly in love with a Jinniyah known as Princess Shamsah who captivated me by her beauty and loveliness but despite my dear love she fled from the palace wherein I placed her and behold I am here in quest of her Herewith he wept with bitter weeping The Marid looked at him and his heart burned with pity on hearing the sad tale and he said Weep not for surely thou art come to thy desire Know that she loveth thee fondly and hath told her parents of thy love for her and all in yonder castle love thee for her sake so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear Then he took him on his shoulders and made off with him to the Castle of Jewels Takni Thereupon the bearers of fair tidings hastened to report his coming and when the news reached Shamsah and her father and mother they all rejoiced with exceeding joy and King Shahlan took horse and rode out commanding all his guards and Ifrits and Marids honourably to meet the Prince And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty sixth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Shahlan commanded all his guards and Ifrits and Marids to meet the Prince and as soon as he came up with him he dismounted and embraced him and Janshah kissed his hand Then Shahlan bade put on him a robe of honour of many coloured silk laced with gold and set with jewels and a coronet such as man never saw and mounting him on a splendid mare of the steeds of the Kings of the Jinn took horse himself and with an immense retinue riding on the right hand and the left brought him in great state to the Castle Janshah marvelled at the splendour of this edifice with its walls builded of rubies and other jewels and its pavement of crystal and jasper and emerald and fell a weeping at the memory of his past miseries but the King and Queen Shamsah s mother wiped away his tears and said Now no more weeping and be of good cheer for thou hast won to thy will Then Shahlan carried him into the inner court of the Castle where he was received by a multitude of beautiful damsels and pages and black Jinn slaves who seated him in the place of honour and stood to do him service whilst he was lost in amazement at the goodliness of the place and its walls all edified of precious metals and jewels of price Presently King Shahlan repaired to his hall of audience where he sat down on his throne and bidding the slave girls and the pages introduce the Prince rose to receive him and seated him by his side on the throne Then he ordered the tables to be spread and they ate and drank and washed their hands after which in came the Queen Shamsah s mother and saluting Janshah bade him welcome in these words Thou hast come to thy desire after weariness and thine eyes shall now sleep after watching so praised be Allah for thy safety Thus saying she went away and forthwith returned with the Princess Shamsah who saluted Janshah and kissed his hands hanging her head in shame and confusion before him and her parents after which as many of her sisters as were in the palace came up to him and greeted him in like manner Then quoth the Queen to him Welcome O my son our daughter Shamsah hath indeed sinned against thee but do thou pardon her misdeed for our sakes When Janshah heard this he cried out and fell down fainting whereat the King marvelled and they sprinkled on his face rose water mingled with musk and civet till he came to himself and looking at Princess Shamsah said Praised be Allah who hath brought me to my desire and hath quenched the fire of my heart Replied she May He preserve thee from the Fire but now tell me O Janshah what hath befallen thee since our parting and how thou madest thy way to this place seeing that few even of the Jann ever heard of Takni the Castle of Jewels and we are independent of all the Kings nor any wotteth the road hither Thereupon he related to her every adventure and peril and hardship he had suffered and how he had left his father at war with King Kafid ending with these words And all for thy sake my lady Shamsah Quoth the Queen Now hast thou thy heart s desire for the Princess is thy handmaid and we give her in free gift to thee Janshah joyed exceedingly at these words and the Queen added Next month if it be the will of Almighty Allah we will have a brave wedding and celebrate the marriage festival and after the knot is tied we will send you both back to thy native land with an escort of a thousand Marids of our body guard the least of whom an thou bid him slay King Kafid and his folk would surely destroy them to the last man in the twinkling of an eye Furthermore if it please thee we will send thee year after year a company of which each and every can so do with all thy foes And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty seventh Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that the lady Shamsah s mother ended with saying And if it so please thee we will send thee year after year a company of which each and every can destroy thy foes to the last man Then King Shahlan sat down on his throne and summoning his Grandees and Officers of state bade them make ready for the marriage festivities and decorate the city seven days and nights We hear and we obey answered they and busied themselves two months in the preparations after which they celebrated the marriage of the Prince and Princess and held a mighty festival never was there its like Then they brought Janshah in to his bride and he abode with her in all solace of life and delight for two years at the end of which time he said to her Thy father promised to send us to my native land that we might pass one year there and the next here Answered she I hear and obey and going in to King Shahlan at nightfall told him what the Prince had said Quoth he I consent but have patience with me till the first of the month that I may make ready for your departure She repeated these words to her husband and they waited till the appointed time when the King bade his Marids bring out to them a great litter of red gold set with pearls and jewels and covered with a canopy of green silk purfled in a profusion of colours and embroidered with precious stones dazzling with its goodliness the eyes of every beholder He chose out four of his Marids to carry the litter in whichever of the four quarters the riders might choose Moreover he gave his daughter three hundred beautiful damsels to wait upon her and bestowed on Janshah the like number of white slaves of the sons of the Jinn Then the lady Shamsah took formal leave of her mother and sisters and all her kith and kin and her father fared forth with them So the four Marids took up the litter each by one corner and rising under it like birds in air flew onward with it between earth and heaven till mid day when the King bade them set it down and all alighted Then they took leave of one another and King Shahlan commended Shamsah to the Prince s care and giving them in charge to the Marids returned to the Castle of Jewels whilst the Prince and Princess remounted the litter and the Marids taking it up flew on for ten whole days in each of which they accomplished thirty months journey till they sighted the capital of King Teghmus Now one of them knew the land of Kabul so when he saw the city he bade the others let down the litter at that populous place which was the capital And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty eighth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Marid guards let down the litter at the capital of King Teghmus who had been routed and had fled from his foes into the city where he was in sore straits King Kafid having laid close siege to him He sought to save himself by making peace with the King of Hind but his enemy would give him no quarter so seeing himself without resource or means of relief he determined to strangle himself and to die and be at rest from this trouble and misery Accordingly he bade his Wazirs and Emirs farewell and entered his house to take leave of his Harim and the whole realm was full of weeping and wailing and lamentation and woe And whilst this rout and hurly burly was enacting behold the Marids descended with the litter upon the palace that was in the citadel and Janshah bade them set it down in the midst of the Divan They did his bidding and he alighted with his company of handmaids and Mamelukes and seeing all the folk of the city in straits and desolation and sore distress said to the Princess O love of my heart and coolth of mine eyes look in what a piteous plight is my sire There upon she bade the Marid guard fall upon the beleaguering host and slay them saying Kill ye all even to the last man and Janshah commanded one of them by name Karatash FN five hundred sixty five who was exceeding strong and valiant to bring King Kafid to him in chains So they set down the litter and covered it with the canopy then having waited till midnight they attacked the enemy s camp one of them being a match for ten or at least for eight And while these smote the foes with iron maces those mounted their magical elephants and soared high in the lift and then swooping down and snatching up their opponents tare them to pieces in mid air But Karatash made straight for Kafid s tent where he found him lying in a couch so he took him up shrieking for fear and flew with him to Janshah who bade the four Marids bind him on the litter and hang him high in the air over his camp that he might witness the slaughter of his men They did as the Prince commanded them and left Kafid who had swooned for fear hanging between earth and air and buffeting his face for grief As for King Teghmus when he saw his son he well nigh died for excess of joy and crying with a loud cry fell down in a swoon They sprinkled rose water on his face till he came to himself when he and his son embraced and wept with sore weeping for he knew not that the Jinn guard were battling with King Kafid s men Then Princess Shamsah accosted the King and kissing his hand said to him Sire be pleased to go up with me to the palace roof and witness the slaughter of thy foes by my father s Marids So he went up to the terrace roof and sitting down there with his daughter in law enjoyed watching the Marids do havoc among the besiegers and break a way through the length and breadth of them For one of them smote with his iron mace upon the elephants and their riders and pounded them till man was not to be distinguished from beast whilst another shouted in the faces of those who fled so that they fell down dead and the third caught up a score of horsemen beasts and all and towering with them high in air cast them down on earth so that they were torn in pieces And this was high enjoyment for Janshah and his father and the lady Shamsah And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Twenty ninth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Teghmus and his son and daughter in law went up to the terrace roof and enjoyed a prospect of the Jinn guards battling with the beleaguering host And King Kafid still hanging between heaven and earth also saw the slaughter of his troops and wept sore and buffeted his face nor did the carnage cease among the army of Hind for two whole days till they were cut off even to the last man Then Janshah commanded a Marid by name Shimwal chain up King Kafid with manacles and fetters and imprison him in a tower called the Black Bulwark And when his bidding was done King Teghmus bade beat the drums and despatched messengers to announce the glad news to Janshah s mother informing her of his approach whereupon she mounted in great joy and she no sooner espied her son than she clasped him in her arms and swooned away for stress of gladness They sprinkled rose water on her face till she came to herself when she embraced him again and again wept for excess of joy And when the lady Shamsah knew of her coming she came to her and saluted her and they embraced each other and after remaining embraced for an hour sat down to converse Then King Teghmus threw open the city gates and despatched couriers to all parts of the kingdom to spread the tidings of his happy deliverance whereupon all his princely Vassals and Emirs and the Grandees of the realm flocked to salute him and give him joy of his victory and of the safe return of his son and they brought him great store of rich offerings and curious presents The visits and oblations continued for some time after which the King made a second and a more splendid bride feast for the Princess Shamsah and bade decorate the city and held high festival Lastly they unveiled and paraded the bride before Janshah with apparel and ornaments of the utmost magnificence and when her bridegroom went in to her he presented her with an hundred beautiful slave girls to wait upon her Some days after this the Princess repaired to the King and interceded with him for Kafid saying Suffer him return to his own land and if henceforward he be minded to do thee a hurt I will bid one of the Jinn guard snatch him up and bring him to thee Replied Teghmus I hear and I obey and bade Shimwal bring him the prisoner who came manacled and fettered and kissed earth between his hands Then he commanded to strike off his chains and mounting him on a lame mare said to him Verily Princess Shamsah hath interceded for thee so begone to thy kingdom but if thou fall again to thine old tricks she will send one of the Marids to seize thee and bring thee hither Thereupon King Kafid set off home wards in the sorriest of plights And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirtieth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that King Kafid set off homewards in the sorriest of plights whilst Janshah and his wife abode in all solace and delight of life making the most of its joyance and happiness All this recounted the youth sitting between the tombs unto Bulukiya ending with And behold I am Janshah who witnessed all these things O my brother O Bulukiya Then Bulukiya who was wandering the world in his love for Mohammed whom Allah bless and keep asked Janshah O my brother what be these two sepulchres and why sittest thou between them and what causeth thy weeping He answered Know O Bulukiya that we abode in all solace and delight of life passing one year at home and the next at Takni the Castle of Jewels whither we betook not ourselves but in the litter borne by the Marids and flying between heaven and earth Quoth Bulukiya O my brother O Janshah what was the distance between the Castle and thy home Quoth he Every day we accomplished a journey of thirty months and the time we took was ten days We abode on this wise a many of years till one year we set out for the Castle of Jewels as was our wont and on the way thither alighted from the litter in this island to rest and take our pleasure therein We sat down on the riverbank and ate and drank after which the Lady Shamsah having a mind to bathe put off her clothes and plunged into the water Her women did likewise and they swam about awhile whilst I walked on along the bank of the stream leaving them to swim about and play with one another And behold a huge shark of the monsters of the deep seized the Princess by the leg without touching any of the girls and she cried out and died forthright whilst the damsels fled out of the river to the pavilion to escape from the shark But after awhile they returned and taking up her corpse carried her to the litter Now when I saw her dead I fell down fainting and they sprinkled water on my face till I recovered and wept over her Then I despatched the Jinn guards to her parents and family announcing what had befallen her and in the shortest time they came to the spot and washed her and shrouded her after which they buried her by the river side and made mourning for her They would have carried me with them to their own country but I said to King Shahlan I beseech thee to dig me a grave beside her tomb that when I die I may be buried by her side in that grave Accordingly the King commanded one of his Marids to do as I wished after which they departed and left me here to weep and mourn for her till I die And this is my story and the cause of my sojourn between these two tombs And he repeated these two couplets FN five hundred sixty six The house sweet heart is now no home to me Since thou art gone nor neighbour neighbourly The friend whilom I took to heart no more Is friend and brightest lights lose brilliancy But when Bulukiya heard out Janshah s tale he marvelled And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirty first Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Bulukiya heard out Janshah s tale he wondered and exclaimed By Allah methought I had indeed wandered over the world and compassed it about but now I forget all I have seen after listening to these adventures of thine He was silent a while and then resumed I beg thee of thy favour and courtesy to direct me in the way of safety So Janshah directed him into the right road and Bulukiya farewelled him and went his ways All this the Serpent queen related to Hasib Karim al Din and he asked her But how knowest thou of these things and she answered O Hasib thou must ken that I had occasion some five and twenty years ago to send one of my largest serpents to Egypt and gave her a letter for Bulukiya saluting him So she went there willingly for she had a daughter in the land called Bint Shumukh FN five hundred sixty seven and after asking anent Bulukiya she found him and gave him my missive He read it and replied to the messenger snake Thou comest from the Queen of the Serpents whom I am minded to visit for I have an occasion to her She replied I hear and obey Then she bore him to her daughter of whom she took leave and said to her companion Close thine eyes So he closed them and opening them again behold he found himself on the mountain where I now am Then his guide carried him to a great serpent whom he saluted whereupon quoth she Didst thou deliver the missive to Bulukiya and she replied Even so and he hath accompanied me and here he standeth Presently Bulukiya asked after me the Serpent queen and the great serpent answered She hath gone to the mountain Kaf with all her host as is her wont in winter but next summer she will come hither again As often as she goeth thither she appointeth me to reign in her room during her absence and if thou have any occasion to her I will accomplish it for thee Said he I beg thee to bring me the herb which whoso crusheth and drinketh the juice thereof sickeneth not neither groweth grey nor dieth I will not bring it said the serpent till thou tell me what befell thee since thou leftest the Queen of the Serpents to go with Affan in quest of King Solomon s tomb So he related to her all his travels and adventures together with the history of Janshah and said at last Grant me my request that I may return to mine own country Replied the serpent By the virtue of the lord Solomon I know not where is to be found the herb whereof thou speakest Then she bade the serpent which had brought him thither carry him back to Egypt so the messenger obeyed her and said to him Shut thine eyes He did so and opening them again found himself on the mountain Mukattam FN five hundred sixty eight When I returned from the mountain Kaf added the Queen the serpent my deputy informed me of Bulukiya s visit and gave me his salutations and repeated to me his story and his meeting with Janshah And this O Hasib is how I came to know the adventures of Bulukiya and the history of Janshah Thereupon Hasib said to her O Queen deign recount to me what befell Bulukiya as regards his return to Egypt She replied Know O Hasib that when he parted from Janshah he fared on nights and days till he came to a great sea so he anointed his feet with the juice of the magical herb and walking over the face of the waters sped onwards till he came to an island abounding in trees and springs and fruits as it were the Garden of Eden He landed and walked about till he saw an immense tree with leaves as big as the sails of a ship So he went up to the tree and found under it a table spread with all manner meats whilst on a branch of the branches sat a great bird whose body was of pearls and leek green emeralds its feet of silver its beak of red carnelian and its plumery of precious metals and it was engaged in singing the praises of Allah the Most High and blessing Mohammed on whom be benediction and peace And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirty second Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Bulukiya landed and walked about the island he found therein many marvels especially a bird whose body was of pearls and leek green emeralds and its plumery of precious metals and it was engaged in singing the praises of Allah the Most High and blessing Mohammed upon whom be benediction and peace Seeing this he said Who and what art thou Quoth the bird I am one of the birds of Eden and followed Adam when Allah Almighty cast him out thence And know O my brother that Allah also cast out with him four leaves of the trees of the garden to cover his nakedness withal and they fell to the ground after awhile One of them was eaten by a worm and of it came silk the gazelles ate the second and thence proceeded musk the third was eaten by bees and gave rise to honey whilst the fourth fell in the land of Hind and from it sprang all manner of spices As for me I wandered over the face of earth till Allah deigned give me this island for a dwelling place and I took up my abode here And every Friday from night till morning the Saints and Princes FN five hundred sixty nine of the Faith flock to this place and make pious visitation and eat from this table spread by Allah Almighty and after they have eaten the table is taken up again to Heaven nor doth the food ever waste or corrupt So Bulukiya ate his fill of the meats and praised the Great Creator And presently behold there came up Al Khizr FN five hundred seventy with whom be peace at sight of whom Bulukiya rose and saluting him was about to withdraw when the bird said to him Sit O Bulukiya in the presence of Al Khizr on whom be peace So he sat down again and Al Khizr said to him Let me know who thou art and tell me thy tale Thereupon Bulukiya related to him all his adventures from beginning to end and asked O my lord how far is it hence to Cairo Five and ninety years journey replied the Prophet whereupon Bulukiya burst into tears then falling at Al Khizr s feet kissed them and said to him I beseech thee deliver me from this strangerhood and thy reward be with Allah for that I am nigh upon death and know not what to do Quoth Al Khizr Pray to Allah Almighty that He permit me to carry thee to Cairo ere thou perish So Bulukiya wept and humbled himself before Allah who granted his prayer and by inspiration bade Al Khizr bear him to his people Then said the Prophet Lift thy head for Allah hath heard thy prayer and hath inspired me to do what thou desires so take fast hold of me with both thy hands and shut thine eyes The Prince did as he was bidden and Al Khizr stepped a single step forwards then said to him Open thine eyes So Bulukiya opened his eyes and found himself at the door of his palace at Cairo He turned to take leave of Al Khizr but found no trace of him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirty third Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that when Bulukiya standing at the gate of his palace turned to take leave of Al Khizr he found no trace of him and entered the palace When his mother saw him she cried with a loud cry and swooned away for excess of joy and they sprinkled water upon her face After awhile she came to herself and embraced her son and wept with sore weeping whilst Bulukiya wept and laughed by turns Then all his friends and kindred came and gave him joy of his safe return and the news was noised abroad in the land and there came to him presents from all parts Moreover they beat the drums and blew the flutes and rejoiced mightily Then Bulukiya related to them his adventures ending with recounting how Al Khizr had set him down at his palace door whereat they marvelled exceedingly and wept till all were a weary of weeping Hasib wondered at the Queen s tale and shed many tears over it then he again besought her to let him return to his family but she said I fear me O Hasib that when thou gettest back to thy country thou wilt fail of thy promise and prove traitor to thine oath and enter the Hammam But he swore to her another solemn oath that he would never again enter the baths as long as he lived whereupon she called a serpent and bade her carry him up to the surface of the earth So the serpent took him and led him from place to place till she brought him out on the platform edge of an abandoned cistern and there left him Upon this he walked to the city and coming to his house by the last of the day at the yellowing of the sun knocked at the door His mother opened it and seeing her son screamed out and threw herself upon him and wept for excess of joy His wife heard her mother in law weeping so she came out to her and seeing her husband saluted him and kissed his hands and each rejoiced in other with exceeding joy of all three Then they entered the house and sat down to converse and presently Hasib asked his mother of the woodcutters who had left him to perish in the cistern Quoth she They came and told me that a wolf had eaten thee in the Wady As for them they are become merchants and own houses and shops and the world is grown wide for them But every day they bring me meat and drink and thus have they done until the present time Quoth Hasib To morrow do thou go to them and say My son Hasib Karim al Din hath returned from his travels so come ye to meet him and salute him Accordingly when morning dawned she repaired to the woodcutters houses and delivered to them her son s message which when they heard they changed colour and saying We hear and obey gave her each a suit of silk embroidered with gold adding Present this to thy good son FN five hundred seventy one and tell him that we will be with him to morrow She assented and returning to Hasib gave him their presents and message Meanwhile the woodcutters called together a number of merchants and acquainting them with all that had passed between themselves and Hasib took counsel with them what they should do Quoth the merchants It behoveth each one of you to give him half his monies and Mamelukes And they all agreed to do this so on the next day each of them took half his wealth and going in to Hasib saluted him and kissed his hands Then they laid before him what they had brought saying This is of thy bounties and we are in thy hands He accepted their peace offering and said What is past is past that which befell us was decreed of Allah and destiny doeth away with dexterity Quoth they Come let us walk about and take our solace in the city and visit the Hammam Quoth he Not so I have taken an oath never again to enter the baths so long as I live Rejoined they at least come to our homes that we may entertain thee He agreed to this and went to their houses and each of them entertained him for a night and a day nor did they cease to do thus for a whole sennight being seven in number And now Hasib was master of monies and houses and shops and the merchants of the city foregathered with him and he told them all that had befallen him He became one of the chiefs of the guild and abode on this wise awhile till it happened one day as he was walking about the streets that he passed the door of a Hammam whose keeper was one of his companions When the bathman who was standing without caught his eye he ran up to him and saluted him and embraced him saying Favour me by entering the bath and there wash and be rubbed that I may show thee hospitality Hasib refused alleging that he had taken a solemn oath never again to enter the Hammam but the bathman was instant with him saying Be my three wives triply divorced can thou enter not and be washed When Hasib heard him thus conjure him he was confounded and replied O my brother hast thou a mind to ruin my house and make my children orphans and lay a load of sin upon my neck But his friend threw himself at his feet and kissed them saying My happiness dependeth upon thy entering and be the sin on the neck of me Then all the servants of the bath set upon Hasib and dragging him in pulled off his clothes But hardly had he sat down against the wall and begun to pour water on his head when a score of men accosted him saying Rise O man and come with us to the Sultan for thou art his debtor Then they despatched one of them as messenger to the Sultan s Minister who straightway took horse and rode attended by threescore Mamelukes to the baths where he alighted and going in to Hasib saluted him and said Welcome to thee Then he gave the bathman an hundred diners and mounting Hasib on a horse he had brought with him returned with him and all his men to the Sultan s palace Here he bade them aid Hasib to dismount and after seating him comfortably set food before him and when they had eaten and drunken and washed their hands the Wazir clad him in two dresses of honour each worth five thousand diners and said to him Know that Allah hath been merciful to us in sending thee for the Sultan is nigh upon death by leprosy and the books tell us that his life is in thy hands Then accompanied by a host of Grandees he took him wondering withal and carried him through the seven doorways of the palace till they came to the King s chamber Now the name of this King was Karazdan King of Persia and of the Seven Countries and under his sway were an hundred sovereign princes sitting on chairs of red gold and ten thousand valiant captains under each one s hand an hundred deputies and as many headsmen armed with sword and axe They found the King lying on his bed with his face swathed in a napkin and groaning for excess of pain When Hasib saw this ordinance his wit was dazed for awe of the King so he kissed the ground before him and prayed a blessing on him Then the Grand Wazir whose name was Shamhur rose and welcoming Hasib seated him on a high chair at the King s right hand And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirty fourth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Wazir Shamhur rose to Hasib and seated him on a chair at the right hand of King Karazdan after which he called for food and the tables were laid And when they had eaten and drunken and washed their hands Shamhur stood up while all present also stood to do him honour and approaching Hasib said to him We are all thy servants and will give thee whatsoever thou askest even were it one half the kingdom so thou wilt but cure the King Saying this he led him by the hand to the royal couch and Hasib uncovering the King s face saw that he was at last fatal stage of the disease so he wondered at their hoping for a cure But the Wazir kissed his hand and repeated his offers and ended with saying All we want of thee is to heal our King so he said to the Wazir True that I am the son of Allah s prophet Daniel but I know nothing of his art for they put me thirty days in the school of medicine and I learnt nothing of the craft I would well I knew somewhat thereof and might heal the King Hearing this the Grand Wazir said Do not multiply words upon us for though we should gather together to us physicians from the East and from the West none could cure the King save thou Answered Hasib How can I make him whole seeing I know neither his case nor its cure Quoth the Minister His healing is in thy hands and quoth Hasib If I knew the remedy of his sickness I would heal him Thereupon the Wazir rejoined Thou keenest a cure right well the remedy of his sickness is the Queen of the Serpents and thou knowest her abiding place and hast been with her When Hasib heard this he knew that all this came of his entering the Baths and repented whenas repentance availed him naught then said he What is the Queen of the Serpents I know her not nor ever in all my life heard I of this name Retorted the Wazir Deny not the knowledge of her for I have proof that thou knowest her and hast passed two years with her Repeated Hasib Verily I never saw her nor even heard of her till this moment upon which Shamhur opened a book and after making sundry calculations raised his head and spake as follows The Queen of the Serpents shall foregather with a man who shall abide with her two years then shall he return from her and come forth to the surface of the earth and when he entereth the Hammam bath his belly will become black Then said he Look at thy belly So Hasib looked at his own belly and behold it was black but he persisted in his denial and said My belly was black from the day my mother bare me Said the Wazir I had stationed three Mamelukes at the door of every Hammam bidding them note all who entered and let me know when they found one whose belly was black so when thou enteredst they looked at thy belly and finding it black sent and told me after we had well nigh lost hope of coming upon thee All we want of thee is to show us the place whence thou camest out and after go thy ways for we have those with us who will take the Queen of the Serpents and fetch her to us Then all the other Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees flocked about Hasib who sorely repented of his misdeed and they conjured him till they were weary to show them the abode of the Queen but he ceased not saying I never saw nor heard of the matter Then the Grand Wazir called the hangman and bade him strip Hasib and beat him a sore beating and so they did till he saw death face to face for excess of pain and the Wazir said We have proof that thou knowest the abiding place of the Queen of the Serpents why wilt thou persist in denial Show us the place whence thou camest out and go from us we have with us one who will take her and no harm shall befall thee Then he raised him and bade give him a dress of honour of cloth of red gold embroidered with jewels and spoke him fair till Hasib yielded and said I will show you the place At this the Wazir rejoiced with great joy and took horse with all his many and rode guided by Hasib and never drew rein till they came to the mountain containing the cavern wherein he had found the cistern full of honey There all dismounted and followed him as he entered sighing and weeping and showed them the well whence he had issued whereupon the Wazir sat down thereby and sprinkling perfumes upon a chafing dish began to mutter charms and conjurations for he was a crafty magician and diviner and skilled in spiritual arts He repeated three several formulas of conjuration and between each threw fresh incense upon the fire crying out and saying Come forth O Queen of the Serpents when behold the water of the well sank down and a great door opened in the side from which came a mighty noise of crying like unto thunder so terrible that they thought the well had caved in and all present fell down fainting nay some even died for fright Presently there issued from the well a serpent as big as an elephant casting out sparks like red hot coals from its eyes and mouth and bearing on its back a charger of red gold set with pearls and jewels in the midst whereof lay a serpent from whose body issued such splendour that the place was illumined thereby and her face was fair and young and she spoke with most eloquent tongue The Serpent queen turned right and left till her eyes fell upon Hasib to whom said she Where is the covenant thou madest with me and the oath thou swearest to me that thou wouldst never again enter the Hammam bath But there is no fighting against Fate nor hath any ever fled from that which is written on his forehead Allah hath appointed the end of my life for thy hand to hend and it is His will that slain I be and King Karazdan be healed of his malady So saying she wept with sore weeping and Hasib wept to see her weep As for the abominable Wazir Shamhur he put out his hand to lay hold of her but she said to him Hold thy hand O accursed or I will blow upon thee and reduce thee to a heap of black ashes Then she cried out to Hasib saying Draw near me and take me in thine hand and lay me in the dish that is with you then set it on thy head for my death was fore ordained from Eternity without beginning FN five hundred seventy two to be at thy hand and thou hast no power to avert it So he took her and laid her in the dish and put it on his head when the well returned to its former state Then they set out on their return to the city Hasib carrying the dish on his head and when they were half way behold the Queen of the Serpents said to him privily Hearken O Hasib to my friendly counsel for all thou hast broken faith with me and been false to thine oath and hast done this misdeed but it was fore ordained from all eternity He replied To hear is to obey and she continued It is this when thou comest to the Wazir s house he will bid thee behead me and cut me in three but do thou refuse saying I know not how to slaughter FN four hundred seventy three and leave him to do it with his own hand and to work his wicked will When he hath cut my throat and divided my body into three pieces there will come a messenger to bid him to the King so he will lay my flesh in a cauldron of brass and set it upon a brasier before going to the presence and he will say to thee Keep up the fire under the cauldron till the scum rise then skim it off and pour it into a phial to cool Wait till it cool and then drink it so shall naught of malady or pain be left in all thy body When the second scum riseth skim it off and pour it into a phial against my return from the King that I may drink it for an ailment I have in my loins Then will he give thee the phials and go to the King and when he is gone do thou light the fire and wait till the first scum rise and set it in a phial keep it by thee but beware of drinking it or no good will befall thee When the second scum riseth skim it off and put it in a second phial and drink it down as soon as it cools When the Wazir returneth and asketh thee for the second phial give him the first and note what shall befall him And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirty fifth Night She said It hath reached me O auspicious King that the Serpent queen charged Hasib not to drink of the first scum and carefully to keep the second saying When the Wazir returneth from the King and asketh for the second phial give him the first and note what shall befall him then drink the contents of the second phial and thy heart will become the home of wisdom After this take up the flesh and laying it in a brazen platter carry it to the King and give him to eat thereof When he hath eaten it and it hath settled in his stomach veil his face with a kerchief and wait by him till noontide when he will have digested the meat Then give him somewhat of wine to drink and by the decree of Allah Almighty he will be healed of his unhealth and be made whole as he was And give thou ear to the charge wherewith I charge thee and keep it in thy memory with carefullest keeping They ceased not faring till they came to the Wazir s house and he said to Hasib Come in with me So he went in and the troops dispersed and fared each his own way whereupon Hasib set down the platter and the Wazir bade him slay the Queen of the Serpents but he said I know not how to slaughter and never in my born days killed I aught An thou wilt have her throat cut do it with thine own hand So the Minister Shamhur took the Queen from the platter and slew her seeing which Hasib wept bitter tears and the Wazir laughed at him saying O weak of wits how canst thou weep for the killing of a worm Then he cut her in three and laying the pieces in a brass cauldron set it on the fire and sat down to await the cooking of the flesh And whilst he was sitting lo there came a slave from the King who said to him The King calls for thee without stay or delay and he answered saying I hear and I obey So he gave Hasib two phials and bade him drink the first scum and keep the second against his return FN five hundred seventy four even as the Queen of the Serpents had foretold after which he went away with repeated charges and injunctions and Hasib tended the fire under the cauldron till the first scum rose when he skimmed it off and setting it in one of the phials kept it by him He then fed the fire till the second scum rose then he skimmed it off and putting it in the other phial kept it for himself And when the meat was done he took the cauldron off the fire and sat awaiting the Wazir who asked him on return What hast thou done and answered Hasib I did thy bidding to the last word Quoth the Wazir What hast thou done with the first phial I drank its contents but now replied Hasib and Shamhur asked Thy body feeleth it no change whereto Hasib answered Verily I feel as I were on fire from front to foot The villain Wazir made no reply hiding the truth but said Hand me the second phial that I may drink what is therein so haply I may be made whole of this ailing in my loins So Hasib brought him the first phial and he drank it off thinking it contained the second scum but hardly had he done drinking when the phial fell from his hand and he swelled up and dropped down dead and thus was exemplified in him the saying Whoso for his brother diggeth a pit he shall be the first to fall into it Now when Hasib saw this he wondered and feared to drink of the second phial but he remembered the Serpent queen s injunction and bethought him that the Wazir would not have reserved the second scum for himself had there been aught of hurt therein So he said I put my trust in Allah FN five hundred seventy five and drank off the contents of the phial No sooner had he done so than the Most Highest made the waters of wisdom to well up in his heart and opened to him the fountains of knowledge and joy and gladness overcame him Then he took the serpent s flesh from the cauldron and laying it on a platter of brass went forth from the Wazir s house On his way to the palace he raised his eyes and saw the seven Heavens and all that therein is even to the Lote tree beyond which there is no passing FN five hundred seventy six and the manner of the revolution of the spheres Moreover Allah discovered to him the ordinance of the planets and the scheme of their movements and the fixed stars and he saw the contour of the land and sea whereby he became informed with geometry astrology and astronomy and mathematics and all that hangeth thereby and he understood the causes and consequences of eclipses of the sun and moon Then he looked at the earth and saw all minerals and vegetables that are therein and thereon and he learned their properties and their virtues so that he became in an instant versed in medicine and chemistry and natural magic and the art of making gold and silver And he ceased not carrying the flesh till he came to the palace when he went in to King Karazdan and kissing the ground before him said May thy head survive thy Wazir Shamhur The King was mightily angered at the news of the Grand Wazir s death and wept for him whilst his Emirs and his Grandees and officers also wept Then said Karazdan He was with me but now in all health and went away to fetch me the flesh of the Queen of the Serpents if it should be cooked what befell him that he is now dead and what accident hath betided him So Hasib told him the whole truth how the Minister had drunk the contents of the phial and had forthwith swelled out and died The King mourned for his loss with mourning sore and said to Hasib What shall I do without Shamhur and Hasib answered Grieve not O King of the age for I will cure thee within three days and leave no whit of disease in thy body At this the King s breast waxed broad and he said I wish to be made whole of this affliction though after a long term of years So Hasib set the platter before the King and made him eat a slice of the flesh of the Serpent queen Then he covered him up and spreading a kerchief over his face bade him sleep and sat down by his side He slept from noonday till sundown while his stomach digested the piece of flesh and presently he awoke Hasib gave him somewhat of wine to drink and bade him sleep again so he slept till the morning and when dawn appeared Hasib repeated the treatment making him eat another piece of the flesh and thus he did with him three days following till he had eaten the whole when his skin began to shrink and scale off and he perspired so that the sweat ran down from his head to his heels Therewith he became whole and there abode in him no trace of the disease which when Hasib saw he said There is no help for it but thou go to the Hammam So he carried him to the bath and washed his body and when he came forth it was like a wand of silver and he was restored to health nay sounder than he was before he fell ill Thereupon he donned his richest robes and seating himself on his throne deigned make Hasib sit beside him Then he bade the tables be spread and they ate and washed their hands after which he called for the service of wine and both drank their fill Upon this all his Wazirs and Emirs and Captains and the Grandees of his realm and the notables of the lieges came in to him and gave him joy of his recovery and they beat the drums and adorned the city in token of rejoicing Then said the King to the assembly O Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees this is Hasim Karim al Din who hath healed me of my sickness and know all here present that I make him my Chief Wazir in the stead of the Wazir Shamhur And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say When it was the Five Hundred and Thirty sixth Night She continued It hath reached me O auspicious King that quoth King Karazdan to his Ministers and high lords He who healed me of my sickness is none other than Hasib Karim al Din here present Therefore I make him my Chief Wazir in the

obligatory saint Paul Heb xi twenty two says Let us draw near with a true heart having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with clean or pure water But this did not suffice Hence the Eastern Christian in hot climates where cleanliness should rank before godliness is distinguished by his dirt which as a holy or reverend man he makes still dirtier and he offers an

over sensibility of the sixth sense and to harden the glans against abrasions and infection by exposure to air and friction against the dress Almost all African tribes practise it but the modes vary and some are exceedingly curious I shall notice a peculiarly barbarous fashion called Al Salkh the flaying still practised in the Arabian province Al Asir Pilgrimage iii eighty There is a difference too between the Hebrew and the Moslem rite The Jewish operator after snipping off the foreskin rips up the prepuce with his sharp thumb nails so that the external cutis does not retract far from the internal and the wound when healed shows a narrow ring of cicatrice This ripping is not done by Moslems They use a stick as a probe passed round between glans and prepuce to ascertain the extent of the frenum and that there is no abnormal adhesion The foreskin is then drawn forward and fixed by the forceps a fork of two bamboo splints five or six inches long by a quarter thick or in some cases an iron like our compasses This is tied tightly over the foreskin so as to exclude about an inch and a half of the prepuce above and three quarters below A single stroke of the razor drawn directly

bred mare What hast thou done that thou art ridden by that ill omened Kafir the Badawin used to mutter when they saw a highly respectable missionary at Damascus mounting a fine Ruwala mare The feeling

Pirate to Alexander Iskandar was originally called Marzban Lord of the Marches son of Marzabah and though descended from Yunan son of Japhet the eponymus of the Greeks was born obscure the son of an old woman According to the Persians he was the son of the Elder Darab Darius Codomannus of the Kayanian or Second dynasty by a daughter of Philip of Macedon and was brought up by his grandfather When Abraham and Isaac had rebuilt the Ka abah they foregathered with him and Allah sent him forth against the four quarters of the earth to convert men to the faith of the Friend or to cut their throats thus he became one of the four world conquerors with Nimrod Solomon Bukht al Nasr Nabochodonosor and he lived down two generations of men His Wazir was Aristu the Greek Aristotle and he carried a couple of flags white and black which made day and night for him and facilitated his conquests At the end of Persia where he was invited by the people on account of the cruelty of his half brother

Book of the great Persian poet Nizami who flourished A H five hundred fifteen five hundred ninety seven between the days of Firdausi ob A D ten twenty one and Sa adi ob A D twelve ninety one In that romance Sikandar builds where the sun goes down a castle of glittering stone which kills men by causing excessive laughter and surrounds it with yellow earth like gold Hence the City of Brass He also

is my pride intelligible in a man who never wanted for anything Here he is diametrically opposed to Ali who honestly abused poverty and the Prophet seems to have borrowed from Christendom whose Lazarus and Dives shows a man sent to Hell because he enjoyed a very modified Heaven in this life and which suggested that one of the man s greatest miseries is an ecclesiastical virtue Holy Poverty represented in the Church as a bride young and lovely If a rich man can hardly enter the kingdom what must it be with a poor man whose conditions are far more unfavourable Going to the other extreme we may say that Poverty is the root of all evil and the more so as it curtails man s power of benefiting others Practically I observe that those who preach and praise it the most practise it the least willingly the ecclesiastic has always some special reasons a church or a school is wanted but not the less he wishes for more money In Syria this Holy Poverty leads to strange abuses At Bayrut I

the same time as Abraham It is now or should be universal in Al Islam and no Arab would marry a girl unpurified by it Son of an uncircumcised mother Ibn al bazra is a sore insult As regards the popular idea that Jewish women were circumcised till the days of Rabbi Gershom A D one thousand who denounced it as a scandal to the Gentiles the learned Prof H Graetz informs me with some indignation that the rite was never practised and that the great Rabbi contended only against polygamy Female circumcision however is I believe the rule amongst some outlying tribes of Jews The rite is the proper complement of male circumcision evening the sensitiveness of the genitories by reducing it equally in both sexes an uncircumcised woman has the venereal orgasm much sooner and oftener than a circumcised man and frequent coitus would injure her health hence I believe despite the learned historian that it is practised by some Eastern Jews Excision is universal amongst the negroids of the Upper Nile Werne the Somal and other adjacent tribes The operator an old woman takes up the instrument a knife or razor blade fixed into a wooden handle and with three sweeps cuts off the labia and the head of the clitoris The parts are then sewn up with a packneedle and a thread of sheepskin and in Dar For a tin tube is inserted for the passage of urine Before marriage the bridegroom trains himself for a month on beef honey and milk and if he can open his bride with the natural weapon he is a sworder to whom no woman in the tribe can deny herself If he fails he tries penetration with his fingers and by way of last resort whips out his whittle and cuts the parts open The sufferings of the first few nights must be severe The few Somali prostitutes who practised at Aden always had the labiae and clitoris excised and the skin showing the scars of coarse sewing The moral effect of female circumcision is peculiar While it diminishes the heat of passion it increases licentiousness and breeds a debauchery of mind far worse than bodily unchastity because accompanied by a peculiar cold cruelty and a taste for artificial stimulants to luxury It is the sexlessness of a spayed canine

Scythia he writes there is a valley begirt with stony mountains as with walls It is inaccessible to man and so excessively deep that the bottom of the valley is invisible from the top of the surrounding mountains So great is the darkness that it has the effect of a kind of chaos To this place certain criminals are condemned whose task it is to throw down into the valley slaughtered lambs from which the skin has been first taken off The little stones adhere to these pieces of flesh Thereupon the eagles which live on the summits of the mountains fly down following the scent of the flesh and carry away the lambs with the stones adhering to them They then who are condemned to this place watch until the eagles have finished their meal and run and take away the stones Epiphanius who wrote this is spoken of in terms of great respect by many ecclesiastical writers and saint Jerome styles the treatise here quoted Egregium volumen quod si legere volueris plenissimam scientiam consequeris and indeed it is by no means improbable that it was from the account of Epiphanius that this story was first translated into Arabic A similar account is given by Marco Polo and by Nicolo

Golconda was alluded to He calls the mountain Albenigaras and says that it was infested with serpents Marco Polo also speaks of these serpents and while his account agrees with that of Sindbad
