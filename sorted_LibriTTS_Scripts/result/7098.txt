General Sir George Wentworth Higginson K C B Gyldernscroft Marlow England THIS BOOK IS INSCRIBED IN TOKEN OF KINDRED AND OF OLD FAMILY FRIENDSHIPS CORDIALLY PRESERVED INTO THE PRESENT GENERATION THESE LEGENDS UNITE THE TWO SIDES OF THE ATLANTIC AND FORM A PART OF THE COMMON HERITAGE OF THE ENGLISH SPEAKING RACE Preface Hawthorne in his Wonder Book has described the beautiful Greek myths and traditions but no one has yet made similar use of the wondrous tales that gathered for more than a thousand years about the islands of the Atlantic deep Although they are a part of the mythical period of American history these hazy legends were altogether disdained by the earlier historians indeed George Bancroft made it a matter of actual pride that the beginning of the American annals was bare and literal But in truth no national history has been less prosaic as to its earlier traditions because every visitor had to cross the sea to reach it and the sea has always been by the mystery of its horizon the fury of its storms and the variableness of the atmosphere above it the foreordained land of romance In all ages and with all sea going races there has always been something especially fascinating about an island amid the ocean Its very existence has for all explorers an air of magic An island offers to us heights rising from depths it exhibits that which is most fixed beside that which is most changeable the fertile beside the barren and safety after danger The ocean forever tends to encroach on the island the island upon the ocean They exist side by side friends yet enemies The island signifies safety in calm and yet danger in storm in a tempest the sailor rejoices that he is not near it even if previously bound for it he puts about and steers for the open sea Often if he seeks it he cannot reach it The present writer spent a winter on the island of Fayal and saw in a storm a full rigged ship drift through the harbor disabled having lost her anchors and it was a week before she again made the port There are groups of islands scattered over the tropical ocean especially to which might well be given Herman Melville s name Las Encantadas the Enchanted Islands These islands usually volcanic have no vegetation but cactuses or wiry bushes with strange names no inhabitants but insects and reptiles lizards spiders snakes with vast tortoises which seem of immemorial age and are coated with seaweed and the slime of the ocean If there are any birds it is the strange and heavy penguin the passing albatross or the Mother Cary s chicken which has been called the humming bird of ocean and here finds a place for its young By night these birds come for their repose at earliest dawn they take wing and hover over the sea leaving the isle deserted The only busy or beautiful life which always surrounds it is that of a myriad species of fish of all forms and shapes and often more gorgeous than any butterflies in gold and scarlet and yellow Once set foot on such an island and you begin at once to understand the legends of enchantment which ages have collected around such spots Climb to its heights you seem at the masthead of some lonely vessel kept forever at sea You feel as if no one but yourself had ever landed there and yet perhaps even there looking straight downward you see below you in some crevice of the rock a mast or spar of some wrecked vessel encrusted with all manner of shells and uncouth vegetable growth No matter how distant the island or how peacefully it seems to lie upon the water there may be perplexing currents that ever foam and swirl about it currents which are at all tides and in the calmest weather as dangerous as any tempest and which make compass untrustworthy and helm powerless It is to be remembered also that an island not only appears and disappears upon the horizon in brighter or darker skies but it varies its height and shape doubles itself in mirage or looks as if broken asunder divided into two or three Indeed the buccaneer Cowley writing of one such island which he had visited says My fancy led me to call it Cowley s Enchanted Isle for we having had a sight of it upon several points of the compass it appeared always in so many different forms sometimes like a ruined fortification upon another point like a great city If much of this is true even now it was far truer before the days of Columbus when men were constantly looking westward across the Atlantic and wondering what was beyond In those days when no one knew with certainty whether the ocean they observed was a sea or a vast lake it was often called The Sea of Darkness A friend of the Latin poet Ovid describing the first approach to this sea says that as you sail out upon it the day itself vanishes and the world soon ends in perpetual darkness Quo Ferimur Ruit ipsa Dies orbemque relictum Ultima perpetuis claudit natura tenebris Nevertheless it was the vague belief of many nations that the abodes of the blest lay somewhere beyond it in the other world a region half earthly half heavenly whence the spirits of the departed could not cross the water to return and so they were constantly imagining excursions made by favored mortals to enchanted islands To add to the confusion actual islands in the Atlantic were sometimes discovered and actually lost again as for instance the Canaries which were reached and called the Fortunate Isles a little before the Christian era and were then lost to sight for thirteen centuries ere being visited again The glamour of enchantment was naturally first attached by Europeans to islands within sight of their own shores Irish Welsh Breton or Spanish and then as these islands became better known men s imaginations carried the mystery further out over the unknown western sea The line of legend gradually extended itself till it formed an imaginary chart for Columbus the aged astronomer Toscanelli for instance suggesting to him the advantage of making the supposed island of Antillia a half way station just as it was proposed long centuries after to find a station for the ocean telegraph in the equally imaginary island of Jacquet which has only lately disappeared from the charts With every step in knowledge the line of fancied stopping places rearranged itself the fictitious names flitting from place to place on the maps and sometimes duplicating themselves Where the tradition itself has vanished we find that the names with which it associated itself are still assigned as in case of Brazil and the Antilles to wholly different localities The order of the tales in the present work follows roughly the order of development giving first the legends which kept near the European shore and then those which like saint Brandan s or Antillia were assigned to the open sea or like Norumbega or the Isle of Demons to the very coast of America Every tale in this book bears reference to some actual legend followed more or less closely and the authorities for each will be found carefully given in the appendix for such readers as may care to follow the subject farther It must be remembered that some of these imaginary islands actually remained on the charts of the British admiralty until within a century If even the exact science of geographers retained them thus long surely romance should embalm them forever CAMBRIDGE MASS

I THE STORY OF ATLANTIS The Greek sage Socrates when he was but a boy minding his father s goats used to lie on the grass under the myrtle trees and while the goats grazed around him he loved to read over and over the story which Solon the law giver and poet wrote down for the great grandfather of Socrates and which Solon had always meant to make into a poem though he died without doing it But this was briefly what he wrote in prose I Solon was never in my life so surprised as when I went to Egypt for instruction in my youth and there in the temple of Sais saw an aged priest who told me of the island of Atlantis which was sunk in the sea thousands of years ago He said that in the division of the earth the gods agreed that the god Poseidon or Neptune should have as his share this great island which then lay in the ocean west of the Mediterranean Sea and was larger than all Asia There was a mortal maiden there whom Poseidon wished to marry and to secure her he surrounded the valley where she dwelt with three rings of sea and two of land so that no one could enter and he made underground springs with water hot or cold and supplied all things needful to the life of man Here he lived with her for many years and they had ten sons and these sons divided the island among them and had many children who dwelt there for more than a thousand years They had mines of gold and silver and pastures for elephants and many fragrant plants They erected palaces and dug canals and they built their temples of white red and black stone and covered them with gold and silver In these were statues of gold especially one of the god Poseidon driving six winged horses He was so large as to touch the roof with his head and had a hundred water nymphs around him riding on dolphins The islanders had also baths and gardens and sea walls and they had twelve hundred ships and ten thousand chariots All this was in the royal city alone and the people were friendly and good and well affectioned towards all But as time went on they grew less so and they did not obey the laws so that they offended heaven In a single day and night the island disappeared and sank beneath the sea and this is why the sea in that region grew so impassable and impenetrable because there is a quantity of shallow mud in the way and this was caused by the sinking of a single vast island This is the tale said Solon which the old Egyptian priest told to me And Solon s tale was read by Socrates the boy as he lay in the grass and he told it to his friends after he grew up as is written in his dialogues recorded by his disciple Plato And though this great island of Atlantis has never been seen again yet a great many smaller islands have been found in the Atlantic Ocean and they have sometimes been lost to sight and found again There is also in this ocean a vast tract of floating seaweed called by sailors the Sargasso Sea covering a region as large as France and this has been thought by many to mark the place of a sunken island There are also many islands such as the Azores which have been supposed at different times to be fragments of Atlantis and besides all this the remains of the vanished island have been looked for in all parts of the world Some writers have thought it was in Sweden others in Spitzbergen others in Africa in Palestine in America Since the depth of the Atlantic has been more thoroughly sounded a few writers have maintained that the inequalities of its floor show some traces of the submerged Atlantis but the general opinion of men of science is quite the other way The visible Atlantic islands are all or almost all they say of volcanic origin and though there are ridges in the bottom of the ocean they do not connect the continents At any rate this was the original story of Atlantis and the legends which follow in these pages have doubtless all grown more or less out of this first tale which Socrates told II TALIESSIN OF THE RADIANT BROW In times past there were enchanted islands in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Wales and even now the fishermen sometimes think they see them On one of these there lived a man named Tegid Voel and his wife called Cardiwen They had a son the ugliest boy in the world and Cardiwen formed a plan to make him more attractive by teaching him all possible wisdom She was a great magician and resolved to boil a large caldron full of knowledge for her son so that he might know all things and be able to predict all that was to happen Then she thought people would value him in spite of his ugliness But she knew that the caldron must burn a year and a day without ceasing until three blessed drops of the water of knowledge were obtained from it and those three drops would give all the wisdom she wanted So she put a boy named Gwion to stir the caldron and a blind man named Morda to feed the fire and made them promise never to let it cease boiling for a year and a day She herself kept gathering magic herbs and putting them into it One day when the year was nearly over it chanced that three drops of the liquor flew out of the caldron and fell on the finger of Gwion They were fiery hot and he put his finger to his mouth and the instant he tasted them he knew that they were the enchanted drops for which so much trouble had been taken By their magic he at once foresaw all that was to come and especially that Cardiwen the enchantress would never forgive him Then Gwion fled The caldron burst in two and all the liquor flowed forth poisoning some horses which drank it These horses belonged to a king named Gwyddno Cardiwen came in and saw all the toil of the whole year lost Seizing a stick of wood she struck the blind man Morda fiercely on the head but he said I am innocent It was not I who did it True said Cardiwen it was the boy Gwion who robbed me and she rushed to pursue him He saw her and fled changing into a hare but she became a greyhound and followed him Running to the water he became a fish but she became another and chased him below the waves He turned himself into a bird when she became a hawk and gave him no rest in the sky Just as she swooped on him he espied a pile of winnowed wheat on the floor of a barn and dropping upon it he became one of the wheat grains Changing herself into a high crested black hen Cardiwen scratched him up and swallowed him when he changed at last into a boy again and was so beautiful that she could not kill him outright but wrapped him in a leathern bag and cast him into the sea committing him to the mercy of God This was on the twenty ninth of April Now Gwyddno had a weir for catching fish on the sea strand near his castle and every day in May he was wont to take a hundred pounds worth of fish He had a son named Elphin who was always poor and unsuccessful but that year the father had given the son leave to draw all the fish from the weir to see if good luck would ever befall him and give him something with which to begin the world When Elphin went next to draw the weir the man who had charge of it said in pity Thou art always unlucky there is nothing in the weir but a leathern bag which is caught on one of the poles How do we know said Elphin that it may not contain the value of a hundred pounds Taking up the bag and opening it the man saw the forehead of the boy and said to Elphin Behold what a radiant brow Taliessin Let him be called Taliessin said Elphin Then he lifted the boy and placed him sorrowfully behind him and made his horse amble gently that before had been trotting and carried him as softly as if he had been sitting in the easiest chair in the world and the boy of the radiant brow made a song to Elphin as they went along Never in Gwyddno s weir Was there such good luck as this night Fair Elphin dry thy cheeks Being too sad will not avail Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain Too much grief will bring thee no good Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty Although I am but little I am highly gifted From seas and from mountains And from the depths of rivers God brings wealth to the fortunate man Elphin of lively qualities Thy resolution is unmanly Thou must not be oversorrowful Better to trust in God than to forebode ill Weak and small as I am On the foaming beach of the ocean In the day of trouble I shall be Of more service to thee than three hundred salmon Elphin of notable qualities Be not displeased at thy misfortune Although reclined thus weak in my bag There lies a virtue in my tongue While I continue thy protector Thou hast not much to fear Then Elphin asked him Art thou man or spirit And in answer the boy sang to him this tale of his flight from the woman I have fled with vigor I have fled as a frog I have fled in the semblance of a crow scarcely finding rest I have fled vehemently I have fled as a chain of lightning I have fled as a roe into an entangled thicket I have fled as a wolf cub I have fled as a wolf in the wilderness I have fled as a fox used to many swift bounds and quirks I have fled as a martin which did not avail I have fled as a squirrel that vainly hides I have fled as a stag s antler of ruddy course I have fled as an iron in a glowing fire I have fled as a spear head of woe to such as have a wish for it I have fled as a fierce bull bitterly fighting I have fled as a bristly boar seen in a ravine I have fled as a white grain of pure wheat Into a dark leathern bag I was thrown And on a boundless sea I was sent adrift Which was to me an omen of being tenderly nursed And the Lord God then set me at liberty Then Elphin came with Taliessin to the house of his father and Gwyddno asked him if he had a good haul at the fish weir I have something better than fish What is that asked the father I have a bard said Elphin Alas what will he profit thee said Gwyddno to which Taliessin replied He will profit him more than the weir ever profited thee Said Gwyddno Art thou able to speak and thou so little Then Taliessin said I am better able to speak than thou to question me From this time Elphin always prospered and he and his wife cared for Taliessin tenderly and lovingly and the boy dwelt with him until he was thirteen years old when Elphin went to make a Christmas visit to his uncle Maelgwyn who was a great king and held open court There were four and twenty bards there and all proclaimed that no king had a wife so beautiful as the queen or a bard so wise as the twenty four who all agreed upon this decision Elphin said on the contrary that it was he himself who had the most beautiful wife and the wisest bard and for this he was thrown into prison Taliessin learning this set forth from home to visit the palace and free his adoptive father Elphin In those days it was the custom of kings to sit in the hall and dine in royal state with lords and bards about them who should keep proclaiming the greatness and glory of the king and his knights Taliessin placed himself in a quiet corner waiting for the four and twenty bards to pass and as each one passed by Taliessin made an ugly face and gave a sound with his finger on his lips thus Blerwm Blerwm Each bard went by and bowed himself before the king but instead of beginning to chant his praises could only play Blerwm Blerwm on the lips as the boy had done The king was amazed and thought they must be intoxicated so he sent one of his lords to them telling them to behave themselves and remember where they were Twice and thrice he told them but they could only repeat the same foolishness until at last the king ordered one of his squires to give a blow to the chief bard and the squire struck him a blow with a broom so that he fell back on his seat Then he arose and knelt before the king and said Oh honorable king be it known unto your grace that it is not from too much drinking that we are dumb but through the influence of a spirit which sits in the corner yonder in the form of a child Then the king bade a squire to bring Taliessin before him and he asked the boy who he was He answered Primary chief bard I am to Elphin And my original country is the region of the summer stars I am a wonder whose origin is not known I have been fostered in the land of the Deity I have been teacher to all intelligences I am able to instruct the whole universe I was originally little Gwion And at length I am Taliessin Then the king and his nobles wondered much for they had never heard the like from a boy so young The king then called his wisest bard to answer Taliessin but he could only play Blerwm on his lips as before and each of the king s four and twenty bards tried in the same way and could do nothing more Then the king bade Taliessin sing again and he began Discover thou what is The strong creature from before the flood Without flesh without bone Without vein without blood Without head without feet It will neither be older nor younger Than at the beginning Great God how the sea whitens When first it comes Great are its gusts When it comes from the south Great are its evaporations When it strikes on coasts It is in the field it is in the wood Without hand and without foot Without signs of old age It is also so wide As the surface of the earth And it was not born Nor was it seen It will cause consternation Wherever God willeth On sea and on land It neither sees nor is seen Its course is devious And will not come when desired On land and on sea It is indispensable It is without equal It is many sided It is not confined It is incomparable It comes from four quarters It is noxious it is beneficial It is yonder it is here It will decompose But it will not repair the injury It will not suffer for its doings Seeing it is blameless One Being has prepared it Out of all creatures By a tremendous blast To wreak vengeance On Maelgwyn Gwynedd And while he was thus singing his verse near the door there came suddenly a mighty storm of wind so that the king and all his nobles thought the castle would fall on their heads They saw that Taliessin had not merely been singing the song of the wind but seemed to have power to command it Then the king hastily ordered that Elphin should be brought from his dungeon and placed before Taliessin and the chains came loose from his feet and he was set free As they rode away from the court the king and his courtiers rode with them and Taliessin bade Elphin propose a race with the king s horses Four and twenty horses were chosen and Taliessin got four and twenty twigs of holly which he had burnt black and he ordered the youth who was to ride Elphin s horse to let all the others set off before him and bade him as he overtook each horse to strike him with a holly twig and throw it down Then he had him watch where his own horse should stumble and throw down his cap at the place The race being won Taliessin brought his master to the spot where the cap lay and put workmen to dig a hole there When they had dug deeply enough they found a caldron full of gold and Taliessin said Elphin this is my payment to thee for having taken me from the water and reared me until now And on this spot stands a pool of water until this day III THE SWAN CHILDREN OF LIR King Lir of Erin had four young children who were cared for tenderly at first by their stepmother the new queen but there came a time when she grew jealous of the love their father bore them and resolved that she would endure it no longer Sometimes there was murder in her heart but she could not bear the thought of that wickedness and she resolved at last to choose another way to rid herself of them One day she took them to drive in her chariot Finola who was eight years old with her three younger brothers Aodh Fiacre and little Conn still a baby They were beautiful children the legend says with skins white and soft as swans feathers and with large blue eyes and very sweet voices Reaching a lake she told them that they might bathe in the clear water but so soon as they were in it she struck them with a fairy wand for she was of the race of the Druids who had magical power and she turned them into four beautiful snow white swans But they still had human voices and Finola said to her This wicked deed of thine shall be punished for the doom that awaits thee will surely be worse than ours Then Finola asked How long shall we be in the shape of swans For three hundred years said the woman on smooth Lake Darvra then three hundred years on the sea of Moyle this being the sea between Ireland and Scotland and then three hundred years at Inis Glora in the Great Western Sea this was a rocky island in the Atlantic Until the Tailkenn saint Patrick shall come to Ireland and bring the Christian faith and until you hear the Christian bell you shall not be freed Neither your power nor mine can now bring you back to human shape but you shall keep your human reason and your Gaelic speech and you shall sing music so sweet that all who hear it shall gladly listen She left them and ere long their father King Lir came to the shore and heard their singing He asked how they came to have human voices We are thy four children said Finola changed into swans by our stepmother s jealousy Then come and live with me said her sorrowing father We are not permitted to leave the lake she said or live with our people any more But we are allowed to dwell together and to keep our reason and our speech and to sing sweet music to you Then they sang and the king and all his followers were at first amazed and then lulled to sleep Then King Lir returned and met the cruel stepmother at her father s palace When her father King Bove was told what she had done he was hot with anger This wicked deed he said shall bring severer punishment on thee than on the innocent children for their suffering shall end but thine never shall Then King Bove asked her what form of existence would be most terrible to her She replied That of a demon of the air Be it so said her father who had also Druidical power He struck her with his wand and she became a bat and flew away with a scream and the legend says She is still a demon of the air and shall be a demon of the air until the end of time After this the people of all the races that were in Erin used to come and encamp by the lake and listen to the swans The happy were made happier by the song and those who were in grief or illness or pain forgot their sorrows and were lulled to rest There was peace in all that region while war and tumult filled other lands Vast changes took place in three centuries towers and castles rose and fell villages were built and destroyed generations were born and died and still the swan children lived and sang until at the end of three hundred years they flew away as was decreed to the stormy sea of Moyle and from that time it was made a law that no one should kill a swan in Erin Beside the sea of Moyle they found no longer the peaceful and wooded shores they had known but only steep and rocky coasts and a wild wild sea There came a great storm one night and the swans knew that they could not keep together so they resolved that if separated they would meet at a rock called Carricknarone Finola reached there first and took her brothers under her wings all wet shivering and exhausted Many such nights followed and in one terrible winter storm when they nestled together on Carricknarone the water froze into solid ice around them and their feet and wings were so frozen to the rock that when they moved they left the skin of their feet the quills of their wings and the feathers of their breasts clinging there When the ice melted and they swam out into the sea their bodies smarted with pain until the feathers grew once more One day they saw a glittering troop of horsemen approaching along the shore and knew that they were their own kindred though from far generations back the Dedannen or Fairy Host They greeted each other with joy for the Fairy Host had been sent to seek for the swans and on returning to their chiefs they narrated what had passed and the chiefs said We cannot help them but we are glad they are living and we know that at last the enchantment will be broken and that they will be freed from their sorrows So passed their lives until Finola sang one day The Second Woe has passed the second period of three hundred years when they flew out on the broad ocean as was decreed and went to the island of Inis Glora There they spent the next three hundred years amid yet wilder storms and yet colder winds No more the peaceful shepherds and living neighbors were around them but often the sailor and fisherman in his little coracle saw the white gleam of their wings or heard the sweet notes of their song and knew that the children of Lir were near But the time came when the nine hundred years of banishment were ended and they might fly back to their father s old home Finnaha Flying for days above the sea they alighted at the palace once so well known but everything was changed by time even the walls of their father s palace were crumbled and rain washed So sad was the sight that they remained one day only and flew back to Inis Glora thinking that if they must be forever solitary they would live where they had lived last not where they had been reared One May morning as the children of Lir floated in the air around the island of Inis Glora they heard a faint bell sounding across the eastern sea The mist lifted and they saw afar off beyond the waves a vision of a stately white robed priest with attendants around him on the Irish shore They knew that it must be saint Patrick the Tailkenn or Tonsured One who was bringing as had been so long promised Christianity to Ireland Sailing through the air above the blue sea towards their native coast they heard the bell once more now near and distinct and they knew that all evil spirits were fleeing away and that their own hopes were to be fulfilled As they approached the land saint Patrick stretched his hand and said Children of Lir you may tread your native land again And the sweet swan sister Finola said If we tread our native land it can only be to die after our life of nine centuries Baptize us while we are yet living When they touched the shore the weight of all those centuries fell upon them they resumed their human bodies but they appeared old and pale and wrinkled Then saint Patrick baptized them and they died but even as he did so a change swiftly came over them and they lay side by side once more children in their white night clothes as when their father Lir long centuries ago had kissed them at evening and seen their blue eyes close in sleep and had touched with gentle hand their white foreheads and their golden hair Their time of sorrow was ended and their last swan song was sung but the cruel stepmother seems yet to survive in her bat like shape and a single glance at her weird and malicious little face will lead us to doubt whether she has yet fully atoned for her sin IV USHEEN IN THE ISLAND OF YOUTH The old Celtic hero and poet Usheen or Oisin whose supposed songs are known in English as those of Ossian lived to a great old age surviving all others of the race of the Feni to which he belonged and he was asked in his last years what had given him such length of life This is the tale he told After the fatal battle of Gavra in which most of the Feni were killed Usheen and his father the king and some of the survivors of the battle were hunting the deer with their dogs when they met a maiden riding on a slender white horse with hoofs of gold and with a golden crescent between his ears The maiden s hair was of the color of citron and was gathered in a silver band and she was clad in a white garment embroidered with strange devices She asked them why they rode slowly and seemed sad and not like other hunters and they replied that it was because of the death of their friends and the ruin of their race When they asked her in turn whence she came and why and whether she was married she replied that she had never had a lover or a husband but that she had crossed the sea for the love of the great hero and bard Usheen whom she had never seen Then Usheen was overcome with love for her but she said that to wed her he must follow her across the sea to the Island of Perpetual Youth There he would have a hundred horses and a hundred sheep and a hundred silken robes a hundred swords a hundred bows and a hundred youths to follow him while she would have a hundred maidens to wait on her But how he asked was he to reach this island He was to mount her horse and ride behind her So he did this and the slender white horse not feeling his weight dashed across the waves of the ocean which did not yield beneath his tread They galloped across the very sea and the maiden whose name was Niam sang to him as they rode and this so enchantingly that he scarcely knew whether hours passed or days Sometimes deer ran by them over the water followed by red eared hounds in full chase sometimes a maiden holding up an apple of gold sometimes a beautiful youth but they themselves rode on always westward At last they drew near an island which was not Niam said the island they were seeking but it was one where a beautiful princess was kept under a spell until some defender should slay a cruel giant who held her under enchantment until she should either wed him or furnish a defender The youth Usheen being an Irishman and not easily frightened naturally offered his services as defender and they waited three days and nights to carry on the conflict He had fought at home so the legend says with wild boars with foreign invaders and with enchanters but he never had quite so severe a contest as with this giant but after he had cut off his opponent s head and had been healed with precious balm by the beautiful princess he buried the giant s body in a deep grave and placed above it a great stone engraved in the Ogham alphabet in which all the letters are given in straight lines After this he and Niam again mounted the white steed and galloped away over the waves Niam was again singing when soft music began to be heard in the distance as if in the centre of the setting sun They drew nearer and nearer to a shore where the very trees trembled with the multitude of birds that sang upon them and when they reached the shore Niam gave one note of song and a band of youths and maidens came rushing towards them and embraced them with eagerness Then they too sang and as they did it one brought to Usheen a harp of silver and bade him sing of earthly joys He found himself chanting as he thought with peculiar spirit and melody but as he told them of human joys they kept still and began to weep till at last one of them seized the silver harp and flung it away into a pool of water saying It is the saddest harp in all the world Then he forgot all the human joys which seemed to those happy people only as sorrows compared with their own and he dwelt with them thenceforward in perpetual youth For a hundred years he chased the deer and went fishing in strangely carved boats and joined in the athletic sports of the young men for a hundred years the gentle Niam was his wife But one day when Usheen was by the beach there floated to his feet what seemed a wooden staff and he drew it from the waves It was the battered fragment of a warrior s lance The blood stains of war were still on it and as he looked at it he recalled the old days of the Feni the wars and tumult of his youth and how he had outlived his tribe and all had passed away Niam came softly to him and rested against his shoulder but it did not soothe his pain and he heard one of the young men watching him say to another The human sadness has come back into his eyes The people around stood watching him all sharing his sorrow and knowing that his time of happiness was over and that he would go back among men So indeed it was Niam and Usheen mounted the white steed again and galloped away over the sea but she had warned him when they mounted that he must never dismount for an instant for that if he once touched the earth she and the steed would vanish forever that his youth too would disappear and that he would be left alone on earth an old man whose whole generation had vanished They passed as before over the sea the same visions hovered around them youths and maidens and animals of the chase they passed by many islands and at last reached the shore of Erin again As they travelled over its plains and among its hills Oisin looked in vain for his old companions A little people had taken their place small men and women mounted on horses as small and these people gazed in wonder at the mighty Usheen We have heard they said of the hero Finn and the poets have written many tales of him and of his people the Feni We have read in old books that he had a son Usheen who went away with a fairy maiden but he was never seen again and there is no race of the Feni left Yet refusing to believe this and always looking round for the people whom he had known and loved of old he thought within himself that perhaps the Feni were not to be seen because they were hunting fierce wolves by night as they used to do in his boyhood and that they were therefore sleeping in the daytime but again an old man said to him The Feni are dead Then he remembered that it was a hundred years and that his very race had perished and he turned with contempt on the little men and their little horses Three hundred of them as he rode by were trying to lift a vast stone but they staggered under its weight and at last fell and lay beneath it then leaning from his saddle Usheen lifted the stone with one hand and flung it five yards But with the strain the saddle girth broke and Usheen came to the ground the white steed shook himself and neighed then galloped away bearing Niam with him and Usheen lay with all his strength gone from him a feeble old man The Island of Youth could only be known by those who dwelt always within it and those mortals who had once left it could dwell there no more V BRAN THE BLESSED The mighty king Bran a being of gigantic size sat one day on the cliffs of his island in the Atlantic Ocean near to Hades and the Gates of Night when he saw ships sailing towards him and sent men to ask what they were They were a fleet sent by Matholweh the king of Ireland who had sent to ask for Branwen Bran s sister as his wife Without moving from his rock Bran bid the monarch land and sent Branwen back with him as queen But there came a time when Branwen was ill treated at the palace they sent her into the kitchen and made her cook for the court and they caused the butcher to come every day after he had cut up the meat and give her a blow on the ear They also drew up all their boats on the shore for three years that she might not send for her brother But she reared a starling in the cover of the kneading trough taught it to speak and told it how to find her brother and then she wrote a letter describing her sorrows and bound it to the bird s wing and it flew to the island and alighted on Bran s shoulder ruffling its feathers says the Welsh legend so that the letter was seen and they knew that the bird had been reared in a domestic manner Then Bran resolved to cross the sea but he had to wade through the water as no ship had yet been built large enough to hold him and he carried all his musicians pipers on his shoulders As he approached the Irish shore men ran to the king saying that they had seen a forest on the sea where there never before had been a tree and that they had also seen a mountain which moved Then the king asked Branwen the queen what it could be She answered These are the men of the Island of the Mighty who have come hither to protect me What is the forest they asked The yards and masts of ships What mountain is that by the side of the ships It is Bran my brother coming to the shoal water and rising What is the lofty ridge with the lake on each side That is his nose she said and the two lakes are his fierce eyes Then the people were terrified there was yet a river for Bran to pass and they broke down the bridge which crossed it but Bran laid himself down and said Who will be a chief let him be a bridge Then his men laid hurdles on his back and the whole army crossed over and that saying of his became afterwards a proverb Then the Irish resolved in order to appease the mighty visitor to build him a house because he had never before had one that would hold him and they decided to make the house large enough to contain the two armies one on each side They accordingly built this house and there were a hundred pillars and the builders treacherously hung a leathern bag on each side of each pillar and put an armed man inside of each so that they could all rise by night and kill the sleepers But Bran s brother who was a suspicious man asked the builders what was in the first bag Meal good soul they answered and he putting his hand in felt a man s head and crushed it with his mighty fingers and so with the next and the next and with the whole two hundred After this it did not take long to bring on a quarrel between the two armies and they fought all day After this great fight between the men of Ireland and the men of the Isles of the Mighty there were but seven of these last who escaped besides their king Bran who was wounded in the foot with a poisoned dart Then he knew that he should soon die but he bade the seven men to cut off his head and told them that they must always carry it with them that it would never decay and would always be able to speak and be pleasant company for them A long time will you be on the road he said In Harlech you will feast seven years the birds of Rhiannon singing to you all the while And at the Island of Gwales you will dwell for fourscore years and you may remain there bearing the head with you uncorrupted until you open the door that looks towards the mainland and after you have once opened that door you can stay no longer but must set forth to London to bury the head leaving it there to look toward France So they went on to Harlech and there stopped to rest and sat down to eat and drink And there came three birds which began singing a certain song and all the songs they had ever heard were unpleasant compared with it and the songs seemed to them to be at a great distance from them over the sea yet the notes were heard as distinctly as if they were close by and it is said that at this repast they continued seven years At the close of this time they went forth to an island in the sea called Gwales There they found a fair and regal spot overlooking the ocean and a spacious hall built for them They went into it and found two of its doors open but the third door looking toward Cornwall was closed See yonder said their leader Manawydan that is the door we may not open And that night they regaled themselves and were joyful And of all they had seen of food laid before them and of all they had heard said they remembered nothing neither of that nor of any sorrow whatsoever There they remained fourscore years unconscious of having ever spent a time more joyous and mirthful And they were not more weary than when first they came neither did they any of them know the time they had been there It was not more irksome for them to have the head with them than if Bran the Blessed had been with them himself And because of these fourscore years it was called The Entertaining of the Noble Head One day said Heilwyn the son of Gwyn Evil betide me if I do not open the door to know if that is true which is said concerning it So he opened the door and looked towards Cornwall And when they had looked they were as conscious of all the evils they had ever sustained and of all the friends and companions they had ever lost and of all the misery that had befallen them as if all had happened in that very spot and especially of the fate of their lord And because of their perturbation they could not rest but journeyed forth with the head towards London And they buried the head in the White Mount The island called Gwales is supposed to be that now named Gresholm eight or ten miles off the coast of Pembrokeshire and to this day the Welsh sailors on that coast talk of the Green Meadows of Enchantment lying out at sea west of them and of men who had either landed on them or seen them suddenly vanishing Some of the people of Milford used to declare that they could sometimes see the Green Islands of the fairies quite distinctly and they believed that the fairies went to and fro between their islands and the shore through a subterranean gallery under the sea They used indeed to make purchases in the markets of Milford or Langhorne and this they did sometimes without being seen and always without speaking for they seemed to know the prices of the things they wished to buy and always laid down the exact sum of money needed And indeed how could the seven companions of the Enchanted Head have spent eighty years of incessant feasting on an island of the sea without sometimes purchasing supplies from the mainland VI THE CASTLE OF THE ACTIVE DOOR Perfect is my chair in Caer Sidi Plague and age hurt not who s in it They know Manawydan and Pryderi Three organs round a fire sing before it And about its points are ocean s streams And the abundant well above it Sweeter than white wine the drink in it Peredur the knight rode through the wild woods of the Enchanted Island until he arrived on clear ground outside the forest Then he beheld a castle on level ground in the middle of a meadow and round the castle flowed a stream and inside the castle there were large and spacious halls with great windows Drawing nearer the castle he saw it to be turning more rapidly than any wind blows On the ramparts he saw archers shooting so vigorously that no armor would protect against them there were also men blowing horns so loud that the earth appeared to tremble and at the gates were lions in iron chains roaring so violently that one might fancy that the castle and the woods were ready to be uprooted Neither the lions nor the warriors resisted Peredur but he found a woman sitting by the gate who offered to carry him on her back to the hall This was the queen Rhiannon who having been accused of having caused the death of her child was sentenced to remain seven years sitting by the gate to tell her story to every one and to offer to carry all strangers on her back into the castle But so soon as Peredur had entered it the castle vanished away and he found himself standing on the bare ground The queen Rhiannon was left beside him and she remained on the island with her son Pryderi and his wife Queen Rhiannon married for her second husband a person named Manawydan One day they ascended a mound called Arberth which was well known for its wonders and as they sat there they heard a clap of thunder followed by mist so thick that they could not see one another When it grew light again they looked around them and found that all dwellings and animals had vanished there was no smoke or fire anywhere or work of human hands all their household had disappeared and there were left only Pryderi and Manawydan with their wives Wandering from place to place they found no human beings but they lived by hunting fishing and gathering wild honey After visiting foreign lands they returned to their island home One day when they were out hunting a wild boar of pure white color sprang from a bush and as they saw him they retreated and they saw also the Turning Castle The boar watching his opportunity sprang into it and the dogs followed and Pryderi said I will go into this castle and get tidings of the dogs Go not said Manawydan whoever has cast a spell over this land and deprived us of our dwelling has placed this castle here But Pryderi replied Of a truth I cannot give up my dogs So he watched for the opportunity and went in He saw neither boar nor dogs neither man nor beast but on the centre of the castle floor he saw a fountain with marble work around it and on the margin of the fountain a golden bowl upon a marble slab and in the air hung chains of which he could see no end He was much delighted with the beauty of the gold and the rich workmanship of the bowl and went up to lay hold of it The moment he touched it his fingers clung to the bowl and his feet to the slab and all his joyousness forsook him so that he could not utter a word And thus he stood Manawydan waited for him until evening but hearing nothing either of him or of the dogs he returned home When he entered Rhiannon who was his wife and who was also Pryderi s mother looked at him Where she said are Pryderi and the dogs This is what has happened to me he said and he told her An evil companion hast thou been she said and a good companion hast thou lost With these words she went out and proceeded towards the Castle of the Active Door Getting in she saw Pryderi taking hold of the bowl and she went towards him What dost thou here she said and she took hold of the bowl for herself and then her hands became fast to it and her feet to the slab and she could not speak a word Then came thunder and a fall of mist thereupon the Castle of the Active Door vanished and never was seen again Rhiannon and Pryderi also vanished When Kigva the wife of Pryderi saw this she sorrowed so that she cared not if she lived or died No one was left on the island but Manawydan and herself They wandered away to other lands and sought to earn their living then they came back to their island bringing with them one bag of wheat which they planted It throve and grew and when the time of harvest came it was most promising so that Manawydan resolved to reap it on the morrow At break of day he came back to begin but found nothing left but straw Every stalk had been cut close to the ground and carried away Going to another field he found it ripe but on coming in the morning he found but the straw Some one has contrived my ruin he said I will watch the third field to see what happens He who stole the first will come to steal this He remained through the evening to watch the grain and at midnight he heard loud thunder He looked and saw coming a host of mice such as no man could number each mouse took a stalk of the wheat and climbed it so that it bent to the ground then each mouse cut off the ear and ran away with it They all did this leaving the stalk bare and there was not a single straw for which there was not a mouse He struck among them but could no more fix his sight on any of them the legend says than on flies and birds in the air except one which seemed heavier than the rest and moved slowly This one he pursued and caught put it in his glove and tied it with a string Taking it home he showed it to Kigva and told her that he was going to hang the mouse next day She advised against it but he persisted and on the next morning took the animal to the top of the Mound of Arberth where he placed two wooden forks in the ground and set up a small gallows While doing this he saw a clerk coming to him in old threadbare clothes It was now seven years since he had seen a human being there except the friends he had lost and Kigva who survived them The clerk bade him good day and said he was going back to his country from England where he had been singing Then the clerk asked Manawydan what he was doing Hanging a thief said he and when the clerk saw that it was a mouse he offered a pound to release it but Manawydan refused Then a priest came riding up and offered him three pounds to release the mouse but this offer was declined Then he made a noose round the mouse s neck and while he did this a bishop s whole retinue came riding towards him The bishop seemed like everybody else to be very desirous of rescuing the mouse he offered first seven pounds and then twenty four and then added all his horses and equipages but Manawydan still refused The bishop finally asked him to name any price he pleased The liberation of Rhiannon and Pryderi he said Thou shalt have it said the bishop And the removal of the enchantment said Manawydan That also said the bishop if you will only restore the mouse Why said the other Because said the bishop she is my wife Why did she come to me asked Manawydan To steal was the reply When it was known that you were inhabiting the island my household came to me begging me to transform them into mice The first and second nights they came alone but the third night my wife and the ladies of the court wished also to accompany them and I transformed them also and now you have promised to let her go Not so said the other except with a promise that there shall be no more such enchantment practised and no vengeance on Pryderi and Rhiannon or on me This being promised the bishop said Now wilt thou release my wife No by my faith said Manawydan not till I see Pryderi and Rhiannon free before my eyes Here they are coming said the bishop and when they had been embraced by Manawydan he let go the mouse the bishop touched it with a wand and it became the most beautiful young woman that ever was seen Now look round upon the country said the bishop and see the dwellings and the crops returned and the enchantment was removed The Land of Illusion and the Realm of Glamour is the name given by the old romancers to the south west part of Wales and to all the islands off the coast Indeed it was believed ever since the days of the Greek writer Plutarch that some peculiar magic belonged to these islands and every great storm that happened among them was supposed to be caused by the death of one of the wondrous enchanters who dwelt in that region When it was over the islanders said Some one of the mighty has passed away VII MERLIN THE ENCHANTER In one of the old books called Welsh Triads in which all things are classed by threes there is a description of three men called The Three Generous Heroes of the Isle of Britain One of these named Nud or Nodens and later called Merlin was first brought from the sea it is stated with a herd of cattle consisting of twenty one thousand milch cows which are supposed to mean those waves of the sea that the poets often describe as White Horses He grew up to be a king and warrior a magician and prophet and on the whole the most important figure in the Celtic traditions He came from the sea and at last returned to it but meanwhile he did great works on land one of which is said to have been the building of Stonehenge This is the way as the old legends tell in which the vast stones of Stonehenge came to be placed on Salisbury Plain It is a thing which has always been a puzzle to every one inasmuch as their size and weight are enormous and there is no stone of the same description to be found within hundreds of miles of Salisbury Plain where they now stand The legend is that Pendragon king of England was led to fight a great battle by seeing a dragon in the air The battle was won but Pendragon was killed and was buried on Salisbury Plain where the fight had taken place When his brother Uther took his place Merlin the enchanter advised him to paint a dragon on a flag and bear it always before him to bring good fortune and this he always did Then Merlin said to him Wilt thou do nothing more on the Plain of Salisbury to honor thy brother The King said What shall be done Then Merlin said I will cause a thing to be done that will endure to the world s end Then he bade Utherpendragon as he called the new king to send many ships and men to Ireland and he showed him stones such as seemed far too large and heavy to bring but he placed them by his magic art upon the boats and bore them to England and he devised means to transport them and to set them on end for they shall seem fairer so than if they were lying And there they are to this day This was the way in which Merlin would sometimes obtain the favor and admiration of young ladies There was a maiden of twelve named Nimiane or Vivian the daughter of King Dionas and Merlin changed himself into the appearance of a fair young squire that he might talk with her beside a fountain described in the legends as a well whereof the springs were fair and the water clear and the gravel so fair that it seemed of fine silver By degrees he made acquaintance with the child who told him who she was adding And what are you fair sweet friend Damsel said Merlin I am a travelling squire seeking for my master who has taught me wonderful things And what master is that she asked It is one he said who has taught me so much that I could here erect for you a castle and I could make many people outside to attack it and inside to defend it nay I could go upon this water and not wet my feet and I could make a river where water had never been These are strange feats said the maiden and I wish that I could thus disport myself I can do yet greater things said Merlin and no one can devise anything which I cannot do and I can also make it to endure forever Indeed said the girl I would always love you if you could show me some such wonders For your love he answered I will show you some of these wondrous plays and I will ask no more of you Then Merlin turned and described a circle with a wand and then came and sat by her again at the fountain At noon she saw coming out of the forest many ladies and knights and squires holding each other by the hand and singing in the greatest joy then came men with timbrels and tabours and dancing so that one could not tell one fourth part of the sports that went on Then Merlin caused an orchard to grow with all manner of fruit and flowers and the maiden cared for nothing but to listen to their singing Truly love begins in joy but ends in grief The festival continued from mid day to even song and King Dionas and his courtiers came out to see it and marvelled whence these strange people came Then when the carols were ended the ladies and maidens sat down on the green grass and fresh flowers and the squires set up a game of tilting called quintain upon the meadows and played till even song and then Merlin came to the damsel and asked if he had done what he promised for her Fair sweet friend said she you have done so much that I am all yours Let me teach you he answered and I will show you many wonders that no woman ever learned so many Merlin and this young damsel always remained friends and he taught her many wonderful arts one of which was this we must regret a spell by which she might put her parents to sleep whenever he visited her while another lesson was this being more unexceptionable in the use of three words by saying which she might at any time keep at a distance any men who tried to molest her He stayed eight days near her and in those days taught her many of the most wonderful things that any mortal heart could think of things past and things that were done and said and a part of what was to come and she put them in writing and then Merlin departed from her and came to Benoyk where the king Arthur rested so that glad were they when they saw Merlin The relations between Merlin and Arthur are unlike those ever held towards a king even by an enchanter in any legend Even in Homer there is no one described except the gods as having such authority over a ruler Merlin came and went as he pleased and under any form he might please He foretold the result of a battle ordered up troops brought aid from a distance He rebuked the bravest knights for cowardice as when Ban Bors and Gawain had concealed themselves behind some bushes during a fight Is this he said to King Arthur and Sir Bors the war and the help that you do to your friends who have put themselves in adventure of death in many a need and ye come hither to hide for cowardice Then the legend says When the king understood the words of Merlin he bowed his head for shame and the other knights acknowledged their fault Then Merlin took the dragon banner which he had given them and said that he would bear it himself for the banner of a king he said should not be hid in battle but borne in the foremost front Then Merlin rode forth and cried with a loud voice Now shall be shown who is a knight And the knights seeing Merlin exclaimed that he was a full noble man and without fail says the legend he was full of marvellous powers and strength of body and great and long stature but brown he was and lean and rough of hair Then he rode in among the enemy on a great black horse and the golden dragon which he had made and had attached to the banner gave out from its throat such a flaming fire that the air was black with its smoke and all King Arthur s men began to fight again more stoutly and Arthur himself held the bridle reins in his left hand and so wielded his sword with his right as to slay two hundred men There was no end to Merlin s disguises sometimes as an old man sometimes as a boy or a dwarf then as a woman then as an ignorant clown but the legends always give him some object to accomplish some work to do and there was always a certain dignity about him even when helping King Arthur as he sometimes did to do wrong things His fame extended over all Britain and also through Brittany now a part of France where the same poetic legends extended This for instance is a very old Breton song about him MERLIN THE DIVINER Merlin Merlin where art thou going So early in the day with thy black dog Oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi oi Oi oi oi oi oi I have come here to search the way To find the red egg The red egg of the marine serpent By the seaside in the hollow of the stone I am going to seek in the valley The green water cress and the golden grass And the top branch of the oak In the wood by the side of the fountain Merlin Merlin retrace your steps Leave the branch on the oak And the green water cress in the valley As well as the golden grass And leave the red egg of the marine serpent In the foam by the hollow of the stone Merlin Merlin retrace thy steps There is no diviner but God Merlin was supposed to know the past the present and the future and to be able to assume the form of any animal and even that of a menhir or huge standing stone Before history began he ruled in Britain then a delightful island of flowery meadows His subjects were small people fairies and their lives were a continued festival of singing playing and enjoyment The sage ruled them as a father his familiar servant being a tame wolf He also possessed a kingdom beneath the waves where everything was beautiful the inhabitants being charming little beings with waves of long fair hair falling on their shoulders in curls Fruits and milk composed the food of all meat and fish being held in abhorrence The only want felt was of the full light of the sun which coming to them through the water was but faint and cast no shadow Here was the famous workshop where Merlin forged the enchanted sword so celebrated by the bards and where the stones were found by which alone the sword could be sharpened Three British heroes were fated to wield this blade in turn viz Lemenisk the leaper Leim meaning leap Utherpendragon and his son King Arthur By orders of this last hero when mortally wounded it was flung into the sea where it will remain till he returns to restore the rule of his country to the faithful British race The bard once amused and puzzled the court by entering the hall as a blind boy led by a greyhound playing on his harp and demanding as recompense to be allowed to carry the king s banner in an approaching battle Being refused on account of his blindness he vanished and the king of Brittany mentioned his suspicions that this was one of Merlin s elfin tricks Arthur was disturbed for he had promised to give the child anything except his honor his kingdom his wife and his sword However while he continued to fret there entered the hall a poor child about eight years old with shaved head features of livid tint eyes of light gray barefooted barelegged and a whip knotted over his shoulders in the manner affected by horseboys Speaking and looking like an idiot he asked the king s permission to bear the royal ensign in the approaching battle with the giant Rion The courtiers laughed but Arthur suspecting a new joke on Merlin s part granted the demand and then Merlin stood in his own proper person before the company He also seems to have taught people many things in real science especially the women who were in those days more studious than the men or at least had less leisure For instance the legend says of Morgan le fay or la fee King Arthur s sister she was a noble clergesse meaning that she could read and write like the clergy and of astronomy could she enough for Merlin had her taught and she learned much of egromancy magic or necromancy and the best work woman she was with her hands that any man knew in any land and she had the fairest head and the fairest hands under heaven and shoulders well shapen and she had fair eloquence and full debonair she was as long as she was in her right wit and when she was wroth with any man she was evil to meet This lady was one of Merlin s pupils but the one whom he loved most and instructed the most was Nimiane or Vivian already mentioned who seems to have been to him rather a beloved younger sister than anything else and he taught her so much that at last he might hold himself a fool the legend says and ever she inquired of his cunning and his mysteries each thing by itself and he let her know all and she wrote all that he said as she was well learned in clergie reading and writing and learned lightly all that Merlin taught her and when they parted each of them commended the other to God full tenderly The form of the enchanter Merlin disappeared from view at last for the legends do not admit that his life ever ended across the sea whence he came The poet Tennyson to be sure describes Nimiane or Vivian the Lady of the Lake as a wicked enchantress who persuaded Merlin to betray his secrets to her and then shut him up in an oak tree forever But other legends seem to show that Tennyson does great injustice to the Lady of the Lake that she really loved Merlin even in his age and therefore persuaded him to show her how to make a tower without walls that they might dwell there together in peace and address each other only as Brother and Sister When he had told her he fell asleep with his head in her lap and she wove a spell nine times around his head and the tower became the strongest in the world Some of the many legends place this tower in the forest of Broceliande while others transport it afar to a magic island where Merlin dwells with his nine bards and where Vivian alone can come or go through the magic walls Some legends describe it as an enclosure neither of iron nor steel nor timber nor of stone but of the air without any other thing but enchantment so strong that it may never be undone while the world endureth Here dwells Merlin it is said with nine favorite bards who took with them the thirteen treasures of England These treasures are said to have been one A sword if any man drew it except the owner it burst into a flame from the cross to the point All who asked it received it but because of this peculiarity all shunned it two A basket if food for one man were put into it when opened it would be found to contain food for one hundred three A horn what liquor soever was desired was found therein four A chariot whoever sat in it would be immediately wheresoever he wished five A halter which was in a staple below the feet of a bed and whatever horse one wished for in it he would find it there six A knife which would serve four and twenty men at meat all at once seven A caldron if meat were put into it to boil for a coward it would never be boiled but if meat were put in it for a brave man it would be boiled forthwith eight A whetstone if the sword of a brave man were sharpened thereon and any one were wounded therewith he would be sure to die but if it were that of a coward that was sharpened on it he would be none the worse nine A garment if a man of gentle birth put it on it suited him well but if a churl it would not fit him ten eleven A pan and a platter whatever food was required was found therein twelve A chessboard when the men were placed upon it they would play of themselves The chessboard was of gold and the men of silver thirteen The mantle of Arthur whosoever was beneath it could see everything while no one could see him It is towards this tower some legends say that Merlin was last seen by some Irish monks sailing away westward with a maiden in a boat of crystal beneath a sunset sky VIII SIR LANCELOT OF THE LAKE Sir Lancelot the famous knight was the son of a king and queen against whom their subjects rebelled the king was killed the queen taken captive when a fairy rose in a cloud of mist and carried away the infant Lancelot from where he had been left beneath a tree The queen after weeping on the body of her husband looked round and saw a lady standing by the water side holding the queen s child in her arms Fair sweet friend said the queen give me back my child The fairy made no reply but dived into the water and the queen was taken to an abbey where she was known as the Queen of Great Griefs The Lady of the Lake took the child to her own home which was an island in the middle of the sea and surrounded by impassable walls From this the lady had her name of Dame du Lac or the Lady of the Lake or Sea and her foster son was called Lancelot du Lac while the realm was called Meidelant or the Land of Maidens Lancelot dwelt thenceforward in the castle on the island When he was eight years old he received a tutor who was to instruct him in all knightly knowledge he learned to use bow and spear and to ride on horseback and some cousins of his were also brought thither by the Lady of the Lake to be his comrades When he was eighteen he wished to go to King Arthur s court that he might be a knight On the eve of saint John as King Arthur returned from the chase and by the high road approached Camelot he met a fair company In the van went two youths leading two white mules one freighted with a silken pavilion the other with robes proper for a newly made knight the mules bore two chests holding the hauberk and the iron boots Next came two squires clad in white robes and mounted on white horses carrying a silver shield and a shining helmet after these two others with a sword in a white sheath and a white charger Behind followed squires and servants in white coats three damsels dressed in white the two sons of King Bors and last of all the fairy with the youth she loved Her robe was of white samite lined with ermine her white palfrey had a silver bit while her breastplate stirrups and saddle were of ivory carved with figures of ladies and knights and her white housings trailed on the ground When she perceived the king she responded to his salutation and said after she had lowered her wimple and displayed her face Sir may God bless the best of kings I come to implore a boon which it shall cost you nothing to grant Damsel even it should cost me dear you should not be refused what is it you would have me do Sir dub this varlet a knight and array him in the arms he bringeth whenever he desireth Your mercy damsel to bring me such a youth Assuredly I will dub him whenever he will but it shameth me to abandon my custom for tis my wont to furnish with garments and arms such as come thither to receive chivalry The lady replied that she desired the youth to carry the arms she had intended him to wear and if she were refused she would address herself elsewhere Sir Ewain said that so fair a youth ought not to be denied and the king yielded to her entreaty She returned thanks and bade the varlet retain the mules and the charger with the two squires and after that she prepared to return as she had come in spite of the urgency of the king who had begged her to remain in his court At least he cried tell us by what name are you known Sir she answered I am called the Lady of the Lake For a long way Lancelot escorted the fairy who said to him as she took leave King s son you are derived from lineage the most noble on earth see to it that your worth be as great as your beauty To morrow you will ask the king to bestow on you knighthood when you are armed you will not tarry in his house a single night Abide in one place no longer than you can help and refrain from declaring your name until others proclaim it Be prepared to accomplish every adventure and never let another man complete a task which you yourself have undertaken With that she gave him a ring that had the property of dissolving enchantment and commended him to God On the morrow Lancelot arrayed himself in his fairest robes and sued for knighthood as he had been commanded to do Sir Ewain attended him to court where they dismounted in front of the palace the king and queen advanced to meet them each took Sir Ewain by a hand and seated him on a couch while the varlet stood in their presence on the rushes that strewed the floor All gazed with pleasure and the queen prayed that God might make him noble for he possessed as much beauty as was possible for man to have After this he had many perilous adventures he fought with giants and lions he entered an enchanted castle and escaped he went to a well in the forest and striking three times on a cymbal with a hammer hung there for the purpose called forth a great giant whom he slew afterwards marrying his daughter Then he went to rescue the queen of the realm Gwenivere from captivity In order to reach the fortress where she was prisoner he had to ride in a cart with a dwarf to follow a wheel that rolled before him to show him the way or a ball that took the place of the wheel he had to walk on his hands and knees across a bridge made of a drawn sword he suffered greatly At last he rescued the queen and later than this he married Elaine the daughter of King Pelles and her father gave to them the castle of Blyaunt in the Joyous Island enclosed in iron and with a deep water all around it There Lancelot challenged all knights to come and contend with him and he jousted with more than five hundred overcoming them all yet killing none and at last he returned to Camelot the place of King Arthur s court One day he was called from the court to an abbey where three nuns brought to him a beautiful boy of fifteen asking that he might be made a knight This was Sir Lancelot s own son Galahad whom he had never seen and did not yet know That evening Sir Lancelot remained at the abbey with the boy that he might keep his vigil there and on the morrow s dawn he was made a knight Sir Lancelot put on one of his spurs and Bors Lancelot s cousin the other and then Sir Lancelot said to the boy Fair son attend me to the court of the king but the abbess said Sir not now but we will send him when it shall be time On Whitsunday at the time called underne which was nine in the morning King Arthur and his knights sat at the Round Table where on every seat there was written in letters of gold the name of a knight with here ought to sit he or he ought to sit here and thus went the inscriptions until they came to one seat or siege in French called the Siege Perilous where they found newly written letters of gold saying that this seat could not be occupied until four hundred and fifty years after the death of Christ and that was this very day Then there came news of a marvellous stone which had been seen above the water with a sword sticking in it bearing the letters Never shall man take me hence but only he by whose side I ought to hang and he shall be the best knight of the world Then two of the knights tried to draw the sword and failed to draw it and Sir Lancelot who was thought the best knight in all the world refused to attempt it Then they went back to their seats around the table Then when all the seats but the Siege Perilous were full the hall was suddenly darkened and an old man clad in white whom nobody knew came in with a young knight in red armor wearing an empty scabbard at his side who said Peace be with you fair knights The old man said I bring you here a young knight that is of kings lineage and the king said Sir ye are right heartily welcome Then the old man bade the young knight to remove his armor and he wore a red garment while the old man placed on his shoulders a mantle of fine ermine and said Sir follow after Then the old man led him to the Siege Perilous next to Sir Lancelot and lifted the cloth and read Here sits Sir Galahad and the youth sat down Upon this all the knights of the Round Table marvelled greatly at Sir Galahad that he dared to sit in that seat and he so tender of age Then King Arthur took him by the hand and led him down to the river to see the adventure of the stone Sir said the king to Sir Galahad here is a great marvel where right good knights have tried and failed Sir said Sir Galahad that is no marvel for the adventure was not theirs but mine I have brought no sword with me for here by my side hangs the scabbard and he laid his hand on the sword and lightly drew it from the stone It was not until long after and when they both had had many adventures that Sir Lancelot discovered Galahad to be his son Sir Lancelot once came to the sea strand and found a ship without sails or oars and sailed away upon it Once when he touched at an island a young knight came on board to whom Lancelot said Sir you are welcome and when the young knight asked his name told him My name is Sir Lancelot du Lac Sir he said then you are welcome for you are my father Ah said Lancelot are you Sir Galahad Then the young knight kneeled down and asked his blessing and they embraced each other and there was great joy between them and they told each other all their deeds So dwelt Sir Lancelot and Sir Galahad together within that ship for half a year and often they arrived at islands far from men where there were but wild beasts and they found many adventures strange and perilous which they brought to an end When Sir Lancelot at last died his body was taken to Joyous Gard his home and there it lay in state in the choir with a hundred torches blazing above it and while it was there came his brother Sir Ector de Maris who had long been seeking Lancelot When he heard such noise and saw such lights in the choir he alighted and came in and Sir Bors went towards him and told him that his brother Lancelot was lying dead Then Sir Ector threw his shield and sword and helm from him and when he looked on Sir Lancelot s face he fell down in a swoon and when he rose he spoke thus Ah Sir Lancelot said he thou wert dead of all Christen knights And now I dare say that Sir Lancelot there thou liest thou wert never matched of none earthly knight s hands and thou wert the curtiest knight that ever beare shield and thou wert the truest friend to thy lover that ever bestrood horse and thou wert the truest lover of a sinful man that ever loved woman and thou wert the kindest man that ever strooke with sword and thou wert the goodliest person that ever came among presse of knights and thou wert the meekest man and the gentlest that ever eate in hall among ladies and thou wert the sternest knight to thy mortall foe that ever put speare in the rest IX THE HALF MAN King Arthur in his youth was fond of all manly exercises especially of wrestling an art in which he found few equals The old men who had been the champions of earlier days and who still sat in summer evenings watching the youths who tried their skill before them at last told him that he had no rival in Cornwall and that his only remaining competitor elsewhere was one who had tired out all others Where is he said Arthur He dwells an old man said on an island whither you will have to go and find him He is of all wrestlers the most formidable You will think him at first so insignificant as to be hardly worth a contest you will easily throw him at the first trial but after a while you will find him growing stronger he seeks out all your weak points as by magic he never gives up you may throw him again and again but he will conquer you at last His name his name said Arthur His name they answered is Hanner Dyn his home is everywhere but on his own island you will be likely to find him sooner or later Keep clear of him or he will get the best of you in the end and make you his slave as he makes slaves of others whom he has conquered Far and wide over the ocean the young Arthur sought he touched at island after island he saw many weak men who did not dare to wrestle with him and many strong ones whom he could always throw until at last when he was far out under the western sky he came one day to an island which he had never before seen and which seemed uninhabited Presently there came out from beneath an arbor of flowers a little miniature man graceful and quick moving as an elf Arthur eager in his quest said to him In what island dwells Hanner Dyn In this island was the answer Where is he said Arthur I am he said the laughing boy taking hold of his hand What did they mean by calling you a wrestler said Arthur Oh said the child coaxingly I am a wrestler Try me The king took him and tossed him in the air with his strong arms till the boy shouted with delight He then took Arthur by the hand and led him about the island showed him his house and where the gardens and fields were He showed him the rows of men toiling in the meadows or felling trees They all work for me he said carelessly The king thought he had never seen a more stalwart set of laborers Then the boy led him to the house asked him what his favorite fruits were or his favorite beverages and seemed to have all at hand He was an unaccountable little creature in size and years he seemed a child but in his activity and agility he seemed almost a man When the king told him so he smiled as winningly as ever and said That is what they call me Hanner Dyn The Half Man Laughing merrily he helped Arthur into his boat and bade him farewell urging him to come again The King sailed away looking back with something like affection on his winsome little playmate It was months before Arthur came that way again Again the merry child met him having grown a good deal since their earlier meeting How is my little wrestler said Arthur Try me said the boy and the king tossed him again in his arms finding the delicate limbs firmer and the slender body heavier than before though easily manageable The island was as green and more cultivated there were more men working in the fields and Arthur noticed that their look was not cheerful but rather as of those who had been discouraged and oppressed It was however a charming sail to the island and as it became more familiar the king often bade his steersman guide the pinnace that way He was often startled with the rapid growth and increased strength of the laughing boy Hanner Dyn while at other times he seemed much as before and appeared to have made but little progress The youth seemed never tired of wrestling he always begged the king for a trial of skill and the king rejoiced to see how readily the young wrestler caught at the tricks of the art so that the time had long passed when even Arthur s strength could toss him lightly in the air as at first Hanner Dyn was growing with incredible rapidity into a tall young fellow and instead of the weakness that often comes with rapid growth his muscles grew ever harder and harder Still merry and smiling he began to wrestle in earnest and one day in a moment of carelessness Arthur received a back fall perhaps on moist ground and measured his length Rising with a quick motion he laughed at the angry faces of his attendants and bade the boy farewell The men at work in the fields glanced up attracted by the sound of voices and he saw them exchange looks with one another Yet he felt his kingly dignity a little impaired and hastened ere long to revisit the island and teach the saucy boy another lesson Months had passed and the youth had expanded into a man of princely promise but with the same sunny look His shoulders were now broad his limbs of the firmest mould his eye clear keen penetrating Of all the wrestlers I have ever yet met said the king this younker promises to be the most formidable I can easily throw him now but what will he be a few years hence The youth greeted him joyously and they began their usual match The sullen serfs in the fields stopped to watch them and an aged Druid priest whom Arthur had brought with him to give the old man air and exercise in the boat opened his weak eyes and closed them again As they began to wrestle the king felt by the very grasp of the youth s arms by the firm set of his foot upon the turf that this was to be unlike any previous effort The wrestlers stood after the old Cornish fashion breast to breast each resting his chin on the other s shoulder They grasped each other round the body each setting his left hand above the other s right Each tried to force the other to touch the ground with both shoulders and one hip or with both hips and one shoulder or else to compel the other to relinquish his hold for an instant either of these successes giving the victory Often as Arthur had tried the art he never had been so matched before The competitors swayed this way and that writhed struggled half lost their footing and regained it yet neither yielded All the boatmen gathered breathlessly around King Arthur s men refusing to believe their eyes even when they knew their king was in danger A stranger group was that of the sullen farm laborers who left their ploughs and spades and congregating on a rising ground watched without any expression of sympathy the contest that was going on An old wrestler from Cornwall whom Arthur had brought with him was the judge and according to the habit of the time the contest was for the best two bouts in three By the utmost skill and strength Arthur compelled Hanner Dyn to lose his hold for one instant in the first trial and the King was pronounced the victor The second test was far more difficult the boy now grown to a man and seeming to grow older and stronger before their very eyes twice forced Arthur to the ground either with hip or shoulder but never with both while the crowd closed in breathlessly around and the half blind old Druid who had himself been a wrestler in his youth and who had been brought ashore to witness the contest called warningly aloud Save thyself O king At this Arthur roused his failing strength to one final effort and griping his rival round the waist with a mighty grasp raised him bodily from the ground and threw him backward till he fell flat like a log on both shoulders and both hips while Arthur himself fell fainting a moment later Nor did he recover until he found himself in the boat his head resting on the knees of the aged Druid who said to him Never again O king must you encounter the danger you have barely escaped Had you failed you would have become subject to your opponent whose strength has been maturing for years to overpower you Had you yielded you would although a king have become but as are those dark browed men who till his fields and do his bidding For know you not what the name Hanner Dyn means It means Habit and the force of habit at first weak then growing constantly stronger ends in conquering even kings X KING ARTHUR AT AVALON In the ruined castle at Winchester England built by William the Conqueror there is a hall called The Great Hall where Richard Coeur de Lion was received by his nobles when rescued from captivity where Henry III was born where all the Edwards held court where Henry VIII entertained the emperor Charles V where Queen Mary was married to Philip II where Parliament met for many years It is now a public hall for the county and at one end of it the visitor sees against the wall a vast wooden tablet on which the names of King Arthur s knights of the Round Table are inscribed in a circle No one knows its date or origin though it is known to be more than four hundred years old but there appear upon it the names most familiar to those who have read the legends of King Arthur whether in Tennyson s poems or elsewhere There are Lancelot and Bedivere Gawaine and Dagonet Modred and Gareth and the rest Many books have been written of their deeds but a time came when almost all those knights were to fall according to the legend in one great battle Modred the king s nephew had been left in charge of the kingdom during Arthur s absence and had betrayed him and tried to dethrone him meaning to crown himself king Many people joined with him saying that under Arthur they had had only war and fighting but under Modred they would have peace and bliss Yet nothing was farther from Modred s purpose than bliss or peace and it was agreed at last that a great battle should be fought for the kingdom On the night of Trinity Sunday King Arthur had a dream He thought he sat in a chair upon a scaffold and the chair was fastened to a wheel He was dressed in the richest cloth of gold that could be made but far beneath him he saw a pit full of black water in which were all manner of serpents and floating beasts Then the wheel began to turn and he went down down among the floating things and they wreathed themselves about him till he cried Help help Then his knights and squires and yeomen aroused him but he slumbered again not sleeping nor thoroughly waking Then he thought he saw his nephew Sir Gawaine with a number of fair ladies and when King Arthur saw him he said O fair nephew what are these ladies who come with you Sir said Sir Gawaine these are the ladies for whose protection I fought while I was a living man and God has given them grace that they should bring me thither to you to warn you of your death If you fight with Sir Modred to morrow you must be slain and most of your people on both sides So Sir Gawaine and all the ladies vanished and then the king called upon his knights and squires and yeomen and summoned his lords and bishops They agreed to propose to Sir Modred that they should have a month s delay and meanwhile agreed to meet him with fourteen persons on each side besides Arthur and Modred Each of these leaders warned his army when they met to watch the other and not to draw their swords until they saw a drawn sword on the other side In that case they were to come on fiercely So the small party of chosen men on each side met and drank wine together and agreed upon a month s delay before fighting but while this was going on an adder came out of a bush and stung a knight on the foot and he drew his sword to slay it and thought of nothing farther At the sight of that sword the two armies were in motion trumpets were blown instantly and the men of each army thought that the other army had begun the fray Alas this unhappy day cried King Arthur and as the old chronicle says nothing there was but rushing and riding fencing and striking and many a grim word was there spoken either to other and many a deadly stroke The following is the oldest account of the battle translated into quaint and literal English by Madden from the book called Layamon s Brut Innumerable folk it came toward the host riding and on foot as the rain down falleth Arthur marched to Cornwall with an immense army Modred heard that and advanced against him with innumerable folk there were many fated Upon the Tambre they came together the place hight Camelford evermore lasted the same word And at Camelford was assembled sixty thousand and more thousands thereto Modred was their chief Then thitherward gan ride Arthur the mighty with innumerable folk fated though it were Upon the Tambre they encountered together elevated their standards advanced together drew their long swords smote on the helms fire outsprang spears splintered shields gan shiver shafts brake in pieces There fought all together innumerable folk Tambre was in flood with blood to excess there might no man in the fight know any warrior nor who did worse nor who better so was the conflict mingled For each slew downright were he swain were he knight There was Modred slain and deprived of life day and all his knights slain in the fight There were slain all the brave Arthur s warriors high and low and all the Britons of Arthur s board and all his dependents of many kingdoms And Arthur wounded with broad slaughter spear fifteen dreadful wounds he had in the least one might thrust two gloves Then was there no more remained in the fight of two hundred thousand men that there lay hewed in pieces except Arthur the king alone and two of his knights Arthur was wounded wondrously much There came to him a lad who was of his kindred he was Cador s son the earl of Cornwall Constantine the lad hight he was dear to the king Arthur looked on him where he lay on the ground and said these words with sorrowful heart Constantine thou art welcome thou wert Cador s son I give thee here my kingdom and defend thou my Britons ever in thy life and maintain them all the laws that have stood in my days and all the good laws that in Uther s days stood And I will fare to Avalon to the fairest of all maidens to Argante the queen an elf most fair and she shall make my wounds all sound make me all whole with healing draughts And afterwards I will come to my kingdom and dwell with the Britons with mickle joy Even with the words there approached from the sea that was a short boat floating with the waves and two women therein wondrously formed and they took Arthur anon and bare him quickly and laid him softly down and forth they gan depart Then was it accomplished that Merlin whilom said that mickle care should be of Arthur s departure The Britons believe yet that he is alive and dwelleth in Avalon with the fairest of all elves and the Britons ever yet expect when Arthur shall return Was never the man born of any lady chosen that knoweth of the sooth to say more of Arthur But whilom was a sage hight Merlin he said with words his sayings were sooth that an Arthur should yet come to help the English Another traditional account which Tennyson has mainly followed in a poem is this The king bade Sir Bedivere take his good sword Excalibur and go with it to the water side and throw it into the water and return to tell what he saw Then Sir Bedivere took the sword and it was so richly and preciously adorned that he would not throw it and came back without it When the king asked what had happened Sir Bedivere said I saw nothing but waves and wind and when Arthur did not believe him and sent him again he made the same answer and then when sent a third time he threw the sword into the water as far as he could Then an arm and a hand rose above the water and caught it and shook and brandished it three times and vanished Then Sir Bedivere came back to the king he told what he had seen Alas said Arthur help me from hence for I fear I have tarried over long Then Sir Bedivere took King Arthur upon his back and went with him to the water s side And when they had reached there a barge with many fair ladies was lying there with many ladies in it and among them three queens and they all had black hoods and they wept and shrieked when they saw King Arthur Now put me in the barge said Arthur and the three queens received him with great tenderness and King Arthur laid his head in the lap of one and she said Ah dear brother why have ye tarried so long until your wound was cold And then they rowed away and King Arthur said to Sir Bedivere I will go unto the valley of Avalon to heal my grievous wound and if I never return pray for my soul He was rowed away by the weeping queens and one of them was Arthur s sister Morgan le Fay another was the queen of Northgalis and the third was the queen of Waste Lands and it was the belief for years in many parts of England that Arthur was not dead but would come again to reign in England when he had been nursed long enough by Morgan le Fay in the island of Avalon The tradition was that King Arthur lived upon this island in an enchanted castle which had the power of a magnet so that every one who came near it was drawn thither and could not get away Morgan le Fay was its ruler called more correctly Morgan la fee or the fairy and her name Morgan meant sea born By one tradition the queens who bore away Arthur were accompanied in the boat by the bard and enchanter Merlin who had long been the king s adviser and this is the description of the island said to have been given by Merlin to another bard Taliessin We came to that green and fertile island which each year is blessed with two autumns two springs two summers two gatherings of fruit the land where pearls are found where the flowers spring as you gather them that isle of orchards called the Isle of the Blessed No tillage there no coulter to tear the bosom of the earth Without labor it affords wheat and the grape There the lives extend beyond a century There nine sisters whose will is the only law rule over those who go from us to them The eldest excels in the art of healing and exceeds her sisters in beauty She is called Morgana and knows the virtues of all the herbs of the meadow She can change her form and soar in the air like a bird she can be where she pleases in a moment and in a moment descend on our coasts from the clouds Her sister Thiten is renowned for her skill on the harp With the prince we arrived and Morgana received us with fitting honour And in her own chamber she placed the king on a bed of gold and with delicate touch she uncovered the wound Long she considered it and at length said to him that she could heal it if he stayed long with her and willed her to attempt her cure Rejoiced at this news we intrusted the king to her care and soon after set sail Sir Thomas Malory who wrote the book called the Historie of King Arthur or more commonly the Morte d Arthur utters these high thoughts concerning the memory of the great king Oh yee mightie and pompeous lords shining in the glory transitory of this unstable life as in raigning over great realmes and mightie great countries fortified with strong castles and toures edified with many a rich citie yee also yee fierce and mightie knights so valiant in adventurous deeds of armes behold behold see how this mightie conquerour king Arthur whom in his humaine life all the world doubted see also the noble queene Guenever which sometime sat in her chaire adorned with gold pearles and precious stones now lye full low in obscure fosse or pit covered with clods of earth and clay behold also this mightie champion Sir Launcelot pearelesse of all knighthood see now how hee lyeth groveling upon the cold mould now being so feeble and faint that sometime was so terrible How and in what manner ought yee to bee so desirous of worldly honour so dangerous Therefore mee thinketh this present booke is right necessary often to be read for in it shall yee finde the most gracious knightly and vertuous war of the most noble knights of the world whereby they gat praysing continually Also mee seemeth by the oft reading thereof yee shall greatly desire to accustome your selfe in following of those gracious knightly deedes that is to say to dread God and to love righteousnesse faithfully and couragiously to serve your soveraigne prince and the more that God hath given you the triumphall honour the meeker yee ought to bee ever feareing the unstablenesse of this deceitfull world XI MAELDUIN S VOYAGE An Irish knight named Maelduin set forth early in the eighth century to seek round the seas for his father s murderers By the advice of a wizard he was to take with him seventeen companions neither less nor more but at the last moment his three foster brothers whom he had not included begged to go with him He refused and they cast themselves into the sea to swim after his vessel Maelduin had pity on them and took them in but his disregard of the wizard s advice brought punishment and it was only after long wanderings after visiting multitudes of unknown and often enchanted islands and after the death or loss of the three foster brothers that Maelduin was able to return to his native land One island which they visited was divided into four parts by four fences one of gold one of silver one of brass one of crystal In the first division there dwelt kings in the second queens in the third warriors and in the fourth maidens The voyagers landed in the maidens realm one of these came out in a boat and gave them food such that every one found in it the taste he liked best then followed an enchanted drink which made them sleep for three days and three nights When they awakened they were in their boat on the sea and nothing was to be seen either of island or maidens The next island had in it a fortress with a brazen door and a bridge of glass on which every one who ascended it slipped and fell A woman came from the fortress pail in hand drew water from the sea and returned not answering them when they spoke When they reached at last the brazen door and struck upon it it made a sweet and soothing sound and they went to sleep for three days and nights as before On the fourth day a maiden came who was most beautiful she wore garments of white silk a white mantle with a brooch of silver with studs of gold and a gold band round her hair She greeted each man by his name and said It is long that we have expected you She took them into the castle and gave them every kind of food they had ever desired Maelduin was filled with love for her and asked her for her love but she told him that love was sin and she had no knowledge of sin so she left him On the morrow they found their boat stranded on a crag while lady and fortress and island had all vanished Another island on which they landed was large and bare with another fortress and a palace There they met a lady who was kinder She wore an embroidered purple mantle gold embroidered gloves and ornamented sandals and was just riding up to the palace door Seventeen maidens waited there for her She offered to keep the strangers as guests and that each of them should have a wife she herself wedding Maelduin She was it seems the widow of the king of the island and these were her seventeen daughters She ruled the island and went every day to judge the people and direct their lives If the strangers would stay she said that they should never more know sorrow or hardships or old age she herself in spite of her large family being young and beautiful as ever They stayed three months and it seemed to all but Maelduin that the three months were three years When the queen was absent one day the men took the boat and compelled Maelduin to leave the island with them but the queen rode after them and flung a rope which Maelduin caught and which clung to his hand She drew them back to the shore this happened thrice and the men accused Maelduin of catching the rope on purpose he bade another man catch it and his companions cut off his hand and they escaped at last On one island the seafarers found three magic apples and each apple gave sufficient food for forty nights again on another island they found the same apples In another place still a great bird like a cloud arrived with a tree larger than an oak in its claws After a while two eagles came and cleaned the feathers of the larger bird They also stripped off the red berries from the tree and threw them into the ocean until its foam grew red The great bird then flew into the ocean and cleaned itself This happened daily for three days when the great bird flew away with stronger wings its youth being thus renewed They came to another island where many people stood by the shore talking and joking They were all looking at Maelduin and his comrades and kept gaping and laughing but would not exchange a word with them Then Maelduin sent one of his foster brothers on the island but he ranged himself with the others and did as they did Maelduin and his men rowed round and round the island and whenever they passed the point where this comrade was they addressed him but he never answered and only gaped and laughed They waited for him a long time and left him This island they found to be called The Island of Joy On another island they found sheep grazing of enormous size on another birds whose eggs when eaten caused feathers to sprout all over the bodies of those who eat them On another they found crimson flowers whose mere perfume sufficed for food and they encountered women whose only food was apples Through the window flew three birds a blue one with a crimson head a crimson one with a green head a green one with a golden head These sang heavenly music and were sent to accompany the wanderers on their departing the queen of the island gave them an emerald cup such that water poured into it became wine She asked if they knew how long they had been there and when they said a day she told them that it was a year during which they had had no food As they sailed away the birds sang to them until both birds and island disappeared in the mist They saw another island standing on a single pedestal as if on one foot projecting from the water Rowing round it to seek a way into it they found no passage but they saw in the base of the pedestal under water a closed door with a lock this being the only way in which the island could be entered Around another island there was a fiery rampart which constantly moved in a circle In the side of that rampart was an open door and as it came opposite them in its turning course they beheld through it the island and all therein and its occupants even human beings were many and beautiful wearing rich garments and feasting with gold vessels in their hands The voyagers lingered long to gaze upon this marvel On another island they found many human beings black in color and raiment and always bewailing Lots were cast and another of Maelduin s foster brothers was sent on shore He at once joined the weeping crowd and did as they did Two others were sent to bring him back and both shared his fate falling under some strange spell Then Maelduin sent four others and bade them look neither at the land nor at the sky to wrap their mouths and noses with their garments and not breathe the island air and not to take off their eyes from their comrades In this way the two who followed the foster brother on shore were rescued but he remained behind Of another island they could see nothing but a fort protected by a great white rampart on which nothing living was to be seen but a small cat leaping from one to another of four stone pillars They found brooches and ornaments of gold and silver they found white quilts and embroidered garments hanging up flitches of bacon were suspended a whole ox was roasting and vessels stood filled with intoxicating drinks Maelduin asked the cat if all this was for them but the cat merely looked at him and went on playing The seafarers dined and drank then went to sleep As they were about to depart Maelduin s third foster brother proposed to carry off a tempting necklace and in spite of his leader s warnings grasped it Instantly the cat leaped through him like a fiery arrow burned him so that he became ashes and went back to its pillar Thus all three of the foster brothers who had disregarded the wizard s warning and forced themselves upon the party were either killed or left behind upon the enchanted islands Around another island there was a demon horse race going on the riders were just riding in over the sea and then the race began the voyagers could only dimly perceive the forms of the horses but could hear the cries of their riders the strokes of the whips and the words of the spectators See the gray horse Watch the chestnut horse and the voyagers were so alarmed that they rowed away The next island was covered with trees laden with golden apples but these were being rapidly eaten by small scarlet animals which they found on coming nearer to be all made of fire and thus brightened in hue Then the animals vanished and Maelduin with his men landed and though the ground was still hot from the fiery creatures they brought away a boat load of the apples Another island was divided into two parts by a brass wall across the middle There were two flocks of sheep and those on one side of the wall were white while the others were black A large man was dividing and arranging the sheep and threw them easily over the wall When he threw a white sheep among the black ones it became black and when he threw a black sheep among the white ones it became white instantly The voyagers thought of landing but when Maelduin saw this he said Let us throw something on shore to see if it will change color If it does we will avoid the island So they took a black branch and threw it toward the white sheep When it fell it grew white and the same with a white branch on the black side It is lucky for us said Maelduin that we did not land on this island They came next to an island where there was but one man visible very aged and with long white hair Above him were trees covered with great numbers of birds The old man told them that he like them had come in a curragh or coracle and had placed many green sods beneath his feet to steady the boat Reaching this spot the green sods had joined together and formed an island which at first gave him hardly room to stand but every year one foot was added to its size and one tree grew up He had lived there for centuries and those birds were the souls of his children and descendants each of whom was sent there after death and they were all fed from heaven each day On the next island there was a great roaring as of bellows and a sound of smiths hammers as if striking all together on an anvil every sound seeming to come from the strokes of a dozen men Are they near asked one big voice Silence said another and they were evidently watching for the boat When it rowed away one of the smiths flung after them a vast mass of red hot iron which he had grasped with the tongs from the furnace It fell just short but made the whole sea to hiss and boil around them as they rowed away Another island had a wall of water round it and Maelduin and his men saw multitudes of people driving away herds of cattle and sheep and shouting There they are they have come again and a woman pelted them from below with great nuts which the crew gathered for eating Then as they rowed away they heard one man say Where are they now and another cried They are going away Still again they visited an island where a great stream of water shot up into the air and made an arch like a rainbow that spanned the land They walked below it without getting wet and hooked down from it many large salmon besides that many fell out above their heads so that they had more than they could carry away with them These are by no means all of the strange adventures of Maelduin and his men The last island to which they came was called Raven s Stream and there one of the men who had been very homesick leaped out upon shore As soon as he touched the land he became a heap of ashes as if his body had lain in the earth a thousand years This showed them for the first time during how vast a period they had been absent and what a space they must have traversed Instead of thirty enchanted islands they had visited thrice fifty many of them twice or thrice as large as Ireland whence the voyagers first came In the wonderful experiences of their long lives they had apparently lost sight of the search which they had undertaken for the murderers of Maelduin s father since of them we hear no more The island enchantment seems to have banished all other thoughts XII THE VOYAGE OF saint BRANDAN The young student Brandan was awakened in the morning by the crowing of the cock in the great Irish abbey where he dwelt he rose washed his face and hands and dressed himself then passed into the chapel where he prayed and sang until the dawn of the day With song comes courage was the motto of the abbey It was one of those institutions like great colonies church library farm workshop college all in one of which Ireland in the sixth century was full and which existed also elsewhere Their extent is best seen by the modern traveller in the remains of the vast buildings at Tintern in England scattered over a wide extent of country where you keep coming upon walls and fragments of buildings which once formed a part of a single great institution in which all the life of the community was organized as was the case in the Spanish missions of California At the abbey of Bangor in Wales for instance there were two thousand four hundred men all under the direction of a comparatively small body of monks who were trained to an amount of organizing skill like that now needed for a great railway system Some of these men were occupied in various mechanic arts some in mining but most of them in agriculture which they carried on with their own hands without the aid of animals and in total silence Having thus labored in the fields until noonday Brandan then returned that he might work in the library transcribing ancient manuscripts or illustrating books of prayer Having to observe silence he wrote the name of the book to give to the librarian and if it were a Christian work he stretched out his hand making motions with his fingers as if turning over the leaves but if it were by a pagan author the monk who asked for it was required to scratch his ear as a dog does to show his contempt because the regulations said an unbeliever might well be compared to that animal one Taking the book he copied it in the Scriptorium or library or took it to his cell where he wrote all winter without a fire It is to such monks that we owe all our knowledge of the earliest history of England and Ireland though doubtless the hand that wrote the histories of Gildas and Bede grew as tired as that of Brandan or as that of the monk who wrote in the corner of a beautiful manuscript He who does not know how to write imagines it to be no labor but though only three fingers hold the pen the whole body grows weary In the same way Brandan may have learned music and have had an organ in his monastery or have had a school of art painting beautiful miniatures for the holy missals This was his early life in the convent Footnote one Adde ut aurem tangas digito sicut canis cum pede pruriens solet quia nec immerito infideles tali animati comparantur MARTENE De Antiq Monach ritibus p two hundred eighty nine qu by Montalembert Monks of the West tr VI one hundred ninety Once a day they were called to food this consisting for them of bread and vegetables with no seasoning but salt although better fare was furnished for the sick and the aged for travellers and the poor These last numbered at Easter time some three or four hundred who constantly came and went and upon whom the monks and young disciples waited After the meal the monks spent three hours in the chapel on their knees still silent then they confessed in turn to the abbot and then sought their hard earned rest They held all things in common no one even received a gift for himself War never reached them it was the rarest thing for an armed party to molest their composure their domains were regarded as a haven for the stormy world Because there were so many such places in Ireland it was known as The Isle of Saints Brandan was sent after a time to other abbeys where he could pursue especial studies for they had six branches of learning grammar rhetoric dialectics geometry astronomy and music Thus he passed three years and was then advised to go to an especial teacher in the mountains who had particular modes of teaching certain branches But this priest he was an Italian was suffering from poverty and could receive his guest but for a few weeks One day as Brandan sat studying he saw the legend says a white mouse come from a crack in the wall a visitor which climbed upon his table and left there a grain of wheat Then the mouse paused looked at the student then ran about the table went away and reappeared with another grain and another up to five Brandan who had at the very instant learned his lesson rose from his seat followed the mouse and looking through a hole in the wall saw a great pile of wheat stored in a concealed apartment On his showing this to the head of the convent it was pronounced a miracle the food was distributed to the poor and the people blessed his charity while the Lord blessed his studies In the course of years Brandan became himself the head of one of the great abbeys that of Clonfert of the order of saint Benedict where he had under him nearly three thousand monks In this abbey having one day given hospitality to a monk named Berinthus who had just returned from an ocean voyage Brandan learned from him the existence far off in the ocean of an island called The Delicious Isle to which a priest named Mernoc had retired with many companions of his order Berinthus found Mernoc and the other monks living apart from one another for purposes of prayer but when they came together Mernoc said they were like bees from different beehives They met for their food and for church their food included only apples nuts and various herbs One day Mernoc said to Berinthus I will conduct you to the Promised Isle of the Saints So they went on board a little ship and sailed westward through a thick fog until a great light shone and they found themselves near an island which was large and fruitful and bore many apples There were no herbs without blossoms he said nor trees without fruits and there were precious stones and the island was traversed by a great river Then they met a man of shining aspect who told them that they had without knowing it passed a year already in the island that they had needed neither food nor sleep Then they returned to the Delicious Island and every one knew where they had been by the perfume of their garments This was the story of Berinthus and from this time forward nothing could keep Brandan from the purpose of beholding for himself these blessed islands Before carrying out his plans however he went about the year five hundred sixty to visit an abbot named Enda who lived at Arran then called Isle of the Saints a priest who was supposed to know more than any one concerning the farther lands of the western sea He knew for instance of the enchanted island named Hy Brasail which could be seen from the coast of Ireland only once in seven years and which the priests had vainly tried to disenchant Some islands it was believed had been already disenchanted by throwing on them a few sparks of lighted turf but as Hy Brasail was too far for this there were repeated efforts to disenchant it by shooting fiery arrows towards it though this had not yet been successful Then Enda could tell of wonderful ways to cross the sea without a boat how his sister Fanchea had done it by spreading her own cloak upon the waves and how she and three other nuns were borne upon it She found however that one hem of the cloak sank below the water because one of her companions had brought with her against orders a brazen vessel from the convent but on her throwing it away the sinking hem rose to the level of the rest and bore them safely saint Enda himself had first crossed to Arran on a large stone which he had ordered his followers to place on the water and which floated before the wind and he told of another priest who had walked on the sea as on a meadow and plucked flowers as he went Hearing such tales how could saint Brandan fear to enter on his voyage He caused a boat to be built of a fashion which one may still see in Welsh and Irish rivers and known as a curragh or coracle made of an osier frame covered with tanned and oiled skins He took with him seventeen priests among whom was saint Malo then a mere boy but afterwards celebrated They sailed to the southwest and after being forty days at sea they reached a rocky island furrowed with streams where they received the kindest hospitality and took in fresh provisions They sailed again the next day and found themselves entangled in contrary currents and perplexing winds so that they were long in reaching another island green and fertile watered by rivers which were full of fish and covered with vast herds of sheep as large as heifers Here they renewed their stock of provisions and chose a spotless lamb with which to celebrate Easter Sunday on another island which they saw at a short distance This island was wholly bare without sandy shores or wooded slopes and they all landed upon it to cook their lamb but when they had arranged their cooking apparatus and when their fire began to blaze the island seemed to move beneath their feet and they ran in terror to their boat from which Brandan had not yet landed Their supposed island was a whale and they rowed hastily away from it toward the island they had left while the whale glided away still showing at a distance of two miles the fire blazing on his back The next island they visited was wooded and fertile where they found a multitude of birds which chanted with them the praises of the Lord so that they called this the Paradise of Birds This was the description given of this island by an old writer named Wynkyn de Worde in The Golden Legend Soon after as God would they saw a fair island full of flowers herbs and trees whereof they thanked God of his good grace and anon they went on land and when they had gone long in this they found a full fayre well and thereby stood a fair tree full of boughs and on every bough sat a fayre bird and they sat so thick on the tree that uneath scarcely any leaf of the tree might be seen The number of them was so great and they sang so merrilie that it was an heavenlie noise to hear Whereupon saint Brandan kneeled down on his knees and wept for joy and made his praise devoutlie to our Lord God to know what these birds meant And then anon one of the birds flew from the tree to saint Brandan and he with the flickering of his wings made a full merrie noise like a fiddle that him seemed he never heard so joyful a melodie And then saint Brandan commanded the foule to tell him the cause why they sat so thick on the tree and sang so merrilie And then the foule said some time we were angels in heaven but when our master Lucifer fell down into hell for his high pride and we fell with him for our offences some higher and some lower after the quality of the trespasse And because our trespasse is so little therefore our Lord hath sent us here out of all paine in full great joy and mirthe after his pleasing here to serve him on this tree in the best manner we can The Sundaie is a daie of rest from all worldly occupation and therefore that day all we be made as white as any snow for to praise our Lorde in the best wise we may And then all the birds began to sing evensong so merrilie that it was an heavenlie noise to hear and after supper saint Brandan and his fellows went to bed and slept well And in the morn they arose by times and then those foules began mattyns prime and hours and all such service as Christian men used to sing and saint Brandan with his fellows abode there seven weeks until Trinity Sunday was passed Having then embarked they wandered for months on the ocean before reaching another island That on which they finally landed was inhabited by monks who had as their patrons saint Patrick and saint Ailbee and they spent Christmas there A year passed in these voyages and the tradition is that for six other years they made just the same circuit always spending Holy Week at the island where they found the sheep alighting for Easter on the back of the same patient whale visiting the Isle of Birds at Pentecost and reaching the island of saint Patrick and saint Ailbee in time for Christmas But in the seventh year they met with wholly new perils They were attacked the legend says first by a whale then by a griffin and then by a race of cyclops or one eyed giants Then they came to an island where the whale which had attacked them was thrown on shore so that they could cut him to pieces then another island which had great fruits and was called The Island of the Strong Man and lastly one where the grapes filled the air with perfume After this they saw an island all cinders and flames where the cyclops had their forges and they sailed away in the light of an immense fire The next day they saw looking northward a great and high mountain sending out flames at the top Turning hastily from this dreadful sight they saw a little round island at the top of which a hermit dwelt who gave them his benediction Then they sailed southward once more and stopped at their usual places of resort for Holy Week Easter and Whitsuntide It was on this trip that they had so the legend says that strange interview with Judas Iscariot out of which Matthew Arnold has made a ballad Sailing in the wintry northern seas at Christmas time saint Brandan saw an iceberg floating by on which a human form rested motionless and when it moved at last he saw by its resemblance to the painted pictures he had seen that it must be Judas Iscariot who had died five centuries before Then as the boat floated near the iceberg Judas spoke and told him his tale After he had betrayed Jesus Christ after he had died and had been consigned to the flames of hell which were believed in very literally in those days an angel came to him on Christmas night and said that he might go thence and cool himself for an hour Why this mercy asked Judas Iscariot Then the angel said to him Remember the leper in Joppa and poor Judas recalled how once when the hot wind called the sirocco swept through the streets of Joppa and he saw a naked leper by the wayside sitting in agony from the heat and the drifting sand Judas had thrown his cloak over him for a shelter and received his thanks In reward for this the angel now told him he was to have once a year an hour s respite from his pain he was allowed in that hour to fling himself on an iceberg and cool his burning heat as he drifted through the northern seas Then saint Brandan bent his head in prayer and when he looked up the hour was passed and Judas had been hurried back into his torments It seems to have been only after seven years of this wandering that they at last penetrated within the obscure fogs which surrounded the Isle of the Saints and came upon a shore which lay all bathed in sunny light It was a vast island sprinkled with precious stones and covered with ripe fruits they traversed it for forty days without arriving at the end though they reached a great river which flowed through the midst of it from east to west There an angel appeared to them and told them that they could go no farther but could return to their own abode carrying from the island some of those fruits and precious stones which were reserved to be distributed among the saints when all the world should be brought to the true faith In order to hasten that time it appears that saint Malo the youngest of the sea faring monks had wished in his zeal to baptize some one and had therefore dug up a heathen giant who had been for some reason buried on the blessed isle Not only had he dug the giant s body up but saint Malo had brought him to life again sufficiently for the purpose of baptism and instruction in the true faith after which he gave him the name of Mildus and let him die once more and be reburied Then facing homeward and sailing beyond the fog they touched once more at The Island of Delights received the benediction of the abbot of the monastery and sailed for Ireland to tell their brethren of the wonders they had seen He used to tell them especially to his nurse Ita under whose care he had been placed until his fifth year His monastery at Clonfert grew as has been said to include three thousand monks and he spent his remaining years in peace and sanctity The supposed islands which he visited are still believed by many to have formed a part of the American continent and he is still thought by some Irish scholars to have been the first to discover this hemisphere nearly a thousand years before Columbus although this view has not yet made much impression on historians The Paradise of Birds in particular has been placed by these scholars in Mexico and an Irish poet has written a long poem describing the delights to be found there Oft in the sunny mornings have I seen Bright yellow birds of a rich lemon hue Meeting in crowds upon the branches green And sweetly singing all the morning through And others with their heads grayish and dark Pressing their cinnamon cheeks to the old trees And striking on the hard rough shrivelled bark Like conscience on a bosom ill at ease And diamond birds chirping their single notes Now mid the trumpet flower s deep blossoms seen Now floating brightly on with fiery throats Small winged emeralds of golden green And other larger birds with orange cheeks A many color painted chattering crowd Prattling forever with their curved beaks And through the silent woods screaming aloud XIII KIRWAN S SEARCH FOR HY BRASAIL The boy Kirwan lay on one of the steep cliffs of the Island of Innismane one of the islands of Arran 
8087-118726-0000	train-other-500	formerly called Isles of the Saints He was looking across the Atlantic for a glimpse of Hy Brasail
none	none	 This was what they called it it was a mysterious island which Kirwan s grandfather had seen or thought he had seen and Kirwan s father also indeed there was not one of the old people on the island who did not think he had seen it 
8087-118726-0001	train-other-500	and the older they were the oftener it had been seen by them and the larger it looked But Kirwan had never seen it and whenever he came to the top of the highest cliff
none	none	 where he often went bird nesting 
8087-118726-0002	train-other-500	he climbed the great mass of granite called The Gregory and peered out into the west especially at sunset in hopes that he would at least catch a glimpse some happy evening
8087-118726-0003	train-other-500	of the cliffs and meadows of Hy Brasail But as yet he had never
none	none	 espied them 
8087-118726-0004	train-other-500	All this was more than two hundred years ago He naturally went up to The Gregory at this hour because it was then that he met the other boys
none	none	 and caught puffins by being lowered over the cliff The agent of the island employed the boys 
8087-118726-0005	train-other-500	and paid them a sixpence for every dozen birds that he might sell the feathers The boys had a rope three hundred feet long which could reach the bottom of the cliff One of them tied this rope around his waist
8087-118726-0006	train-other-500	and then held it fast with both hands the rope being held above by four or five strong boys who lowered the cragman or clifter as he was called over the precipice
8087-118726-0007	train-other-500	Kirwan was thus lowered to the rocks near the sea where the puffins bred and loosening the rope he prepared to spend the night in catching them He had a pole with a snare on the end
none	none	 which he easily clapped on the heads of the heavy and stupid birds then tied each on a string as he caught it and so kept it to be hauled up in the morning He took in this way twenty or thirty score of the birds 
8087-118726-0008	train-other-500	besides quantities of their large eggs which were found in deep clefts in the rock and these he carried with him when his friends came in the morning to haul him up It was a good school of courage for sometimes boys missed their footing
8087-118726-0009	train-other-500	and were dashed to pieces At other times he fished in his father s boat or drove calves for sale on the mainland or cured salt after high tide in the caverns or collected kelp for the farmers
none	none	 But he was always looking forward to a time when he might get a glimpse of the island of Hy Brasail and make his way to it One day when all the fleet of fishing boats was out for the herring fishery and Kirwan among them the fog came in closer and closer and he was shut apart from all others His companion in the boat or dory mate as it would be called in New England had gone to cut bait on board another boat but Kirwan could manage the boat well enough alone 
8087-118726-0010	train-other-500	Long he toiled with his oars toward the west where he fancied the rest of the fleet to be and sometimes he spread his little sprit sail steering with an oar a thing which was
8087-118726-0011	train-other-500	in a heavy sea almost as hard as rowing At last the fog lifted and he found himself alone upon the ocean He had lost his bearings and could not tell the points of the compass Presently
8087-118726-0012	train-other-500	out of a heavy bank of fog which rose against the horizon he saw what seemed land It gave him new strength and he worked hard to reach it but it was long since he had eaten his head was dizzy
8087-118726-0013	train-other-500	and he lay down on the thwart of the boat rather heedless of what might come Growing weaker and weaker he did not clearly know what he was doing Suddenly he started up for a voice hailed him from above his head
8087-118726-0014	train-other-500	He saw above him the high stern of a small vessel and with the aid of a sailor he was helped on board He found himself on the deck of a sloop of about seventy tons John Nisbet master
8087-118726-0015	train-other-500	with a crew of seven men They had sailed from Killebegs County Donegal in Ireland for the coast of France laden with butter tallow and hides and were now returning from France
8087-118726-0016	train-other-500	with French wines and were befogged as Kirwan had been The boy was at once taken on board and rated as a seaman and the later adventures of the trip are here given as he reported them on his return
none	none	 with the ship some months later The mist continued thicker and thicker for a time and when it suddenly furled itself away they found themselves on an unknown coast with the wind driving them shoreward There were men on board who were familiar with the whole coast of Ireland and Scotland but they remembered nothing like this Finding less than three fathoms of water they came to anchor and sent four men ashore to find where they were 
8087-118726-0017	train-other-500	these being James Ross the carpenter and two sailors with the boy Kirwan They took swords and pistols Landing at the edge of a little wood they walked for a mile within a pleasant valley where cattle
none	none	 horses and sheep were feeding and then came in sight of a castle small but strong where they went to the door and knocked No one answered and they walked on up a green hill where there were multitudes of black rabbits 
8087-118726-0018	train-other-500	but when they had reached the top and looked around they could see no inhabitants nor any house on which they returned to the sloop and told their tale After this the whole ship s company went ashore except one left in charge
none	none	 and they wandered about for hours yet saw nothing more As night came on they made a fire at the base of a fallen oak near the shore and lay around it talking and smoking the lately discovered weed tobacco 
8087-118726-0019	train-other-500	when suddenly they heard loud noises from the direction of the castle and then all over the island which frightened them so that they went on board the sloop and stayed all night The next morning they saw a dignified elderly gentleman
8087-118726-0020	train-other-500	with ten unarmed followers coming down towards the shore Hailing the sloop the older gentleman speaking Gaelic asked who and whence they were and being told invited them ashore as his guests
8087-118726-0021	train-other-500	They went on shore well armed and he embraced them one by one telling them that they were the happiest sight that island had seen for hundreds of years that it was called Hy Brasail
none	none	 or O Brazile that his ancestors had been princes of it but For many years it had been taken possession of by enchanters who kept it almost always invisible so that no ship came there 
8087-118726-0022	train-other-500	and that for the same reason he and his friends were rendered unable to answer the sailors even when they knocked at the door and that the enchantment must remain until a fire was kindled on the island by good Christians
8087-118726-0023	train-other-500	This had been done the night before and the terrible noises which they had heard were from the powers of darkness which had now left the island forever And indeed when the sailors were led to the castle
8087-118726-0024	train-other-500	they saw that the chief tower had just been demolished by the powers of darkness as they retreated but there were sitting within the halls men and women of dignified appearance
8087-118726-0025	train-other-500	who thanked them for the good service they had done Then they were taken over the island which proved to be some sixty miles long and thirty wide abounding with horses cattle sheep deer rabbits and birds
none	none	 but without any swine it had also rich mines of silver and gold but few people although there were ruins of old towns and cities The sailors after being richly rewarded were sent on board their vessel and furnished with sailing directions to their port On reaching home they showed to the minister of their town the pieces of gold and silver that were given them at the island these being of an ancient stamp 
8087-118726-0026	train-other-500	somewhat rusty yet of pure gold and there was at once an eager desire on the part of certain of the townsmen to go with them Within a week an expedition was fitted out containing several godly ministers
8087-118726-0027	train-other-500	who wished to visit and discover the inhabitants of the island but through some mishap of the seas this expedition was never heard of again
none	none	 Partly for this reason and partly because none of Captain Nesbit s crew wished to return to the island there came to be in time a feeling of distrust about all this rediscovery of Hy Brasail or O Brazile 
8087-118726-0028	train-other-500	There were not wanting those who held that the ancient gold pieces might have been gained by piracy such as was beginning to be known upon the Spanish main and as for the boy Kirwan
8087-118726-0029	train-other-500	some of his playmates did not hesitate to express the opinion that he had always been as they phrased it the greatest liar that ever spoke What is certain is that the island of Brazil or Hy Brasail
none	none	 had appeared on maps ever since thirteen sixty seven as being near the coast of Ireland that many voyages were made from Bristol to find it a hundred years later that it was mentioned about sixteen thirty six 
8087-118726-0030	train-other-500	as often seen from the shore and that it appeared as Brazil Rock on the London Admiralty Charts until after eighteen fifty If many people tried to find it and failed
none	none	 why should not Kirwan have tried and succeeded And as to his stretching his story a little by throwing in a few enchanters and magic castles there was not a voyager of his period who was not tempted to do the same XIV THE ISLE OF SATAN S HAND The prosperous farmer Conall Ua Corra in the province of Connaught had everything to make him happy except that he and his wife had no children to cheer their old age and inherit their estate Conall had prayed for children and one day said in his impatience that he would rather have them sent by Satan than not have them at all A year or two later his wife had three sons at a birth and when these sons came to maturity they were so ridiculed by other young men as being the sons of Satan that they said If such is really our parentage we will do Satan s work So they collected around them a few villains and began plundering and destroying the churches in the neighborhood and thus injuring half the church buildings in the country At last they resolved to visit also the church of Clothar to destroy it and to kill if necessary their mother s father who was the leading layman of the parish When they came to the church they found the old man on the green in front of it distributing meat and drink to his tenants and the people of the parish Seeing this they postponed their plans until after dark and in the meantime went home with their grandfather to spend the night at his house They went to rest and the eldest Lochan had a terrible dream in which he saw first the joys of heaven and then the terrors of future punishment and then he awoke in dismay Waking his brothers he told them his dream and that he now saw that they had been serving evil masters and making war upon a good one Such was his bitterness of remorse that he converted them to his views and they agreed to go to their grandfather in the morning renounce their sinful ways and ask his pardon This they did and he advised them to go to a celebrated saint Finnen of Clonard and take him as their spiritual guide Laying aside their armor and weapons they went to Clonard where all the people dreading them and knowing their wickedness fled for their lives except the saint himself who came forward to meet them With him the three brothers undertook the most austere religious exercises and after a year they came to saint Finnen and asked his punishment for their former crimes You cannot he said restore to life those you have slain but you can at least restore the buildings you have devastated and ruined So they went and repaired many churches after which they resolved to go on a pilgrimage upon the great Atlantic Ocean They built for themselves therefore a curragh or coracle covered with hides three deep It was capable of carrying nine persons and they selected five out of the many who wished to join the party There were a bishop a priest a deacon a musician and the man who had modelled the boat and with these they pushed out to sea It had happened some years before that in a quarrel about a deer hunt the men of Ross had killed the king It had been decided that by way of punishment sixty couples of the people of Ross should be sent out to sea two and two in small boats to meet what fate they might upon the deeps They were watched that they might not land again and for many years nothing more had been heard from them The most pious task which these repenting pilgrims could undertake it was thought would be to seek these banished people They resolved to spread their sail and let Providence direct their course They went therefore northwest on the Atlantic where they visited several wonderful islands on one of which there was a great bird which related to them the legend says the whole history of the world and gave them a great leaf from a tree the leaf being as large as an ox hide and being preserved for many years in one of the churches after their return At the next island they heard sweet human voices and found that the sixty banished couples had established their homes there The pilgrims then went onward in their hidebound boat until they reached the coast of Spain and there they landed and dwelt for a time The bishop built a church and the priest officiated in it and the organist took charge of the music All prospered yet the boat builder and the three brothers were never quite contented for they had roamed the seas too long and they longed for a new enterprise for their idle valor They thought they had found this when one day they found on the sea coast a group of women tearing their hair and when they asked the explanation Senor said an old woman our sons and our husbands have again fallen into the hand of Satan At this the three brothers were startled for they remembered well how they used in youth to rank themselves as Satan s children Asking farther they learned that a shattered boat they saw on the beach was one of a pair of boats which had been carried too far out to sea and had come near an islet which the sailors called Isla de la Man Satanaxio or The Island of Satan s Hand It appeared that in that region there was an islet so called always surrounded by chilly mists and water of a deadly cold that no one had ever reached it as it constantly changed place but that a demon hand sometimes uprose from it and plucked away men and even whole boats which when once grasped usually by night were never seen again but perished helplessly victims of Satan s Hand When the voyagers laughed at this legend the priest of the village showed them on the early chart of Bianco the name of De la Man Satanagio and on that of Beccaria the name Satanagio alone both these being the titles of islands Not alarmed at the name of Satan as being that of one whom they had supposed in their days of darkness to be their patron they pushed boldly out to sea and steered westward a boat load of Spanish fishermen following in their wake Passing island after island of green and fertile look they found themselves at last in what seemed a less favored zone as windy as the roaring forties and growing chillier every hour Fogs gathered quickly so that they could scarcely see the companion boat and the Spanish fishermen called out to them Garda da la Man do Satanaxio Look out for Satan s hand As they cried the fog became denser yet and when it once parted for a moment something that lifted itself high above them like a gigantic hand showed itself an instant and then descended with a crushing grasp upon the boat of the Spanish fishermen breaking it to pieces and dragging some of the men below the water while others escaping swam through the ice cold waves and were with difficulty taken on board the coracle this being all the harder because the whole surface of the water was boiling and seething furiously Rowing away as they could from this perilous neighborhood they lay on their oars when the night came on not knowing which way to go Gradually the fog cleared away the sun rose clearly at last and wherever they looked on the deep they saw no traces of any island still less of the demon hand But for the presence among them of the fishermen they had picked up there was nothing to show that any casualty had happened That day they steered still farther to the west with some repining from the crew and at night the same fog gathered the same deadly chill came on Finding themselves in shoal water and apparently near some island they decided to anchor the boat and as the man in the bow bent over to clear away the anchor something came down upon him with the same awful force and knocked him overboard His body could not be recovered and as the wind came up they drove before it until noon of the next day seeing nothing of any land and the ocean deepening again By noon the fog cleared and they saw nothing but cried with one voice that the boat should be put about and they should return to Spain For two days they rowed in peace over a summer sea then came the fog again and they laid on their oars that night All around them dim islands seemed to float scarcely discernible in the fog sometimes from the top of each a point would show itself as of a mighty hand and they could hear an occasional plash and roar as if this hand came downwards Once they heard a cry as if of sailors from another vessel Then they strained their eyes to gaze into the fog and a whole island seemed to be turning itself upside down its peak coming down while its base went uppermost and the whole water boiled for leagues around as if both earth and sea were upheaved The sun rose upon this chaos of waters No demon hand was anywhere visible nor any island but a few icebergs were in sight and the frightened sailors rowed away and made sail for home It was rare to see icebergs so far south and this naturally added to the general dismay Amid the superstition of the sailors the tales grew and grew and all the terrors became mingled But tradition says that there were some veteran Spanish sailors along that coast men who had sailed on longer voyages and that these persons actually laughed at the whole story of Satan s Hand saying that any one who had happened to see an iceberg topple over would know all about it It was more generally believed however that all this was mere envy and jealousy the daring fishermen remained heroes for the rest of their days and it was only within a century or two that the island of Satanaxio disappeared from the charts XV ANTILLIA THE ISLAND OF THE SEVEN CITIES The young Spanish page Luis de Vega had been for some months at the court of Don Rodrigo king of Spain when he heard the old knights lamenting as they came out of the palace at Toledo over the king s last and most daring whim He means said one of them in a whisper to penetrate the secret cave of the Gothic kings that cave on which each successive sovereign has put a padlock Till there are now twenty seven of them interrupted a still older knight And he means said the first frowning at the interruption to take thence the treasures of his ancestors Indeed he must do it said another else the son of his ancestors will have no treasure left of his own But there is a spell upon it said the other For ages Spain has been threatened with invasion and it is the old tradition that the only talisman which can prevent it is in this cave Well said the scoffer it is only by entering the cave that he can possess the talisman But if he penetrates to it his power is lost A pretty talisman said the other It is only of use to anybody so long as no one sees it Were I the king I would hold it in my hands And I have counselled him to heed no graybeards but to seize the treasure for himself I have offered to accompany him May it please your lordship said the eager Luis may I go with you Yes said Don Alonzo de Carregas turning to the ardent boy Where the king goes I go and where I go thou shalt be my companion See senors he said turning to the others how the ready faith of boyhood puts your fears to shame To his Majesty the terrors of this goblin cave are but a jest which frightens the old and only rouses the young to courage The king may find the recesses of the cavern filled with gold and jewels he who goes with him may share them This boy is my first recruit who follows By this time a whole group of courtiers young and old had assembled about Don Alonzo and every man below thirty years was ready to pledge himself to the enterprise But the older courtiers and the archbishop Oppas were beseeching the king to refrain Respect O king they said the custom held sacred by twenty seven of thy predecessors Give us but an estimate of the sum that may in thy kingly mind represent the wealth that is within the cavern walls and we will raise it on our own domains rather than see the sacred tradition set at nought The king s only answer was Follow me Don Alonzo hastily sending the boy Luis to collect the younger knights who had already pledged themselves to the enterprise A gallant troop they made their way down the steep steps which led from the palace to the cave The news had spread the ladies had gathered on the balconies and the bright face of one laughing girl looked from a bower window while she tossed a rose to the happy Luis Alas it fell short of its mark and hit the robes of Archbishop Oppas who stood with frowning face as the youngster swept by The archbishop crushed it unwittingly in the hand that held the crosier The rusty padlocks were broken and each fell clanking on the floor and was brushed away by mailed heels They passed from room to room with torches for the cavern extended far beneath the earth yet they found no treasure save the jewelled table of Solomon But for their great expectations this table alone might have proved sufficient to reward their act of daring Some believed that it had been brought by the Romans from Solomon s temple and from Rome by the Goths and Vandals who sacked that city and afterwards conquered Spain but all believed it to be sacred and now saw it to be gorgeous Some describe it as being of gold set with precious stones others as of gold and silver making it yellow and white in hue ornamented with a row of pearls a row of rubies and another row of emeralds It is generally agreed that it stood on three hundred and sixty feet each made of a single emerald Being what it was the king did not venture to remove it but left it where it was Traversing chamber after chamber and finding all empty they at last found all passages leading to the inmost apartment which had a marble urn in the centre Yet all eyes presently turned from this urn to a large painting on the wall which displayed a troop of horsemen in full motion Their horses were of Arab breed their arms were scimitars and lances with fluttering pennons they wore turbans and their coarse black hair fell over their shoulders they were dressed in skins Never had there been seen by the courtiers a mounted troop so wild so eager so formidable Turning from them to the marble urn the king drew from it a parchment which said These are the people who whenever this cave is entered and the spell contained in this urn is broken shall possess this country An idle curiosity has done its work two Footnote two Latinas letras a la margen puestas Decian Cuando aquesta puerta y arca Fueran abiertas gentes como estas Pondran por tierra cuanto Espana abarca LOPE DE VEGA The rash king covering his eyes with his hands fled outward from the cavern his knights followed him but Don Alonzo lingered last except the boy Luis Nevertheless my lord said Luis I should like to strike a blow at these bold barbarians We may have an opportunity said the gloomy knight He closed the centre gate of the cavern and tried to replace the broken padlocks but it was in vain In twenty four hours the story had travelled over the kingdom The boy Luis little knew into what a complex plot he was drifting In the secret soul of his protector Don Alonzo there burned a great anger against the weak and licentious king He and his father Count Julian and Archbishop Oppas his uncle were secretly brooding plans of wrath against Don Rodrigo for his ill treatment of Don Alonzo s sister Florinda Rumors had told them that an army of strange warriors from Africa who had hitherto carried all before them were threatening to cross the straits not yet called Gibraltar and descend on Spain All the ties of fidelity held these courtiers to the king but they secretly hated him and wished for his downfall By the next day they had planned to betray him to the Moors Count Julian had come to make his military report to Don Rodrigo and on some pretext had withdrawn Florinda from the court When you come again said the pleasure loving king bring me some hawks from the south that we may again go hawking I will bring you hawks enough was the answer and such as you never saw before But Rodrigo says the Arabian chronicler did not understand the full meaning of his words It was a hard blow for the young Luis when he discovered what a plot was being urged around him He would gladly have been faithful to the king worthless as he knew him to be but Don Alonzo had been his benefactor and he held by him Meanwhile the conspiracy drew towards completion and the Arab force was drawing nearer to the straits A single foray into Spain had shown Musa the Arab general the weakness of the kingdom that the cities were unfortified the citizens unarmed and many of the nobles lukewarm towards the king Hasten he said towards that country where the palaces are filled with gold and silver and the men cannot fight in their defence Accordingly in the early spring of the year seven hundred eleven Musa sent his next in command Tarik to cross to Spain with an army of seven thousand men consisting mostly of chosen cavalry They crossed the straits then called the Sea of Narrowness embarking the troops at Tangier and Ceute in many merchant vessels and landing at that famous promontory called thenceforth by the Arab general s name the Rock of Tarik Dschebel Tarik or more briefly Gibraltar Luis under Don Alonzo was with the Spanish troops sent hastily down to resist the Arab invaders and as these troops were mounted he had many opportunities of seeing the new enemies and observing their ways They were a picturesque horde their breasts were covered with mail armor they wore white turbans on their heads carried their bows slung across their backs and their swords suspended to their girdles while they held their long spears firmly grasped in their hands The Arabs said that their fashion of mail armor had come to them from King David to whom they said God made iron soft and it became in his hands as thread More than half of them were mounted on the swift horses which were peculiar to their people and the white red and black turbans and cloaks made a most striking picture around the camp fires These men too were already trained and successful soldiers held together both by a common religion and by the hope of spoil There were twelve thousand of them by the most probable estimate for Musa had sent reinforcements and they had against them from five to eight times their number But of the Spaniards only a small part were armed or drilled or used to warfare and great multitudes of them had to put their reliance in clubs slings axes and short scythes The cavalry were on the wings where Luis found himself with Count Julian and Archbishop Oppas to command them Soon however Don Alonzo and Luis were detached with others to act as escort to the king Don Rodrigo The battle began soon after daybreak on Sunday July nineteen seven hundred eleven As the Spanish troops advanced their trumpets sounded defiance and were answered by Moorish horns and kettledrums While they drew near the shouts of the Spaniards were drowned in the lelie of the Arabs the phrase La ila ha ella llah there is no deity but God As they came nearer yet there is a tradition that Rodrigo looking on the Moslem said By the faith of the Messiah these are the very men I saw painted on the walls of the cave at Toledo Yet he certainly bore himself like a king and he rode on the battle field in a chariot of ivory lined with gold having a silken awning decked with pearls and rubies while the vehicle was drawn by three white mules abreast He was then nearly eighty and was dressed in a silken robe embroidered with pearls He had brought with him in carts and on mules his treasures in jewels and money and he had trains of mules whose only load consisted of ropes to bind the arms of his captives so sure was he of making every Arab his prisoner Driving along the lines he addressed his troops boldly and arriving at the centre quitted his chariot put on a horned helmet and mounted his white horse Orelio This was before the invention of gunpowder and all battles were hand to hand On the first day the result was doubtful and Tarik rode through the Arab ranks calling on them to fight for their religion and their safety As the onset began Tarik rode furiously at a Spanish chief whom he took for the king and struck him down For a moment it was believed to be the king whom he had killed and from that moment new energy was given to the Arabs The line of the Spaniards wavered and at this moment the whole wing of cavalry to which Luis belonged rode out from its place and passed on the flank of the army avoiding both Spaniard and Arab What means this said Luis to the horseman by his side It means was the answer that Bishop Oppas is betraying the king At this moment Don Alonzo rode up and cheered their march with explanations No more he said will we obey this imbecile old king who can neither fight nor govern He and his troops are but so many old women it is only these Arabs who are men All is arranged with Tarik and we will save our country by joining the only man who can govern it Luis groaned in dismay it seemed to him an act of despicable treachery but those around him seemed mostly prepared for it and he said to himself After all Don Alonzo is my chief I must hold by him so he kept with the others and the whole cavalry wing followed Oppas to a knoll whence they watched the fight It soon became a panic the Arabs carried all before them and the king himself was either killed or hid himself in a convent Many a Spaniard of the seceding wing of cavalry reproached himself afterwards for what had been done and while the archbishop had some influence with the conquering general and persuaded him to allow the Christians everywhere to retain a part of their churches yet he had after all the reward of a traitor in contempt and self reproach This he could bear no longer and organizing an expedition from a Spanish port he and six minor bishops with many families of the Christians made their way towards Gibraltar They did not make their escape however without attracting notice and obstruction As they rode among the hills with their long train soldiers ecclesiastics women and children they saw a galloping band of Arabs in pursuit The archbishop bade them turn instantly into a deserted castle they were just passing to drop the portcullis and man the walls That they might look as numerous as possible he bade all the women dress themselves like men and tie their long hair beneath their chins to resemble beards He then put helmets on their heads and lances in their hands and thus the Arab leader saw a formidable host on the walls to be besieged In obedience perhaps to orders he rode away and after sufficient time had passed the archbishop s party rode onward towards their place of embarkation Luis found himself beside a dark eyed maiden who ambled along on a white mule and when he ventured to joke her a little on her late appearance as an armed cavalier she said coyly Did you think my only weapons were roses Looking eagerly at her he recognized the laughing face which he had once seen at a window but ere he could speak again she had struck her mule lightly and taken refuge beside the archbishop where Luis dared not venture He did not recognize the maiden again till they met on board one of the vessels which the Arabs had left at Gibraltar and on which they embarked for certain islands of which Oppas had heard which lay in the Sea of Darkness Among these islands they were to find their future home The voyage at first rough soon became serene and quiet the skies were clear the moon shone the veils of the Spanish maidens were convenient by day and useless at evening and Luis had many a low voiced talk on the quarter deck with Juanita who proved to be a young relative of the archbishop It was understood that she was to take the veil and that young as she was she would become by and by the lady abbess of a nunnery to be established on the islands and as her kinsman though severe to others was gentle to her she had her own way a good deal especially beneath the moon and the stars For the rest they had daily services of religion as dignified and sonorous as could have taken place on shore except on those rare occasions when the chief bass voice was hushed in seasickness in some cabin below Beautiful Gregorian masses rose to heaven and it is certain that the Pilgrim fathers in their two months on the Atlantic almost a thousand years later had no such rich melody as floated across those summer seas Luis was a favorite of Oppas the archbishop who never seemed to recognize any danger in having an enamoured youth so near to the demure future abbess He consulted the youth about many plans Their aim it seemed was the great island called Antillia as yet unexplored but reputed to be large enough for many thousand people Oppas was to organize the chief settlement and he planned to divide the island into seven dioceses each bishop having a permanent colony Once established they would trade with Spain and whether it remained Moorish or became Christian Oppas was sure of friendly relations The priests were divided among the three vessels and among them there was that occasional jarring from which even holy men are not quite free The different bishops had their partisans but none dared openly face the imperial Oppas His supposed favorite Luis was less formidable he was watched and spied upon while his devotion to the dignified Juanita was apparent to all Yet he was always ready to leave her side when Oppas called and then they discussed together the future prospects of the party when they should see land whether it would really be Antillia whether they should have a good landfall whether the island would be fertile whether there would be native inhabitants and if so whether they should be baptized and sent to Spain as slaves or whether they should be retained on the island It was decided on the whole that this last should be done and what with the prospect of winning souls and the certainty of having obedient subjects the prospect seemed inviting One morning at sunrise there lay before them a tropic island soft and graceful with green shrubs and cocoanut trees and rising in the distance to mountains whose scooped tops and dark furrowed sides spoke of extinct volcanoes yet not so extinct but that a faint wreath of vapor still mounted from the utmost peak of the highest among them Here and there were seen huts covered with great leaves or sheaves of grass and among these they saw figures moving and disappearing watching their approach yet always ready to disappear in the recesses of the woods Sounding carefully the depth of water with their imperfect tackle they anchored off the main beach and sent a boat on shore from each vessel Luis being in command of one The natives at first hovered in the distance but presently came down to the shore to meet the visitors some even swimming off to the boats in advance They were of a yellow complexion with good features were naked except for goat skins or woven palm fibres or reeds painted in different colors and were gay and merry singing and dancing among themselves When brought on board the ships they ate bread and figs but refused wine and spices and they seemed not to know the use of rings or of swords when shown to them Whatever was given to them they divided with one another They cultivated fruit and grain on their island reared goats and seemed willing to share all with their newly found friends Luis always thoughtful and somewhat anxious in temperament felt many doubts as to the usage which these peaceful islanders would receive from the ships company no matter how many bishops and holy men might be on board All that day there was exploring by small companies and on the next the archbishop landed in solemn procession The boats from the ships all met at early morning near the shore the sight bringing together a crowd of islanders on the banks men women and children who with an instinct that something of importance was to happen decked themselves with flowers wreaths and plumes the number increasing constantly and the crowd growing more and more picturesque Forming from the boats a procession marched slowly up the beach beginning with a few lay brethren carrying tools for digging then acolytes bearing tall crosses and then white robed priests the seven bishops being carried on litters the archbishop most conspicuously of all Solemn chants were sung as the procession moved through the calm water towards the placid shore and the gentle savages joined in kneeling while a solemn mass was said and the crosses were uplifted which took possession of the new found land in the name of the Church These solemn services occupied much of the day later they carried tents on shore and some of them occupied large storehouses which the natives had built for drying their figs and to the women under direction of Juanita was allotted a great airy cave with smaller caves branching from it where the natives had made palm baskets Day after day they labored transferring all their goods and provisions to the land tools and horses and mules clothing and simple furniture Most of them joined with pleasure in this toil but others grew restless as they transferred all their possessions to land and sometimes the women especially would climb to high places and gaze longingly towards Spain One morning a surprise came to Luis Every night it was their custom to have a great fire on the beach and to meet and sing chants around it One night Luis had personally put out the blaze of the fire as it was more windy than usual and went to sleep in his tent Soon after midnight he was awakened by a glare of a great light upon his tent s thin walls and hastily springing up he saw their largest caravel on fire Rushing out to give the alarm he saw a similar flame kindled in the second vessel and then after some delay in the third Then he saw a dark boat pulling hastily towards the shore and going down to the beach he met their most trusty captain who told him that the ships had been burnt by order of the archbishop in order that their return might be hopeless and that their stay on the island might be forever There was some lamentation among the emigrants when they saw their retreat thus cut off but Luis when once established on shore did not share it to be near Juanita was enough for him though he rarely saw her He began sometimes to feel that the full confidence of the archbishop was withdrawn from him but he was still high in office and he rode with Oppas over the great island marking it out by slow degrees into seven divisions that each bishop might have a diocese and a city of his own Soon the foundations began to be laid and houses and churches began to be built for the soft volcanic rock was easily worked though not very solid for building The spot for the cathedral was selected with the unerring eye for a fine situation which the Roman Catholic Church has always shown and the adjoining convent claimed as it rose the care of Juanita As general superintendent of the works it was the duty of Luis sometimes to be in that neighborhood until one unlucky day when the two lovers lingering to watch the full moon rise were interrupted by one of the younger bishops a black browed Spaniard of stealthy ways who had before now taken it upon himself to watch them Nothing could be more innocent than their dawning loves yet how could any love be held innocent on the part of a maiden who was the kinswoman of an archbishop and was his destined choice for the duties of an abbess The fact that she had never yet taken her preliminary vows or given her consent to take them counted for nothing in the situation though any experienced lady superior could have told the archbishop that no maiden could be wisely made an abbess until she had given some signs of having a vocation for a religious life From that moment the youthful pair met no more for weeks It seemed always necessary for Luis to be occupied elsewhere than in the Cathedral city as the best architect on the island he was sent here there and everywhere and the six other churches rose with more rapidity because the archbishop preferred to look after his own The once peaceful natives found themselves a shade less happy when they were required to work all day long as quarry men or as builders but it was something had they but known it that they were not borne away as slaves as happened later on other islands to so many of their race To Luis they were always loyal for his cheery ways although there seemed a change in his spirits as time went on But an event happened which brought a greater change still A Spanish caravel was seen one day making towards the port and showing signals of distress Luis having just then found an excuse for visiting the Cathedral city was the first to board her and was hailed with joy by the captain He was a townsman of the youth s and had given him his first lessons in navigation He had been bound it seemed for the Canary Islands and had put in for repairs which needed only a few days in the quiet waters of a sheltered port He could tell Luis of his parents of his home and that the northern part of Spain under Arab sway was humanely governed and a certain proportion of Christian churches allowed In a few days the caravel sailed again at nightfall but it carried with it two unexpected passengers the archbishop lost his architect and the proposed convent lost its unwilling abbess From this point both the Island of the Seven Cities and its escaping lovers disappear from all definite records It was a period when expeditions of discovery came and went and when one wondrous tale drove out another There exist legends along the northern coast of Spain in the region of Santander for instance of a youth who once eloped with a high born maiden and came there to dwell but there may have been many such youths and many such maidens who knows Of Antillia itself or the Island of the Seven Cities it is well known that it appeared on the maps of the Atlantic sometimes under the one name and sometimes under another six hundred years after the date assigned by the story that has here been told It was said by Fernando Columbus to have been revisited by a Portuguese sailor in fourteen forty seven and the name appeared on the globe of Behaim in fourteen ninety two The geographer Toscanelli in his famous letter to Columbus recommended Antillia as likely to be useful to Columbus as a way station for reaching India and when the great explorer reached Hispaniola he was supposed to have discovered the mysterious island whence the name of Antilles was given to the group Later the first explorers of New Mexico thought that the pueblos were the Seven Cities so that both the names of the imaginary island have been preserved although those of Luis de Vega and his faithful Juanita have not been recorded until the telling of this tale XVI HARALD THE VIKING Erik the Red the most famous of all Vikings had three sons and once when they were children the king came to visit Erik and passed through the playground where the boys were playing Leif and Biorn the two oldest were building little houses and barns and were making believe that they were full of cattle and sheep while Harald who was only four years old was sailing chips of wood in a pool The king asked Harald what they were and he said Ships of war King Olaf laughed and said The time may come when you will command ships my little friend Then he asked Biorn what he would like best to have Corn land he said ten farms That would yield much corn the king replied Then he asked Leif the same question and he answered Cows How many So many that when they went to the lake to be watered they would stand close round the edge so that not another could pass That would be a large housekeeping said the king and he asked the same question of Harald What would you like best to have Servants and followers said the child stoutly How many would you like Enough said the child to eat up all the cows and crops of my brothers at a single meal Then the king laughed and said to the mother of the children You are bringing up a king As the boys grew Leif and Harald were ever fond of roaming while Biorn wished to live on the farm at peace Their sister Freydis went with the older boys and urged them on She was not gentle and amiable but full of energy and courage she was also quarrelsome and vindictive People said of her that even if her brothers were all killed yet the race of Erik the Red would not end while she lived that she practised more of shooting and the handling of sword and shield than of sewing or embroidering and that as she was able she did evil oftener than good and that when she was hindered she ran into the woods and slew men to get their property She was always urging her brothers to deeds of daring and adventure One day they had been hawking and when they let slip the falcons Harald s falcon killed two blackcocks in one flight and three in another The dogs ran and brought the birds and he said proudly to the others It will be long before most of you have any such success and they all agreed to this He rode home in high spirits and showed his birds to his sister Freydis Did any king he asked ever make so great a capture in so short a time It is indeed she said a good morning s hunting to have got five blackcocks but it was still better when in one morning a king of Norway took five kings and subdued all their kingdoms Then Harald went away very humble and besought his father to let him go and serve on the Varangian Guard of King Otho at Constantinople that he might learn to be a warrior So Harald was brought from his Norwegian home by his father Erik the Red in his galley called the Sea serpent and sailed with him through the Mediterranean Sea and was at last made a member of the Emperor Otho s Varangian Guard at Constantinople This guard will be well remembered by the readers of Scott s novel Count Robert of Paris and was maintained by successive emperors and drawn largely from the Scandinavian races Erik the Red had no hesitation in leaving his son among them as the young man was stout and strong very self willed and quite able to defend himself The father knew also that the Varangian Guard though hated by the people held to one another like a band of brothers and that any one brought up among them would be sure of plenty of fighting and plenty of gold the two things most prized by early Norsemen For ordinary life Harald s chief duties would be to lounge about the palace keeping guard wearing helmet and buckler and bearskin with purple underclothes and golden clasped hose and bearing as armor a mighty battle axe and a small scimitar Such was the life led by Harald till one day he had a message from his father through a new recruit calling him home to join an expedition to the western seas I hear my son the message said that your good emperor whom may the gods preserve is sorely ill and may die any day When he is dead be prompt in getting your share of the plunder of the palace and come back to me The emperor died and the order was fulfilled It was the custom of the Varangians to reward themselves in this way for their faithful services of protection and the result is that to this day Greek and Arabic gold crosses and chains are to be found in the houses of Norwegian peasants and may be seen in the museums of Christiania and Copenhagen No one was esteemed the less for this love of spoil if he was only generous in giving The Norsemen spoke contemptuously of gold as the serpent s bed and called a generous man a hater of the serpent s bed because such a man parts with gold as with a thing he hates When the youth came to his father he found Erik the Red directing the building of one of the great Norse galleys nearly eighty feet long and seventeen wide and only six feet deep The boat had twenty ribs and the frame was fastened together by withes made of roots while the oaken planks were held by iron rivets The oars were twenty feet long and were put through oar holes and the rudder shaped like a large oar was not at the end but was attached to a projecting beam on the starboard originally steer board side The ship was to be called a Dragon and was to be painted so as to look like one having a gilded dragon s head at the bow and a gilded tail on the stern while the moving oars would look like legs and the row of red and white shields hung along the side of the boat would resemble the scales of a dragon and the great square sails red and blue would look like wings This was the vessel which young Harald was to command He had already made trips in just such vessels with his father had learned to attack the enemy with arrow and spear also with stones thrown down from above and with grappling irons to clutch opposing boats He had learned to swim from early childhood even in the icy northern waters and he had been trained in swimming to hide his head beneath his floating shield so that it could not be seen He had learned also to carry tinder in a walnut shell enclosed in wax so that no matter how long he had been in the water he could strike a light on reaching shore He had also learned from his father acts of escape as well as attack Thus he had once sailed on a return trip from Denmark after plundering a town the ships had been lying at anchor all night in a fog and at sunlight in the morning lights seemed burning on the sea But Erik the Red said It is a fleet of Danish ships and the sun strikes on the gilded dragon crests furl the sail and take to the oars They rowed their best yet the Danish ships were overtaking them when Erik the Red ordered his men to throw wood overboard and cover it with Danish plunder This made some delay as the Danes stopped to pick it up and in the same way Erik the Red dropped his provisions and finally his prisoners and in the delay thus caused he got away with his own men But now Harald was not to go to Denmark but to the new western world the Wonderstrands which Leif had sought and had left without sufficient exploration First however he was to call at Greenland which his father had first discovered It was the custom of the Viking explorers when they reached a new country to throw overboard their seat posts or setstokka the curved part of their doorways and then to land where they floated ashore But Erik the Red had lent his to a friend and could not get them back so that he sailed in search of them and came to a new land which he called Greenland because as he said people would be attracted thither if it had a good name Then he established a colony there and then Leif the Lucky as he was called sailed still farther and came to the Wonderstrand or Magic Shores These he called Vinland or Wine land and now a rich man named Karlsefne was to send a colony thither from Greenland and the young Harald was to go with it and take command of it Now as Harald was to be presented to the rich Karlsefne he thought he must be gorgeously arrayed So he wore a helmet on his head a red shield richly inlaid with gold and iron and a sharp sword with an ivory handle wound with golden thread He had also a short spear and wore over his coat a red silk short cloak on which was embroidered both before and behind a yellow lion We may well believe that the sixty men and five women who composed the expedition were ready to look on him with admiration especially as one of the women was his own sister Freydis now left to his peculiar care since Erik the Red had died The sturdy old hero had died still a heathen and it was only just after his death that Christianity was introduced into Greenland and those numerous churches were built there whose ruins yet remain even in regions from which all population has gone So the party of colonists sailed for Vinland and Freydis with the four older women came in Harald s boat and Freydis took easily the lead among them for strength though not always it must be admitted for amiability The boats of the expedition having left Greenland soon after the year one thousand coasted the shore as far as they could rarely venturing into open sea At last amidst fog and chilly weather they made land at a point where a river ran through a lake into the sea and they could not enter from the sea except at high tide It was once believed that this was Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island but this is no longer believed Here they landed and called the place Hop from the Icelandic word hopa meaning an inlet from the ocean Here they found grape vines growing and fields of wild wheat there were fish in the lake and wild animals in the woods Here they landed the cattle and the provisions which they had brought with them and here they built their huts They went in the spring and during that summer the natives came in boats of skin to trade with them men described as black and ill favored with large eyes and broad cheeks and with coarse hair on their heads These it is thought may have been the Esquimaux The first time they came these visitors held up a white shield as a sign of peace and were so frightened by the bellowing of the bull that they ran away Then returning they brought furs to sell and wished to buy weapons but Harald tried another plan he bade the women bring out milk butter and cheese from their dairies and when the Skraelings saw that they wished for nothing else and the legend says the Skraelings carried away their wares in their stomachs but the Norsemen had the skins they had purchased This happened yet again but at the second visit one of the Skraelings was accidentally killed or injured The next time the Skraelings came they were armed with slings and raised upon a pole a great blue ball and attacked the Norsemen so furiously that they were running away when Erik s sister Freydis came out before them with bare arms and took up a sword saying Why do you run strong men as you are from these miserable dwarfs whom I thought you would knock down like cattle Give me weapons and I will fight better than any of you Then the rest took courage and began to fight and the Skraelings were driven back Once more the strangers came and one of them took up an axe a thing which he had not before seen and struck at one of his companions killing him Then the leader took the axe and threw it into the water after which the Skraelings retreated and were not seen again The winter was a mild one and while it lasted the Norsemen worked busily at felling wood and house building They had also many amusements in most of which Harald excelled They used to swim in all weathers One of their feats was to catch seals and sit on them while swimming another was to pull one another down and remain as long as possible under water Harald could swim for a mile or more with his armor on or with a companion on his shoulder In doors they used to play the tug of war dragging each other by a walrus hide across the fire Harald was good at this and was also the best archer sometimes aiming at something placed on a boy s head the boy having a cloth tied around his head and held by two men that he might not move at all on hearing the whistling of the arrow In this way Harald could even shoot an arrow under a nut placed on the head so that the nut would roll down and the head not be hurt He could plant a spear in the ground and then shoot an arrow upward so skilfully that it would turn in the air and fall with the point in the end of the spear shaft He could also shoot a blunt arrow through the thickest ox hide from a cross bow He could change weapons from one hand to the other during a fencing match or fence with either hand or throw two spears at the same time or catch a spear in motion He could run so fast that no horse could overtake him and play the rough games with bat and ball using a ball of the hardest wood He could race on snowshoes or wrestle when bound by a belt to his antagonist Then when he and his companions wished a rest they amused themselves with harp playing or riddles or chess The Norsemen even played chess on board their vessels and there are still to be seen on some of these the little holes that were formerly used for the sharp ends of the chessmen so that they should not be displaced They could not find that any European had ever visited this place but some of the Skraelings told them of a place farther south which they called the Land of the Whiteman or Great Ireland They said that in that place there were white men who clothed themselves in long white garments carried before them poles to which white cloths were hung and called with a loud voice These it was thought by the Norsemen must be Christian processions in which banners were borne and hymns were chanted It has been thought from this that some expedition from Ireland that of saint Brandan for instance may have left a settlement there long before but this has never been confirmed The Skraelings and the Northmen were good friends for a time until at last one of Erik s own warriors killed a Skraeling by accident and then all harmony was at an end They saw no hope of making a lasting settlement there and moreover Freydis who was very grasping tried to deceive the other settlers and get more than her share of everything so that Harald himself lost patience with her and threatened her It happened that one of the men of the party Olaf was Harald s foster brother They had once had a fight and after the battle had agreed that they would be friends for life and always share the same danger For this vow they were to walk under the turf that is a strip of turf was cut and held above their heads and they stood beneath and let their blood flow upon the ground whence the turf had been cut After this they were to own everything by halves and either must avenge the other s death This was their brotherhood but Freydis did not like it so she threatened Olaf and tried to induce men to kill him for she did not wish to bring upon herself the revenge that must come if she slew him This was the reason why the whole enterprise failed and why Olaf persuaded Harald for the sake of peace to return to Greenland in the spring and take a load of valuable timber to sell there including one stick of what was called massur wood which was as valuable as mahogany and may have been at some time borne by ocean currents to the beach It is hardly possible that as some have thought the colonists established a regular trade in this wood for no such wood grows on the northern Atlantic shores However this may be the party soon returned after one winter in Vinland the Good and on the way back Harald did one thing which made him especially dear to his men A favorite feat of the Norsemen was to toss three swords in the air and catch each by the handle as it came down This was called the handsax game The young men used also to try the feat of running along the oar blades of the rowers as they were in motion passing around the bow of the vessel with a spring and coming round to the stern over the oars on the other side Few could accomplish this but no one but Harald could do it and play the handsax game as he ran and when he did it they all said that he was the most skilful man at idrottie ever seen That was their word for an athletic feat But presently came a time when not only his courage but his fairness and justice were to be tried It happened in this way There was nothing of which the Norsemen were more afraid than of the teredo or shipworm which gnaws the wood of ships It was observed in Greenland and Iceland that pieces of wood often floated on shore which were filled with holes made by this animal and they thought that in certain places the seas were full of this worm so that a ship would be bored and sunk in a little while It is said that on this return voyage Harald s vessel entered a worm sea and presently began to sink They had however provided a smaller boat smeared with sea oil which the worms would not attack They went into the boat but found that it would not hold more than half of them all Then Harald said We will divide by lots without regard to the rank each taking his chance with the rest This they thought the Norse legend says a high minded offer They drew lots and Harald was among those assigned to the safer boat He stepped in and when he was there a man called from the other boat and said Dost thou intend Harald to separate from me here Harald answered So it turns out and the man said Very different was thy promise to my father when we came from Greenland for the promise was that we should share the same fate Then Harald said It shall not be thus Go into the boat and I will go back into the ship since thou art so anxious to live Then Harald went back to the ship while the man took his place in the boat and after that Harald was never heard of more XVII THE SEARCH FOR NORUMBEGA 
7150-118730-0000	train-other-500	Sir Humphrey Gilbert colonel of the British forces in the Netherlands was poring over the manuscript narrative of David Ingram mariner

7150-118730-0004	train-other-500	He saw kings decorated with rubies six inches long
7150-118730-0005	train-other-500	and they were borne on chairs of silver and crystal adorned with precious stones He saw pearls as common as pebbles and the natives were laden down by their ornaments of gold and silver
7150-118730-0006	train-other-500	The city of Bega was three quarters of a mile long and had many streets wider than those of London Some houses had massive pillars of crystal and silver What assurance can he give asked Raleigh
7150-118730-0007	train-other-500	He offers on his life to prove it A small offer mayhap There be many of these lying mariners whose lives are as worthless as the stories they relate
none	none	 But what said he of the natives Kindly disposed was the reply so far as he went but those dwelling farther north where he did not go were said to be cannibals with teeth like those of dogs whereby you may know them Travellers tales said Raleigh Omne ignotum pro mirifico 
7150-118730-0008	train-other-500	He returned said Gilbert

none	none	 He says that he saw in that country both elephants and ounces and he says that their trumpets are made of elephants teeth 
7150-118730-0012	train-other-500	But the houses said Raleigh tell me of the houses In every house said Gilbert reading from the manuscript they have scoops

7150-118730-0015	train-other-500	published without his knowledge by George Gascoigne
none	none	 In fifteen seventy eight he had from Queen Elizabeth a patent of exploration allowing him to take possession of 
7150-118730-0016	train-other-500	any uncolonized lands in North America paying for these a fifth of all gold and silver found The next year he sailed with Raleigh for Newfoundland
7150-118730-0017	train-other-500	but one vessel was lost and the others returned to England In fifteen eighty three he sailed again taking with him the narrative of Ingram which he reprinted He also took with him a learned Hungarian from Buda
7150-118730-0018	train-other-500	named Parmenius who went for the express purpose of singing the praise of Norumbega in Latin verse but was drowned in Sir Humphrey s great flag ship the Delight
7150-118730-0019	train-other-500	This wreck took place near Sable Island and as most of the supplies for the expedition went down in the flag ship the men in the remaining vessels grew so impatient as to compel a return
7150-118730-0020	train-other-500	There were two vessels the Golden Hind of forty tons and the Squirrel of ten tons this last being a mere boat then called a frigate
7150-118730-0021	train-other-500	a small vessel propelled by both sails and oars quite unlike the war ship afterwards called by that name
7150-118730-0022	train-other-500	On both these vessels the men were so distressed that they gathered on the bulwarks pointing to their empty mouths and their ragged clothing
7150-118730-0023	train-other-500	The officers of the Golden Hind were unwilling to return but consented on Sir Humphrey s promise that they should come back in the spring they sailed for England on the thirty first of August
7150-118730-0024	train-other-500	All wished him to return in the Golden Hind as a much larger and safer vessel
none	none	 the Squirrel besides its smallness being encumbered on the deck with guns ammunition and nettings making it unseaworthy 
7150-118730-0025	train-other-500	But when he was begged to remove into the larger vessel he said I will not forsake my little company going homeward with whom I have passed so many storms and perils One reason for this was
none	none	 the narrator of the voyage says because of hard reports given of him that he was afraid of the sea albeit this was rather rashness than advised resolution to prefer the wind of a vain report to the weight of his own life 
7150-118730-0026	train-other-500	On the very day of sailing they caught their first glimpse of some large species of seal or walrus which is thus described by the old narrator of the expedition
none	none	 So vpon Saturday in the afternoone the thirty one of August we changed our course and returned backe for England at which very instant euen in winding about there passed along betweene vs and towards the land which we now forsooke 
7150-118730-0027	train-other-500	a very lion to our seeming in shape hair and colour not swimming after the maner of a beast by moouing of his feete but rather sliding vpon the water with his whole body excepting the legs in sight

7150-118730-0030	train-other-500	roaring or bellowing as doeth a lion
none	none	 which spectacle wee all beheld so farre as we were able to discerne the same as men prone to wonder at euery strange thing 
7150-118730-0031	train-other-500	as this doubtlesse was to see a lion in the Ocean sea or fish in shape of a lion What opinion others had thereof and chiefly the Generall himselfe I forbeare to deliuer

7150-118730-0034	train-other-500	saint Elmo s Fire yet they had but one of these at a time
none	none	 and this is thought a sign of tempest On September nine in the afternoon the general as they called him Sir Humphrey was sitting abaft with a book in his hand and cried out more than once to those in the other vessel We are as near to heaven by sea as by land And that same night about twelve o clock the frigate being ahead of the Golden Hind the lights of the smaller vessel suddenly disappeared and they knew that she had sunk in the sea The event is well described in a ballad by Longfellow The name of Norumbega and the tradition of its glories survived Sir Humphrey Gilbert In a French map of fifteen forty three the town appears with castle and towers Jean Allfonsce 
7150-118730-0035	train-other-500	who visited New England in that year describes it as the capital of a great fur country Students of Indian tongues defined the word as meaning
none	none	 the place of a fine city while the learned Grotius seized upon it as being the same as Norberga and so affording a relic of the visits of the Northmen 
7150-118730-0036	train-other-500	As to the locality it appeared first on the maps as a large island then as a smaller one and after fifteen sixty nine no longer as an island but a part of the mainland bordering apparently on the Penobscot River
7150-118730-0037	train-other-500	Whittier in his poem of Norumbega describes a Norman knight as seeking it in vain He turned him back O master dear We are but men misled And thou hast sought a city here
7150-118730-0038	train-other-500	To find a grave instead No builded wonder of these lands My weary eyes shall see A city never made with hands Alone awaiteth me
none	none	 So Champlain in sixteen oh four could find no trace of it and said that no such marvel existed while Mark Lescarbot the Parisian advocate writing in sixteen oh nine says If this beautiful town ever existed in nature I would like to know who pulled it down for there is nothing here but huts made of pickets and covered with the barks of trees or skins 
7150-118730-0040	train-other-500	Yet it kept its place on maps till sixteen forty and even Heylin in his Cosmography sixteen sixty nine
none	none	 speaks of Norumbega and its fair city though he fears that the latter never existed It is a curious fact that the late mister Justin Winsor the eminent historian after much inquiry among the present descendants of the Indian tribes in Maine could never find any one who could remember to have heard the name of Norumbega XVIII THE GUARDIANS OF THE saint LAWRENCE When in sixteen eleven the Sieur de Champlain went back to France to report his wonderful explorations in Canada he was soon followed by a young Frenchman named Vignan who had spent a whole winter among the Indians in a village where there was no other white man This was a method often adopted by the French for getting more knowledge of Indian ways and commanding their confidence Vignan had made himself a welcome guest in the cabins and had brought away many of their legends to which he added some of his own In particular he declared that he had penetrated into the interior until he had come upon a great lake of salt water far to the northwest This was as it happened the very thing which the French government and all Europe had most hoped to find They had always believed that sooner or later a short cut would be discovered across the newly found continent a passage leading to the Pacific Ocean and far Cathay 
7150-118731-0000	train-other-500	This was the dream of all French explorers and of Champlain in particular and his interest was at once excited by anything that looked toward the Pacific
none	none	 Now Vignan had prepared himself with just the needed information 
7150-118731-0001	train-other-500	He said that during his winter with the Indians he had made the very discovery needed
none	none	 that he had ascended the river Ottawa which led to a body of salt water so large that it seemed like an ocean that he had just seen on its shores the wreck of an English ship from which eighty men had been taken and slain by the savages and that 
7150-118731-0002	train-other-500	they had with them an English boy whom they were keeping to present to Champlain
none	none	 This tale about the English ship was evidently founded on the recent calamities of Henry Hudson of which Vignan 
7150-118731-0003	train-other-500	had heard some garbled account and which he used as coloring for his story
none	none	 The result was that Champlain was thoroughly interested in the tale and that Vignan was cross examined and tested and was made at last to certify to the truth of it before two notaries of Rochelle Champlain privately consulted the chancellor de Sillery the old Marquis de Brissac and others who all assured him that the matter should be followed up and he resolved to make it the subject of an exploration without delay He sailed in one vessel and Vignan in another the latter taking with him an ardent young Frenchman Albert de Brissac M de Vignan talking with the young Brissac on the voyage told him wonderful tales of monsters which were he said the guardians of the saint Lawrence River There was he said an island in the bay of Chaleurs 
7150-118731-0004	train-other-500	near the mouth of that river where a creature dwelt having the form of a woman and called by the Indians Gougou
7150-118731-0005	train-other-500	She was very frightful and so enormous that the masts of the vessel could not reach her waist She had already eaten many savages and constantly continued to do so putting them first into a great pocket to await her hunger
none	none	 Some of those who had escaped said that this pocket was large enough to hold a whole ship 
7150-118731-0006	train-other-500	This creature habitually made dreadful noises and several savages who came on board claimed to have heard them A man from saint Malo in France the Sieur de Prevert confirmed this story
none	none	 and said that he had passed so near the den of this frightful being that all on board could hear its hissing and all hid themselves below lest it should carry them off This naturally made much impression upon the young Sieur de Brissac and he doubtless wished many times that he had stayed at home On the other hand he observed that both M de Vignan and M de Prevert took the tale very coolly and that there seemed no reason why he should distrust himself if they did not Yet he was very glad when after passing many islands and narrow straits the river broadened 
7150-118731-0007	train-other-500	and they found themselves fairly in the saint Lawrence and past the haunted Bay of Chaleurs
7150-118731-0008	train-other-500	They certainly heard a roaring and a hissing in the distance but it may have been the waves on the beach But this was not their last glimpse of the supposed guardians of the saint Lawrence
7150-118731-0009	train-other-500	As the ship proceeded farther up the beautiful river they saw one morning a boat come forth from the woods bearing three men dressed to look like devils wrapped in dogs skins white and black their faces besmeared as black as any coals
none	none	 with horns on their heads more than a yard long and as this boat passed the ship one of the men made a long address not looking towards them Then they all three fell flat in the boat when Indians rowed out to meet them and guided them to a landing 
7150-118731-0010	train-other-500	Then many Indians collected in the woods and began a loud talk which they could hear on board the ships and which lasted half an hour
none	none	 Then two of their leaders came towards the shore 
7150-118731-0011	train-other-500	holding their hands upward joined together and meanwhile carrying their hats under their upper garments and showing great reverence Looking upward they sometimes cried Jesus Jesus or Jesus Maria
none	none	 Then the captain asked them whether anything ill had happened and they said in French Nenni est il bon meaning that it was not good Then they said that their god Cudraigny had spoken in Hochelaga Montreal and had sent these three men to show to them that there was so much snow and ice in the country that he who went there would die 
7150-118731-0012	train-other-500	This made the Frenchmen laugh saying in reply that their god Cudraigny was but a fool and a noddy and knew not what he said Tell him said a Frenchman that Christ will defend them from all cold if they will believe in him
7150-118731-0013	train-other-500	The Indians then asked the captain if he had spoken with Jesus He answered No but that his priests had and they had promised fair weather
7150-118731-0014	train-other-500	Hearing this they thanked the captain and told the other Indians in the woods who all came rushing out seeming to be very glad Giving great shouts they began to sing and dance as they had done before They also began to bring to the ships
7150-118731-0015	train-other-500	great stores of fish and of bread made of millet casting it into the French boats so thickly that it seemed to fall from heaven Then the Frenchmen went on shore and the people came clustering about them
7150-118731-0016	train-other-500	bringing children in their arms to be touched as if to hallow them Then the captain in return arranged the women in order and gave them beads made of tin and other trifles and gave knives to the men
7150-118731-0017	train-other-500	All that night the Indians made great fires and danced and sang along the shore
none	none	 But when the Frenchmen had finally reached the mouth of the Ottawa and had begun to ascend it under Vignan s guidance they had reasons to remember the threats of the god Cudraigny 
7150-118731-0018	train-other-500	Ascending the Ottawa in canoes past cataracts boulders and precipices they at last with great labor reached the island of Allumette at a distance of two hundred and twenty five miles
7150-118731-0019	train-other-500	Often it was impossible to carry their canoes past waterfalls because the forests were so dense so that they had to drag the boats by ropes wading among rocks or climbing along precipices
7150-118731-0020	train-other-500	Gradually they left behind them their armor their provisions and clothing keeping only their canoes they lived on fish and wild fowl and were sometimes twenty four hours without food Champlain himself
7150-118731-0021	train-other-500	carried three French arquebuses or short guns three oars his cloak
none	none	 and many smaller articles and was harassed by dense clouds of mosquitoes all the time Vignan Brissac and the rest were almost as heavily loaded 
7150-118731-0022	train-other-500	The tribe of Indians whom they at last reached had chosen the spot as being inaccessible to their enemies and thought that the newcomers had fallen from the clouds
none	none	 When Champlain inquired after the salt sea promised by Vignan 
7150-118731-0023	train-other-500	he learned to his indignation that the whole tale was false
none	none	 Vignan had spent a winter at the very village 
7150-118731-0024	train-other-500	where they were but confessed that he had never gone a league further north The Indians knew of no such sea
7150-118731-0025	train-other-500	and craved permission to torture and kill him for his deceptions they called him loudly a liar and even the children took up the cry and jeered at him They said
7150-118731-0026	train-other-500	Do you not see that he meant to cause your death Give him to us and we promise you that he shall not lie any more
none	none	 Champlain defended him from their attacks 
7150-118731-0027	train-other-500	bore it all philosophically
none	none	 and the young Brissac 
7150-118731-0028	train-other-500	went back to France having given up hope of reaching the salt sea except as Champlain himself coolly said in imagination
7150-118731-0029	train-other-500	The guardians of the saint Lawrence had at least exerted their spell to the extent of saying Thus far and no farther
none	none	 Vignan never admitted that he had invented the story of the Gougou 
7150-118731-0030	train-other-500	and had bribed the Indians who acted the part of devils and perhaps he did not
none	none	 but it is certain that neither the giantess nor the god Cudraigny has ever again been heard from XIX THE ISLAND OF DEMONS Those American travellers who linger with delight among the narrow lanes and picturesque overhanging roofs of Honfleur do not know what a strange tragedy took place on a voyage which began in that quaint old port three centuries and a half ago When in fifteen thirty six the Breton sailor Jacques Cartier returned from his early explorations of the saint Lawrence which he had ascended as high as Hochelaga King Francis I sent for him at the lofty old house known as the House of the Salamander in a narrow street of the quaint town of Lisieux It now seems incredible that the most powerful king in Europe should have dwelt in such a meagre lane yet the house still stands there as a witness although a visitor must now brush away the rough ready made garments and fishermen s overalls which overhang its door Over that stairway nevertheless the troubadours Pierre Ronsard and Clement Marot used to go up and down humming their lays or touching their viols and through that door De Lorge returned in glory after leaping down into the lions den to rescue his lady s glove The house still derives its name from the great carved image of a reptile which stretches down its outer wall from garret to cellar beside the doorway In that house the great king deigned to meet the Breton sailor who had set up along the saint Lawrence a cross bearing the arms of France with the inscription Franciscus Primus Dei gratia Francorum Rex regnat and had followed up the pious act by kidnapping the king Donnacona and carrying him back to France This savage potentate was himself brought to Lisieux to see his French fellow sovereign and the jovial king eagerly convinced decided to send Cartier forth again to explore for other wonders and perhaps bring back other kingly brethren Meanwhile however as it was getting to be an affair of royalty he decided to send also a gentleman of higher grade than a pilot and so selected Jean Francois de la Roche Sieur de Roberval whom he commissioned as lieutenant and governor of Canada and Hochelaga Roberval was a gentleman of credit and renown in Picardy and was sometimes jocosely called by Francis the little king of Vimeu He was commissioned at Fontainebleau and proceeded to superintend the building of ships at saint Malo Marguerite Roberval his fair haired and black eyed niece was to go with him on the voyage with other ladies of high birth and also with the widowed Madame de Noailles her gouvernante Roberval himself remained at saint Malo to superintend the building of the ships and Marguerite and her gouvernante would sit for hours in a beautiful nook by the shipyards where they could overlook the vessels in rapid construction or else watch the wondrous swirl of the tide as it swept in and out leaving the harbor bare at low tide but with eight fathoms of water when the tide was full The designer of the ships often came cap in hand to ask or answer questions one of those frank and manly French fishermen and pilots whom the French novelists describe as un solide gaillard or such as Victor Hugo paints in his Les Travailleurs de la Mer The son of a notary Etienne Gosselin was better educated than most of the young noblemen whom Marguerite knew and only his passion for the sea and for nautical construction had kept him a shipbuilder No wonder that the young Marguerite who had led the sheltered life of the French maiden was attracted by his manly look his open face his merry blue eyes and curly hair There was about her a tinge of romance which made her heart an easier thing to reach for such a lover than for one within her own grade and as the voyage itself was a world of romance a little more or less of the romantic was an easy thing to add Meanwhile Madame de Noailles read her breviary and told her beads and took little naps wholly ignorant of the drama that was beginning its perilous unfolding before her When the Sieur de Roberval returned the shipbuilder became a mere shipbuilder again Three tall ships sailed from Honfleur on August twenty two fifteen forty one and on one of them La Grande Hermine so called to distinguish it from a smaller boat of that name which had previously sailed with Cartier were the Sieur de Roberval his niece and her gouvernante She also had with her a Huguenot nurse who had been with her from a child and cared for her devotedly Roberval naturally took with him for future needs the best shipbuilder of saint Malo Etienne Gosselin The voyage was long and there is reason to think that the Sieur de Roberval was not a good sailor while as to the gouvernante she may have been as helpless as the seasick chaperon of yachting excursions Like them she suffered the most important events to pass unobserved and it was not till too late that she discovered what more censorious old ladies on board had already seen that her young charge lingered too often and too long on the quarter deck when Etienne Gosselin was planning ships for the uncle When she found it out she was roused to just indignation but being after all but a kindly dowager with a heart softened by much reading of the interminable tales of Madame de Scudery she only remonstrated with Marguerite wept over her little romance and threatened to break the sad news to the Sieur de Roberval yet never did so Other ladies were less considerate it all broke suddenly upon the angry uncle the youth was put in irons and threatened with flogging and forbidden to approach the quarter deck again But love laughs at locksmiths Gosselin was relieved of his irons in a day or two because he could not be spared from his work in designing the forthcoming ship and as both he and Marguerite were of a tolerably determined nature they invoked through the old nurse the aid of a Huguenot minister on board who had before sailed with Cartier to take charge of the souls of some Protestant vagabonds on the ship and who was now making a second trip for the same reason That night after dark he joined the lovers in marriage within twenty four hours Roberval had heard of it and had vowed a vengeance quick and sure The next morning under his orders the vessel lay to under the lee of a rocky island then known to the sailors as l Isle des Demons from the fierce winds that raged round it There was no house there no living person no tradition of any only rocks sands and deep forests With dismay the ship s company heard that it was the firm purpose of Roberval to put the offending bride on shore giving her only the old nurse for company and there to leave her with provisions for three months trusting to some other vessel to take the exiled women away within that time The very ladies whose love of scandal had first revealed to him the alleged familiarities now besought him with many tears to abandon the thought of a doom so terrible Vainly Madame de Noailles implored mercy for the young girl from a penalty such as was never imposed in any of Madame de Scudery s romances vainly the Huguenot minister and the Catholic chaplain who had fought steadily on questions of doctrine during the whole voyage now united in appeals for pardon At least they implored him to let the offenders have a man servant or two with them to protect them against wild beasts or buccaneers He utterly refused until at last wearied out his wild nature yielded to one of those sudden impulses which were wont to sweep over it and he exclaimed Is it that they need a man servant then Let this insolent caitiff Gosselin be relieved of his irons and sent on shore Let him be my niece s servant or since a Huguenot marriage is as good as any in the presence of bears and buccaneers let her call the hound her husband if she likes I have done with her and the race from which she came disowns her forever Thus it was done Etienne was released from his chains and sent on shore An arquebus and ammunition were given him and resisting the impulse to send his first shot through the heart of his tyrant he landed and the last glimpse seen of the group as the Grande Hermine sailed away was the figure of Marguerite sobbing on his shoulder and of the unhappy nurse now somewhat plethoric and certainly not the person to be selected as a pioneer sitting upon a rock weeping profusely The ship s sails filled the angry Roberval never looked back on his deserted niece and the night closed down upon the lonely Isle of Demons now newly occupied by three unexpected settlers two of whom at least were happy in each other A few boxes of biscuits a few bottles of wine had been put on shore with them enough to feed them for a few weeks They had brought flint and steel to strike fire and some ammunition The chief penalty of the crime did not lie after all in the cold and the starvation and the wild beasts and the possible visits of pirates it lay in the fact that it was the Island of Demons where they were to be left and in that superstitious age this meant everything that was terrible For the first few nights of their stay they fancied that they heard superhuman voices in every wind that blew every branch that creaked against another branch and they heard at any rate more substantial sounds from the nightly wolves or from the bears which ice floes had floated to that northern isle They watched Roberval sail away he rejoicing as the old legend of Thevet says at having punished them without soiling his hands with their blood ioueux de les auior puniz sans se souiller les mains en leurs sang They built as best they could a hut of boughs and strewed beds of leaves until they had killed wild beasts enough to prepare their skins Their store of hard bread lasted them but a little while but there were fruits around them and there was fresh water near by Yet it was terrible says Thevet s old narrative to hear the frightful sounds which the evil spirits made around them and how they tried to break down their abode and showed themselves in various forms of frightful animals yet at last conquered by the constancy and perseverance of these repentant Christians the tormentors afflicted or disquieted them no more save that often in the night they heard cries so loud that it seemed as if more than five thousand men were assembled together plus de cent mil homes qui fussent ensemble So passed many months of desolation and alas the husband was the first to yield Daily he climbed the rocks to look for vessels each night he descended sadder and sadder he waked while the others slept Feeling that it was he who had brought distress upon the rest he concealed his depression but it soon was past concealing he only redoubled his care and watching as his wife grew the stronger of the two and he faded slowly away and died His wife had nothing to sustain her spirits except the approach of maternity she would live for her child When the child was born and baptized in the name of the Holy Church though without the Church s full ceremonies Marguerite felt the strength of motherhood became a better huntress a better provider A new sorrow came in the sixteenth or seventeenth month of her stay the old nurse died also and not long after the baby followed Marguerite now seemed to herself deserted even by Heaven itself she was alone in that northern island without comradeship her husband child and nurse gone dependent for very food on the rapidly diminishing supply of ammunition Her head swam for months she saw visions almost constantly which only strenuous prayer banished and only the acquired habit of the chase enabled her almost mechanically to secure meat to support life Fortunately those especial sights and sounds of demons which had haunted her imagination during the first days and nights on the island did not recur but the wild beasts gathered round her the more when there was only one gun to alarm them and she once shot three bears in a day one a white bear of which she secured the skin What imagination can depict the terrors of those lonely days and still lonelier nights Most persons left as solitary tenants of an island have dwelt like Alexander Selkirk in regions nearer the tropics where there was at least a softened air a fertile soil and the Southern Cross above their heads but to be solitary in a prolonged winter to be alone with the Northern Lights this offered peculiar terrors To be ice bound to hear the wolves in their long and dreary howl to protect the very graves of her beloved from being dug up to watch the floating icebergs not knowing what new and savage visitor might be borne by them to the island what a complication of terror was this for Marguerite For two years and five months in all she dwelt upon the Isle of Demons the last year wholly alone Then as she stood upon the shore some Breton fishing smacks seeking codfish came in sight Making signals with fire and calling for aid she drew them nearer but she was now dressed in furs only and seemed to them but one of the fancied demons of the island Beating up slowly and watchfully toward the shore they came within hearing of her voice and she told her dreary tale At last they took her in charge and bore her back to France with the bearskins she had prepared and taking refuge in the village of Nautron in a remote province Perigord where she could escape the wrath of Roberval she told her story to Thevet the explorer to the Princess Marguerite of Navarre sister of Francis I and to others Thevet tells it in his Cosmographie and Marguerite of Navarre in her Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles She told Thevet that after the first two months the demons came to her no more until she was left wholly alone then they renewed their visits but not continuously and she felt less fear Thevet also records of her this touching confession that when the time came for her to embark in the Breton ship for home there came over her a strong impulse to refuse the embarkation but rather to die in that solitary place as her husband her child and her servant had already died This profound touch of human nature does more than anything else to confirm the tale as substantially true Certain it is that the lonely island which appeared so long on the old maps as the Isle of Demons l Isola de Demoni appears differently in later ones as the Lady s Island l Isle de la Demoiselle The Princess Marguerite of Navarre who died in fifteen forty nine seems also to have known her namesake at her retreat in Perigord gives some variations from Thevet s story and describes her as having been put on shore with her husband because of frauds which he had practised on Roberval nor does she speak of the nurse or of the child But she gives a similar description of Marguerite s stay on the island after his death and says that although she lived what might seem a bestial life as to her body it was a life wholly angelic as regarded her soul ainsi vivant quant au corps de vie bestiale et quant a l esprit de vie angelicque She had the princess also says a mind cheerful and content in a body emaciated and half dead She was afterwards received with great honor in France according to the princess and was encouraged to establish a school for little children where she taught reading and writing to the daughters of high born families And by this honest industry says the princess she supported herself during the remainder of her life having no other wish than to exhort every one to love and confidence towards God offering them as an example the great pity which he had shown for her XX BIMINI AND THE FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH When Juan Ponce de Leon set forth from Porto Rico March thirteen fifteen twelve to seek the island of Bimini and its Fountain of Youth he was moved by the love of adventure more than by that of juvenility for he was then but about fifty a time when a cavalier of his day thought himself but in his prime He looked indeed with perpetual sorrow as much of it as a Spaniard of those days could feel upon his kinsman Luis Ponce once a renowned warrior but on whom age had already at sixty five laid its hand in earnest There was little in this slowly moving veteran to recall one who had shot through the lists at the tournament and had advanced with his short sword at the bull fight who had ruled his vassals and won the love of high born women It was a vain hope of restored youth which had brought Don Luis from Spain to Porto Rico four years before and when Ponce de Leon had subdued that island his older kinsman was forever beseeching him to carry his flag farther and not stop till he had reached Bimini and sought the Fountain of Youth For what end he said should you stay here longer and lord it over these miserable natives Let us go where we can bathe in those enchanted waters and be young once more I need it and you will need it ere long How know we said his kinsman that there is any such place All know it said Luis Peter Martyr saith that there is in Bimini a continual spring of running water of such marvellous virtue that the water thereof being drunk perhaps with some diet maketh old men young And he adds that an Indian grievously oppressed with old age moved with the fame of that fountain and allured through the love of longer life went to an island near unto the country of Florida to drink of the desired fountain and having well drunk and washed himself for many days with the appointed remedies by them who kept the bath he is reported to have brought home a manly strength and to have used all manly exercises Let us therefore go thither he cried and be like him They set sail with three brigantines and found without difficulty the island of Bimini among the Lucayos or Bahamas islands but when they searched for the Fountain of Youth they were pointed farther westward to Florida where there was said to be a river of the same magic powers called the Jordan Touching at many a fair island green with trees and occupied by a gentle population till then undisturbed it was not strange if nearing the coast of Florida both Juan Ponce de Leon and his more impatient cousin expected to find the Fountain of Youth They came at last to an inlet which led invitingly up among wooded banks and flowery valleys and here the older knight said Let us disembark here and strike inland My heart tells me that here at last will be found the Fountain of Youth Nonsense said Juan our way lies by water Then leave me here with my men said Luis He had brought with him five servants mostly veterans from his own estate in Spain A fierce discussion ended in Luis obtaining his wish and being left for a fortnight of exploration his kinsman promising to come for him again at the mouth of the river saint John The men left on shore were themselves past middle age and the more eager for their quest They climbed a hill and watched the brigantines disappear in the distance then set up a cross which they had brought with them and prayed before it bareheaded Sending the youngest of his men up to the top of a tree Luis learned from him that they were on an island after all and this cheered him much as making it more likely that they should find the Fountain of Youth He saw that the ground was pawed up as if in a cattle range and that there was a path leading to huts Taking this path they met fifty Indian bowmen who whether large or not seemed to them like giants The Spaniards gave them beads and hawk bells and each received in return an arrow as a token of friendship The Indians promised them food in the morning and brought fish roots and pure water and finding them chilly from the coldness of the night carried them in their arms to their homes first making four or five large fires on the way At the houses there were many fires and the Spaniards would have been wholly comfortable had they not thought it just possible that they were to be offered as a sacrifice Still fearing this they left their Indian friends after a few days and traversed the country stopping at every spring or fountain to test its quality Alas they all grew older and more worn in look as time went on and farther from the Fountain of Youth After a time they came upon new tribes of Indians and as they went farther from the coast these people seemed more and more friendly They treated the white men as if come from heaven brought them food made them houses carried every burden for them Some had bows and went upon the hills for deer and brought half a dozen every night for their guests others killed hares and rabbits by arranging themselves in a circle and striking down the game with billets of wood as it ran from one to another through the woods All this game was brought to the visitors to be breathed upon and blessed and when this had to be done for several hundred people it became troublesome The women also brought wild fruit and would eat nothing till the guests had seen and touched it If the visitors seemed offended the natives were terrified and apparently thought that they should die unless they had the favor of these wise and good men Farther on people did not come out into the paths to gather round them as the first had done but stayed meekly in their houses sitting with their faces turned to the wall and with their property heaped in the middle of the room From these people the travellers received many valuable skins and other gifts Wherever there was a fountain the natives readily showed it but apparently knew nothing of any miraculous gift yet they themselves were in such fine physical condition and seemed so young and so active that it was as if they had already bathed in some magic spring They had wonderful endurance of heat and cold and such health that when their bodies were pierced through and through by arrows they would recover rapidly from their wounds These things convinced the Spaniards that even if the Indians would not disclose the source of all their bodily freshness it must at any rate lie somewhere in the neighborhood Yet a little while no doubt and their visitors would reach it It was a strange journey for these gray and careworn men as they passed up the defiles and valleys along the saint John s River beyond the spot where now spreads the city of Jacksonville and even up to the woods and springs about Magnolia and Green Cove Yellow jasmines trailed their festoons above their heads wild roses grew at their feet the air was filled with the aromatic odors of pine or sweet bay the long gray moss hung from the live oak branches birds and butterflies of wonderful hues fluttered around them and strange lizards crossed their paths or looked with dull and blinking eyes from the branches They came at last to one spring which widened into a natural basin and which was so deliciously aromatic that Luis Ponce said on emerging It is enough I have bathed in the Fountain of Youth and henceforth I am young His companions tried it and said the same The Fountain of Youth is found No time must now be lost in proclaiming the great discovery They obtained a boat from the natives who wept at parting with the white strangers whom they had so loved In this boat they proposed to reach the mouth of the saint John meet Juan Ponce de Leon and carry back the news to Spain But one native whose wife and children they had cured and who had grown angry at their refusal to stay longer went down to the water s edge and sending an arrow from his bow transfixed Don Luis so that even his foretaste of the Fountain could not save him and he died ere reaching the mouth of the river If Don Luis ever reached what he sought it was in another world But those who have ever bathed in Green Cove Spring near Magnolia on the saint John s River will be ready to testify that had he but stayed there longer he would have found something to recall his visions of the Fountain of Youth NOTES PREFACE A Full account of the rediscovery of the Canaries in thirteen forty one will be found in Major s Life of Prince Henry of Portugal London eighteen sixty eight p one hundred thirty eight For the statement as to the lingering belief in the Jacquet Island see Winsor s Columbus p one hundred eleven The extract from Cowley is given by Herman Melville in his picturesque paper on The Encantadas Putnam s Magazine III three hundred nineteen In Harris s Voyages seventeen oh two there is a map giving Cowley s Inchanted Isl I seventy eight but there is no explanation of the name The passage quoted by Melville is not to be found in Cowley s Voyage to Magellanica and Polynesia given by Harris in the same volume and must be taken from Cowley s Voyage round the Globe which I have not found in any library I ATLANTIS For the original narrative of Socrates see Plato s Timaeus and Critias in each of which it is given For further information see the chapter on the Geographical Knowledge of the Ancients by W H Tillinghast in Winsor s Narrative and Critical History of America I fifteen He mentions I nineteen note a map printed at Amsterdam in sixteen seventy eight by Kircher which shows Atlantis as a large island midway between Spain and America Ignatius Donnelly s Atlantis the Antediluvian World N Y eighteen eighty two maintains that the evidence for the former existence of such an island is irresistible and his work has been very widely read although it is not highly esteemed by scholars II TALIESSIN The Taliessin legend in its late form cannot be traced back beyond the end of the sixteenth century but the account of the transformation is to be found in the Book of Taliessin a manuscript of the thirteenth century preserved in the Hengwt Collection at Peniarth The Welsh bard himself is supposed to have flourished in the sixth century See Alfred Nutt in The Voyage of Bram London eighteen ninety seven II eighty six The traditions may be found in Lady Charlotte Guest s translation of the Mabinogion twod ed London eighteen seventy seven p four hundred seventy one The poems may be found in the original Welsh in Skene s Four Ancient Books of Wales two vols Edinburgh eighteen sixty eight and he also gives a facsimile of the manuscript III CHILDREN OF LIR The lovely legend of the children of Lir or Lear forms one of those three tales of the old Irish Bards which are known traditionally in Ireland as The Three Sorrows of Story Telling It has been told in verse by Aubrey de Vere The Foray of Queen Meave and Other Legends London eighteen eighty two by John Todhunter Three Irish Bardic Tales London eighteen ninety six and also in prose by various writers among whom are Professor Eugene O Curry whose version with the Gaelic original was published in Atlantis Nos vii and viii Gerald Griffin in The Tales of a Jury Room and doctor Patrick Weston Joyce in Ancient Celtic Romances London eighteen seventy nine The oldest manuscript copy of the tale in Gaelic is one in the British Museum made in seventeen eighteen but there are more modern ones in different English and Irish libraries and the legend itself is of much older origin Professor O Curry the highest authority places its date before the year one thousand Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Irish History p three hundred nineteen IV USHEEN In the original legend Oisin or Usheen is supposed to have told his tale to saint Patrick on his arrival in Ireland but as the ancient Feni were idolaters the hero bears but little goodwill to the saint The Celtic text of a late form of the legend seventeen forty nine with a version by Brian O Looney will be found in the transactions of the Ossianic Society for eighteen fifty six Vol IV p two hundred twenty seven and still more modern and less literal renderings in P W Joyce s Ancient Celtic Romances London eighteen seventy nine p three hundred eighty five and in W B Yeats s Wanderings of Oisin and Other Poems London eighteen eighty nine p one The last is in verse and is much the best saint Patrick who takes part in it regards Niam as a demon thing See also the essays entitled L Elysee Transatlantique by Eugene Beauvois in the Revue de L Histoire des Religions VII two hundred seventy three Paris eighteen eighty five and L Eden Occidental same VII six hundred seventy three As to Oisin or Usheen s identity with Ossian see O Curry s Lectures on the Manuscript Materials for Ancient Irish History Dublin eighteen sixty one pp two hundred nine three hundred John Rhys s Hibbert Lectures London eighteen eighty eight p five hundred fifty one The latter thinks the hero identical with Taliessin as well as with Ossian and says that the word Ossin means a little fawn from os cervus See also O Curry p three hundred four O Looney represents that it was a stone which Usheen threw to show his strength and Joyce follows this view but another writer in the same volume of the Ossianic Society transactions p two hundred thirty three makes it a bag of sand and Yeats follows this version It is also to be added that the latter in later editions changes the spelling of his hero s name from Oisin to Usheen V BRAN The story of Bran and his sister Branwen may be found most fully given in Lady Charlotte Guest s translation of the Mabinogion ed eighteen seventy seven pp three hundred sixty nine three hundred eighty four She considers Harlech whence Bran came to be a locality on the Welsh seacoast still known by that name and called also Branwen s Tower But Rhys a much higher authority thinks that Bran came really from the region of Hades and therefore from a distant island Arthurian Legend p two hundred fifty Hibbert Lectures pp ninety four two hundred sixty nine The name of the Blessed came from the legend of Bran s having introduced Christianity into Ireland as stated in one of the Welsh Triads He was the father of Caractacus celebrated for his resistance to the Roman conquest and carried a prisoner to Rome Another triad speaks of King Arthur as having dug up Bran s head for the reason that he wished to hold England by his own strength whence followed many disasters Guest p three hundred eighty seven There were many Welsh legends in regard to Branwen or Bronwen White Bosom and what is supposed to be her grave with an urn containing her ashes may still be seen at a place called Ynys Bronwen or the islet of Bronwen in Anglesea It was discovered and visited in eighteen thirteen Guest p three hundred eighty nine The White Mount in which Bran s head was deposited is supposed to have been the Tower of London described by a Welsh poet of the twelfth century as The White Eminence of London a place of splendid fame Guest p three hundred ninety two VI THE CASTLE OF THE ACTIVE DOOR This legend is mainly taken from different parts of Lady Charlotte Guest s translation of the Mabinogion with some additions and modifications from Rhys s Hibbert Lectures and The Arthurian Legend VIII MERLIN In later years Merlin was known mainly by a series of remarkable prophecies which were attributed to him and were often said to be fulfilled by actual events in history Thus one of the many places where Merlin s grave was said to be was Drummelzion in Tweeddale Scotland On the east side of the churchyard a brook called the Pansayl falls into the Tweed and there was this prophecy as to their union When Tweed and Pansayl join at Merlin s grave Scotland and England shall one monarch have Sir Walter Scott tells us in his Border Minstrelsy that on the day of the coronation of James VI of Scotland the Tweed accordingly overflowed and joined the Pansayl at the prophet s grave It was also claimed by one of the witnesses at the trial of Jeanne d Arc that there was a prediction by Merlin that France would be saved by a peasant girl from Lorraine These prophesies have been often reprinted and have been translated into different languages and there was published in London in sixteen forty one The Life of Merlin surnamed Ambrosius His Prophesies and Predictions interpreted and their Truth made Good by our English Annals Another book was also published in London in sixteen eighty three called Merlin revived in a Discourse of Prophesies Predictions and their Remarkable Accomplishments VIII LANCELOT The main sources of information concerning Lancelot are the Morte d Arthur Newell s King Arthur and the Table Round and the publications of the Early English Text Society See also Rhys s Arthurian Legend pp one hundred twenty seven one hundred forty seven et cetera IX THE HALF MAN The symbolical legend on which this tale is founded will be found in Lady Charlotte Guest s translation of the Mabinogion London eighteen seventy seven II p three hundred forty four It is an almost unique instance in the imaginative literature of that period of a direct and avowed allegory There is often allegory but it is usually contributed by modern interpreters and would sometimes greatly astound the original fabulists X ARTHUR The earliest mention of the island of Avalon or Avilion in connection with the death of Arthur is a slight one by the old English chronicler Geoffrey of Monmouth Book XI c two and the event is attributed by him to the year five hundred forty two Wace s French romance was an enlargement of Geoffrey and the narrative of Layamon at the close of the twelfth century an explanation of that of Wace Layamon s account of the actual death of Arthur as quoted in the text is to be found in the translation a very literal one by Madden Madden s Layamon s Brut III pp one hundred forty one hundred forty six The earliest description of the island itself is by an anonymous author known as Pseudo Gildas supposed to be a thirteenth century Breton writer Meyer s Voyage of Bram I p two hundred thirty seven and quoted by Archbishop Usher in his British Ecclesiastical Antiquities sixteen thirty seven p two hundred seventy three who thus describes it in Latin hexameters Cingitur oceano memorabilis insula nullis Desolata bonis non fur nec praedo nec hostis Insidiatur ibi nec vis nec bruma nec aestas Immoderata furit Pax et concordia pubes Ver manent aeternum Nec flos nec lilia desunt Nec rosa nec violae flores et poma sub una Fronde gerit pomus Habitant sine labe cruoris Semper ibi juvenes cum virgine nulla

however allows Maelduin sixty comrades instead of seventeen which is Nutt s version There are copies of the original narrative in the Erse language at the British Museum and in the library of Trinity College Dublin The voyage which may have had some reality at its foundation is supposed to have taken place about the year seven hundred A D It belongs to the class known as Imrama or sea expeditions Another of these is the voyage of saint Brandan and another is that of the sons of O Corra A poetical translation of this last has been made by T D Sullivan of Dublin and published in his volume of poems Joyce p xiii All these voyages illustrated the wider and wider space assigned on the Atlantic ocean to the enchanted islands until they were finally identified in some cases with the continent which Columbus found XII saint BRANDAN THE legend of saint Brandan which was very well known in the Middle Ages was probably first written in Latin prose near the end of the eleventh century and is preserved in manuscript in many English libraries An English metrical version written probably about the beginning of the fourteenth century is printed under the editorship of Thomas Wright in the publications of the Percy Society London eighteen forty four XIV and it is followed in the same volume by an English prose version of fifteen twenty seven A partial narrative in Latin prose with an English version may be found in W J Rees s Lives of the Cambro British Saints Llandovery eighteen fifty three pp two hundred fifty one five hundred seventy five The account of Brandan in the Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandists may be found under May sixteen the work being arranged under saints days This account excludes the more legendary elements The best sketch of the supposed island appears in the Nouvelles Annales des Voyages for eighteen forty five p two hundred ninety three by D Avezac Professor O Curry places the date of the alleged voyage or voyages at about the year five hundred sixty Lectures on the Manuscript Materials for Irish History p two hundred eighty nine Good accounts of the life in the great monasteries of Brandan s period may be found in Digby s Mores Catholici or Ages of Faith in Montalembert s Monks of the West translation in Villemarque s La Legende Celtique et la Poesie des Cloistres en Irlande en Cambrie et en Bretagne Paris eighteen sixty four The poem on saint Brandan stanzas from which are quoted in the text is by Denis Florence McCarthy and may be found in the Dublin University Magazine XXXI p eighty nine and there is another poem on the subject a very foolish burlesque in the same magazine LXXXIX p four hundred seventy one Matthew Arnold s poem with the same title appeared in Fraser s Magazine LXII p one hundred thirty three and may be found in the author s collected works in the form quoted below The legends of saint Brandan it will be observed resemble so much the tales of Sindbad the Sailor and others in the Arabian Nights which have also the island whale the singing birds and other features that it is impossible to doubt that some features of tradition were held in common with the Arabs of Spain In later years the twelfth century a geographer named Honore d Autun declared in his Image of the World that there was in the ocean a certain island agreeable and fertile beyond all others now unknown to men once discovered by chance and then lost again and that this island was the one which Brandan had visited In several early maps before the time of Columbus the Madeira Islands appear as The Fortunate Islands of saint Brandan and on the famous globe of Martin Behaim made in the very year when Columbus sailed there is a large island much farther west than Madeira and near the equator with an inscription saying that in the year five hundred sixty five saint Brandan arrived at this island and saw many wondrous things returning to his own land afterwards Columbus heard this island mentioned at Ferro where men declared that they had seen it in the distance Later the chart of Ortelius in the sixteenth century carried it to the neighborhood of Ireland then it was carried south again and was supposed all the time to change its place through enchantment and when Emanuel of Portugal in fifteen nineteen renounced all claim to it he described it as The Hidden Island In fifteen seventy a Portuguese expedition was sent which claimed actually to have touched the mysterious island indeed to have found there the vast impression of a human foot doubtless of the baptized giant Mildus and also a cross nailed to a tree and three stones laid in a triangle for cooking food Departing hastily from the island they left two sailors behind but could never find the place again Again and again expeditions were sent out in search of saint Brandan s island usually from the Canaries one in sixteen oh four by Acosta one in seventeen twenty one by Dominguez and several sketches of the island as seen from a distance were published in seventeen fifty nine by a Franciscan priest in the Canary Islands named Viere y Clarijo including one made by himself on May three seventeen fifty nine about six A M in presence of more than forty witnesses All these sketches depict the island as having its chief length from north to south and formed of two unequal hills the highest of these being at the north they having between them a depression covered with trees The fact that this resembles the general form of Palma one of the Canary Islands has led to the belief that it may have been an ocean mirage reproducing the image of that island just as the legends themselves reproduce here and there the traditions of the Arabian Nights In a map drawn by the Florentine physician Toscanelli which was sent by him to Columbus in fourteen seventy four to give his impression of the Asiatic coast lying as he supposed across the Atlantic there appears the island of saint Brandan It is as large as all the Azores or Canary Islands or Cape de Verde Islands put together its southern tip just touches the equator and it lies about half way between the Cape de Verde Islands and Zipangu or Japan which was then believed to lie on the other side of the Atlantic mister Winsor also tells us that the apparition of this island sometimes came to sailors eyes as late as the last century Winsor s Columbus one hundred twelve He also gives a reproduction of Toscanelli s map now lost as far as can be inferred from descriptions Winsor p one hundred ten The following is Matthew Arnold s poem SAINT BRANDAN Saint Brandan sails the northern main The brotherhoods of saints are glad He greets them once he sails again So late such storms the Saint is mad He heard across the howling seas Chime convent bells on wintry nights He saw on spray swept Hebrides Twinkle the monastery lights But north still north Saint Brandan steer d And now no bells no convents more The hurtling Polar lights are near d The sea without a human shore At last it was the Christmas night Stars shone after a day of storm He sees float past an iceberg white And on it Christ a living form That furtive mien that scowling eye Of hair that red and tufted fell It is oh where shall Brandan fly The traitor Judas out of hell Palsied with terror Brandan sate The moon was bright the iceberg near He hears a voice sigh humbly Wait By high permission I am here One moment wait thou holy man On earth my crime my death they knew My name is under all men s ban Ah tell them of my respite too Tell them one blessed Christmas night It was the first after I came Breathing self murder frenzy spite To rue my guilt in endless flame I felt as I in torment lay Mid the souls plagued by heavenly power An angel touch my arm and say Go hence and cool thyself an hour Ah whence this mercy Lord I said The Leper recollect said he Who ask d the passers by for aid In Joppa and thy charity Then I remember d how I went In Joppa through the public street One morn when the sirocco spent Its storm of dust with burning heat And in the street a leper sate Shivering with fever naked old Sand raked his sores from heel to pate The hot wind fever d him five fold He gazed upon me as I pass d And murmur d Help me or I die To the poor wretch my cloak I cast Saw him look eased and hurried by Oh Brandan think what grace divine What blessing must full goodness shower When fragment of it small like mine Hath such inestimable power Well fed well clothed well friended I Did that chance act of good that one Then went my way to kill and lie Forgot my good as soon as done That germ of kindness in the womb Of mercy caught did not expire Outlives my guilt outlives my doom And friends me in this pit of fire Once every year when carols wake On earth the Christmas night s repose Arising from the sinner s lake I journey to these healing snows I stanch with ice my burning breast With silence balm my whirling brain O Brandan to this hour of rest That Joppan leper s ease was pain Tears started to Saint Brandan s eyes He bow d his head he breathed a prayer Then look d and lo the frosty skies The iceberg and no Judas there The island of saint Brandan s was sometimes supposed to lie in the Northern Atlantic sometimes farther south It often appears as the Fortunate Isle or Islands Insulae Fortunatae or Beatae On some early maps thirteen oh six to fourteen seventy one there is an inlet on the western coast of Ireland called Lacus Fortunatus which is filled with Fortunate Islands to the number of three hundred fifty eight Humboldt Examen II p one hundred fifty nine and in one map of fourteen seventy one both these and the supposed saint Brandan s group appear in different parts of the ocean under the same name When the Canary Islands were discovered they were supposed to be identical with saint Brandan s but the latter was afterwards supposed to lie southeast of them After the discovery of the Azores various expeditions were sent to search for saint Brandan s until about seventeen twenty one It was last reported as seen in seventeen fifty nine A full bibliography will be found in Winsor s Narrative and Critical History I p forty eight and also in Humboldt s Examen II p one hundred sixty three and early maps containing saint Brandan s will be found in Winsor I pp fifty four fifty eight The first of these is Pizigani s thirteen eighty seven containing Ysolae dictae Fortunatae and the other that of Ortelius fifteen eighty seven containing S Brandain XIII HY BRASAIL The people of Aran with characteristic enthusiasm fancy that at certain periods they see Hy Brasail elevated far to the west in their watery horizon This has been the universal tradition of the ancient Irish who supposed that a great part of Ireland had been swallowed by the sea and that the sunken part often rose and was seen hanging in the horizon such was the popular notion The Hy Brasail of the Irish is evidently a part of the Atlantis of Plato who in his Timaeus says that that island was totally swallowed up by a prodigious earthquake O Flaherty s Discourse on the History and Antiquities of the Southern Islands of Aran lying off the West Coast of Ireland eighteen twenty four p one hundred thirty nine The name appeared first thirteen fifty one on the chart called the Medicean Portulana applied to an island off the Azores In Pizigani s map thirteen sixty seven there appear three islands of this name two off the Azores and one off Ireland From this time the name appears constantly in maps and in fourteen eighty a man named John Jay went out to discover the island on July fourteen and returned unsuccessful on September eighteen He called it Barsyle or Brasylle and Pedro d Ayalo the Spanish Ambassador says that such voyages were made for seven years according to the fancies of the Genoese meaning Sebastian Cabot Humboldt thinks that the wood called Brazil wood was supposed to have come from it as it was known before the South American Brazil was discovered A manuscript history of Ireland written about sixteen thirty six in the Library of the Royal Irish Academy says that Hy Brasail was discovered by a Captain Rich who saw its harbor but could never reach it It is mentioned by Jeremy Taylor Dissuasives from Popery sixteen sixty seven and the present narrative is founded partly on an imaginary one printed in a pamphlet in London sixteen seventy five and reprinted in Hardiman s Irish Minstrelsy eighteen thirty one II p three hundred sixty nine The French Geographer Royal M Tassin thinks that the island may have been identical with Porcupine Bank once above water In Jeffrey s atlas seventeen seventy six it appears as the imaginary island of O Brasil Brazil Rock appears on a chart of Purdy eighteen thirty four Humboldt s Examen Critique II p one hundred sixty three Two rocks always associated with it Mayda and Green Rock appear on an atlas issued in eighteen sixty six See bibliography in Winsor s Narrative and Critical History I p forty nine where there are a number of maps depicting it I pp fifty four fifty seven The name of the island is derived by Celtic scholars from breas large and i island or according to O Brien s Irish Dictionary its other form of O Brasile means a large imaginary island Hardiman s Irish Minstrelsy I p three hundred sixty nine There are several families named Brazil in County Waterford Ireland Transactions of the Ossianic Society Dublin eighteen fifty four I p eighty one The following poem about the island by Gerald Griffin will be found in Sparling s Irish Minstrelsy eighteen eighty eight p four hundred twenty seven HY BRASAIL THE ISLE OF THE BLEST On the ocean that hollows the rocks where ye dwell A shadowy land has appeared as they tell Men thought it a region of sunshine and rest And they called it Hy Brasail the isle of the blest From year unto year on the ocean s blue rim The beautiful spectre showed lovely and dim The golden clouds curtained the deep where it lay And it looked like an Eden away far away A peasant who heard of the wonderful tale In the breeze of the Orient loosened his sail From Ara the holy he turned to the west For though Ara was holy Hy Brasail was blest He heard not the voices that called from the shore He heard not the rising wind s menacing roar Home kindred and safety he left on that day And he sped to Hy Brasail away far away Morn rose on the deep and that shadowy isle O er the faint rim of distance reflected its smile Noon burned on the wave and that shadowy shore Seemed lovelily distant and faint as before Lone evening came down on the wanderer s track And to Ara again he looked timidly back O far on the verge of the ocean it lay Yet the isle of the blest was away far away Rash dreamer return O ye winds of the main Bear him back to his own peaceful Ara again Rash fool for a vision of fanciful bliss To barter thy calm life of labor and peace The warning of reason was spoken in vain He never revisited Ara again Night fell on the deep amidst tempest and spray And he died on the waters away far away XIV ISLAND OF SATAN S HAND The early part of this narrative is founded on Professor O Curry s Lectures on the manuscript materials of Irish history it being another of those Imrama or narratives of ocean expeditions to which the tale of saint Brandan belongs The original narrative lands the three brothers ultimately in Spain and it is a curious fact that most of what we know of the island of Satanaxio or Satanajio which remained so long on the maps is taken from an Italian narrative of three other brothers cited by Formaleoni Il Pellegrinaccio di tre giovanni by Christoforo Armeno Gaffarel Les Iles Fantastiques p ninety one The coincidence is so peculiar that it offered an irresistible temptation to link the two trios of brothers into one narrative and let the original voyagers do the work of exploration The explanation given by Gaffarel to the tale is the same that I have suggested as possible He says in Iles Fantastiques de l Atlantaque p twelve S il nous etait permis d aventurer une hypothese nous croirions voluntiers que les navigateurs de l epoque rencontrerent en s aventurant dans l Atlantique quelques uns de ces gigantesques icebergs ou montagnes de glace arraches aux banquises du pole nord et entraines au sud par les courants dont la rencontre assez frequente est meme aujourd hui tellement redoutee par les capitaines Ces icebergs quand ils se heurtent contre un navire le coulent a pic et comme ils arrivent a l improviste escortes par d epais brouillards ils paraissent reellement sortir du sein des flots comme sortait la main de Satan pour precipiter au fond de l abime matelots et navires As to the name itself there has been much discussion On the map of Bianco fourteen thirty six reproduced in Winsor I p fifty four the name Ya de Lamansatanaxio distinctly appears and this was translated by both Formaleoni and Humboldt as meaning the Island of the Hand of Satan D Avezac was the first to suggest that the reference was to two separate islands the one named De la Man or Danman and the other Satanaxio He further suggests followed by Gaffarel that the name of the island may originally have been San Atanagio thus making its baptism a tribute to saint Athanasius instead of to Satan This would certainly have been a curious transformation and almost as unexpected in its way as the original conversion of the sinful brothers from outlaws to missionaries XV ANTILLIA The name Antillia appears first but not very clearly on the Pizigani map of thirteen sixty seven then clearly on a map of fourteen twenty four preserved at Weimar on that of Bianco in fourteen thirty six and on the globe of Beheim in fourteen ninety two which adds in an inscription the story of the Seven Bishops On some maps of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there appears near it a smaller island under the name of Sette Cidade or Sete Ciudades which is properly another name for the same island Toscanelli in his famous letter to Columbus recommended Antillia as a good way station for his voyage to India The island is said by tradition to have been re discovered by a Portuguese sailor in fourteen forty seven Tradition says that this sailor went hastily to the court of Portugal to announce the discovery but was blamed for not having remained longer and so fled It was supposed to be a large rectangular island extending from north to south lying in the mid Atlantic about lat thirty five N An ample bibliography will be found in Winsor s Narrative and Critical History I p forty eight with maps containing Antillia I pp fifty four Pizigani s fifty six fifty eight After the discovery of America Peter Martyr states in fourteen ninety three that Hispaniola and the adjacent islands were Antillae insulae meaning that they were identical with the group surrounding the fabled Antillia Winsor s Narrative and Critical History I p forty nine and Schoner in the dedicatory letter of his globe of fifteen twenty three says that the king of Castile through Columbus has discovered Antiglias Hispaniam Cubam quoque It was thus that the name Antilles came to be applied to the islands discovered by Columbus just as the name Brazil was transferred from an imaginary island to the new continent and the name Seven Cities was applied to the pueblos of New Mexico by those who discovered them See J H Simpson Coronado s March in Search of the Seven Cities of Cibola Smithsonian Institution eighteen sixty nine pp two hundred nine three hundred forty The sailor who re discovered them said that the chief desire of the people was to know whether the Moors still held Spain Gaffarel Iles Fantastiques p three In a copy of Ptolemy addressed to Pope Urban VI about thirteen eighty before the alleged visit of the Portuguese it was stated of the people at Antillia that they lived in a Christian manner and were most prosperous Hie populus christianissime vivit omnibus divitiis seculi hujus plenus D Avezac Nouvelles Annales des voyages eighteen forty five II p fifty five It was afterwards held by some that the island of Antillia was identical with saint Michael in the Azores where a certain cluster of stone huts still bears the name of Seven Cities and the same name is associated with a small lake by which they stand Humboldt s Examen Critique Paris eighteen thirty seven II p two hundred three Gaffarel Iles Fantastiques p three XVI HARALD THE VIKING The tales of the Norse explorations of America are now accessible in many forms the most convenient of these being in the edition of E L Slafter published by the Prince Society As to the habits of the Vikings the most accessible authorities are The Age of the Vikings by Du Chaillu and The Sea Kings of Norway by Laing The writings of the late Professor E N Horsford are well known but his opinions are not yet generally accepted by students His last work Leif s House in Vineland with his daughter s supplementary essay on Graves of the Northmen is probably the most interesting of the series Boston eighteen ninety three In Longfellow s Saga of King Olaf II included in Tales of a Wayside Inn there is a description of the athletic sports practised by the Vikings which are moreover described with the greatest minuteness by Du Chaillu XVII NORUMBEGA The narrative of Champlain s effort to find Norumbega in sixteen thirty two may be found in Otis s Voyages of Champlain II p thirty eight and there is another version in the Magazine of American History I p three hundred twenty one The whole legend of the city is well analyzed in the same magazine I p fourteen by doctor De Costa under the title The Lost City of New England In another volume he recurs to the subject IX p one hundred sixty eight and gives IX p two hundred a printed copy of David Ingram s narrative from the original in the Bodleian Library He also discusses the subject in Winsor s Narrative and Critical History IV p seventy seven et cetera where he points out that the insular character of the Norumbega region is not purely imaginary but is based on the fact that the Penobscot region affords a continued watercourse to the saint Lawrence which was travelled by the Maine Indians Ramusio s map of fifteen fifty nine represents Nurumbega as a large island well defined Winsor IV p ninety one and so does that of Ruscelli Winsor IV p ninety two the latter spelling it Nurumberg Some geographers supposed it to extend as far as Florida The name was also given to a river probably the Penobscot and to a cape The following is Longfellow s poem on the voyage of Sir Humphrey Gilbert SIR HUMPHREY GILBERT Southward with fleet of ice Sailed the corsair Death Wild and fast blew the blast And the east wind was his breath His lordly ships of ice Glisten in the sun On each side like pennons wide Flashing crystal streamlets run His sails of white sea mist Dripped with silver rain But where he passed there were cast Leaden shadows o er the main Eastward from Campobello Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed Three days or more seaward he bore Then alas the land wind failed Alas the land wind failed And ice cold grew the night And nevermore on sea or shore Should Sir Humphrey see the light He sat upon the deck The Book was in his hand Do not fear Heaven is as near He said by water as by land In the first watch of the night Without a signal s sound Out of the sea mysteriously The fleet of Death rose all around The moon and the evening star Were hanging in the shrouds Every mast as it passed Seemed to rake the passing clouds They grappled with their prize At midnight black and cold As of a rock was the shock Heavily the ground swell rolled Southward through day and dark They drift in close embrace With mist and rain o er the open main Yet there seems no change of place Southward forever southward They drift through dark and day And like a dream in the Gulf Stream Sinking vanish all away XVIII GUARDIANS OF THE saint LAWRENCE For authorities for this tale see Voyages of Samuel de Champlain translated by Charles Pomeroy Otis Ph D with memoir by the reverend E F Slafter A M Boston eighteen eighty I pp one hundred sixteen two hundred eighty nine II p fifty two The incident of the disguised Indians occurred however to the earlier explorer Jacques Cartier See my Larger History of the United States p one hundred twelve XIX ISLAND OF DEMONS The tale of the Isle of Demons is founded on a story told first by Marguerite of Navarre in her Heptameron LXVII Nouvelle and then with much variation and amplification by the very untrustworthy traveller Thevet in his Cosmographie fifteen seventy one Livre XXIII c vi The only copy of the latter work known to me is in the Carter Brown Library at Providence R I and the passage has been transcribed for me through the kindness of A E Winship esquire librarian who has also sent me a photograph of a woodcut representing the lonely woman shooting at a bear A briefer abstract of the story is in Winsor s Narrative and Critical History IV p sixty six note but it states perhaps erroneously that Thevet knew Marguerite only through the Princess of Navarre whereas that author claims though his claim is never worth much that he had the story from the poor woman herself La pauvre femme estant arriuvee en France et venue en la ville de Nautron pays de Perigort lors que i y estois me feit le discours de toutes ses fortunes passees The Island of Demons appears on many old maps which may be found engraved in Winsor IV pp ninety one ninety two ninety three one hundred three hundred seventy three et cetera also as Isla de demonios in Sebastian Cabot s map fifteen forty four reprinted in doctor S E Dawson s valuable Voyages of the Cabots in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for eighteen ninety seven He also gives Ruysch s map fifteen oh eight in which a cluster of islands appears in the same place marked Insulae daemonum Harrisse in his Notes sur la Nouvelle France p two hundred seventy eight describes the three sufferers as having been abandoned by Roberval a trente six lieues des cotes de Canada dans une isle deserte qui fut depuis designee sous le nom de l Isle de la Demoiselle pres de l embouchure de la Riviere saint Paul ou des Saumons I have not however been able to identify this island Parkman also says Pioneers of France p two hundred five that Roberval s pilot in his routier or logbook speaks often of Les Isles de la Demoiselle evidently referring to Marguerite The brief account by the Princess of Navarre follows LXVII NOUVELLE Une pauvre femme pour sauver la vie de son mary hasarda la sienne et ne l abandonna jusqu a la mort C est que faisant le diet Robertval un voiage sur la mer duquel il estoit chef par le commandement du Roy son maistre en l isle de Canadas auquel lieu avoit delibere si l air du pais euste este commode de demourer et faire villes et chasteaulx en quoy il fit tel commencement que chacun peut scavoir Et pour habituer le pays de Chrestiens mena avecq luy de toutes sortes d artisans entre lesquelz y avoit un homme qui fut si malheureux qu il trahit son maistre et le mist en dangier d estre prins des gens du pays Mais Dieu voulut que son entreprinse fut si tost congneue qu elle ne peut nuyre au cappitaine Robertval lequel feit prendre ce meschant traistre le voulant pugnir comme il l avoit merite ce qui eust este faict sans sa femme qui avoit suivy son mary par les perilz de la mer et ne le voulut abandonner a la mort mais avecq force larmes feit tant avecq le cappitaine et toute la compaignye que tant pour la pitie d icelle que pour le service qu elle leur avoit faict luy accorda sa requeste qui fut telle que le mary et la femme furent laissez en une petite isle sur la mer ou il n habitoit que bestes saulvaiges et leur fut permis de porter avecq eulx ce dont ilz avoient necessite Les pauvres gens se trouvans tous seulz en la compaignye des bestes saulvaiges et cruelles n eurent recours que a Dieu seul qui avoit este toujours le ferme espoir de ceste pauvre femme Et comme celle qui avoit toute consolation en Dieu porta pour sa saulve garde nourriture et consolation le Nouveau Testament lequel elle lisoit incessamment Et au demourant avecq son mary mettoit peine d accoustrer un petit logis le mieulx qui l leur estoit possible et quand les lyons et aultres bestes en aprochoient pour les devorer le mary avecq sa harquebuze et elle avecq les pierres se defendoient si bien que non suellement les bestes ne les osoient approcher mais bien souvent en tuerent de tres bonnes a manger ainsy avecq telles chairs et les herbes du pais vesquirent quelque temps quand le pain leur fut failly A la longue le mary ne peut porter telle nourriture et a cause des eaues qu ilz buvoient devint si enfle que en peu de temps il mourut n aiant service ne consolation que sa femme laquelle le servoit de medecin et de confesseur en sorte qu il passa joieusement de ce desert en la celeste patrie Et la pauvre femme demouree seulle l enterra le plus profond en terre qu il fut possible si est ce que les bestes en eurent incontinent le sentyment qui vindrent pour manger la charogne Mais la pauvre femme en sa petite maisonnette de coups de harquebuze defendoit que la chair de son mary n eust tel sepulchre Ainsy vivant quant au corps de vie bestiale et quant a l esperit de vie angelicque passoit son temps en lectures contemplations prieres et oraisons ayant un esperit joieux et content dedans un corps emmaigry et demy mort Mais Celluy qui n abandonne jamais les siens et qui au desespoir des autres monstre sa puissance ne permist que la vertu qu il avoit myse en ceste femme fust ignoree des hommes mais voulut qu elle fust congneue a sa gloire et fiet que au bout de quelque temps un des navires de ceste armee passant devant ceste isle les gens qui estoient dedans adviserent quelque fumee qui leur feit souvenir de ceulx qui y avoient este laissez et delibererent d aller veoir ce que Dieu en avoit faict La pauvre femme voiant approcher el navire se tira au bort de la mer auquel lieu la trouverent a leur arrivee Et apres en avoir rendu louange a Dieu les mena en sa pauvre maisonnette et leur monstra de quoy elle vivoit durant sa demeure ce que leur eust este incroiable sans la congnoissance qu ilz avoient que Dieu est puissant de nourrir en un desert ses serviteurs comme au plus grandz festins du monde Et ne pouvant demeurer en tel lieu emmenerent la pauvre femme avecq eulx droict a la Rochelle ou apres un navigage ilz arriverent Et quand ilz eurent faict entendre aux habitans la fidelite et perseverance de ceste femme elle fut receue a grand honneur de toutes les Dames qui voluntiers luy baillerent leurs filles pour aprendre a lire et a escripre Et a cest honneste mestier la gaigna le surplus de sa vie n aiant autre desir que d exhorter un chaucun a l amour et confiance de Nostre Seigneur se proposant pour exemple la grande misericorde dont il avoit use envers elle XX BIMINI Parkman says expressly that Ponce de Leon found the Island of Bimini but it is generally mentioned as having been imaginary and is not clearly identified among the three thousand islands and rocks of the Bahamas Peter Martyr placed the Fountain of Youth in Florida which he may have easily supposed to be an island
