SWANSTON EDITION So much has been written on R L Stevenson as a boy a man and a man of letters so much has been written both by himself and others that I can hope to add nothing essential to the world s knowledge of his character and appreciation of his genius What is essential has been said once for all by Sir Sidney Colvin in Notes and Introductions to R L S s Letters to His Family and Friends I can but contribute the personal views of one who knew loved and esteemed his junior that is already a classic but who never was of the inner circle of his intimates We shared however a common appreciation of his genius for he was not so dull as to suppose or so absurd as to pretend to suppose that much of his work was not excellent His tale Thrawn Janet is good he says in a letter with less vigour than but with as much truth as Thackeray exclaiming that s genius when he describes Becky s admiration of Rawdon s treatment of Lord Steyne in the affray in Curzon Street About the work of other men and novelists or poets we were almost invariably of the same mind we were of one mind about the great Charles Gordon He was filled too with enthusiasm for Joan of Arc says his biographer a devotion and also a cool headed admiration which he never lost In a letter he quotes Byron as having said that Jeanne was a fanatical strumpet and he cries shame on the noble poet He projected an essay on the Blessed Maid which is not in the veniable part of things lost Thus we were so much of the same sentiments in so many ways that I can hope to speak with sympathy if not always with complete understanding of Stevenson Like a true Scot he was interested in his ancestry his heredity regarding Robert Fergusson the young Scottish poet who died so young in an asylum as his spiritual forefather and hoping to attach himself to a branch of the Royal Clan Alpine the MacGregors as the root of the Stevensons Of Fergusson he had in early youth the waywardness the liking for taverns and tavern talk the half rueful appreciation of the old closes and wynds of Old Edinburgh a touch of the recklessness and more than all the pictorial power which in Fergusson Burns so magnanimously admired But genealogical research shows that Stevenson drew nothing from the dispossessed MacGregors a clan greatly wronged from Robert Bruce s day and greatly given to wronging others Alan Breck did not like the Gregara apart from their courage and in Alan s day they were not consistent walkers Stevenson as far as one can learn had no Celtic blood none at least of traceable infusion he was more purely Lowland than Sir Walter Scott His paternal line could be traced back to a West Country Stevenson of sixteen seventy five probably a tenant farmer who was contemporary with the Whig rising at Bothwell Bridge with the murder of Archbishop Sharp with Claverhouse and Sir George Mackenzie called the bluidy Advocate An earnest student of mister Wodrow s History of the Sufferings Louis did not find James Stevenson in Nether Carsewell among the many martyrs who live in the Libre d Or of the Remnant But he had a Covenanting childhood his father mister Thomas Stevenson was loyal to the positions of John Knox the theological positions and brought up in these Louis had a taste when the tenets of Calvin ceased to convince his reason of what non Covenanters endured at the hands of the godly in their day of power Every little Presbyterian fifty years ago was compelled to be familiar with the Genevan creed as expressed in The Shorter Catechism but most little Presbyterians regarded that document as a necessary but unintelligible evil the sorrow that haunted the Sabbath I knew it by rote Effectual Calling and all but did not perceive that it possessed either meaning or actuality Nobody was so unkind as to interpret the significance of the questions and answers but somebody did interpret them for Stevenson or his early genius enabled him to discover what it is all about as he told me once and it seems that the tendency of the theology is terribly depressing A happier though more or less theological influence on his childhood he found in the adventures and sufferings of the Covenanters It is curious and shows how much early education can do that he never was a little Royalist always his heart like Lockhart s which is no less strange was with the true blue Remnant I can remember no proof that he was fascinated by the greatness of Montrose As is well known at about the age of sixteen he perverted a romance of his own making Hackston of Rathillet a fanatic of Fife into a treatise The Pentland Rising a Page of History published in eighteen sixty six One would rather have possessed the romance Stevenson came from the Balfours of Pilrig and was of gentle blood on the spindle side An ancestress of his mother was a granddaughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot as a law lord or judge Lord Minto and so he could say I have shaken a spear in the debatable land and shouted the slogan of the Elliots perhaps And wha dares meddle wi me In Weir of Hermiston he returns to the auld bauld Elliots with zest He was not perhaps aware that through some remote ancestress on the spindle side he came of Harden s line so that he and I had a common forebear with Sir Walter Scott and were hundredth cousins of each other if we reckon in the primitive manner by female descent Of these Border ancestors Louis inherited the courage he was a fearless person but one would not trace his genius to The Bard of Rule an Elliot named Sweet Milk who was slain in a duel by another minstrel about sixteen twenty seven Genius is untraceable the granite intellect of Louis s great engineering forefathers the Stevensons was not like his tuneful though his father was imaginative diverting himself with daydreams and his uncle Alan Stevenson the builder of Skerryvore yielded to the fascinations of the religious Muse A volume of verse was the pledge of this dalliance His mother who gave him her gay indifference to discomfort and readiness for travel also read to him in his childhood much good literature for not till he was eight years of age was he an unreluctant reader which is strange The whole record of his life from his eighteenth month is a chronicle of fever and ill health borne always with heroic fortitude His dear nurse Alison Cunningham seems to have been a kind of festive Cameronian Her recitation of hymns was though she hated the playhouse grand and dramatic There is a hymn Jehovah Tsidkenu in which he rejoiced and no wonder for the refrain Jehovah Tsidkenu was nothing to me moves with the galloping hoof beats of Tis up wi the bonnets o Bonny Dundee I have however ascertained that this theological piece is not sung to the tune The cavalry canter of Bonny Dundee When the experiment is made the results are unspeakably strange It need not be said Stevenson has told us in verse and prose that in childhood his whole vocation was endless imitation He was the hunter and the pirate and the king throwing his fancy very seriously into each of his roles though visualizing never passed with him as with some children it does into actual hallucination He had none of the invisible playmates that to some children are visible and real He was less successful than Shelley in seeing apparitions but the dreams which he communicated to mister Frederic Myers were curious illustrations of his subconscious activities his Brownies as he called them They told him stories of which he could not foresee the end one led up to a love affair forbidden even by exogamous law with male descent and the sub class system and thus a fine plot was ruined Throughout life he always played his part as in childhood with full conscious and picturesque effect as did the great Montrose and the English Admirals in whom he notes this dramatic trait He was not a poseur he was merely sensitively conscious of himself and of life as an art As a little boy with curls and a velvet tunic he read Ministering Children and yearned to be a ministering child An opportunity seemed to present itself the class of boys called keelies by the more comfortable boys in Edinburgh used to play in the street under the windows of his father s house One lame boy a baker s son could only look on Here was a chance to minister Louis with a beating heart walked out on his angelic mission Little boy would you like to play with me he asked You go to was the answer of the independent son of the hardy baker It is difficult to pass from the enchanted childhood of this eternal child with its imaginative playing at everything broken only by fevers whereof the dreams were the nightmares of unconscious genius He has told of all this as only he could tell it As a boy despite his interrupted education he laid the foundations of a knowledge of French and German acquired Latin and was not like that other boy who Euclide viso cohorruit et evasit He was a mathematician He never played cricket I deeply regret to say and his early love of football deserted him He was no golfer and a good day s trout fishing during which he neglected to kill each trout as it was taken caused remorse and made him abandon the contemplative boy s recreation Boating riding and walking were his exercises He read the good books that never lose their charm Scott Dumas Shakespeare The Arabian Nights when very young he was delighted with The Book of Snobs he also read Mayne Reid and Ballantyne the Brave and any story that contained Skeltica cloaks swords wigs on the green pirates and great adventures He lived in literature for Romance His doings at Edinburgh University and as a budding engineer he has chronicled he took part in snowball rows in the debates of the Speculative Society and in private dramatic performances organized by his senior and friend Professor Fleeming Jenkin To dress up in old costumes always pleased him He happened to praise the acting of a girl of fourteen who in her family circle said Perhaps when I am old like the lady in Ronsard I will say R L Stevenson sang of me His gambols with the wild Prince and Poins are not unrecorded These were his Fergussonian years Perhaps he might have expressed Burns s esteem for the class of men called black guards as far as their unconventionality is concerned He saw a great deal of life in many varieties like Scott in Liddesdale he was making himsel a the time With his cousin R A M Stevenson Walter Ferrier mister Charles Baxter and Sir Walter Simpson a good golfer and not a bad bat he performed acts of Libbelism and discussed all things in the universe He was wildly gay and profoundly serious he had the earnestness of the Covenanter in forming speculations more or less unorthodox It is needless to dwell on the strain caused by his theological ideals and those of a loving but sternly Calvinistic sire to whom his love was ever loyal These things bred melancholy of necessity and melancholy was purged by an almost unexampled interest not in literature alone but in the technique of style and the construction of sentences and periods Few of his confessions are better known than those on his apprenticeship in style to the great authors of the past He gave himself up to the schools of Hazlitt Lamb Wordsworth Sir Thomas Browne Defoe Hawthorne Montaigne Baudelaire William Morris and Obermann De Senancour This he did when he was aged about eighteen when other lads are trying to write Latin prose like Cicero or Livy or Tacitus Tacitus is the easiest to ape in a way and Latin verse like Ovid or Horace or Virgil This they do because it is part of the curricoolum as the Scottish baronet said of school and college But I do not remember anecdotes of other boys with a genius for English prose who set themselves to acquire style before they deemed that they had anything in particular to say In English essays at college a young fellow may be told by his tutor not to imitate Carlyle or Macaulay the attempt to repeat the tones of Thackeray is most incident to youth But to aim like Stevenson while a student of Edinburgh University at the choice of the essential note and the right word in exercises written for his own improvement is a thing so original that it keeps me wondering Like most of us I have always thought with mister Froude when asked how he acquired his style that a man sits down and says what he has to say and there is an end of it We must not write like Clarendon now even if we could our sentences must be brief It would be affectation to write like Sir Thomas Browne if we could or like de Quincey and nobody can write like mister Ruskin when he is simple or like the late Master of Balliol mister Jowett How far and how early Stevenson succeeded in the pursuit of style may be seen in his Juvenilia for example in the essay on the Old Gardener But one is inclined to think that he succeeded because he had a very keen natural perception of all things was a most minute observer knew what told in the matter of words in fact had a genius of his own and that these graces came to him though he says that they did not by nature He tells us how often he wrote and rewrote some of his chapters some of his books His prima cura we have not seen perhaps it was as good as his most polished copy Prince Otto has even seemed to me in places over written He now and then ran near the rock of preciosity though he very seldom piled up his barque on that reef His style is to the right reader a perpetual feast a dreiping roast and his style cannot be parodied I never saw a parody that came within a league of the jest it aimed at save one burlesque of the deliberately stilted manner of his New Arabian Nights This triumph was achieved by mister Walter Pollock Stevenson s manner was too appropriate to his matter for parody for nobody could reproduce his matter and the vividness of his visualization When his characters were Scots Lowlanders or Highlanders it seems to me that their style has no rival except in the talk of Sir Walter s countrymen A minute student who knew Stevenson has told me that he once suggested chafts where Louis had written cheeks or jaws and that the emendation was accepted but his Scots always use the right word and never in prose say tae for to I think Theirs is the good Scots Perhaps I am biased in my doubt concerning the usefulness of his persistence in re writing by my regret that he destroyed so many of his romances as not worthy of him King s chaff is better than other folk s corn says our proverb In his day I bored him by pressing him to write more and more rapidly he never could have been commonplace he never could have been less than excellent But his conscience was adamant no man was less of an improviser as fortunately Scott was had he not been there would not be so many Waverley Novels Stevenson was hard on Scott who wrote much as he himself did in boyhood I forgot to say remarks the early Stevensonian hero after describing a day full of adventures with Red Indians that I had made love to a beautiful girl There is a faint resemblance to this over sight in a long sentence of Guy Mannering which Stevenson criticized but Guy Mannering was written in about six weeks to refresh the machine Fastidious himself conscientious almost to a fault in style Stevenson s joy was in the romances of Xavier de Montepin and Fortune du Boisgobey names which suggest Old crusading knights austere That bore King Louis company When Dumas and Scott and perhaps missus Radcliffe had been read too recently Louis went to Fortune and Xavier and doubtless to the father of them Gaboriau None of these benefactors of the race was a student of style but they gave him what Thackeray liked stories hot with as he says briefly but adequately All of us are led like that ancient people Israel like all humanity by a way we know not and a path we do not understand If some benevolent genie who understood Stevenson s qualities and genius could have directed his career how would that spirit have educated him For some reason not intelligible he was put on an allowance of five shillings weekly for his menus plaisirs till he was twenty three years of age He never was an expensive man except in giving wherein he knew no stint his favourite velvet coats his yellow shoes his black shirts with a necktie of a scrap of carpet he said I failed to guess its nature were not extravagant The last occasion on which I saw him in the legendary velvet coat was also the only moment in which I viewed the author of his being The circumstances were of the wildest comedy but the tale can never be told though in all respects it redounds to the credit of everybody concerned Not one of us let a laugh out of himself But a young man in his position likes to do many harmless things which cannot be done on five shillings a week and so he sought the haunts of thieves and chimney sweeps he says and wrote sonnets in those shy retreats which are known perhaps in Scotland as shebeens Why shebeens Is the word Gaelic misspelled Cases of shebeening are tried before the Edinburgh magistrates and as my circle was being continually changed by the action of the police magistrates he says conceivably his was a shebeening circle Another lad of his age some eighty years earlier was partial like him to taverns and old clothes They be good enough for drinking in said Walter Scott when Erskine or some other friend ventured to remonstrate Scott like Stevenson knew queer people knew beggars but had not one of them shaken hands with Prince Charles Certainly after Scott met Green Mantle and sheltered her as she came from church under his umbrella a piece of furniture which Stevenson can never have possessed he left off his old clothes and went into the best company But R L S did not delight in the good company of his native town nor did he suffer gladly the conventional raiment of the evening hours Green Mantle there was none as far as we learn He was not popular with the young Scots of his age his biographer says so candidly candidly have they said as much to me yet they were good fellows From childhood he had enjoyed all the indulgences of an only son and an invalid now he was brought up short and there were the religious disputes with a sire to whom he was devoted The climate of his own romantic town the worst in the world was his foe the wandering spirit in his blood called him to the south and the sun he tells of months in which he had no mortal to whom he could speak freely his cousin Bob being absent he was unhappy he was out of his milieu What would the genie have done for him Neither of the English Universities would have been to his taste the rebel in him would have kicked at morning chapel lectures cap and gown Proctors the talk of oars and bats manifestly Balliol was not the place for R L S though he might have been happy with his contemporary John Churton Collins He I remember even to the velvet coat was like Stevenson and was a rebel Grant Allen too would have been his contemporary the only man in Oxford who took to Herbert Spencer whom Stevenson also read with much edification Yet it is clear that Stevenson should not have been domiciled in the paternal mansion of Heriot Row The genie might have transported him to a German University perhaps to Heidelberg Dis aliter visum and the result for us is his matchless book on Edinburgh To see a copy thereof is to take it up and read through it again it is better at every reading In eighteen seventy one he broke to his father the news that the profession of engineering was not for him The Scottish Bar eighteen seventy four eighteen seventy five was not more attractive and in eighteen seventy three his meeting with mister now Sir Sidney Colvin then Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge and already well known as a critic and with a lady missus Sitwell to whom many of his most carefully written early letters are addressed probably sealed Stevenson into the profession of literature He has left this note on his prospects I think now this fifth or sixth of April eighteen seventy three that I can see my future life I think it will run stiller and stiller year by year a very quiet desultorily studious existence If God only gives me tolerable health I think now I shall be very happy work and science calm the mind and stop gnawing in the brain and as I am glad to say that I do now recognise that I shall never be a great man I may set myself peacefully on a smaller journey not without hope of coming to the inn before nightfall O dass mein Leben Nach diesem Ziel ein ewig Wandeln sey DESIDERATA I Good Health II two to three hundred a year III O du lieber Gott friends AMEN ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON He wrote an article this born wayfarer on Roads which was accepted by P G Hamerton for the Portfolio but in November eighteen seventy three nervous exhaustion with a threatening of phthisis caused him to be Ordered South to Mentone a lonely exile Here he was joined by mister Colvin and in mister Colvin s rooms for I also was ordered South I first met this surprising figure Our schooldays had just overlapped he was a gyte a child in the lowest form class we called it when I was in the highest but I had never seen him nor heard of him In some rhymes of his later years when Count Nerli was painting his portrait Louis wrote Oh will he paint me the way I like and as bonny as a girlie Or will he make me an ugly tyke and be d to mister Nerli When first we met he really was as bonny as a girlie with his oval face his flushed cheeks his brown eyes large and radiant and his hair of a length more romantic than conventional He wore a wide blue cloak with a grace which hovered between that of an Italian poet and an early pirate It was impossible not to discover in a short conversation that he was very clever but as a girl said once of her first meeting with another girl We looked at each other with horny eyes of disapproval I thought that he was affecting the poet and in me he found a donnish affectation of the British sportsman He said later that I complained concerning Monsieur Paul de saint Victor that he was no sportsman though his style was effulgent We seldom met again unhappily for I was then with a family in whose company he would have been happy all young all kind simple and beautiful and all doomed Stevenson was then seriously ill certainly a short walk fatigued him The next news I had of him was in his essay Ordered South concerning the emotions apathies and pleasures on that then fairy coast of a young man who thinks that his days are numbered After reading this paper I was absolutely convinced that among the writers of our generation Stevenson was first like Eclipse and the rest nowhere There was nobody to be spoken of in his company as a writer It was not his style alone Pater s style had bewitched me in his first book but it was the life that underlay the style of Stevenson He came home and found peace at home and a less inadequate allowance and he put up a brazen plate R L Stevenson Advocate on the door in Heriot Row But his practice was a jest Some senior men sought his society his old friends were with him his articles were welcomed by mister Leslie Stephen in The Cornhill Magazine and were eagerly expected by a few Directed by mister Stephen he found mister Henley in the Edinburgh Infirmary and that friendship began which was of such considerable influence in his life and work mister Henley s maimed strength his impeded vigour even his blond upstanding hair and beard all tangled his uncomplaining fortitude under the most cruel trials and the candid freshness of his conversation on men and books won Stevenson s heart In London Stevenson appeared now and again at the Savile Club then tenanting a rather gloomy little house in Savile Row The members were mostly connected with science literature journalism and the stage and Stevenson became intimate with many of them especially with the staff and the sub editor in those days of The Saturday Review mister Walter Pollock and with mister Saintsbury mister Traill mister Charles Brookfield Sir Walter Besant a little later with mister Edmund Gosse who was by much his favourite in this little society In addition to the chaff of the Saturday reviewers he enjoyed the talk of Prof Robertson Smith Prof W H Clifford and Prof Fleeming Jenkin Stevenson never wrote to my knowledge in The Saturday Review journalism never set his genius For one reason among many his manner was by far too personal in those days of unsigned contributions He needed money he wished to be financially independent but in the Press his independence could not be all that he desired He did not wield the ready punctual pen of him whom Lockhart most invidiously calls the bronzed and mother naked gentleman of the Press His conversation at luncheon and after luncheon in the Club was the delight of all but for various reasons I was seldom present I do remember an afternoon when I had him all to myself but that was later He poured out stories of his American wanderings including a tale of a murderous lonely inn kept by Scots whose genius tended to assassination He knew nothing of their exploits at home but then or afterwards I heard of them from a boatman on Loch Awe Their mother was a witch At this period Stevenson was much in Paris and alone or with his cousin Bob dwelt at Barbizon and other forest haunts of painters The chronicle of these merry days is written in the early chapters of The Wrecker In literature he was finding himself in his Essays but the world did not find him easily or early History much attracted him as it did Thackeray who said I like history it is so gentlemanly But it can only be written by gentlemen of independent means Stevenson s favourite period was that of the France of the fifteenth century and he studied later some aspects of that time in essays on Charles d Orleans in his admirable picture of Villon as a man and poet and especially in A Lodging for the Night and The Sieur de Maletroit s Door shut on a windy night in the month after the Maid failed at Paris September fourteen twenty nine These unexcelled short stories really revealed Stevenson as the narrator his path lay clear before him But even his friends were then divided in opinion some preferring his essays and his two books of sentimental travel An Inland Voyage eighteen seventy eight and Travels with a Donkey eighteen seventy nine These were indeed admirable in style humour description and incident but the creative imagination in the stories of Villon s night and of the Sieur de Maletroit s door the painting of character the romance the vividness were worth many such volumes They were well received by the Press these sketches of travel but as Monsieur Got says in his Journal eighteen fifty seven Les succes des delicats sont meme quand ils s etablissent trop lents a s etablir La foule s est tellement democratisee qu il n a pas de salut si l on ne frappe brutalement The needful brutality was not employed till Stevenson knocked them with Jekyll and Hyde The world is so full of a number of things that a few essays two or three short stories in a magazine a little book of sketches in prose may be masterpieces in their three several ways but they escape the notice of all but a few amateurs mister Kipling s knock was much more insistent he could not be unheard It was not by essays on Burns and Knox however independently done that Stevenson could make his mark Concerning these heroes Scotland has a vision of her own and no man must undo it no man must tell about Knox facts ignored by Professors of Church History Indeed to study Knox afresh demands research for which Stevenson had not the opportunity The Covenanting side of his nature appeared in his study of the moral aspect of Burns his feet of clay It is agreed that we must veil the feet of clay As Lockhart says Scott infuriated mister Alexander Peterkin by remarking that Burns was not chivalrous Stevenson went further and annoyed the Peterkins of his day His task required courage it was not found wanting In eighteen seventy seven Stevenson had a new if very narrow opening A friend of his at Edinburgh University a young mister Caldwell Brown so Stevenson named him to me his real name seems to have been Glasgow Brown came to the great metropolis to found a Conservative weekly journal London was its name but Edinburgh was its nature and base if a base it had The editor was in the air he knew nothing of his business and its difficulties nothing of what the Conservative public with sixpences to spend was likely to want He approached some of Stevenson s friends and he gave the Conservative party scores of lively ballades villanelles and rondeaux They were brilliant Stevenson would not tell me the author s name he proved to be mister Henley who came to town and on the death of mister Brown edited this unread periodical There were Society notes although mister Henley s haunts were not those of that kind of society and one occasional contributor ventured to remonstrate about the chatter on the professional beauties of that distant day The New Arabian Nights with all their humour and horror all their intellectual high spirits and reckless absurdity were poured by Stevenson into this outcast flutterer of a Tory paper to the great joy of some of the very irregular contributors It was an honest flutterer its contributors received their wages Then London died and then seriousness enough came into the life of our Arabian author In August eighteen seventy nine he disappeared he went to America to marry the lady whom he had first met at Fontainebleau whom he wedded at San Francisco eighteen eighty and loved with all his heart Reconciled to his father he returned to Scotland His health had been anew impaired by troubles and privations and the rest of his life in the Old World was occupied by a series of maladies vain roamings in search of climate and hard work constantly interrupted From his early childhood onwards an army of maladies surrounded him invested him cut him off if in an hour of health he ventured on any sally but they never overcame his invincible resolution He was as one of his favourite old authors says about I forget what emperor an entertainer of fortune by the day making the most of every sunny hour and the best of every hour passed under the shadow of imminent death I remember that soon after his marriage he was staying in London at the house of a friend Going to see him I noted in him a somewhat anxious look and I did not wonder at it mister Henley was seated in a great chair the whole of his face from the eyes downwards muffled in a huge crimson silk pocket handkerchief of which the point covered his aureate beard The room was a large room and as Louis flitted about it more suo he managed to tell me privily that Henley had a very bad cold and that he himself caught every cold which came within a limited radius He did catch that cold I heard and when once such an invader entered his system nobody knew what the end of it might be His lungs usually suffered hemorrhage was frequent and often alarming In one of these accesses unable to speak he wrote Do not be frightened If this is the end it is an easy one Many scraps written by him in circumstances like these used to exist some of them though brief were rich in the simple eloquence of indignation Almost no climate did him any good in eighteen eighty eighteen eighty one he chiefly suffered at Davos and in the tempests of September in Braemar At Davos he had few consolations except the society of mister J A Symonds the Opalstein of his essay on Talk and Talkers and his family He was still attached to the indigent Muse of History meditating a History of the Highlands and another book on that much trampled topic the Union of seventeen oh seven When one thinks of the commercial statistics necessary to the student of the Union to take that grim aspect of it alone enfin I have been there and would not go In the nature of things the History of the Union would have become a romance with that impudent entertaining rogue Ker of Kersland and his bewildered Cameronians for the heroes with Hamilton the waverer and the dark sardonic Lockhart of Carnwath and Daniel Defoe as the English looker on The study of Highland history led to the reading of the Trial of James of the Glens and the vain hunt for Alan Breck and so to Kidnapped Stevenson felt and described the exhilaration of Alpine mornings but his style was as sensitive as his bronchial apparatus and he declares that when he tried to write the style suffered from yeasty inflation while his nights were haunted by the nightmares of his childhood The next change carried him to a cottage near Pitlochry whence he wrote that he was engaged in the composition of crawlers The first and best of these Thrawn Janet was with his Tod Lapraik in Kidnapped the only pendant to Scott s Wandering Willie s Tale in the northern vernacular The tale has a limited circle no Southern can appreciate all its merits the thing is so absolutely and essentially Scots especially the atmosphere He said that it was true for a hill parish in Scotland in old days not true for mankind and the world So it is fortunate to be a native of a hill parish in Scotland The Merry Men as a fantasia or vision of the sea is excellent the poor negro never was to myself convincing However knowing Stevenson s taste in art I designed for him in Skeltic taste an illustration coloured of the negro pursuing the wicked uncle in the philabeg over the crests of Ben Mor Mull Descending from these heights Stevenson like every bookish Scot ettled at a professorial chair that of History and Constitutional Law in the University of Edinburgh The election was in the winter the legist and historian occupied the autumn in composing the first half of Treasure Island originally The Sea Cook Everyone knows the story how playing with his stepson Stevenson drew a map of an island an island like a dragon seyant considered the caves and hills and streams and thought of the place as a haunt of these serviceable pirates who always dumped down their hard earned swag on distant and on deadly shores which they carefully abstained from revisiting The legends of Captain Kidd s caches have long haunted the imagination the idea of Hidden Treasure has its eternal charm and the story thereof was told once for all by Poe Soon after Treasure Island appeared there was a real treasure hunt The deposit so I was informed was put down by a Fin and mister Rider Haggard and I were actually paying at least mister Haggard sent me a cheque for shares in this alluring enterprise when I learned that the Fin or Finn a native of Finland had looted the church plate of some Spanish cathedral in America Knowing this I returned his cheque to mister Haggard happily for the isle was the playroom of young earthquakes which had upset the soil and the landmarks to such a degree that the gentleman adventurer returned bredouille I hope Stevenson had nothing on In the Highland cottage during the rain eternal he amused himself with writing his story as Shelley Byron Polidori and Mary Godwin had diverted themselves in Swiss wet weather with their ghost stories Frankenstein and Byron s good opening of a romance of a vampire Visitors came mister Colvin mister Gosse and doctor Japp they liked the tale as chapter by chapter was read aloud and it was offered to a penny periodical for boys A much better market might easily have been found indeed Stevenson wasted his mercies He was paid like the humblest of unknown scribblers not even illustrations were given to the obscure romance running in dim inner pages of the periodical and it appears that as Theophile Gautier s editor said about one of his narratives the abonne was bored with the style It was an audacious thing for a man of Louis s health and intermittent inspiration to send in half the copy meaning to send the rest later from Davos He might not be able physically to write the inspiration might vanish and there was John Addington Symonds eager for him to write on the Characters of Theophrastus He might as well have written or better on the Characters of Sir Thomas Overbury which are rather less remote from the ken of the British public than those of the Greek If any young man or woman not in possession of independent means reads these lines of mine let him or her take warning and deserting history morals the essay biography and shunning anthropology as they would kippered sturgeon or the devil cleave only to fiction Biography also allured Stevenson his literary tastes were nearly his ruin he wanted at Davos to write a Life of Hazlitt and at Bournemouth a biography of Arthur Duke of Wellington But time and strength were lacking nor have we R L S s mature opinion of the strategy and tactics of the victor of Assaye The Muse of piratical enterprise returned and Treasure Island reached its haven with no applause in the paper for boys In the following May Messrs Cassell proposed to publish Treasure Island in book form being spirited up I suppose by mister Henley who was editing for them The Magazine of Art in which Stevenson wrote two or three articles I remember that a letter of my own to The Editor as mister Henley had proudly signed himself came automatically into the hands of the General Editor a clergyman if I do not err and that my observations on the Art of Savages lighting on the wrong sort of ground sprang up and nearly choked mister Henley Stevenson was already the victim of the Yankee pirate whose industry at least made his name though wrongly spelled known to the community which later paid him so well for his work and displayed for him an enthusiasm of affectionate admiration In eighteen eighty four he worked at the often rewritten Prince Otto and did a pot boiler The Black Arrow which pleased the boy public of the paper much better than Treasure Island His time from January eighteen eighty three to May eighteen eighty four was passed at Hyeres In the end of November Treasure Island was published in book form and was warmly welcomed by the Press and by such friends of the author as retained at least in letters any smack of youth It was forced as far as You must read it please even on the friends of the friends and so on in successive waves yet it did not reach a wide circle five or six thousand copies were sold in the first year That is failure in the eyes of many of our novelists whose style does not bore the unfastidious abonne Stevenson in writing an article for a magazine on his First Book chose Treasure Island for books other than novels do not count as books He spoke of terror as the motive and interest of the tale the dread for each and all of a mutiny headed by his ruthless favourite John Silver Indeed terror whether caused by the eccentric furies of mister William Bones mariner or of the awful blind Pew with his tapping staff runs through the volume as the dominant motive But there is so much else the many landscapes so various and so vivid the humour of the Doctor and the Squire the variety of the seamen s characters the Man of the Island with his craving for a piece of cheese above all John Silver He is terrible this coldly cruel crafty and masterful Odysseus of the Pacific His creator liked him but I could have seen Silver withering on the wuddie at Execution Dock or suspended from a yardarm without shedding the tears of sensibility A pirate is rather a beast than otherwise says a young critic in The Human Boy and I cannot get over Silver gloating on the prospect of torturing Trelawny At all events he is an original creation and a miraculous portent in a boy s book Fiercer attacks of illness in various forms drove Stevenson to Bournemouth he was engaged when he had the strength on those plays in collaboration with mister Henley which prove that he had not the mysterious gift of writing for the stage I hope mister Henley wrote most of it said a lady as she left the theatre where she had seen Deacon Brodie played Had Deacon Brodie been Archdeacon Brodie there would have been more piquancy in the contrast of his double life This idea of the double life of each man had long haunted Stevenson He told me once that he meant to write a story about a fellow who was two fellows which did not when thus stated seem a fortunate idea However happily he continued to think of Hyde and Jekyll yet knew not how to manage them One night after eating bread and jam freely he had a nightmare he saw Hyde pursued take refuge in a closet swallow the mixture as before the mysterious powder or potion and change horribly into Jekyll He set to work at once and in three feverish days completed the first draft of his parable In this the Hyde aspect was only Jekyll s unassuming disguise adopted at hours when he wished to be a little gay Stevenson burned his first draft and rewrote the whole in three days He knew it seems that the magical powder was an error One sees how the thing could be managed otherwise with a slight strain on the resources of psychical research But in no way could the story have attained the probable impossible which Aristotle preferred to the improbable possible Stevenson sent the manuscript to my friend mister Charles Longman who in turn sent it to me I began to read it one night in the security of a modest London drawing room and naturally it fascinated me from the first page Then I came to a certain page which produced such an emotion that I threw the manuscript on a chair and scuttled apprehensively to the safety of bed Later a kinsman who seldom read a book told me that living alone in a great Highland house he had thrown down the printed book at the same passage and made the same inglorious retreat Anyone who knows the book knows what the passage is The story was produced in a paper covered volume costing a shilling and was little heeded till a reviewer in The Times caught this great stupid public by the ear as Thackeray said The clergy of all denominations did the rest As they had preached on Pamela a hundred and forty years earlier so they called the attention of their flocks to Hyde and to Jekyll Who are Hyde and Jekyll my brethren You are Hyde and Jekyll I am Jekyll and Hyde each of us is Jekyll and alas each of us is Hyde Stevenson had long ago found himself now he was found by the public The names of his two rascally heroes doctor Jekyll is even less of a gentleman than Hyde became proverbial The gruesome parable occupied an interval in the making of what I suppose is his masterpiece Kidnapped The story centres on the Appin Murder of seventeen fifty one about which he had made inquiries in the neighbourhood of Rannoch where Alan Breck skulked after the shooting of Campbell of Glenure in the hanging wood south of Ballachulish Stevenson could not learn who the other man was the real murderer in the romance I know but respect the Celtic secret The fatal gun was found very many years after the deed by an old woman in a hollow tree and it was not the gun of James Stewart I have a friend whose great great grandfather was standing beside James of the Glens watching the digging of potatoes A horse was heard approaching at such a pace that James said Whoever the rider is the horse is not his own As he galloped past the rider shouted Glenure is shot Who did it I don t know but I am the man that will hang for it said James too truly Of Kidnapped Stevenson said as Thackeray said of Henry Esmond and Lady Castlewood as Scott says of Dugald Dalgetty that in this book alone of his the characters took the bit in their teeth at a certain point It was they who spoke it was they who wrote the remainder of the story They are spontaneous they are living Balfour in the scenario of the tale was to have been kidnapped and carried to the American plantations But he and Alan went their ain gait At the end you can see the pen drop from the weary fingers they left half told the story of Alan to be continued in Catriona A love of Jacobite times and of Alan Breck s country Lochaber Glencoe Mamore may bias me but in Kidnapped Stevenson appears to me to reach the height of his genius in designing character and landscape in humour dialogue and creative power As in his preceding stories there is hardly the flutter of a petticoat but the tale like Prince Charles at Holyrood can point to a Highland man of the sword and say These are my beauties I remember that mister Matthew Arnold admired the story greatly and he had no Jacobite or local bias In May eighteen eighty seven Stevenson lost his father and paid his last visit to his native country It was during this period in eighteen eighty six probably that I for the first time saw Stevenson confined to bed in one of his frequent illnesses and then also I saw him for the last time So emaciated was he we need not dwell on what seemed that last face of Hippocrates that we could not believe there remained for him some crowded years of life and comparatively healthy and joy bestowing energy If the ocean was henceforth to roll between us at least he said that we were always best friends when furthest apart though indeed we were never so intimate as to be otherwise than friendly It was never the man that I knew best but the genius that I delighted in on this side idolatry Always in verse or in prose in Scots or in English he made one reader happy by a kind of pre established harmony of taste which might not have prevailed in the intercourse of every day s life In August eighteen eighty seven Stevenson left England for ever arriving at New York as a lion hunted by reporters whom no doubt he received with the majestic courtesy of his own Prince of Bohemia Two versions of Jekyll and Hyde were being acted all this was very unlike the calm indifference of his native land It seems that in Jekyll as Terryfled in Scott s phrase there is a love interest love is alien to doctor Jekyll as to the shepherd before he found that Love was a dweller on the rocks The Terryfication was at least an advertisement To advertise himself in the modern way Stevenson was not competent He never was interviewed as a Celebrity at Home as far as I am aware Indeed he loved not society papers and lit a bonfire and danced a dance around it in his garden when some editor of a journal of that sort was committed to prison His name is not mentioned but Stevenson and I had against him a grudge of very old standing Dollars in sufficient profusion were offered for his works and in the Adirondack Hills beside a frozen river in the starlit night he dreamed of a story of many years and countries of the sea and the land savagery and civilization He thought of that old Indian marvel the suspended life of the buried fakir over whose grave the corn is sown and grown He thought of an evil genius on whom this method should be tried in frozen Canadian earth Thus what seems like the far fetched idea of a wearied fancy in The Master of Ballantrae was from the first of the essence of that bitter romance The new conception fitted in with a tale already dreamed of on the Perthshire moors about the dark adventurous years of the Jacobite eclipse The Prince was hidden in a convent of Paris or flashing for a moment in the Mall or cruising a dingy bearded wanderer in Germany or the Netherlands while his followers were serving under French colours under Montcalm or Lally Tolendal Men who had charged side by side at Gledsmuir and Culloden might meet as foes in Canada or Hindostan There is matter enough in seventeen fifty seventeen sixty five for scores of romances but who now can write them But the Master did not now begin his deeds of bale Stevenson s stepson mister Osbourne then very young himself wrote The Finsbury Tontine or The Game of Bluff and I was informed at the time by Stevenson s devoted admirer mister McClure that the book was completed by mister Osbourne for the Press Then Stevenson took up the manuscript and as mister Osbourne says forced the thing to live as it had never lived before Indeed the style of The Wrong Box throughout is Louis s style in such romantic farces as The New Arabian Nights a manner of his own creation I seem to remember that I saw the finished manuscript or perhaps an early copy of the book and I did not care for it mister Kipling rather surprised me by finding it so very amusing mister Osbourne says that the story still retains it seems to me a sense of failure and that the public does not relish it For my own part on later re readings the little farce has made me laugh hysterically at the sorrows of mister William Pitman that mild drawing master caught up and whirled away into adventures worthy of the great Fortune du Boisgobey The scene in which he is described as the American Broadwood a person inured to a simple patriarchal life a being of violent passions with the immortal John in the character of the Great Vance and that joy for ever Uncle Joseph with his deathless thirst for popular information and instruction these personages this educated insolence never cease to amuse Uncle Joseph is no caricature But the world likes its sensational novels to be written with becoming seriousness in short The Wrong Box is aimed at a small but devoted circle of admirers People constantly ask men who have collaborated how they do the business As a rule so some French collaborator says some one is the dupe and he is the man of genius This was not true too notably in the case of Alexandre Dumas nor was it true in Stevenson s case As a rule one man does the work and the other looks on but again this was not the way in which Stevenson and mister Osbourne worked They first talked over the book together and ideas were struck out in the encounter of minds This practice may very probably prove unfruitful or even injurious to many writers they are confused rather than assisted After or during the course of the conversations when he had an ally after reflection when he had not Stevenson used to write out a series of chapter headings One I remember was The Master of Ballantrae to the Rescue an incident in a tale which he began about the obscure adventures of Prince Charles in seventeen forty nine seventeen fifty Ballantrae to the Rescue the sound was promising but I do not know who was to be obliged by the Master After the list of chapters was completed mister Osbourne used to write the first draft to break the ground and then each wrote and rewrote an indefinite number of times The style the general effect produced are the style and the effect of Stevenson He liked the comradeship More care was taken than on a novel of which I and another were greatly guilty My partner represented mister Nicholas Wogan as rubbing his hands after a bullet at Fontenoy as history and I made quite clear had deprived mister Wogan of one of his arms There is no such error in the Iliad despite the unnumbered multitude of collaborators detected by the Higher Criticism In June eighteen eighty eight Stevenson sailed out on the Pacific in search of health and followed the shining shadow through the isles and seas till he made his last home at Samoa It was a three years cruise among summer isles of Eden Perhaps no book of Stevenson s is less popular than his narrative of storm and calm of beachcombers and brown Polynesian princes The scenery is too exotic for the general taste The joy and sorrow of Stevenson was to find a society in much the same convulsionary and transitional state as the Highlands and Islands after seventeen forty five He was always haunted and in popularity retarded by History He wanted to know about details of savage custom and of superstitious belief a taste very far from being universal even in the most highly cultivated circles where Folklore is a name of fear He found among the natives such fatal Polynesian fairy ladies as they of Glenfinlas on whom Scott wrote the ballad He found a medicine man who hypnotized him from behind his back which nobody at home had been able to do before his face He exchanged stories with the clansmen Scots for Polynesian they were much the same in character and incident He had found in Polynesia the way out of our own present He met a Polynesian Queen a Mary Stuart or a Helen of Troy grown old She had been passed from chief to chief she had been fought for and taken in war a Queen of Cannibals tattooed from head to foot Now she had reached the Elysian plain and a windless age living in religion as it were she passes all her days with the sisters She was not a white woman none of these people so courteous and kind were white were up to date In London and New York amateurs did not want to be told about them in Stevenson s Letters from the South Seas Stevenson collected songs and legends fortunately he also worked at The Master of Ballantrae in spite of frequent illnesses and many perils of the sea The Master of Ballantrae was finished at Honolulu the closing chapters are the work of a weary pen He had made tryst with an evil genius that was essential to the conception of the book and with a hideous tale of fraternal hatred told by a constitutional coward Everything is under the shadow of thunder and lit by lightning A glimpse of Allan Breck and the babblings of the Chevalier Bourke are the only relief But the life is as clearly seen as life in Stevenson s books always is for example when the guinea is thrown through the stained window pane or the old serving man holds the candle to light the duel of brothers who are born foes or as in the final scenes of desperate wanderings in the company of murderers through Canadian snows But the book as Sir Henry Yule said is as grim as the road to Lucknow as it was intended to be A fresh cruise in the following year bettered his health and brought him the anecdote of a mystery of the sea which was the germ of The Wrecker He saw Samoa and bought land there Vailima the last and best of his resting places and here he was joined in eighteen ninety one by his intrepid mother He was now a lord of land a householder in his unpretentious Abbotsford and a great chief among the natives distracted as they were by a king de facto and a king over the water with the sonorous names of Malietoa and Mataafa Samoan politics the strifes of Germany England and the States were labyrinthine their chronicle is written in his Footnote to History My conjectures as to the romantic side of his dealings with the rightful king are vague and need not be recorded You can be in a new conspiracy every day said an Irishman with zest but conspiracies are better things in fiction than in real life and Stevenson had no personal ambitions and withal as much common sense as Shelley displayed in certain late events of his life He turned to the half finished Wrecker and completed it When the story began to appear in Scribner s Magazine it seemed full of vivacity and promise The opening scenes in the Pacific were like Paradise as the author said to dwellers in Brixton or other purlieus of London The financial school at which Loudon Dodd was educated in Stock Exchange flutters was rather less convincing than any dream of Paradise but none the less amusing At home in Edinburgh with the old Scottish master of jerry building and of plinths the atmosphere was truly Scots tea coseys and all while the reminiscences of Paris and Fontainebleau and the grandeurs et miseres of the young Americo Parisienne sculptor were perfectly fresh to the world though some of the anecdotes were known to Stevenson s intimates mister James Pinkerton is a laudable creation with his loyalty his innocence his total ignorance and complete lack of taste and his scampers too near the wind of commercial probity The spirit of hustle incarnate in a man otherwise so innocent the ideals caught from heaven knows what American works for the young and the inspired patriotism the blundering enthusiastic affection make the early Pinkerton a study as original as it is entertaining The sale by auction of the wreck which by arrangement is to be Pinkerton s prey the mysterious opposition of the other bidder so determined to win an object apparently so worthless is no less thrilling than the sale of the fur coat in Boisgobey s Crime de l Opera But the reader knows why the fur coat is so much desired whereas I remember being driven so wild by curiosity about the value of the wreck that I wrote to Louis desiring to learn the secret He would not divulge it and when after the voyage to the island and the excitement of knocking the wreck to pieces were over when the secret came out it was neither pleasant nor probable That a mild British amateur of water colour drawing should have taken part in a massacre of men shot painfully with cheap revolvers was an example of the possible improbable and much more of a tax on belief than the transformation of doctor Jekyll When I mildly urged this criticism I learned by return of post from a correspondent usually as dilatory as Wordsworth that I was a stay at home person ignorant of the world and of life as it is lived by full blooded men on the high seas That was very true but the amateur in water colour was also a mild kind of good being What would I have done with the crew who were such compromising witnesses and were butchered I would have marooned them The Beach of Falesa is a revelation of unfamiliar life and character and one is attached to the little brown heroine There was to have been a supernatural element better probably than the device of the AEolian harps hung in the thicket I have got the smell and the look of the thing a good deal he said and he had got the style of his rough English narrator who was as he told the missionary what you call a sinner what I call a sweep but repented in time A period of many projects followed one The Young Chevalier had a germ in The Letter of Henry Goring seventeen forty nine seventeen fifty with which I brought him acquainted not knowing then that it was merely a romance by the prolific Eliza Heywood It was in this tale that the Master of Ballantrae was to come to the rescue and I think that a Scottish assassin who lurks obscure in real history and Mandrin the famed French robber were to appear but only a chapter is published among other fragments As it stands Prince Charles s eyes are alternately blue and brown brown was their actual colour they were like Stevenson s own Fortunately the Chevalier was deserted for the continuation of Kidnapped a sequel which is as good as or thanks to the two heroines Catriona and Barbara Grant is even better than the original To think of it is to wish to take it from the shelf and read it again It is all excellent from the scenes where Alan is hiding under a haystack suggested by an adventure of the Chevalier Johnstone after Culloden and the first meeting with that good daughter of Clan Alpine and of James Mor onwards Stevenson excited a good deal of odium among fiery Celts by his scoundrel Master of Lovat There is no reason as far as I am aware to suppose that Simon was a scoundrel but as a figure in fiction he is very firmly drawn The abortive duel of Balfour with the Highland Ensign who conceives high esteem of Palfour is in the author s best manner as are the days of prison in that unco place the Bass and he was justly proud of the wizard tale of Tod Lapraik The bristling demeanour of Alan Breck and James Mor a very gallant but distinctly unfortunate son of Rob Roy seems a correct picture Indeed James Mor was correctly divined probably from letters of his published in Scott s Rob Roy It does not appear that Stevenson ever saw a number of James s letters in the character of a spy a spy who appears to be carefully bamboozling his employers which exist in the Newcastle MSS in the British Museum But the James of these letters is the James of Catriona The scenes with the advocates of James of the Glens at Inveraray read as if they had been recorded in shorthand at the moment David himself is of course the Lowland prig he is meant to be but Catriona at last was a moving heroine though Stevenson justly preferred to her the beautiful Miss Grant and entirely overcame the difficulty of making us realise her beauty The Princess in Prince Otto is a fair shadow compared to Miss Grant and Stevenson at last convinced most readers that if he had omitted the interest of womanhood it was not from incompetence though it may have been from diffidence At this time we used to receive letters from him not infrequently he sent me the Luck of Apemama which he sacrilegiously purchased from its holder This fetish the palladium of the island was in one point remarkable a very ordinary shell in a perfectly new box of native make Why it was thought great medicine and ignorantly worshipped the pale face student of magic and religion could not understand However it was the Luck of the island and when it crossed the sea to Europe a pestilence of measles fell on the native population There was no manifest connection of cause and effect Stevenson s letters to me were merely such notes as he might have written had we both been living within the four mile radius usually notes about books which he needed always brightened with a quip and some original application of slang Occasionally there were rhymes One was about a lady Who beckled beckled beckled gaily Another had the refrain The dibs that take the islands Are the dollars of Peru One long and lively piece was on the Achaean hero of a fantastic romance by mister Rider Haggard and myself the Ithacan the Stormer of the City Stevenson exclaimed Ye wily auld blackguard How far ye hae staggered Frae Homer to Haggard And Lang How variously excellent he was as a letter writer the readers of his correspondence know and how vast considering his labours and his health that correspondence is Often it is freakish often it is serious but except in some epistles of the period of his apprenticeship it is never written as if he anticipated the publisher and the editor Good examples are his letters to a reviewer who criticizing him without knowing him wrote as if he were either an insensible athletic optimist or a sufferer who was a poseur The fact is consciously or not you doubt my honesty Any brave man may make out a life which shall be happy for himself and by so being beneficent to those about him And if he fail why should I hear him weeping Why indeed Think of mister Carlyle Did I groan loud or did I groan low Wackford said mister Squeers mister Carlyle groaned loud sometimes with fair reason Stevenson did not groan at all If he posed if his silence was a pose it was heroic But his intellectual high spirits were almost invincible If he had a pen in his hand the follet of Moliere rode it mister Thomas Emmett that famous Yorkshire cricketer has spoken words of gold I was always happy as long as I was bowling Stevenson I think was almost always happy when he was writing when the instrument of his art was in his fingers Consider the deliberate and self conscious glumness the willful making the worst of things in themselves pretty bad I admit that mark the novels of eminent moderns who thrive on their inexpensive pessimism and have a name as Psychologues Ohe les Psychologues Does anyone suppose that Stevenson could not have dipped his pencil in squalor and gloom and psychology and oppositions of science falsely so called as saint Paul in the spirit of prophecy remarks Ugliness is only the prose of horror he said It is when you are not able to write Macbeth that you write Therese Raquin In any case and under any fashion the great man produces beauty terror and mirth and the little man produces We know what he produces and though his books may be praised as if the little man were a Sophocles up to date he and his works are a weariness to think upon In them is neither beauty mirth nor terror except the terror of illimitable ennui None the less I believe that the little men of woe are happy are enjoying themselves while they are writing while they are doing their best to make the public comfortably miserable If these authors were as candid as Stevenson they would admit that they enjoy their merry days of desolation and that the world is not such a bad place for them after all But perhaps before this truth can be accepted and confessed by these eminent practitioners in pessimism a gleam of humour must arise on their darkness and that is past praying for There is a burden of a Scots song which perhaps may have sung itself in the ear of Louis when life was at its darkest And werena my heart licht I wad die Having finished Catriona at about the age that Scott had when he wrote his first novel Waverley Stevenson thought of Weir of Hermiston I thought of mister Pickwick says Dickens with admirable simplicity and fell to that work furiously as was his wont when a great theme dawned on him But soon as usual came the cold fit his inspirations being intermittent for some untraced reason physical or psychological Possibly he foresaw the practical difficulty of his initial idea that the Roman Father should sit on the bench of Scottish Themis and try his own son on a capital charge This would not have been permitted to occur in Scotland even when the Fifteen were first constituted into a Court If humane emotions did not forbid it must have been clear that no Scottish judge they were not kinless loons would have permitted his son to be found guilty Conceivably this damping circumstance occurred to Stevenson He dropped for a while the hanging judge and began saint Ives as a short story It was now that early in eighteen ninety three under an attack of hemorrhage Stevenson dictated his tale to his stepdaughter on his fingers in the gesture alphabet of the dumb Perhaps this feat is as marvelous as Scott s dictating The Bride of Lammermoor in tormentis to Will Laidlaw We see how his maladies hung on Stevenson s flank even in Samoa where his health had so remarkably improved and permitted to him unwonted activities After a visit to Sydney he took up The Ebb Tide in collaboration with mister Osbourne whose draft of the first chapters he warmly applauded It is not one of his central successes His pencil was dipped in moral gloom but even to the odious Cockney scoundrel Huish his Shakespearian tolerance accorded the virtue of indomitable courage He could not help filling the book full with his abundant vitality and his keen observation of the islands and the beachcombers The thing to use an obsolete piece of slang is vecu There were other projects many of them which dawned rosily and faded into the grey and there was the rich and copious correspondence dated from Vailima His friends no doubt hearing of his good health now and then hoped to see his face again the grouse on the hills of home were calling their eternal Come back come back Stevenson who himself could live contentedly on so little was the most open handed of men the most liberal and cheerful of givers and whether to Samoans in distressful times or to others who sought his aid his purse was never closed while his hospitality was like Sir Walter s Probably in his hour of greatest success he never was among the best sellers But any financial anxieties which may have beset him were assuaged and his heart was greatly held up by the success of the beautiful Edinburgh Edition of his works conceived and carried out by the energy of his friend of old Edinburgh days mister Charles Baxter His latest work was Weir of Hermiston the plenitude of his genius shines in every page He himself thought that this was his best work so far as we can judge by the considerable fragment that exists he was in the right There is nothing immature nothing here of the boy he is approaching in his tale a fateful point of passion and disaster his characters especially the elder woman the nurse are entirely human with no touch of caprice they all live their separate lives in our memories Then the end came One moment of bewildered consciousness then unconsciousness and death He had written to me some months before a letter full of apprehensions of the fate of Scott and Swift whether warned by some monitory experience or whether he had merely chanced to be thinking of the two great men who outlived themselves To him death had come almost as a friend in the fullness of his powers there was no touch of weakness or decay and he was mourned like a king by his Samoans by his family by all who had known him and by many thousands who had never seen his face There was mourning at home in Scotland where we hoped against hope that the news was untrue in England in Europe in America in Australia and the Isles He who had been such a friendly writer who had created for us so many friends in his characters had made more friends for himself friends more and more various in age race tastes character and temper than any British writer perhaps since Dickens He was taken from us untimely broken was our strong hope in the future gifts of his genius and there was a pain that does not attend the peaceful passing in the fullness of years and wisdom and honour of an immortal like Tennyson Any attempt by a contemporary to place Stevenson to give him his class in English literature would be a folly The future must judge for itself and if we may estimate the taste of the future by that of the present the reading public will not often look behind the most recent publications of its own day But les delicats will look back on Stevenson as they now look back on Fielding who to my simple thinking remains unsurpassed as a novelist and as they turn to Lamb and Hazlitt as essayists The poet is of course at his best immortal time cannot stale Beowulf or the nameless lyrists of the fourteenth century or Chaucer or Spenser and so with the rest la mort n y mord But it is as a writer of prose that Stevenson must be remembered If he is not the master British essayist of the later nineteenth century I really cannot imagine who is to be preferred to him His vivacity vitality his original reflections on life his personal and fascinating style claim for him the crown Nobody perhaps places him beside Lamb and he would not have dreamed of being equaled in renown with Hazlitt while he is I conceive more generally sympathetic than mister Pater whose place is apart whose province is entirely his own When we think of Stevenson as a novelist there is this conspicuous drawback that he never did write a novel on characters and conditions in the mid stream of the life that was contemporary with himself He does not compete therefore with Thackeray and Dickens mister Hardy and mister Meredith but Scott is also no competitor saint Ronan s Well is Scott s only novel that deals with precisely contemporary life and saint Ronan s Well is a kind of backwater the story of a remote contemporary watering place of local squireens and of a tragedy mangled in deference to James Ballantyne Scott did not often care to trust himself out of the last echoes of the pipes that played for Charlie and though his knowledge of contemporary life was infinitely wider than Stevenson s we see many good reasons for his abstention from use of his knowledge For example it is obvious that he could not attempt a romance of the War in the Peninsula and of life in London let us say while Wellington was holding Torres Vedras Even among Stevenson s abandoned projects there is not I think one which deals with English society in the eighties His health and his fugitive life imposed on him those limitations against which his taste did not rebel for his taste led him to the past and to adventure in a present not English but exotic He is not in the same field so to speak as Richardson and Fielding Dickens and Thackeray mister Hardy and mister Meredith and their field the great living world of their time is what the general reader wants the novelist to deal with as he best may Shakespeare to be sure wrote no drama on Elizabethan times in England we must go to Heywood and Ben Jonson for the drama of his contemporary world Many circumstances caused Stevenson when at his best to be a historical novelist and he is since Scott and Thackeray the best historical novelist whom we have Add to all this his notable eminence in tales of shorter scope in essays whether on life or on literature so various and original so graceful and so strong add the fantasies of his fables and remember that almost all he did is good and we must I think give to Stevenson a very high place in the literature of his century Of his verse I have hitherto said nothing and I do not think that if he had written verse alone his place would have been highly distinguished His Child s Garden of Verse is a little masterpiece in a genre of his own invention His verses in Scots are full of humour and he had a complete mastery of the old Northern English of the Lowlands His more serious poems often contain ideas and the expression of moods which he handled better I think in his prose Even the story of Ticonderoga I would rather have received from him in prose than in his ballad measure Possibly I am prejudiced a little by his willfulness in giving to a Cameron the part of the generous hero true to his word in spite of the desire to avenge a brother and of the thrice repeated monition of the dead It is not that I grudge any glory to the children of Lochiel a clan in General Wolfe s opinion the bravest where all were brave a clan of constant and boundless loyalty But in Stevenson s own note to his poem the Cameron swears by his sword and Ben Cruachan and Cruachan is a slogan of the Campbells The hero as a matter of fact was a Campbell of Inverawe Between the name of Cameron and that of Campbell the Muse will never hesitate says Stevenson One name means Wry mouth the other Crooked nose so far the Muse has a poor choice But the tale is a tale of the Campbells of Clan Diarmaid and the Muse must adhere to the historic truth This essay must not close on a difference of opinion concerning historical events a jarring note There are points enough in Stevenson s character and opinions which I have not touched such as his religious views He never mentioned the topic of religion in my hearing it is to his printed words that the reader must turn and he cannot but perceive that Stevenson s was a deeply religious nature With his faith whatever its tenets may have been was implicated his uneasily active conscience his sense of duty This appears to have directed his life and was practically the same thing as his sense of honour Honour I conceive is in a phrase of Aristotle s duty with a bloom on it Readers of his Letters and of his Biography by his cousin mister Balfour readers of his essays and of his novels must see that he was keenly interested in cases of conscience in the right course to steer in an apparent conflict of duties To say that his theory of the right course in a hypothetical instance was always the same as my own would be to abuse the confidence of the reader As Preston grange observes I would never charge myself with mister David s conscience and if you could cast some part of it as you went by in a moss bog you would find yourself to ride much easier without it and not perhaps always in the wrong direction There is a case of conscience in The Wrecker something about opium smuggling and the conscience of mister Loudon Dodd a truly Balfourian character which I have studied aided by other casuists for a summer s day We never could agree as to what the case really was as to what was the moral issue Casuistry may not be my strong point I have found myself between no less authorities than a Chancellor of England and a learned Jesuit both of whom I thought would certainly accept my view of a very unusual case of conduct A certain cleric in his ecclesiastical duties happened to overhear an automatically uttered remark by another person who never meant to speak or to be overheard The cleric acted on this information with results distressing to a pair of true lovers I maintained that he did wrong There was no appeal I said to the umpire Nobody in the field asked How s that But the Chancellor and the learned Jesuit backed the clergyman Now I never knew for certain how mister David s conscience would decide but I think he would have been with me on this occasion and with the Rules of the Game There was a very pleasant trait in Stevenson s character which perhaps does not display itself in most of his writings his great affection for children In A Child s Garden of Verse delightful as it is and not to be read without a great inclination to cry the child is himself the child that is gone But in an early letter he writes Kids is what is the matter with me Children are too good to be true He had a natural infatuation so to say for children as children which many men of the pen overcome with no apparent difficulty He could not overcome it little boys and girls were his delight and he was theirs At Molokai the Leper Island he played croquet with the little girls refusing to wear gloves lest he should remind them of their condition Sensitive and weak in body as he was Nelson was not more fearless It was equally characteristic of another quality of his the open hand that he gave a grand piano to these leper children He says But the nearest friends are the auldest friends And the grave s the place to seek them Among the nearest and the oldest friends of his I never was but to few friends nearer and older does my desiderium go back so frequently simply because almost every day brings something newly learned or known which would have appealed most to his unequaled breadth of knowledge and interest and sympathy ANDREW LANG AN INLAND VOYAGE Thus sang they in the English boat MARVELL TO SIR WALTER GRINDLAY SIMPSON BART My dear Cigarette It was enough that you should have shared so liberally in the rains and portages of our voyage that you should have had so hard a paddle to recover the derelict Arethusa on the flooded Oise and that you should thenceforth have piloted a mere wreck of mankind to Origny Sainte Benoite and a supper so eagerly desired It was perhaps more than enough as you once somewhat piteously complained that I should have set down all the strong language to you and kept the appropriate reflections for myself I could not in decency expose you to share the disgrace of another and more public shipwreck But now that this voyage of ours is going into a cheap edition that peril we shall hope is at an end and I may put your name on the burgee But I cannot pause till I have lamented the fate of our two ships That sir was not a fortunate day when we projected the possession of a canal barge it was not a fortunate day when we shared our daydream with the most hopeful of daydreamers For a while indeed the world looked smilingly The barge was procured and christened and as the Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne lay for some months the admired of all admirers in a pleasant river and under the walls of an ancient town M Mattras the accomplished carpenter of Moret had made her a centre of emulous labour and you will not have forgotten the amount of sweet champagne consumed in the inn at the bridge end to give zeal to the workmen and speed to the work On the financial aspect I would not willingly dwell The Eleven Thousand Virgins of Cologne rotted in the stream where she was beautified She felt not the impulse of the breeze she was never harnessed to the patent track horse And when at length she was sold by the indignant carpenter of Moret there were sold along with her the Arethusa and the Cigarette she of cedar she as we knew so keenly on a portage of solid hearted English oak Now these historic vessels fly the tricolour and are known by new and alien names R L S PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION To equip so small a book with a preface is I am half afraid to sin against proportion But a preface is more than an author can resist for it is the reward of his labours When the foundation stone is laid the architect appears with his plans and struts for an hour before the public eye So with the writer in his preface he may have never a word to say but he must show himself for a moment in the portico hat in hand and with an urbane demeanour It is best in such circumstances to represent a delicate shade of manner between humility and superiority as if the book had been written by someone else and you had merely run over it and inserted what was good But for my part I have not yet learned the trick to that perfection I am not yet able to dissemble the warmth of my sentiments towards a reader and if I meet him on the threshold it is to invite him in with country cordiality To say truth I had no sooner finished reading this little book in proof than I was seized upon by a distressing apprehension It occurred to me that I might not only be the first to read these pages but the last as well that I might have pioneered this very smiling tract of country all in vain and find not a soul to follow in my steps The more I thought the more I disliked the notion until the distaste grew into a sort of panic terror and I rushed into this Preface which is no more than an advertisement for readers What am I to say for my book Caleb and Joshua brought back from Palestine a formidable bunch of grapes alas my book produces naught so nourishing and for the matter of that we live in an age when people prefer a definition to any quantity of fruit I wonder would a negative be found enticing for from the negative point of view I flatter myself this volume has a certain stamp Although it runs to considerably upwards of two hundred pages it contains not a single reference to the imbecility of God s universe nor so much as a single hint that I could have made a better one myself I really do not know where my head can have been I seem to have forgotten all that makes it glorious to be man Tis an omission that renders the book philosophically unimportant but I am in hopes the eccentricity may please in frivolous circles To the friend who accompanied me I owe many thanks already indeed I wish I owed him nothing else but at this moment I feel towards him an almost exaggerated tenderness He at least will become my reader if it were only to follow his own travels alongside of mine R L S AN INLAND VOYAGE ANTWERP TO BOOM We made a great stir in Antwerp Docks A stevedore and a lot of dock porters took up the two canoes and ran with them for the slip A crowd of children followed cheering The Cigarette went off in a splash and a bubble of small breaking water Next moment the Arethusa was after her A steamer was coming down men on the paddle box shouted hoarse warnings the stevedore and his porters were bawling from the quay But in a stroke or two the canoes were away out in the middle of the Scheldt and all steamers and stevedores and other long shore vanities were left behind The sun shone brightly the tide was making four jolly miles an hour the wind blew steadily with occasional squalls For my part I had never been in a canoe under sail in my life and my first experiment out in the middle of this big river was not made without some trepidation What would happen when the wind first caught my little canvas I suppose it was almost as trying a venture into the regions of the unknown as to publish a first book or to marry But my doubts were not of long duration and in five minutes you will not be surprised to learn that I had tied my sheet I own I was a little struck by this circumstance myself of course in company with the rest of my fellow men I had always tied the sheet in a sailing boat but in so little and crank a concern as a canoe and with these charging squalls I was not prepared to find myself follow the same principle and it inspired me with some contemptuous views of our regard for life It is certainly easier to smoke with the sheet fastened but I had never before weighed a comfortable pipe of tobacco against an obvious risk and gravely elected for the comfortable pipe It is a commonplace that we cannot answer for ourselves before we have been tried But it is not so common a reflection and surely more consoling that we usually find ourselves a great deal braver and better than we thought I believe this is every one s experience but an apprehension that they may belie themselves in the future prevents mankind from trumpeting this cheerful sentiment abroad I wish sincerely for it would have saved me much trouble there had been some one to put me in a good heart about life when I was younger to tell me how dangers are most portentous on a distant sight and how the good in a man s spirit will not suffer itself to be overlaid and rarely or never deserts him in the hour of need But we are all for tootling on the sentimental flute in literature and not a man among us will go to the head of the march to sound the heady drums It was agreeable upon the river A barge or two went past laden with hay Reeds and willows bordered the stream and cattle and grey venerable horses came and hung their mild heads over the embankment Here and there was a pleasant village among trees with a noisy shipping yard here and there a villa in a lawn The wind served us well up the Scheldt and thereafter up the Rupel and we were running pretty free when we began to sight the brickyards of Boom lying for a long way on the right bank of the river The left bank was still green and pastoral with alleys of trees along the embankment and here and there a flight of steps to serve a ferry where perhaps there sat a woman with her elbows on her knees or an old gentleman with a staff and silver spectacles But Boom and its brickyards grew smokier and shabbier with every minute until a great church with a clock and a wooden bridge over the river indicated the central quarters of the town Boom is not a nice place and is only remarkable for one thing that the majority of the inhabitants have a private opinion that they can speak English which is not justified by fact This gave a kind of haziness to our intercourse As for the Hotel de la Navigation I think it is the worst feature of the place It boasts of a sanded parlour with a bar at one end looking on the street and another sanded parlour darker and colder with an empty bird cage and a tricolor subscription box by way of sole adornment where we made shift to dine in the company of three uncommunicative engineer apprentices and a silent bagman The food as usual in Belgium was of a nondescript occasional character indeed I have never been able to detect anything in the nature of a meal among this pleasing people they seem to peck and trifle with viands all day long in an amateur spirit tentatively French truly German and somehow falling between the two The empty bird cage swept and garnished and with no trace of the old piping favourite save where two wires had been pushed apart to hold its lump of sugar carried with it a sort of graveyard cheer The engineer apprentices would have nothing to say to us nor indeed to the bagman but talked low and sparingly to one another or raked us in the gaslight with a gleam of spectacles For though handsome lads they were all in the Scots phrase barnacled There was an English maid in the hotel who had been long enough out of England to pick up all sorts of funny foreign idioms and all sorts of curious foreign ways which need not here be specified She spoke to us very fluently in her jargon asked us information as to the manners of the present day in England and obligingly corrected us when we attempted to answer But as we were dealing with a woman perhaps our information was not so much thrown away as it appeared The sex likes to pick up knowledge and yet preserve its superiority It is good policy and almost necessary in the circumstances If a man finds a woman admire him were it only for his acquaintance with geography he will begin at once to build upon the admiration It is only by unintermittent snubbing that the pretty ones can keep us in our place Men as Miss Howe or Miss Harlowe would have said are such encroachers For my part I am body and soul with the women and after a well married couple there is nothing so beautiful in the world as the myth of the divine huntress It is no use for a man to take to the woods we know him saint Anthony tried the same thing long ago and had a pitiful time of it by all accounts But there is this about some women which overtops the best gymnosophist among men that they suffice to themselves and can walk in a high and cold zone without the countenance of any trousered being I declare although the reverse of a professed ascetic I am more obliged to women for this ideal than I should be to the majority of them or indeed to any but one for a spontaneous kiss There is nothing so encouraging as the spectacle of self sufficiency And when I think of the slim and lovely maidens running the woods all night to the note of Diana s horn moving among the old oaks as fancy free as they things of the forest and the starlight not touched by the commotion of man s hot and turbid life although there are plenty other ideals that I should prefer I find my heart beat at the thought of this one Tis to fail in life but to fail with what a grace That is not lost which is not regretted And where here slips out the male where would be much of the glory of inspiring love if there were no contempt to overcome ON THE WILLEBROEK CANAL Next morning when we set forth on the Willebroek Canal the rain began heavy and chill The water of the canal stood at about the drinking temperature of tea and under this cold aspersion the surface was covered with steam The exhilaration of departure and the easy motion of the boats under each stroke of the paddles supported us through this misfortune while it lasted and when the cloud passed and the sun came out again our spirits went up above the range of stay at home humours A good breeze rustled and shivered in the rows of trees that bordered the canal The leaves flickered in and out of the light in tumultuous masses It seemed sailing weather to eye and ear but down between the banks the wind reached us only in faint and desultory puffs There was hardly enough to steer by Progress was intermittent and unsatisfactory A jocular person of marine antecedents hailed us from the tow path with a C est vite mais c est long The canal was busy enough Every now and then we met or overtook a long string of boats with great green tillers high sterns with a window on either side of the rudder and perhaps a jug or a flower pot in one of the windows a dinghy following behind a woman busied about the day s dinner and a handful of children These barges were all tied one behind the other with tow ropes to the number of twenty five or thirty and the line was headed and kept in motion by a steamer of strange construction It had neither paddle wheel nor screw but by some gear not rightly comprehensible to the unmechanical mind it fetched up over its bow a small bright chain which lay along the bottom of the canal and paying it out again over the stern dragged itself forward link by link with its whole retinue of loaded skows Until one had found out the key to the enigma there was something solemn and uncomfortable in the progress of one of these trains as it moved gently along the water with nothing to mark its advance but an eddy alongside dying away into the wake Of all the creatures of commercial enterprise a canal barge is by far the most delightful to consider It may spread its sails and then you see it sailing high above the tree tops and the windmill sailing on the aqueduct sailing through the green corn lands the most picturesque of things amphibious Or the horse plods along at a foot pace as if there were no such thing as business in the world and the man dreaming at the tiller sees the same spire on the horizon all day long It is a mystery how things ever get to their destination at this rate and to see the barges waiting their turn at a lock affords a fine lesson of how easily the world may be taken There should be many contented spirits on board for such a life is both to travel and to stay at home The chimney smokes for dinner as you go along the banks of the canal slowly unroll their scenery to contemplative eyes the barge floats by great forests and through great cities with their public buildings and their lamps at night and for the barge in his floating home travelling abed it is merely as if he were listening to another man s story or turning the leaves of a picture book in which he had no concern He may take his afternoon walk in some foreign country on the banks of the canal and then come home to dinner at his own fireside There is not enough exercise in such a life for any high measure of health but a high measure of health is only necessary for unhealthy people The slug of a fellow who is never ill nor well has a quiet time of it in life and dies all the easier I am sure I would rather be a barge than occupy any position under heaven that required attendance at an office There are few callings I should say where a man gives up less of his liberty in return for regular meals The barge is on shipboard he is master in his own ship he can land whenever he will he can never be kept beating off a lee shore a whole frosty night when the sheets are as hard as iron and so far as I can make out time stands as nearly still with him as is compatible with the return of bed time or the dinner hour It is not easy to see why a barge should ever die Half way between Willebroek and Villevorde in a beautiful reach of canal like a squire s avenue we went ashore to lunch There were two eggs a junk of bread and a bottle of wine on board the Arethusa and two eggs and an Etna cooking apparatus on board the Cigarette The master of the latter boat smashed one of the eggs in the course of disembarkation but observing pleasantly that it might still be cooked a la papier he dropped it into the Etna in its covering of Flemish newspaper We landed in a blink of fine weather but we had not been two minutes ashore before the wind freshened into half a gale and the rain began to patter on our shoulders We sat as close about the Etna as we could The spirits burned with great ostentation the grass caught flame every minute or two and had to be trodden out and before long there were several burnt fingers of the party But the solid quantity of cookery accomplished was out of proportion with so much display and when we desisted after two applications of the fire the sound egg was little more than loo warm and as for a la papier it was a cold and sordid fricassee of printer s ink and broken egg shell We made shift to roast the other two by putting them close to the burning spirits and that with better success And then we uncorked the bottle of wine and sat down in a ditch with our canoe aprons over our knees It rained smartly Discomfort when it is honestly uncomfortable and makes no nauseous pretensions to the contrary is a vastly humorous business and people well steeped and stupefied in the open air are in a good vein for laughter From this point of view even egg a la papier offered by way of food may pass muster as a sort of accessory to the fun But this manner of jest although it may be taken in good part does not invite repetition and from that time forward the Etna voyaged like a gentleman in the locker of the Cigarette It is almost unnecessary to mention that when lunch was over and we got aboard again and made sail the wind promptly died away The rest of the journey to Villevorde we still spread our canvas to the unfavouring air and with now and then a puff and now and then a spell of paddling drifted along from lock to lock between the orderly trees It was a fine green fat landscape or rather a mere green water lane going on from village to village Things had a settled look as in places long lived in Crop headed children spat upon us from the bridges as we went below with a true conservative feeling But even more conservative were the fishermen intent upon their floats who let us go by without one glance They perched upon sterlings and buttresses and along the slope of the embankment gently occupied They were indifferent like pieces of dead nature They did not move any more than if they had been fishing in an old Dutch print The leaves fluttered the water lapped but they continued in one stay like so many churches established by law You might have trepanned every one of their innocent heads and found no more than so much coiled fishing line below their skulls I do not care for your stalwart fellows in india rubber stockings breasting up mountain torrents with a salmon rod but I do dearly love the class of man who plies his unfruitful art for ever and a day by still and depopulated waters At the last lock just beyond Villevorde there was a lock mistress who spoke French comprehensibly and told us we were still a couple of leagues from Brussels At the same place the rain began again It fell in straight parallel lines and the surface of the canal was thrown up into an infinity of little crystal fountains There were no beds to be had in the neighbourhood Nothing for it but to lay the sails aside and address ourselves to steady paddling in the rain Beautiful country houses with clocks and long lines of shuttered windows and fine old trees standing in groves and avenues gave a rich and sombre aspect in the rain and the deepening dusk to the shores of the canal I seem to have seen something of the same effect in engravings opulent landscapes deserted and overhung with the passage of storm And throughout we had the escort of a hooded cart which trotted shabbily along the tow path and kept at an almost uniform distance in our wake THE ROYAL SPORT NAUTIQUE The rain took off near Laeken But the sun was already down the air was chill and we had scarcely a dry stitch between the pair of us Nay now we found ourselves near the end of the Allee Verte and on the very threshold of Brussels we were confronted by a serious difficulty The shores were closely lined by canal boats waiting their turn at the lock Nowhere was there any convenient landing place nowhere so much as a stable yard to leave the canoes in for the night We scrambled ashore and entered an estaminet where some sorry fellows were drinking with the landlord The landlord was pretty round with us he knew of no coach house or stable yard nothing of the sort and seeing we had come with no mind to drink he did not conceal his impatience to be rid of us One of the sorry fellows came to the rescue Somewhere in the corner of the basin there was a slip he informed us and something else besides not very clearly defined by him but hopefully construed by his hearers Sure enough there was the slip in the corner of the basin and at the top of it two nice looking lads in boating clothes The Arethusa addressed himself to these One of them said there would be no difficulty about a night s lodging for our boats and the other taking a cigarette from his lips inquired if they were made by Searle and Son The name was quite an introduction Half a dozen other young men came out of a boat house bearing the superscription ROYAL SPORT NAUTIQUE and joined in the talk They were all very polite voluble and enthusiastic and their discourse was interlarded with English boating terms and the names of English boat builders and English clubs I do not know to my shame any spot in my native land where I should have been so warmly received by the same number of people We were English boating men and the Belgian boating men fell upon our necks I wonder if French Huguenots were as cordially greeted by English Protestants when they came across the Channel out of great tribulation But after all what religion knits people so closely as a common sport The canoes were carried into the boat house they were washed down for us by the Club servants the sails were hung out to dry and everything made as snug and tidy as a picture And in the meanwhile we were led upstairs by our new found brethren for so more than one of them stated the relationship and made free of their lavatory This one lent us soap that one a towel a third and fourth helped us to undo our bags And all the time such questions such assurances of respect and sympathy I declare I never knew what glory was before Yes yes the Royal Sport Nautique is the oldest club in Belgium We number two hundred We this is not a substantive speech but an abstract of many speeches the impression left upon my mind after a great deal of talk and very youthful pleasant natural and patriotic it seems to me to be We have gained all races except those where we were cheated by the French You must leave all your wet things to be dried O entre freres In any boat house in England we should find the same I cordially hope they might En Angleterre vous employez des sliding seats n est ce pas We are all employed in commerce during the day but in the evening voyez vous nous sommes serieux These were the words They were all employed over the frivolous mercantile concerns of Belgium during the day but in the evening they found some hours for the serious concerns of life I may have a wrong idea of wisdom but I think that was a very wise remark People connected with literature and philosophy are busy all their days in getting rid of second hand notions and false standards It is their profession in the sweat of their brows by dogged thinking to recover their old fresh view of life and distinguish what they really and originally like from what they have only learned to tolerate perforce And these Royal Nautical Sportsmen had the distinction still quite legible in their hearts They had still those clean perceptions of what is nice and nasty what is interesting and what is dull which envious old gentlemen refer to as illusions The nightmare illusion of middle age the bear s hug of custom gradually squeezing the life out of a man s soul had not yet begun for these happy starred young Belgians They still knew that the interest they took in their business was a trifling affair compared to their spontaneous long suffering affection for nautical sports To know what you prefer instead of humbly saying Amen to what the world tells you you ought to prefer is to have kept your soul alive Such a man may be generous he may be honest in something more than the commercial sense he may love his friends with an elective personal sympathy and not accept them as an adjunct of the station to which he has been called He may be a man in short acting on his own instincts keeping in his own shape that God made him in and not a mere crank in the social engine house welded on principles that he does not understand and for purposes that he does not care for For will any one dare to tell me that business is more entertaining than fooling among boats He must have never seen a boat or never seen an office who says so And for certain the one is a great deal better for the health There should be nothing so much a man s business as his amusements Nothing but money grubbing can be put forward to the contrary no one but Mammon the least erected spirit that fell From Heaven durst risk a word in answer It is but a lying cant that would represent the merchant and the banker as people disinterestedly toiling for mankind and then most useful when they are most absorbed in their transactions for the man is more important than his services And when my Royal Nautical Sportsman shall have so far fallen from his hopeful youth that he cannot pluck up an enthusiasm over anything but his ledger I venture to doubt whether he will be near so nice a fellow and whether he would welcome with so good a grace a couple of drenched Englishmen paddling into Brussels in the dusk When we had changed our wet clothes and drunk a glass of pale ale to the Club s prosperity one of their number escorted us to an hotel He would not join us at our dinner but he had no objection to a glass of wine Enthusiasm is very wearing and I begin to understand why prophets were unpopular in Judea where they were best known For three stricken hours did this excellent young man sit beside us to dilate on boats and boat races and before he left he was kind enough to order our bedroom candles We endeavoured now and again to change the subject but the diversion did not last a moment the Royal Nautical Sportsman bridled shied answered the question and then breasted once more into the swelling tide of his subject I call it his subject but I think it was he who was subjected The Arethusa who holds all racing as a creature of the devil found himself in a pitiful dilemma He durst not own his ignorance for the honour of Old England and spoke away about English clubs and English oarsmen whose fame had never before come to his ears Several times and once above all on the question of sliding seats he was within an ace of exposure As for the Cigarette who has rowed races in the heat of his blood but now disowns these slips of his wanton youth his case was still more desperate for the Royal Nautical proposed that he should take an oar in one of their eights on the morrow to compare the English with the Belgian stroke I could see my friend perspiring in his chair whenever that particular topic came up And there was yet another proposal which had the same effect on both of us It appeared that the champion canoeist of Europe as well as most other champions was a Royal Nautical Sportsman And if we would only wait until the Sunday this infernal paddler would be so condescending as to accompany us on our next stage Neither of us had the least desire to drive the coursers of the sun against Apollo When the young man was gone we countermanded our candles and ordered some brandy and water The great billows had gone over our head The Royal Nautical Sportsmen were as nice young fellows as a man would wish to see but they were a trifle too young and a thought too nautical for us We began to see that we were old and cynical we liked ease and the agreeable rambling of the human mind about this and the other subject we did not want to disgrace our native land by messing an eight or toiling pitifully in the wake of the champion canoeist In short we had recourse to flight It seemed ungrateful but we tried to make that good on a card loaded with sincere compliments And indeed it was no time for scruples we seemed to feel the hot breath of the champion on our necks AT MAUBEUGE Partly from the terror we had of our good friends the Royal Nauticals partly from the fact that there were no fewer than fifty five locks between Brussels and Charleroi we concluded that we should travel by train across the frontier boats and all Fifty five locks in a day s journey was pretty well tantamount to trudging the whole distance on foot with the canoes upon our shoulders an object of astonishment to the trees on the canal side and of honest derision to all right thinking children To pass the frontier even in a train is a difficult matter for the Arethusa He is somehow or other a marked man for the official eye Wherever he journeys there are the officers gathered together Treaties are solemnly signed foreign ministers ambassadors and consuls sit throned in state from China to Peru and the Union Jack flutters on all the winds of heaven Under these safeguards portly clergymen schoolmistresses gentlemen in grey tweed suits and all the ruck and rabble of British touristry pour unhindered Murray in hand over the railways of the Continent and yet the slim person of the Arethusa is taken in the meshes while these great fish go on their way rejoicing If he travels without a passport he is cast without any figure about the matter into noisome dungeons if his papers are in order he is suffered to go his way indeed but not until he has been humiliated by a general incredulity He is a born British subject yet he has never succeeded in persuading a single official of his nationality He flatters himself he is indifferent honest yet he is rarely taken for anything better than a spy and there is no absurd and disreputable means of livelihood but has been attributed to him in some heat of official or popular distrust For the life of me I cannot understand it I too have been knolled to church and sat at good men s feasts but I bear no mark of it I am as strange as a Jack Indian to their official spectacles I might come from any part of the globe it seems except from where I do My ancestors have laboured in vain and the glorious Constitution cannot protect me in my walks abroad It is a great thing believe me to present a good normal type of the nation you belong to Nobody else was asked for his papers on the way to Maubeuge but I was and although I clung to my rights I had to choose at last between accepting the humiliation and being left behind by the train I was sorry to give way but I wanted to get to Maubeuge Maubeuge is a fortified town with a very good inn the Grand Cerf It seemed to be inhabited principally by soldiers and bagmen at least these were all that we saw except the hotel servants We had to stay there some time for the canoes were in no hurry to follow us and at last stuck hopelessly in the custom house until we went back to liberate them There was nothing to do nothing to see We had good meals which was a great matter but that was all The Cigarette was nearly taken up upon a charge of drawing the fortifications a feat of which he was hopelessly incapable And besides as I suppose each belligerent nation has a plan of the other s fortified places already these precautions are of the nature of shutting the stable door after the steed is away But I have no doubt they help to keep up a good spirit at home It is a great thing if you can persuade people that they are somehow or other partakers in a mystery It makes them feel bigger Even the Freemasons who have been shown up to satiety preserve a kind of pride and not a grocer among them however honest harmless and empty headed he may feel himself to be at bottom but comes home from one of their coenacula with a portentous significance for himself It is an odd thing how happily two people if there are two can live in a place where they have no acquaintance I think the spectacle of a whole life in which you have no part paralysis personal desire You are content to become a mere spectator The baker stands in his door the colonel with his three medals goes by to the cafe at night the troops drum and trumpet and man the ramparts as bold as so many lions It would task language to say how placidly you behold all this In a place where you have taken some root you are provoked out of your indifference you have a hand in the game your friends are fighting with the army But in a strange town not small enough to grow too soon familiar nor so large as to have laid itself out for travellers you stand so far apart from the business that you positively forget it would be possible to go nearer you have so little human interest around you that you do not remember yourself to be a man Perhaps in a very short time you would be one no longer Gymnosophists go into a wood with all nature seething around them with romance on every side it would be much more to the purpose if they took up their abode in a dull country town where they should see just so much of humanity as to keep them from desiring more and only the stale externals of man s life These externals are as dead to us as so many formalities and speak a dead language in our eyes and ears They have no more meaning than an oath or a salutation We are so much accustomed to see married couples going to church of a Sunday that we have clean forgotten what they represent and novelists are driven to rehabilitate adultery no less when they wish to show us what a beautiful thing it is for a man and a woman to live for each other One person in Maubeuge however showed me something more than his outside That was the driver of the hotel omnibus a mean enough looking little man as well as I can remember but with a spark of something human in his soul He had heard of our little journey and came to me at once in envious sympathy How he longed to travel he told me How he longed to be somewhere else and see the round world before he went into the grave Here I am said he I drive to the station Well And then I drive back again to the hotel And so on every day and all the week round My God is that life I could not say I thought it was for him He pressed me to tell him where I had been and where I hoped to go and as he listened I declare the fellow sighed Might not this have been a brave African traveller or gone to the Indies after Drake But it is an evil age for the gypsily inclined among men He who can sit squarest on a three legged stool he it is who has the wealth and glory I wonder if my friend is still driving the omnibus for the Grand Cerf Not very likely I believe for I think he was on the eve of mutiny when we passed through and perhaps our passage determined him for good Better a thousand times that he should be a tramp and mend pots and pans by the wayside and sleep under trees and see the dawn and the sunset every day above a new horizon I think I hear you say that it is a respectable position to drive an omnibus Very well What right has he who likes it not to keep those who would like it dearly out of this respectable position Suppose a dish were not to my taste and you told me that it was a favourite amongst the rest of the company what should I conclude from that Not to finish the dish against my stomach I suppose Respectability is a very good thing in its way but it does not rise superior to all considerations I would not for a moment venture to hint that it was a matter of taste but I think I will go as far as this that if a position is admittedly unkind uncomfortable unnecessary and superfluously useless although it were as respectable as the Church of England the sooner a man is out of it the better for himself and all concerned ON THE SAMBRE CANALISED TO QUARTES About three in the afternoon the whole establishment of the Grand Cerf accompanied us to the water s edge The man of the omnibus was there with haggard eyes Poor cage bird Do I not remember the time when I myself haunted the station to watch train after train carry its complement of freemen into the night and read the names of distant places on the time bills with indescribable longings We were not clear of the fortifications before the rain began The wind was contrary and blew in furious gusts nor were the aspects of nature any more clement than the doings of the sky For we passed through a stretch of blighted country sparsely covered with brush but handsomely enough diversified with factory chimneys We landed in a soiled meadow among some pollards and there smoked a pipe in a flaw of fair weather But the wind blew so hard we could get little else to smoke There were no natural objects in the neighbourhood but some sordid workshops A group of children headed by a tall girl stood and watched us from a little distance all the time we stayed I heartily wonder what they thought of us At Hautmont the lock was almost impassable the landing place being steep and high and the launch at a long distance Near a dozen grimy workmen lent us a hand They refused any reward and what is much better refused it handsomely without conveying any sense of insult It is a way we have in our countryside said they And a very becoming way it is In Scotland where also you will get services for nothing the good people reject your money as if you had been trying to corrupt a voter When people take the trouble to do dignified acts it is worth while to take a little more and allow the dignity to be common to all concerned But in our brave Saxon countries where we plod threescore years and ten in the mud and the wind keeps singing in our ears from birth to burial we do our good and bad with a high hand and almost offensively and make even our alms a witness bearing and an act of war against the wrong After Hautmont the sun came forth again and the wind went down and a little paddling took us beyond the ironworks and through a delectable land The river wound among low hills so that sometimes the sun was at our backs and sometimes it stood right ahead and the river before us was one sheet of intolerable glory On either hand meadows and orchards bordered with a margin of sedge and water flowers upon the river The hedges were of great height woven about the trunks of hedgerow elms and the fields as they were often very small looked like a series of bowers along the stream There was never any prospect sometimes a hill top with its trees would look over the nearest hedgerow just to make a middle distance for the sky but that was all The heaven was bare of clouds The atmosphere after the rain was of enchanting purity The river doubled among the hillocks a shining strip of mirror glass and the dip of the paddles set the flowers shaking along the brink In the meadows wandered black and white cattle fantastically marked One beast with a white head and the rest of the body glossy black came to the edge to drink and stood gravely twitching his ears at me as I went by like some sort of preposterous clergyman in a play A moment after I heard a loud plunge and turning my head saw the clergyman struggling to shore The bank had given way under his feet Besides the cattle we saw no living things except a few birds and a great many fishermen These sat along the edges of the meadows sometimes with one rod sometimes with as many as half a score They seemed stupefied with contentment and when we induced them to exchange a few words with us about the weather their voices sounded quiet and far away There was a strange diversity of opinion among them as to the kind of fish for which they set their lures although they were all agreed in this that the river was abundantly supplied Where it was plain that no two of them had ever caught the same kind of fish we could not help suspecting that perhaps not any one of them had ever caught a fish at all I hope since the afternoon was so lovely that they were one and all rewarded and that a silver booty went home in every basket for the pot Some of my friends would cry shame on me for this but I prefer a man were he only an angler to the bravest pair of gills in all God s waters I do not affect fishes unless when cooked in sauce whereas an angler is an important piece of river scenery and hence deserves some recognition among canoeists He can always tell you where you are after a mild fashion and his quiet presence serves to accentuate the solitude and stillness and remind you of the glittering citizens below your boat The Sambre turned so industriously to and fro among his little hills that it was past six before we drew near the lock at Quartes There were some children on the tow path with whom the Cigarette fell into a chaffing talk as they ran along beside us It was in vain that I warned him In vain I told him in English that boys were the most dangerous creatures and if once you began with them it was safe to end in a shower of stones For my own part whenever anything was addressed to me I smiled gently and shook my head as though I were an inoffensive person inadequately acquainted with French For indeed I have had such experience at home that I would sooner meet many wild animals than a troop of healthy urchins But I was doing injustice to these peaceable young Hainaulters When the Cigarette went off to make inquiries I got out upon the bank to smoke a pipe and superintend the boats and became at once the centre of much amiable curiosity The children had been joined by this time by a young woman and a mild lad who had lost an arm and this gave me more security When I let slip my first word or so in French a little girl nodded her head with a comical grown up air Ah you see she said he understands well enough now he was just making believe And the little group laughed together very good naturedly They were much impressed when they heard we came from England and the little girl proffered the information that England was an island and a far way from here bien loin d ici Ay you may say that a far way from here said the lad with one arm I was as nearly home sick as ever I was in my life they seemed to make it such an incalculable distance to the place where I first saw the day They admired the canoes very much And I observed one piece of delicacy in these children which is worthy of record They had been deafening us for the last hundred yards with petitions for a sail ay and they deafened us to the same tune next morning when we came to start but then when the canoes were lying empty there was no word of any such petition Delicacy or perhaps a bit of fear for the water in so crank a vessel I hate cynicism a great deal worse than I do the devil unless perhaps the two were the same thing And yet tis a good tonic the cold tub and bath towel of the sentiments and positively necessary to life in cases of advanced sensibility From the boats they turned to my costume They could not make enough of my red sash and my knife filled them with awe They make them like that in England said the boy with one arm I was glad he did not know how badly we make them in England nowadays They are for people who go away to sea he added and to defend one s life against great fish I felt I was becoming a more and more romantic figure to the little group at every word And so I suppose I was Even my pipe although it was an ordinary French clay pretty well trousered as they call it would have a rarity in their eyes as a thing coming from so far away And if my feathers were not very fine in themselves they were all from over seas One thing in my outfit however tickled them out of all politeness and that was the bemired condition of my canvas shoes I suppose they were sure the mud at any rate was a home product The little girl who was the genius of the party displayed her own sabots in competition and I wish you could have seen how gracefully and merrily she did it The young woman s milk can a great amphora of hammered brass stood some way off upon the sward I was glad of an opportunity to divert public attention from myself and return some of the compliments I had received So I admired it cordially both for form and colour telling them and very truly that it was as beautiful as gold They were not surprised The things were plainly the boast of the countryside And the children expatiated on the costliness of these amphorae which sell sometimes as high as thirty francs apiece told me how they were carried on donkeys one on either side of the saddle a brave caparison in themselves and how they were to be seen all over the district and at the larger farms in great number and of great size PONT SUR SAMBRE WE ARE PEDLARS The Cigarette returned with good news There were beds to be had some ten minutes walk from where we were at a place called Pont We stowed the canoes in a granary and asked among the children for a guide The circle at once widened round us and our offers of reward were received in dispiriting silence We were plainly a pair of Bluebeards to the children they might speak to us in public places and where they had the advantage of numbers but it was another thing to venture off alone with two uncouth and legendary characters who had dropped from the clouds upon their hamlet this quiet afternoon sashed and be knived and with a flavour of great voyages The owner of the granary came to our assistance singled out one little fellow and threatened him with corporalities or I suspect we should have had to find the way for ourselves As it was he was more frightened at the granary man than the strangers having perhaps had some experience of the former But I fancy his little heart must have been going at a fine rate for he kept trotting at a respectful distance in front and looking back at us with scared eyes Not otherwise may the children of the young world have guided Jove or one of his Olympian compeers on an adventure A miry lane led us up from Quartes with its church and bickering windmill The hinds were trudging homewards from the fields A brisk little woman passed us by She was seated across a donkey between a pair of glittering milk cans and as she went she kicked jauntily with her heels upon the donkey s side and scattered shrill remarks among the wayfarers It was notable that none of the tired men took the trouble to reply Our conductor soon led us out of the lane and across country The sun had gone down but the west in front of us was one lake of level gold The path wandered a while in the open and then passed under a trellis like a bower indefinitely prolonged On either hand were shadowy orchards cottages lay low among the leaves and sent their smoke to heaven every here and there in an opening appeared the great gold face of the west I never saw the Cigarette in such an idyllic frame of mind He waxed positively lyrical in praise of country scenes I was little less exhilarated myself the mild air of the evening the shadows the rich lights and the silence made a symphonious accompaniment about our walk and we both determined to avoid towns for the future and sleep in hamlets At last the path went between two houses and turned the party out into a wide muddy high road bordered as far as the eye could reach on either hand by an unsightly village The houses stood well back leaving a ribbon of waste land on either side of the road where there were stacks of firewood carts barrows rubbish heaps and a little doubtful grass Away on the left a gaunt tower stood in the middle of the street What it had been in past ages I know not probably a hold in time of war but nowadays it bore an illegible dial plate in its upper parts and near the bottom an iron letter box The inn to which we had been recommended at Quartes was full or else the landlady did not like our looks I ought to say that with our long damp india rubber bags we presented rather a doubtful type of civilization like rag and bone men the Cigarette imagined These gentlemen are pedlars Ces messieurs sont des marchands asked the landlady And then without waiting for an answer which I suppose she thought superfluous in so plain a case recommended us to a butcher who lived hard by the tower and took in travellers to lodge Thither went we But the butcher was flitting and all his beds were taken down Or else he didn t like our look As a parting shot we had These gentlemen are pedlars It began to grow dark in earnest We could no longer distinguish the faces of the people who passed us by with an inarticulate good evening And the householders of Pont seemed very economical with their oil for we saw not a single window lighted in all that long village I believe it is the longest village in the world but I daresay in our predicament every pace counted three times over We were much cast down when we came to the last auberge and looking in at the dark door asked timidly if we could sleep there for the night A female voice assented in no very friendly tones We clapped the bags down and found our way to chairs The place was in total darkness save a red glow in the chinks and ventilators of the stove But now the landlady lit a lamp to see her new guests I suppose the darkness was what saved us another expulsion for I cannot say she looked gratified at our appearance We were in a large bare apartment adorned with two allegorical prints of Music and Painting and a copy of the law against public drunkenness On one side there was a bit of a bar with some half a dozen bottles Two labourers sat waiting supper in attitudes of extreme weariness a plain looking lass bustled about with a sleepy child of two and the landlady began to derange the pots upon the stove and set some beefsteak to grill These gentlemen are pedlars she asked sharply And that was all the conversation forthcoming We began to think we might be pedlars after all I never knew a population with so narrow a range of conjecture as the innkeepers of Pont sur Sambre But manners and bearing have not a wider currency than bank notes You have only to get far enough out of your beat and all your accomplished airs will go for nothing These Hainaulters could see no difference between us and the average pedlar Indeed we had some grounds for reflection while the steak was getting ready to see how perfectly they accepted us at their own valuation and how our best politeness and best efforts at entertainment seemed to fit quite suitably with the character of packmen At least it seemed a good account of the profession in France that even before such judges we could not beat them at our own weapons At last we were called to table The two hinds and one of them looked sadly worn and white in the face as though sick with over work and under feeding supped off a single plate of some sort of bread berry some potatoes in their jackets a small cup of coffee sweetened with sugar candy and one tumbler of swipes The landlady her son and the lass aforesaid took the same Our meal was quite a banquet by comparison We had some beefsteak not so tender as it might have been some of the potatoes some cheese an extra glass of the swipes and white sugar in our coffee You see what it is to be a gentleman I beg your pardon what it is to be a pedlar It had not before occurred to me that a pedlar was a great man in a labourer s alehouse but now that I had to enact the part for an evening I found that so it was He has in his hedge quarters somewhat the same pre eminency as the man who takes a private parlour in a hotel The more you look into it the more infinite are the class distinctions among men and possibly by a happy dispensation there is no one at all at the bottom of the scale no one but can find some superiority over somebody else to keep up his pride withal We were displeased enough with our fare Particularly the Cigarette for I tried to make believe that I was amused with the adventure tough beefsteak and all According to the Lucretian maxim our steak should have been flavoured by the look of the other people s bread berry But we did not find it so in practice You may have a head knowledge that other people live more poorly than yourself but it is not agreeable I was going to say it is against the etiquette of the universe to sit at the same table and pick your own superior diet from among their crusts I had not seen such a thing done since the greedy boy at school with his birthday cake It was odious enough to witness I could remember and I had never thought to play the part myself But there again you see what it is to be a pedlar There is no doubt that the poorer classes in our country are much more charitably disposed than their superiors in wealth And I fancy it must arise a great deal from the comparative indistinction of the easy and the not so easy in these ranks A workman or a pedlar cannot shutter himself off from his less comfortable neighbours If he treats himself to a luxury he must do it in the face of a dozen who cannot And what should more directly lead to charitable thoughts Thus the poor man camping out in life sees it as it is and knows that every mouthful he puts in his belly has been wrenched out of the fingers of the hungry But at a certain stage of prosperity as in a balloon ascent the fortunate person passes through a zone of clouds and sublunary matters are thenceforward hidden from his view He sees nothing but the heavenly bodies all in admirable order and positively as good as new He finds himself surrounded in the most touching manner by the attentions of Providence and compares himself involuntarily with the lilies and the skylarks He does not precisely sing of course but then he looks so unassuming in his open landau If all the world dined at one table this philosophy would meet with some rude knocks PONT SUR SAMBRE THE TRAVELLING MERCHANT Like the lackeys in Moliere s farce when the true nobleman broke in on their high life below stairs we were destined to be confronted with a real pedlar To make the lesson still more poignant for fallen gentlemen like us he was a pedlar of infinitely more consideration than the sort of scurvy fellows we were taken for like a lion among mice or a ship of war bearing down upon two cock boats Indeed he did not deserve the name of pedlar at all he was a travelling merchant I suppose it was about half past eight when this worthy Monsieur Hector Gilliard of Maubeuge turned up at the alehouse door in a tilt cart drawn by a donkey and cried cheerily on the inhabitants He was a lean nervous flibbertigibbet of a man with something the look of an actor and something the look of a horse jockey He had evidently prospered without any of the favours of education for he adhered with stern simplicity to the masculine gender and in the course of the evening passed off some fancy futures in a very florid style of architecture With him came his wife a comely young woman with her hair tied in a yellow kerchief and their son a little fellow of four in a blouse and military kepi It was notable that the child was many degrees better dressed than either of the parents We were informed he was already at a boarding school but the holidays having just commenced he was off to spend them with his parents on a cruise An enchanting holiday occupation was it not to travel all day with father and mother in the tilt cart full of countless treasures the green country rattling by on either side and the children in all the villages contemplating him with envy and wonder It is better fun during the holidays to be the son of a travelling merchant than son and heir to the greatest cotton spinner in creation And as for being a reigning prince indeed I never saw one if it was not Master Gilliard While M Hector and the son of the house were putting up the donkey and getting all the valuables under lock and key the landlady warmed up the remains of our beefsteak and fried the cold potatoes in slices and Madame Gilliard set herself to waken the boy who had come far that day and was peevish and dazzled by the light He was no sooner awake than he began to prepare himself for supper by eating galette unripe pears and cold potatoes with so far as I could judge positive benefit to his appetite The landlady fired with motherly emulation awoke her own little girl and the two children were confronted Master Gilliard looked at her for a moment very much as a dog looks at his own reflection in a mirror before he turns away He was at that time absorbed in the galette His mother seemed crestfallen that he should display so little inclination towards the other sex and expressed her disappointment with some candour and a very proper reference to the influence of years Sure enough a time will come when he will pay more attention to the girls and think a great deal less of his mother let us hope she will like it as well as she seemed to fancy But it is odd enough the very women who profess most contempt for mankind as a sex seem to find even its ugliest particulars rather lively and high minded in their own sons The little girl looked longer and with more interest probably because she was in her own house while he was a traveller and accustomed to strange sights And besides there was no galette in the case with her All the time of supper there was nothing spoken of but my young lord The two parents were both absurdly fond of their child Monsieur kept insisting on his sagacity how he knew all the children at school by name and when this utterly failed on trial how he was cautious and exact to a strange degree and if asked anything he would sit and think and think and if he did not know it my faith he wouldn t tell you at all ma foi il ne vous le dira pas which is certainly a very high degree of caution At intervals M Hector would appeal to his wife with his mouth full of beefsteak as to the little fellow s age at such or such a time when he had said or done something memorable and I noticed that Madame usually pooh poohed these inquiries She herself was not boastful in her vein but she never had her fill of caressing the child and she seemed to take a gentle pleasure in recalling all that was fortunate in his little existence No schoolboy could have talked more of the holidays which were just beginning and less of the black school time which must inevitably follow after She showed with a pride perhaps partly mercantile in origin his pockets preposterously swollen with tops and whistles and string When she called at a house in the way of business it appeared he kept her company and whenever a sale was made received a sou out of the profit Indeed they spoiled him vastly these two good people But they had an eye to his manners for all that and reproved him for some little faults in breeding which occurred from time to time during supper On the whole I was not much hurt at being taken for a pedlar I might think that I ate with greater delicacy or that my mistakes in French belonged to a different order but it was plain that these distinctions would be thrown away upon the landlady and the two labourers In all essential things we and the Gilliards cut very much the same figure in the alehouse kitchen M Hector was more at home indeed and took a higher tone with the world but that was explicable on the ground of his driving a donkey cart while we poor bodies tramped afoot I daresay the rest of the company thought us dying with envy though in no ill sense to be as far up in the profession as the new arrival And of one thing I am sure that every one thawed and became more humanized and conversible as soon as these innocent people appeared upon the scene I would not very readily trust the travelling merchant with any extravagant sum of money but I am sure his heart was in the right place In this mixed world if you can find one or two sensible places in a man above all if you should find a whole family living together on such pleasant terms you may surely be satisfied and take the rest for granted or what is a great deal better boldly make up your mind that you can do perfectly well without the rest and that ten thousand bad traits cannot make a single good one any the less good It was getting late M Hector lit a stable lantern and went off to his cart for some arrangements and my young gentleman proceeded to divest himself of the better part of his raiment and play gymnastics on his mother s lap and thence on to the floor with accompaniment of laughter Are you going to sleep alone asked the servant lass There s little fear of that says Master Gilliard You sleep alone at school objected his mother Come come you must be a man But he protested that school was a different matter from the holidays that there were dormitories at school and silenced the discussion with kisses his mother smiling no one better pleased than she There certainly was as he phrased it very little fear that he should sleep alone for there was but one bed for the trio We on our part had firmly protested against one man s accommodation for two and we had a double bedded pen in the loft of the house furnished beside the beds with exactly three hat pegs and one table There was not so much as a glass of water But the window would open by good fortune Some time before I fell asleep the loft was full of the sound of mighty snoring the Gilliards and the labourers and the people of the inn all at it I suppose with one consent The young moon outside shone very clearly over Pont sur Sambre and down upon the alehouse where all we pedlars were abed ON THE SAMBRE CANALISED TO LANDRECIES In the morning when we came downstairs the landlady pointed out to us two pails of water behind the street door Voila de l eau pour vous debarbouiller says she And so there we made a shift to wash ourselves while Madame Gilliard brushed the family boots on the outer doorstep and M Hector whistling cheerily arranged some small goods for the day s campaign in a portable chest of drawers which formed a part of his baggage Meanwhile the child was letting off Waterloo crackers all over the floor I wonder by the bye what they call Waterloo crackers in France perhaps Austerlitz crackers There is a great deal in the point of view Do you remember the Frenchman who travelling by way of Southampton was put down in Waterloo Station and had to drive across Waterloo Bridge He had a mind to go home again it seems Pont itself is on the river but whereas it is ten minutes walk from Quartes by dry land it is six weary kilometres by water We left our bags at the inn and walked to our canoes through the wet orchards unencumbered Some of the children were there to see us off but we were no longer the mysterious beings of the night before A departure is much less romantic than an unexplained arrival in the golden evening Although we might be greatly taken at a ghost s first appearance we should behold him vanish with comparative equanimity The good folk of the inn at Pont when we called there for the bags were overcome with marveling At sight of these two dainty little boats with a fluttering Union Jack on each and all the varnish shining from the sponge they began to perceive that they had entertained angels unawares The landlady stood upon the bridge probably lamenting she had charged so little the son ran to and fro and called out the neighbours to enjoy the sight and we paddled away from quite a crowd of rapt observers These gentlemen pedlars indeed Now you see their quality too late The whole day was showery with occasional drenching plumps We were soaked to the skin then partially dried in the sun then soaked once more But there were some calm intervals and one notably when we were skirting the forest of Mormal a sinister name to the ear but a place most gratifying to sight and smell It looked solemn along the riverside drooping its boughs into the water and piling them up aloft into a wall of leaves What is a forest but a city of nature s own full of hardy and innocuous living things where there is nothing dead and nothing made with the hands but the citizens themselves are the houses and public monuments There is nothing so much alive and yet so quiet as a woodland and a pair of people swinging past in canoes feel very small and bustling by comparison And surely of all smells in the world the smell of many trees is the sweetest and most fortifying The sea has a rude pistolling sort of odour that takes you in the nostrils like snuff and carries with it a fine sentiment of open water and tall ships but the smell of a forest which comes nearest to this in tonic quality surpasses it by many degrees in the quality of softness Again the smell of the sea has little variety but the smell of a forest is infinitely changeful it varies with the hour of the day not in strength merely but in character and the different sorts of trees as you go from one zone of the wood to another seem to live among different kinds of atmosphere Usually the resin of the fir predominates But some woods are more coquettish in their habits and the breath of the forest of Mormal as it came aboard upon us that showery afternoon was perfumed with nothing less delicate than sweetbrier I wish our way had always lain among woods Trees are the most civil society An old oak that has been growing where he stands since before the Reformation taller than many spires more stately than the greater part of mountains and yet a living thing liable to sicknesses and death like you and me is not that in itself a speaking lesson in history But acres on acres full of such patriarchs contiguously rooted their green tops billowing in the wind their stalwart younglings pushing up about their knees a whole forest healthy and beautiful giving colour to the light giving perfume to the air what is this but the most imposing piece in nature s repertory Heine wished to lie like Merlin under the oaks of Broceliande I should not be satisfied with one tree but if the wood grew together like a banyan grove I would be buried under the tap root of the whole my parts should circulate from oak to oak and my consciousness should be diffused abroad in all the forest and give a common heart to that assembly of green spires so that it also might rejoice in its own loveliness and dignity I think I feel a thousand squirrels leaping from bough to bough in my vast mausoleum and the birds and the winds merrily coursing over its uneven leafy surface Alas the forest of Mormal is only a little bit of a wood and it was but for a little way that we skirted by its boundaries And the rest of the time the rain kept coming in squirts and the wind in squalls until one s heart grew weary of such fitful scolding weather It was odd how the showers began when we had to carry the boats over a lock and must expose our legs They always did This is a sort of thing that readily begets a personal feeling against nature There seems no reason why the shower should not come five minutes before or five minutes after unless you suppose an intention to affront you The Cigarette had a mackintosh which put him more or less above these contrarieties But I had to bear the brunt uncovered I began to remember that nature was a woman My companion in a rosier temper listened with great satisfaction to my Jeremiads and ironically concurred He instanced as a cognate matter the action of the tides which said he was altogether designed for the confusion of canoeists except in so far as it was calculated to minister to a barren vanity on the part of the moon At the last lock some little way out of Landrecies I refused to go any farther and sat in a drift of rain by the side of the bank to have a reviving pipe A vivacious old man whom I take to have been the devil drew near and questioned me about our journey In the fullness of my heart I laid bare our plans before him He said it was the silliest enterprise that ever he heard of Why did I not know he asked me that it was nothing but locks locks locks the whole way not to mention that at this season of the year we should find the Oise quite dry Get into a train my little young man said he and go you away home to your parents I was so astounded at the man s malice that I could only stare at him in silence A tree would never have spoken to me like this At last I got out with some words We had come from Antwerp already I told him which was a good long way and we should do the rest in spite of him Yes I said if there were no other reason I would do it now just because he had dared to say we could not The pleasant old gentleman looked at me sneeringly made an allusion to my canoe and marched off waggling his head I was still inwardly fuming when up came a pair of young fellows who imagined I was the Cigarette s servant on a comparison I suppose of my bare jersey with the other s mackintosh and asked me many questions about my place and my master s character I said he was a good enough fellow but had this absurd voyage on the head O no no said one you must not say that it is not absurd it is very courageous of him I believe these were a couple of angels sent to give me heart again It was truly fortifying to reproduce all the old man s insinuations as if they were original to me in my character of a malcontent footman and have them brushed away like so many flies by these admirable young men When I recounted this affair to the Cigarette They must have a curious idea of how English servants behave says he dryly for you treated me like a brute beast at the lock I was a good deal mortified but my temper had suffered it is a fact AT LANDRECIES At Landrecies the rain still fell and the wind still blew but we found a double bedded room with plenty of furniture real water jugs with real water in them and dinner a real dinner not innocent of real wine After having been a pedlar for one night and a butt for the elements during the whole of the next day these comfortable circumstances fell on my heart like sunshine There was an English fruiterer at dinner travelling with a Belgian fruiterer in the evening at the cafe we watched our compatriot drop a good deal of money at corks and I don t know why but this pleased us It turned out we were to see more of Landrecies than we expected for the weather next day was simply bedlamite It is not the place one would have chosen for a day s rest for it consists almost entirely of fortifications Within the ramparts a few blocks of houses a long row of barracks and a church figure with what countenance they may as the town There seems to be no trade and a shopkeeper from whom I bought a sixpenny flint and steel was so much affected that he filled my pockets with spare flints into the bargain The only public buildings that had any interest for us were the hotel and the cafe But we visited the church There lies Marshal Clarke But as neither of us had ever heard of that military hero we bore the associations of the spot with fortitude In all garrison towns guard calls and reveilles and such like make a fine romantic interlude in civic business Bugles and drums and fifes are of themselves most excellent things in nature and when they carry the mind to marching armies and the picturesque vicissitudes of war they stir up something proud in the heart But in a shadow of a town like Landrecies with little else moving these points of war made a proportionate commotion Indeed they were the only things to remember It was just the place to hear the round going by at night in the darkness with the solid tramp of men marching and the startling reverberations of the drum It reminded you that even this place was a point in the great warfaring system of Europe and might on some future day be ringed about with cannon smoke and thunder and make itself a name among strong towns The drum at any rate from its martial voice and notable physiological effect nay even from its cumbrous and comical shape stands alone among the instruments of noise And if it be true as I have heard it said that drums are covered with asses skin what a picturesque irony is there in that As if this long suffering animal s hide had not been sufficiently belaboured during life now by Lyonnese costermongers now by presumptuous Hebrew prophets it must be stripped from his poor hinder quarters after death stretched on a drum and beaten night after night round the streets of every garrison town in Europe And up the heights of Alma and Spicheren and wherever death has his red flag a flying and sounds his own potent tuck upon the cannons there also must the drummer boy hurrying with white face over fallen comrades batter and bemaul this slip of skin from the loins of peaceable donkeys Generally a man is never more uselessly employed than when he is at this trick of bastinadoing asses hide We know what effect it has in life and how your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating But in this state of mummy and melancholy survival of itself when the hollow skin reverberates to the drummer s wrist and each dub a dub goes direct to a man s heart and puts madness there and that disposition of the pulses which we in our big way of talking nickname Heroism is there not something in the nature of a revenge upon the donkey s persecutors Of old he might say you drubbed me up hill and down dale and I must endure but now that I am dead those dull thwacks that were scarcely audible in country lanes have become stirring music in front of the brigade and for every blow that you lay on my old great coat you will see a comrade stumble and fall Not long after the drums had passed the cafe the Cigarette and the Arethusa began to grow sleepy and set out for the hotel which was only a door or two away But although we had been somewhat indifferent to Landrecies Landrecies had not been indifferent to us All day we learned people had been running out between the squalls to visit our two boats Hundreds of persons so said report although it fitted ill with our idea of the town hundreds of persons had inspected them where they lay in a coal shed We were becoming lions in Landrecies who had been only pedlars the night before in Pont And now when we left the cafe we were pursued and overtaken at the hotel door by no less a person than the Juge de Paix a functionary as far as I can make out of the character of a Scots Sheriff Substitute He gave us his card and invited us to sup with him on the spot very neatly very gracefully as Frenchmen can do these things It was for the credit of Landrecies said he and although we knew very well how little credit we could do the place we must have been churlish fellows to refuse an invitation so politely introduced The house of the Judge was close by it was a well appointed bachelor s establishment with a curious collection of old brass warming pans upon the walls Some of these were most elaborately carved It seemed a picturesque idea for a collector You could not help thinking how many nightcaps had wagged over these warming pans in past generations what jests may have been made and kisses taken while they were in service and how often they had been uselessly paraded in the bed of death If they could only speak at what absurd indecorous and tragical scenes had they not been present The wine was excellent When we made the Judge our compliments upon a bottle I do not give it you as my worst said he I wonder when Englishmen will learn these hospitable graces They are worth learning they set off life and make ordinary moments ornamental There were two other Landrecienses present One was the collector of something or other I forget what the other we were told was the principal notary of the place So it happened that we all five more or less followed the law At this rate the talk was pretty certain to become technical The Cigarette expounded the Poor Laws very magisterially And a little later I found myself laying down the Scots Law of Illegitimacy of which I am glad to say I know nothing The collector and the notary who were both married men accused the Judge who was a bachelor of having started the subject He deprecated the charge with a conscious pleased air just like all the men I have ever seen be they French or English How strange that we should all in our unguarded moments rather like to be thought a bit of a rogue with the women As the evening went on the wine grew more to my taste the spirits proved better than the wine the company was genial This was the highest water mark of popular favour on the whole cruise After all being in a Judge s house was there not something semi official in the tribute And so remembering what a great country France is we did full justice to our entertainment Landrecies had been a long while asleep before we returned to the hotel and the sentries on the ramparts were already looking for daybreak SAMBRE AND OISE CANAL CANAL BOATS Next day we made a late start in the rain The Judge politely escorted us to the end of the lock under an umbrella We had now brought ourselves to a pitch of humility in the matter of weather not often attained except in the Scottish Highlands A rag of blue sky or a glimpse of sunshine set our hearts singing and when the rain was not heavy we counted the day almost fair Long lines of barges lay one after another along the canal many of them looking mighty spruce and ship shape in their jerkin of Archangel tar picked out with white and green Some carried gay iron railings and quite a parterre of flower pots Children played on the decks as heedless of the rain as if they had been brought up on Loch Carron side men fished over the gunwale some of them under umbrellas women did their washing and every barge boasted its mongrel cur by way of watch dog Each one barked furiously at the canoes running alongside until he had got to the end of his own ship and so passing on the word to the dog aboard the next We must have seen something like a hundred of these embarkations in the course of that day s paddle ranged one after another like the houses in a street and from not one of them were we disappointed of this accompaniment It was like visiting a menagerie the Cigarette remarked These little cities by the canal side had a very odd effect upon the mind They seemed with their flower pots and smoking chimneys their washings and dinners a rooted piece of nature in the scene and yet if only the canal below were to open one junk after another would hoist sail or harness horses and swim away into all parts of France and the impromptu hamlet would separate house by house to the four winds The children who played together to day by the Sambre and Oise Canal each at his own father s threshold when and where might they next meet For some time past the subject of barges had occupied a great deal of our talk and we had projected an old age on the canals of Europe It was to be the most leisurely of progresses now on a swift river at the tail of a steam boat now waiting horses for days together on some inconsiderable junction We should be seen pottering on deck in all the dignity of years our white beards falling into our laps We were ever to be busied among paint pots so that there should be no white fresher and no green more emerald than ours in all the navy of the canals There should be books in the cabin and tobacco jars and some old Burgundy as red as a November sunset and as odorous as a violet in April There should be a flageolet whence the Cigarette with cunning touch should draw melting music under the stars or perhaps laying that aside upraise his voice somewhat thinner than of yore and with here and there a quaver or call it a natural grace note in rich and solemn psalmody All this simmering in my mind set me wishing to go aboard one of these ideal houses of lounging I had plenty to choose from as I coasted one after another and the dogs bayed at me for a vagrant At last I saw a nice old man and his wife looking at me with some interest so I gave them good day and pulled up alongside I began with a remark upon their dog which had somewhat the look of a pointer thence I slid into a compliment on Madame s flowers and thence into a word in praise of their way of life If you ventured on such an experiment in England you would get a slap in the face at once The life would be shown to be a vile one not without a side shot at your better fortune Now what I like so much in France is the clear unflinching recognition by everybody of his own luck They all know on which side their bread is buttered and take a pleasure in showing it to others which is surely the better part of religion And they scorn to make a poor mouth over their poverty which I take to be the better part of manliness I have heard a woman in quite a better position at home with a good bit of money in hand refer to her own child with a horrid whine as a poor man s child I would not say such a thing to the Duke of Westminster And the French are full of this spirit of independence Perhaps it is the result of republican institutions as they call them Much more likely it is because there are so few people really poor that the whiners are not enough to keep each other in countenance The people on the barge were delighted to hear that I admired their state They understood perfectly well they told me how Monsieur envied them Without doubt Monsieur was rich and in that case he might make a canal boat as pretty as a villa joli comme un chateau And with that they invited me on board their own water villa They apologized for their cabin they had not been rich enough to make it as it ought to be The fire should have been here at this side explained the husband Then one might have a writing table in the middle books and comprehensively all It would be quite coquettish ca serait tout a fait coquet And he looked about him as though the improvements were already made It was plainly not the first time that he had thus beautified his cabin in imagination and when next he makes a hit I should expect to see the writing table in the middle Madame had three birds in a cage They were no great thing she explained Fine birds were so dear They had sought to get a Hollandais last winter in Rouen Rouen thought I and is this whole mansion with its dogs and birds and smoking chimneys so far a traveller as that and as homely an object among the cliffs and orchards of the Seine as on the green plains of Sambre they had sought to get a Hollandais last winter in Rouen but these cost fifteen francs apiece picture it fifteen francs Pour un tout petit oiseau For quite a little bird added the husband As I continued to admire the apologetics died away and the good people began to brag of their barge and their happy condition in life as if they had been Emperor and Empress of the Indies It was in the Scots phrase a good hearing and put me in good humour with the world If people knew what an inspiriting thing it is to hear a man boasting so long as he boasts of what he really has I believe they would do it more freely and with a better grace They began to ask about our voyage You should have seen how they sympathized They seemed half ready to give up their barge and follow us But these canaletti are only gypsies semi domesticated The semi domestication came out in rather a pretty form Suddenly Madame s brow darkened Cependant she began and then stopped and then began again by asking me if I were single Yes said I And your friend who went by just now He also was unmarried O then all was well She could not have wives left alone at home but since there were no wives in the question we were doing the best we could To see about one in the world said the husband il n y a que ca there is nothing else worth while A man look you who sticks in his own village like a bear he went on very well he sees nothing And then death is the end of all And he has seen nothing Madame reminded her husband of an Englishman who had come up this canal in a steamer Perhaps mister Moens in the Ytene I suggested That s it assented the husband He had his wife and family with him and servants He came ashore at all the locks and asked the name of the villages whether from boatmen or lock keepers and then he wrote wrote them down Oh he wrote enormously I suppose it was a wager A wager was a common enough explanation for our own exploits but it seemed an original reason for taking notes THE OISE IN FLOOD Before nine next morning the two canoes were installed on a light country cart at Etreux and we were soon following them along the side of a pleasant valley full of hop gardens and poplars Agreeable villages lay here and there on the slope of the hill notably Tupigny with the hop poles hanging their garlands in the very street and the houses clustered with grapes There was a faint enthusiasm on our passage weavers put their heads to the windows children cried out in ecstasy at sight of the two boaties barquettes and bloused pedestrians who were acquainted with our charioteer jested with him on the nature of his freight We had a shower or two but light and flying The air was clean and sweet among all these green fields and green things growing There was not a touch of autumn in the weather And when at Vadencourt we launched from a little lawn opposite a mill the sun broke forth and set all the leaves shining in the valley of the Oise The river was swollen with the long rains From Vadencourt all the way to Origny it ran with ever quickening speed taking fresh heart at each mile and racing as though it already smelt the sea The water was yellow and turbulent swung with an angry eddy among half submerged willows and made an angry clatter along stony shores The course kept turning and turning in a narrow and well timbered valley Now the river would approach the side and run griding along the chalky base of the hill and show us a few open colza fields among the trees Now it would skirt the garden walls of houses where we might catch a glimpse through a doorway and see a priest pacing in the chequered sunlight Again the foliage closed so thickly in front that there seemed to be no issue only a thicket of willows overtopped by elms and poplars under which the river ran flush and fleet and where a kingfisher flew past like a piece of the blue sky On these different manifestations the sun poured its clear and catholic looks The shadows lay as solid on the swift surface of the stream as on the stable meadows The light sparkled golden in the dancing poplar leaves and brought the hills in communion with our eyes And all the while the river never stopped running or took breath and the reeds along the whole valley stood shivering from top to toe There should be some myth but if there is I know it not founded on the shivering of the reeds There are not many things in nature more striking to man s eye It is such an eloquent pantomime of terror and to see such a number of terrified creatures taking sanctuary in every nook along the shore is enough to infect a silly human with alarm Perhaps they are only a cold and no wonder standing waist deep in the stream Or perhaps they have never got accustomed to the speed and fury of the river s flux or the miracle of its continuous body Pan once played upon their forefathers and so by the hands of his river he still plays upon these later generations down all the valley of the Oise and plays the same air both sweet and shrill to tell us of the beauty and the terror of the world The canoe was like a leaf in the current It took it up and shook it and carried it masterfully away like a Centaur carrying off a nymph To keep some command on our direction required hard and diligent plying of the paddle The river was in such a hurry for the sea Every drop of water ran in a panic like as many people in a frightened crowd But what crowd was ever so numerous or so single minded All the objects of sight went by at a dance measure the eyesight raced with the racing river the exigencies of every moment kept the pegs screwed so tight that our being quivered like a well tuned instrument and the blood shook oft its lethargy and trotted through all the highways and byways of the veins and arteries and in and out of the heart as if circulation were but a holiday journey and not the daily moil of threescore years and ten The reeds might nod their heads in warning and with tremulous gestures tell how the river was as cruel as it was strong and cold and how death lurked in the eddy underneath the willows But the reeds had to stand where they were and those who stand still are always timid advisers As for us we could have shouted aloud If this lively and beautiful river were indeed a thing of death s contrivance the old ashen rogue had famously outwitted himself with us I was living three to the minute I was scoring points against him every stroke of my paddle every turn of the stream I have rarely had better profit of my life For I think we may look upon our little private war with death somewhat in this light If a man knows he will sooner or later be robbed upon a journey he will have a bottle of the best in every inn and look upon all his extravagances as so much gained upon the thieves And above all where instead of simply spending he makes a profitable investment for some of his money when it will be out of risk of loss So every bit of brisk living and above all when it is healthful is just so much gained upon the wholesale filcher death We shall have the less in our pockets the more in our stomach when he cries stand and deliver A swift stream is a favourite artifice of his and one that brings him in a comfortable thing per annum but when he and I come to settle our accounts I shall whistle in his face for these hours upon the upper Oise Towards afternoon we got fairly drunken with the sunshine and the exhilaration of the pace We could no longer contain ourselves and our content The canoes were too small for us we must be out and stretch ourselves on shore And so in a green meadow we bestowed our limbs on the grass and smoked deifying tobacco and proclaimed the world excellent It was the last good hour of the day and I dwell upon it with extreme complacency On one side of the valley high up on the chalky summit of the hill a ploughman with his team appeared and disappeared at regular intervals At each revelation he stood still for a few seconds against the sky for all the world as the Cigarette declared like a toy Burns who should have just ploughed up the Mountain Daisy He was the only living thing within view unless we are to count the river On the other side of the valley a group of red roofs and a belfry showed among the foliage Thence some inspired bell ringer made the afternoon musical on a chime of bells There was something very sweet and taking in the air he played and we thought we had never heard bells speak so intelligibly or sing so melodiously as these It must have been to some such measure that the spinners and the young maids sang Come away Death in the Shakespearian Illyria There is so often a threatening note something blatant and metallic in the voice of bells that I believe we have fully more pain than pleasure from hearing them but these as they sounded abroad now high now low now with a plaintive cadence that caught the ear like the burthen of a popular song were always moderate and tunable and seemed to fall in with the spirit of still rustic places like the noise of a waterfall or the babble of a rookery in spring I could have asked the bell ringer for his blessing good sedate old man who swung the rope so gently to the time of his meditations I could have blessed the priest or the heritors or whoever may be concerned with such affairs in France who had left these sweet old bells to gladden the afternoon and not held meetings and made collections and had their names repeatedly printed in the local paper to rig up a peal of brand new brazen Birmingham hearted substitutes who should bombard their sides to the provocation of a brand new bell ringer and fill the echoes of the valley with terror and riot At last the bells ceased and with their note the sun withdrew The piece was at an end shadow and silence possessed the valley of the Oise We took to the paddle with glad hearts like people who have sat out a noble performance and returned to work The river was more dangerous here it ran swifter the eddies were more sudden and violent All the way down we had had our fill of difficulties Sometimes it was a weir which could be shot sometimes one so shallow and full of stakes that we must withdraw the boats from the water and carry them round But the chief sort of obstacle was a consequence of the late high winds Every two or three hundred yards a tree had fallen across the river and usually involved more than another in its fall Often there was free water at the end and we could steer round the leafy promontory and hear the water sucking and bubbling among the twigs Often again when the tree reached from bank to bank there was room by lying close to shoot through underneath canoe and all Sometimes it was necessary to get out upon the trunk itself and pull the boats across and sometimes when the stream was too impetuous for this there was nothing for it but to land and carry over This made a fine series of accidents in the day s career and kept us aware of ourselves Shortly after our re embarkation while I was leading by a long way and still full of a noble exulting spirit in honour of the sun the swift pace and the church bells the river made one of its leonine pounces round a corner and I was aware of another fallen tree within a stone cast I had my back board down in a trice and aimed for a place where the trunk seemed high enough above the water and the branches not too thick to let me slip below When a man has just vowed eternal brotherhood with the universe he is not in a temper to take great determinations coolly and this which might have been a very important determination for me had not been taken under a happy star The tree caught me about the chest and while I was yet struggling to make less of myself and get through the river took the matter out of my hands and bereaved me of my boat The Arethusa swung round broadside on leaned over ejected so much of me as still remained on board and thus disencumbered whipped under the tree righted and went merrily away down stream I do not know how long it was before I scrambled on to the tree to which I was left clinging but it was longer than I cared about My thoughts were of a grave and almost sombre character but I still clung to my paddle The stream ran away with my heels as fast as I could pull up my shoulders and I seemed by the weight to have all the water of the Oise in my trousers pockets You can never know till you try it what a dead pull a river makes against a man Death himself had me by the heels for this was his last ambuscado and he must now join personally in the fray And still I held to my paddle At last I dragged myself on to my stomach on the trunk and lay there a breathless sop with a mingled sense of humour and injustice A poor figure I must have presented to Burns upon the hill top with his team But there was the paddle in my hand On my tomb if ever I have one I mean to get these words inscribed He clung to his paddle The Cigarette had gone past a while before for as I might have observed if I had been a little less pleased with the universe at the moment there was a clear way round the tree top at the farther side He had offered his services to haul me out but as I was then already on my elbows I had declined and sent him down stream after the truant Arethusa The stream was too rapid for a man to mount with one canoe let alone two upon his hands So I crawled along the trunk to shore and proceeded down the meadows by the riverside I was so cold that my heart was sore I had now an idea of my own why the reeds so bitterly shivered I could have given any of them a lesson The Cigarette remarked facetiously that he thought I was taking exercise as I drew near until he made out for certain that I was only twittering with cold I had a rub down with a towel and donned a dry suit from the india rubber bag But I was not my own man again for the rest of the voyage I had a queasy sense that I wore my last dry clothes upon my body The struggle had tired me and perhaps whether I knew it or not I was a little dashed in spirit The devouring element in the universe had leaped out against me in this green valley quickened by a running stream The bells were all very pretty in their way but I had heard some of the hollow notes of Pan s music Would the wicked river drag me down by the heels indeed and look so beautiful all the time Nature s good humour was only skin deep after all There was still a long way to go by the winding course of the stream and darkness had fallen and a late bell was ringing in Origny Sainte Benoite when we arrived ORIGNY SAINTE BENOITE A BY DAY The next day was Sunday and the church bells had little rest indeed I do not think I remember anywhere else so great a choice of services as were here offered to the devout And while the bells made merry in the sunshine all the world with his dog was out shooting among the beets and colza In the morning a hawker and his wife went down the street at a foot pace singing to a very slow lamentable music O France mes amours It brought everybody to the door and when our landlady called in the man to buy the words he had not a copy of them left She was not the first nor the second who had been taken with the song There is something very pathetic in the love of the French people since the war for dismal patriotic music making I have watched a forester from Alsace while someone was singing Les malheurs de la France at a baptismal party in the neighbourhood of Fontainebleau He arose from the table and took his son aside close by where I was standing Listen listen he said bearing on the boy s shoulder and remember this my son A little after he went out into the garden suddenly and I could hear him sobbing in the darkness The humiliation of their arms and the loss of Alsace and Lorraine made a sore pull on the endurance of this sensitive people and their hearts are still hot not so much against Germany as against the Empire In what other country will you find a patriotic ditty bring all the world into the street But affliction heightens love and we shall never know we are Englishmen until we have lost India Independent America is still the cross of my existence I cannot think of Farmer George without abhorrence and I never feel more warmly to my own land than when I see the Stars and Stripes and remember what our empire might have been The hawker s little book which I purchased was a curious mixture Side by side with the flippant rowdy nonsense of the Paris music halls there were many pastoral pieces not without a touch of poetry I thought and instinct with the brave independence of the poorer class in France There you might read how the wood cutter gloried in his axe and the gardener scorned to be ashamed of his spade It was not very well written this poetry of labour but the pluck of the sentiment redeemed what was weak or wordy in the expression The martial and the patriotic pieces on the other hand were tearful womanish productions one and all The poet had passed under the Caudine Forks he sang for an army visiting the tomb of its old renown with arms reversed and sang not of victory but of death There was a number in the hawker s collection called Conscrits Francais which may rank among the most dissuasive war lyrics on record It would not be possible to fight at all in such a spirit The bravest conscript would turn pale if such a ditty were struck up beside him on the morning of battle and whole regiments would pile their arms to its tune If Fletcher of Saltoun is in the right about the influence of national songs you would say France was come to a poor pass But the thing will work its own cure and a sound hearted and courageous people weary at length of sniveling over their disasters Already Paul Deroulede has written some manly military verses There is not much of the trumpet note in them perhaps to stir a man s heart in his bosom they lack the lyrical elation and move slowly but they are written in a grave honourable stoical spirit which should carry soldiers far in a good cause One feels as if one would like to trust Deroulede with something It will be happy if he can so far inoculate his fellow countrymen that they may be trusted with their own future And in the meantime here is an antidote to French Conscripts and much other doleful versification We had left the boats over night in the custody of one whom we shall call Carnival I did not properly catch his name and perhaps that was not unfortunate for him as I am not in a position to hand him down with honour to posterity To this person s premises we strolled in the course of the day and found quite a little deputation inspecting the canoes There was a stout gentleman with a knowledge of the river which he seemed eager to impart There was a very elegant young gentleman in a black coat with a smattering of English who led the talk at once to the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race And then there were three handsome girls from fifteen to twenty and an old gentleman in a blouse with no teeth to speak of and a strong country accent Quite the pick of Origny I should suppose The Cigarette had some mysteries to perform with his rigging in the coach house so I was left to do the parade single handed I found myself very much of a hero whether I would or not The girls were full of little shudderings over the dangers of our journey And I thought it would be ungallant not to take my cue from the ladies My mishap of yesterday told in an off hand way produced a deep sensation It was Othello over again with no less than three Desdemonas and a sprinkling of sympathetic senators in the background Never were the canoes more flattered or flattered more adroitly It is like a violin cried one of the girls in an ecstasy I thank you for the word mademoiselle said I All the more since there are people who call out to me that it is like a coffin Oh I but it is really like a violin It is finished like a violin she went on And polished like a violin added a senator One has only to stretch the cords concluded another and then tum tumty tum he imitated the result with spirit Was not this a graceful little ovation Where this people finds the secret of its pretty speeches I cannot imagine unless the secret should be no other than a sincere desire to please But then no disgrace is attached in France to saying a thing neatly whereas in England to talk like a book is to give in one s resignation to society The old gentleman in the blouse stole into the coach house and somewhat irrelevantly informed the Cigarette that he was the father of the three girls and four more quite an exploit for a Frenchman You are very fortunate answered the Cigarette politely And the old gentleman having apparently gained his point stole away again We all got very friendly together The girls proposed to start with us on the morrow if you please And jesting apart every one was anxious to know the hour of our departure Now when you are going to crawl into your canoe from a bad launch a crowd however friendly is undesirable and so we told them not before twelve and mentally determined to be off by ten at latest Towards evening we went abroad again to post some letters It was cool and pleasant the long village was quite empty except for one or two urchins who followed us as they might have followed a menagerie the hills and the tree tops looked in from all sides through the clear air and the bells were chiming for yet another service Suddenly we sighted the three girls standing with a fourth sister in front of a shop on the wide selvage of the roadway We had been very merry with them a little while ago to be sure But what was the etiquette of Origny Had it been a country road of course we should have spoken to them but here under the eyes of all the gossips ought we to do even as much as bow I consulted the Cigarette Look said he I looked There were the four girls on the same spot but now four backs were turned to us very upright and conscious Corporal Modesty had given the word of command and the well disciplined picket had gone right about face like a single person They maintained this formation all the while we were in sight but we heard them tittering among themselves and the girl whom we had not met laughed with open mouth and even looked over her shoulder at the enemy I wonder was it altogether modesty after all or in part a sort of country provocation As we were returning to the inn we beheld something floating in the ample field of golden evening sky above the chalk cliffs and the trees that grow along their summit It was too high up too large and too steady for a kite and as it was dark it could not be a star For although a star were as black as ink and as rugged as a walnut so amply does the sun bathe heaven with radiance that it would sparkle like a point of light for us The village was dotted with people with their heads in air and the children were in a bustle all along the street and far up the straight road that climbs the hill where we could still see them running in loose knots It was a balloon we learned which had left saint Quentin at half past five that evening Mighty composedly the majority of the grown people took it But we were English and were soon running up the hill with the best Being travellers ourselves in a small way we would fain have seen these other travellers alight The spectacle was over by the time we gained the top of the hill All the gold had withered out of the sky and the balloon had disappeared Whither I ask myself caught up into the seventh heaven or come safely to land somewhere in that blue uneven distance into which the roadway dipped and melted before our eyes Probably the aeronauts were already warming themselves at a farm chimney for they say it is cold in these unhomely regions of the air The night fell swiftly Roadside trees and disappointed sightseers returning though the meadows stood out in black against a margin of low red sunset It was cheerfuller to face the other way and so down the hill we went with a full moon the colour of a melon swinging high above the wooded valley and the white cliffs behind us faintly reddened by the fire of the chalk kilns The lamps were lighted and the salads were being made in Origny Sainte Benoite by the river ORIGNY SAINTE BENOITE THE COMPANY AT TABLE Although we came late for dinner the company at table treated us to sparkling wine That is how we are in France said one Those who sit down with us are our friends And the rest applauded They were three altogether and an odd trio to pass the Sunday with Two of them were guests like ourselves both men of the north One ruddy and of a full habit of body with copious black hair and beard the intrepid hunter of France who thought nothing so small not even a lark or a minnow but he might vindicate his prowess by its capture For such a great healthy man his hair flourishing like Samson s his arteries running buckets of red blood to boast of these infinitesimal exploits produced a feeling of disproportion in the world as when a steam hammer is set to cracking nuts The other was a quiet subdued person blond and lymphatic and sad with something the look of a Dane Tristes tetes de Danois as Gaston Lafenestre used to say I must not let that name go by without a word for the best of all good fellows now gone down into the dust We shall never again see Gaston in his forest costume he was Gaston with all the world in affection not in disrespect nor hear him wake the echoes of Fontainebleau with the woodland horn Never again shall his kind smile put peace among all races of artistic men and make the Englishman at home in France Never more shall the sheep who were not more innocent at heart than he sit all unconsciously for his industrious pencil He died too early at the very moment when he was beginning to put forth fresh sprouts and blossom into something worthy of himself and yet none who knew him will think he lived in vain I never knew a man so little for whom yet I had so much affection and I find it a good test of others how much they had learned to understand and value him His was indeed a good influence in life while he was still among us he had a fresh laugh it did you good to see him and however sad he may have been at heart he always bore a bold and cheerful countenance and took fortune s worst as it were the showers of spring But now his mother sits alone by the side of Fontainebleau woods where he gathered mushrooms in his hardy and penurious youth Many of his pictures found their way across the Channel besides those which were stolen when a dastardly Yankee left him alone in London with two English pence and perhaps twice as many words of English If any one who reads these lines should have a scene of sheep in the manner of Jacques with this fine creature s signature let him tell himself that one of the kindest and bravest of men has lent a hand to decorate his lodging There may be better pictures in the National Gallery but not a painter among the generations had a better heart Precious in the sight of the Lord of humanity the Psalms tell us is the death of his saints It had need to be precious for it is very costly when by the stroke a mother is left desolate and the peace maker and peace looker of a whole society is laid in the ground with Caesar and the Twelve Apostles There is something lacking among the oaks of Fontainebleau and when the dessert comes in at Barbizon people look to the door for a figure that is gone The third of our companions at Origny was no less a person than the landlady s husband not properly the landlord since he worked himself in a factory during the day and came to his own house at evening as a guest a man worn to skin and bone by perpetual excitement with baldish head sharp features and swift shining eyes On Saturday describing some paltry adventure at a duck hunt he broke a plate into a score of fragments Whenever he made a remark he would look all round the table with his chin raised and a spark of green light in either eye seeking approval His wife appeared now and again in the doorway of the room where she was superintending dinner with a Henri you forget yourself or a Henri you can surely talk without making such a noise Indeed that was what the honest fellow could not do On the most trifling matter his eyes kindled his fist visited the table and his voice rolled abroad in changeful thunder I never saw such a petard of a man I think the devil was in him He had two favourite expressions it is logical or illogical as the case might be and this other thrown out with a certain bravado as a man might unfurl a banner at the beginning of many a long and sonorous story I am a proletarian you see Indeed we saw it very well God forbid that ever I should find him handling a gun in Paris streets That will not be a good moment for the general public I thought his two phrases very much represented the good and evil of his class and to some extent of his country It is a strong thing to say what one is and not be ashamed of it even although it be in doubtful taste to repeat the statement too often in one evening I should not admire it in a duke of course but as times go the trait is honourable in a workman On the other hand it is not at all a strong thing to put one s reliance upon logic and our own logic particularly for it is generally wrong We never know where we are to end if once we begin following words or doctors There is an upright stock in a man s own heart that is trustier than any syllogism and the eyes and the sympathies and appetites know a thing or two that have never yet been stated in controversy Reasons are as plentiful as blackberries and like fisticuffs they serve impartially with all sides Doctrines do not stand or fall by their proofs and are only logical in so far as they are cleverly put An able controversialist no more than an able general demonstrates the justice of his cause But France is all gone wandering after one or two big words it will take some time before they can be satisfied that they are no more than words however big and when once that is done they will perhaps find logic less diverting The conversation opened with details of the day s shooting When all the sportsmen of a village shoot over the village territory pro indiviso it is plain that many questions of etiquette and priority must arise Here now cried the landlord brandishing a plate here is a field of beet root Well Here am I then I advance do I not Eh bien sacristi and the statement waxing louder rolls off into a reverberation of oaths the speaker glaring about for sympathy and everybody nodding his head to him in the name of peace The ruddy Northman told some tales of his own prowess in keeping order notably one of a Marquis Marquis I said if you take another step I fire upon you You have committed a dirtiness Marquis Whereupon it appeared the Marquis touched his cap and withdrew The landlord applauded noisily It was well done he said He did all that he could He admitted he was wrong And then oath upon oath He was no marquis lover either but he had a sense of justice in him this proletarian host of ours From the matter of hunting the talk veered into a general comparison of Paris and the country The proletarian beat the table like a drum in praise of Paris What is Paris Paris is the cream of France There are no Parisians it is you and I and everybody who are Parisians A man has eighty chances per cent to get on in the world in Paris And he drew a vivid sketch of the workman in a den no bigger than a dog hutch making articles that were to go all over the world Eh bien quoi c est magnifique ca cried he The sad Northman interfered in praise of a peasant s life he thought Paris bad for men and women centralization said he But the landlord was at his throat in a moment It was all logical he showed him and all magnificent What a spectacle What a glance for an eye And the dishes reeled upon the table under a cannonade of blows Seeking to make peace I threw in a word in praise of the liberty of opinion in France I could hardly have shot more amiss There was an instant silence and a great wagging of significant heads They did not fancy the subject it was plain but they gave me to understand that the sad Northman was a martyr on account of his views Ask him a bit said they Just ask him Yes sir said he in his quiet way answering me although I had not spoken I am afraid there is less liberty of opinion in France than you may imagine And with that he dropped his eyes and seemed to consider the subject at an end Our curiosity was mightily excited at this How or why or when was this lymphatic bagman martyred We concluded at once it was on some religious question and brushed up our memories of the Inquisition which were principally drawn from Poe s horrid story and the sermon in Tristram Shandy I believe On the morrow we had an opportunity of going further into the question for when we rose very early to avoid a sympathizing deputation at our departure we found the hero up before us He was breaking his fast on white wine and raw onions in order to keep up the character of martyr I conclude We had a long conversation and made out what we wanted in spite of his reserve But here was a truly curious circumstance It seems possible for two Scotsmen and a Frenchman to discuss during a long half hour and each nationality have a different idea in view throughout It was not till the very end that we discovered his heresy had been political or that he suspected our mistake The terms and spirit in which he spoke of his political beliefs were in our eyes suited to religious beliefs And vice versa Nothing could be more characteristic of the two countries Politics are the religion of France as Nanty Ewart would have said A d d bad religion while we at home keep most of our bitterness for little differences about a hymn book or a Hebrew word which perhaps neither of the parties can translate And perhaps the misconception is typical of many others that may never be cleared up not only between people of different race but between those of different sex As for our friend s martyrdom he was a Communist or perhaps only a Communard which is a very different thing and had lost one or more situations in consequence I think he had also been rejected in marriage but perhaps he had a sentimental way of considering business which deceived me He was a mild gentle creature anyway and I hope he has got a better situation and married a more suitable wife since then DOWN THE OISE TO MOY Carnival notoriously cheated us at first Finding us easy in our ways he regretted having let us oil so cheaply and taking me aside told me a cock and bull story with the moral of another five francs for the narrator The thing was palpably absurd but I paid up and at once dropped all friendliness of manner and kept him in his place as an inferior with freezing British dignity He saw in a moment that he had gone too far and killed a willing horse his face fell I am sure he would have refunded if he could only have thought of a decent pretext He wished me to drink with him but I would none of his drinks He grew pathetically tender in his professions but I walked beside him in silence or answered him in stately courtesies and when we got to the landing place passed the word in English slang to the Cigarette In spite of the false scent we had thrown out the day before there must have been fifty people about the bridge We were as pleasant as we could be with all but Carnival We said good bye shaking hands with the old gentleman who knew the river and the young gentleman who had a smattering of English but never a word for Carnival Poor Carnival here was a humiliation He who had been so much identified with the canoes who had given orders in our name who had shown off the boats and even the boatmen like a private exhibition of his own to be now so publicly shamed by the lions of his caravan I never saw anybody look more crestfallen than he He hung in the background coming timidly forward ever and again as he thought he saw some symptom of a relenting humour and falling hurriedly back when he encountered a cold stare Let us hope it will be a lesson to him I would not have mentioned Carnival s peccadillo had not the thing been so uncommon in France This for instance was the only case of dishonesty or even sharp practice in our whole voyage We talk very much about our honesty in England It is a good rule to be on your guard wherever you hear great professions about a very little piece of virtue If the English could only hear how they are spoken of abroad they might confine themselves for a while to remedying the fact and perhaps even when that was done give us fewer of their airs The young ladies the graces of Origny were not present at our start but when we got round to the second bridge behold it was black with sightseers We were loudly cheered and for a good way below young lads and lasses ran along the bank still cheering What with current and paddling we were flashing along like swallows It was no joke to keep up with us upon the woody shore But the girls picked up their skirts as if they were sure they had good ankles and followed until their breath was out The last to weary were the three graces and a couple of companions and just as they too had had enough the foremost of the three leaped upon a tree stump and kissed her hand to the canoeists Not Diana herself although this was more of a Venus after all could have done a graceful thing more gracefully Come back again she cried and all the others echoed her and the hills about Origny repeated the words Come back But the river had us round an angle in a twinkling and we were alone with the green trees and running water Come back There is no coming back young ladies on the impetuous stream of life The merchant bows unto the seaman s star The ploughman from the sun his season takes And we must all set our pocket watches by the clock of fate There is a headlong forthright tide that bears away man with his fancies like a straw and runs fast in time and space It is full of curves like this your winding river of the Oise and lingers and returns in pleasant pastorals and yet rightly thought upon never returns at all For though it should revisit the same acre of meadow in the same hour it will have made an ample sweep between whiles many little streams will have fallen in many exhalations risen towards the sun and even although it were the same acre it will no more be the same river of Oise And thus O graces of Origny although the wandering fortune of my life should carry me back again to where you await death s whistle by the river that will not be the old I who walks the street and those wives and mothers say will those be you There was never any mistake about the Oise as a matter of fact In these upper reaches it was still in a prodigious hurry for the sea It ran so fast and merrily through all the windings of its channel that I strained my thumb fighting with the rapids and had to paddle all the rest of the way with one hand turned up Sometimes it had to serve mills and being still a little river ran very dry and shallow in the meanwhile We had to put our legs out of the boat and shove ourselves off the sand of the bottom with our feet And still it went on its way singing among the poplars and making a green valley in the world After a good woman and a good book and tobacco there is nothing so agreeable on earth as a river I forgave it its attempt on my life which was after all one part owing to the unruly winds of heaven that had blown down the tree one part to my own mismanagement and only a third part to the river itself and that not out of malice but from its great preoccupation over its business of getting to the sea A difficult business too for the detours it had to make are not to be counted The geographers seem to have given up the attempt for I found no map represent the infinite contortion of its course A fact will say more than any of them After we had been some hours three if I mistake not flitting by the trees at this smooth break neck gallop when we came upon a hamlet and asked where we were we had got no farther than four kilometres say two miles and a half from Origny If it were not for the honour of the thing in the Scots saying we might almost as well have been standing still We lunched on a meadow inside a parallelogram of poplars The leaves danced and prattled in the wind all round about us The river hurried on meanwhile and seemed to chide at our delay Little we cared The river knew where it was going not so we the less our hurry where we found good quarters and a pleasant theatre for a pipe At that hour stockbrokers were shouting in Paris Bourse for two or three per cent but we minded them as little as the sliding stream and sacrificed a hecatomb of minutes to the gods of tobacco and digestion Hurry is the resource of the faithless Where a man can trust his own heart and those of his friends to morrow is as good as to day And if he die in the meanwhile why then there he dies and the question is solved We had to take to the canal in the course of the afternoon because where it crossed the river there was not a bridge but a siphon If it had not been for an excited fellow on the bank we should have paddled right into the siphon and thenceforward not paddled any more We met a man a gentleman on the tow path who was much interested in our cruise And I was witness to a strange seizure of lying suffered by the Cigarette who because his knife came from Norway narrated all sorts of adventures in that country where he has never been He was quite feverish at the end and pleaded demoniacal possession Moy pronounce Moy was a pleasant little village gathered round a chateau in a moat The air was perfumed with hemp from neighbouring fields At the Golden Sheep we found excellent entertainment German shells from the siege of La Fere Nuernberg figures gold fish in a bowl and all manner of knick knacks embellished the public room The landlady was a stout plain short sighted motherly body with something not far short of a genius for cookery She had a guess of her excellence herself After every dish was sent in she would come and look on at the dinner for a while with puckered blinking eyes C est bon n est ce pas she would say and when she had received a proper answer she disappeared into the kitchen That common French dish partridge and cabbages became a new thing in my eyes at the Golden Sheep and many subsequent dinners have bitterly disappointed me in consequence Sweet was our rest in the Golden Sheep at Moy LA FERE OF CURSED MEMORY We lingered in Moy a good part of the day for we were fond of being philosophical and scorned long journeys and early starts on principle The place moreover invited to repose People in elaborate shooting costumes sallied from the chateau with guns and game bags and this was a pleasure in itself to remain behind while these elegant pleasure seekers took the first of the morning In this way all the world may be an aristocrat and play the duke among marquises and the reigning monarch among dukes if he will only outvie them in tranquility An imperturbable demeanour comes from perfect patience Quiet minds cannot be perplexed or frightened but go on in fortune or misfortune at their own private pace like a clock during a thunderstorm We made a very short day of it to La Fere but the dusk was falling and a small rain had begun before we stowed the boats La Fere is a fortified town in a plain and has two belts of rampart Between the first and the second extends a region of waste land and cultivated patches Here and there along the wayside were posters forbidding trespass in the name of military engineering At last a second gateway admitted us to the town itself Lighted windows looked gladsome whiffs of comfortable cookery came abroad upon the air The town was full of the military reserve out for the French Autumn Manoeuvres and the reservists walked speedily and wore their formidable great coats It was a fine night to be within doors over dinner and hear the rain upon the windows The Cigarette and I could not sufficiently congratulate each other on the prospect for we had been told there was a capital inn at La Fere Such a dinner as we were going to eat such beds as we were to sleep in and all the while the rain raining on houseless folk over all the poplared countryside It made our mouths water The inn bore the name of some woodland animal stag or hart or hind I forget which But I shall never forget how spacious and how eminently habitable it looked as we drew near The carriage entry was lighted up not by intention but from the mere superfluity of fire and candle in the house A rattle of many dishes came to our ears we sighted a great field of tablecloth the kitchen glowed like a forge and smelt like a garden of things to eat Into this the inmost shrine and physiological heart of a hostelry with all its furnaces in action and all its dressers charged with viands you are now to suppose us making our triumphal entry a pair of damp rag and bone men each with a limp india rubber bag upon his arm I do not believe I have a sound view of that kitchen I saw it through a sort of glory but it seemed to me crowded with the snowy caps of cookmen who all turned round from their saucepans and looked at us with surprise There was no doubt about the landlady however there she was heading her army a flushed angry woman full of affairs Her I asked politely too politely thinks the Cigarette if we could have beds she surveying us coldly from head to foot You will find beds in the suburb she remarked We are too busy for the like of you If we could make an entrance change our clothes and order a bottle of wine I felt sure we could put things right so said I If we cannot sleep we may at least dine and was for depositing my bag What a terrible convulsion of nature was that which followed in the landlady s face She made a run at us and stamped her foot Out with you out of the door she screeched Sortez sortez sortez par la porte I do not know how it happened but next moment we were out in the rain and darkness and I was cursing before the carriage entry like a disappointed mendicant Where were the boating men of Belgium where the Judge and his good wines and where the graces of Origny Black black was the night after the firelit kitchen but what was that to the blackness in our heart This was not the first time that I have been refused a lodging Often and often have I planned what I should do if such a misadventure happened to me again And nothing is easier to plan But to put in execution with the heart boiling at the indignity Try it try it only once and tell me what you did It is all very fine to talk about tramps and morality Six hours of police surveillance such as I have had or one brutal rejection from an inn door change your views upon the subject like a course of lectures As long as you keep in the upper regions with all the world bowing to you as you go social arrangements have a very handsome air but once get under the wheels and you wish society were at the devil I will give most respectable men a fortnight of such a life and then I will offer them twopence for what remains of their morality For my part when I was turned out of the Stag or the Hind or whatever it was I would have set the temple of Diana on fire if it had been handy There was no crime complete enough to express my disapproval of human institutions As for the Cigarette I never knew a man so altered We have been taken for pedlars again said he Good God what it must be to be a pedlar in reality He particularized a complaint for every joint in the landlady s body Timon was a philanthropist alongside of him And then when he was at the top of his maledictory bent he would suddenly break away and begin whimperingly to commiserate the poor I hope to God he said and I trust the prayer was answered that I shall never be uncivil to a pedlar Was this the imperturbable Cigarette This this was he O change beyond report thought or belief Meantime the heaven wept upon our heads and the windows grew brighter as the night increased in darkness We trudged in and out of La Fere streets we saw shops and private houses where people were copiously dining we saw stables where carters nags had plenty of fodder and clean straw we saw no end of reservists who were very sorry for themselves this wet night I doubt not and yearned for their country homes but had they not each man his place in La Fere barracks And we what had we There seemed to be no other inn in the whole town People gave us directions which we followed as best we could generally with the effect of bringing us out again upon the scene of our disgrace We were very sad people indeed by the time we had gone all over La Fere and the Cigarette had already made up his mind to lie under a poplar and sup off a loaf of bread But right at the other end the house next the town gate was full of light and bustle Bazin aubergiste loge a pied was the sign A la Croix de Malte There were we received The room was full of noisy reservists drinking and smoking and we were very glad indeed when the drums and bugles began to go about the streets and one and all had to snatch shakoes and be off for the barracks Bazin was a tall man running to fat soft spoken with a delicate gentle face We asked him to share our wine but he excused himself having pledged reservists all day long This was a very different type of the workman innkeeper from the bawling disputatious fellow at Origny He also loved Paris where he had worked as a decorative painter in his youth There were such opportunities for self instruction there he said And if any one has read Zola s description of the workman s marriage party visiting the Louvre they would do well to have heard Bazin by way of antidote He had delighted in the museums in his youth One sees there little miracles of work he said that is what makes a good workman it kindles a spark We asked him how he managed in La Fere I am married he said and I have my pretty children But frankly it is no life at all From morning to night I pledge a pack of good enough fellows who know nothing It faired as the night went on and the moon came out of the clouds We sat in front of the door talking softly with Bazin At the guardhouse opposite the guard was being for ever turned out as trains of field artillery kept clanking in out of the night or patrols of horsemen trotted by in their cloaks Madame Bazin came out after a while she was tired with her day s work I suppose and she nestled up to her husband and laid her head upon his breast He had his arm about her and kept gently patting her on the shoulder I think Bazin was right and he was really married Of how few people can the same be said Little did the Bazins know how much they served us We were charged for candles for food and drink and for the beds we slept in But there was nothing in the bill for the husband s pleasant talk nor for the pretty spectacle of their married life And there was yet another item uncharged For these people s politeness really set us up again in our own esteem We had a thirst for consideration the sense of insult was still hot in our spirits and civil usage seemed to restore us to our position in the world How little we pay our way in life Although we have our purses continually in our hand the better part of service goes still unrewarded But I like to fancy that a grateful spirit gives as good as it gets Perhaps the Bazins knew how much I liked them perhaps they also were healed of some slights by the thanks that I gave them in my manner DOWN THE OISE THROUGH THE GOLDEN VALLEY Below La Fere the river runs through a piece of open pastoral country green opulent loved by breeders called the Golden Valley In wide sweeps and with a swift and equable gallop the ceaseless stream of water visits and makes green the fields Kine and horses and little humorous donkeys browse together in the meadows and come down in troops to the riverside to drink They make a strange feature in the landscape above all when they are startled and you see them galloping to and fro with their incongruous forms and faces It gives a feeling as of great unfenced pampas and the herds of wandering nations There were hills in the distance upon either hand and on one side the river sometimes bordered on the wooded spurs of Coucy and saint Gobain The artillery were practicing at La Fere and soon the cannon of heaven joined in that loud play Two continents of cloud met and exchanged salvos overhead while all round the horizon we could see sunshine and clear air upon the hills What with the guns and the thunder the herds were all frightened in the Golden Valley We could see them tossing their heads and running to and fro in timorous indecision and when they had made up their minds and the donkey followed the horse and the cow was after the donkey we could hear their hooves thundering abroad over the meadows It had a martial sound like cavalry charges And altogether as far as the ears are concerned we had a very rousing battle piece performed for our amusement At last the guns and the thunder dropped off the sun shone on the wet meadows the air was scented with the breath of rejoicing trees and grass and the river kept unweariedly carrying us on at its best pace There was a manufacturing district about Chauny and after that the banks grew so high that they hid the adjacent country and we could see nothing but clay sides and one willow after another Only here and there we passed by a village or a ferry and some wondering child upon the bank would stare after us until we turned the corner I daresay we continued to paddle in that child s dreams for many a night after Sun and shower alternated like day and night making the hours longer by their variety When the showers were heavy I could feel each drop striking through my jersey to my warm skin and the accumulation of small shocks put me nearly beside myself I decided I should buy a mackintosh at Noyon It is nothing to get wet but the misery of these individual pricks of cold all over my body at the same instant of time made me flail the water with my paddle like a madman The Cigarette was greatly amused by these ebullitions It gave him something else to look at besides clay banks and willows All the time the river stole away like a thief in straight places or swung round corners with an eddy the willows nodded and were undermined all day long the clay banks tumbled in the Oise which had been so many centuries making the Golden Valley seemed to have changed its fancy and to be bent upon undoing its performance What a number of things a river does by simply following Gravity in the innocence of its heart NOYON CATHEDRAL Noyon stands about a mile from the river in a little plain surrounded by wooded hills and entirely covers an eminence with its tile roofs surmounted by a long straight backed cathedral with two stiff towers As we got into the town the tile roofs seemed to tumble uphill one upon another in the oddest disorder but for all their scrambling they did not attain above the knees of the cathedral which stood upright and solemn over all As the streets drew near to this presiding genius through the market place under the Hotel de Ville they grew emptier and more composed Blank walls and shuttered windows were turned to the great edifice and grass grew on the white causeway Put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground The Hotel du Nord nevertheless lights its secular tapers within a stone cast of the church and we had the superb east end before our eyes all morning from the window of our bedroom I have seldom looked on the east end of a church with more complete sympathy As it flanges out in three wide terraces and settles down broadly on the earth it looks like the poop of some great old battle ship Hollow backed buttresses carry vases which figure for the stern lanterns There is a roll in the ground and the towers just appear above the pitch of the roof as though the good ship were bowing lazily over an Atlantic swell At any moment it might be a hundred feet away from you climbing the next billow At any moment a window might open and some old admiral thrust forth a cocked hat and proceed to take an observation The old admirals sail the sea no longer the old ships of battle are all broken up and live only in pictures but this that was a church before ever they were thought upon is still a church and makes as brave an appearance by the Oise The cathedral and the river are probably the two oldest things for miles around and certainly they have both a grand old age The Sacristan took us to the top of one of the towers and showed us the five bells hanging in their loft From above the town was a tessellated pavement of roofs and gardens the old line of rampart was plainly traceable and the Sacristan pointed out to us far across the plain in a bit of gleaming sky between two clouds the towers of Chateau Coucy I find I never weary of great churches It is my favourite kind of mountain scenery Mankind was never so happily inspired as when it made a cathedral a thing as single and specious as a statue to the first glance and yet on examination as lively and interesting as a forest in detail The height of spires cannot be taken by trigonometry they measure absurdly short but how tall they are to the admiring eye And where we have so many elegant proportions growing one out of the other and all together into one it seems as if proportion transcended itself and became something different and more imposing I could never fathom how a man dares to lift up his voice to preach in a cathedral What is he to say that will not be an anti climax For though I have heard a considerable variety of sermons I never yet heard one that was so expressive as a cathedral Tis the best preacher itself and preaches day and night not only telling you of man s art and aspirations in the past but convicting your own soul of ardent sympathies or rather like all good preachers it sets you preaching to yourself and every man is his own doctor of divinity in the last resort As I sat outside of the hotel in the course of the afternoon the sweet groaning thunder of the organ floated out of the church like a summons I was not averse liking the theatre so well to sit out an act or two of the play but I could never rightly make out the nature of the service I beheld Four or five priests and as many choristers were singing Miserere before the high altar when I went in There was no congregation but a few old women on chairs and old men kneeling on the pavement After a while a long train of young girls walking two and two each with a lighted taper in her hand and all dressed in black with a white veil came from behind the altar and began to descend the nave the four first carrying a Virgin and child upon a table The priests and choristers arose from their knees and followed after singing Ave Mary as they went In this order they made the circuit of the cathedral passing twice before me where I leaned against a pillar The priest who seemed of most consequence was a strange down looking old man He kept mumbling prayers with his lips but as he looked upon me darkling it did not seem as if prayer were uppermost in his heart Two others who bore the burthen of the chant were stout brutal military looking men of forty with bold over fed eyes they sang with some lustiness and trolled forth Ave Mary like a garrison catch The little girls were timid and grave As they footed slowly up the aisle each one took a moment s glance at the Englishman and the big nun who played marshal fairly stared him out of countenance As for the choristers from first to last they misbehaved as only boys can misbehave and cruelly marred the performance with their antics I understood a great deal of the spirit of what went on Indeed it would be difficult not to understand the Miserere which I take to be the composition of an atheist If it ever be a good thing to take such despondency to heart the Miserere is the right music and a cathedral a fit scene So far I am at one with the Catholics an odd name for them after all But why in God s name these holiday choristers why these priests who steal wandering looks about the congregation while they feign to be at prayer why this fat nun who rudely arranges her procession and shakes delinquent virgins by the elbow why this spitting and snuffing and forgetting of keys and the thousand and one little misadventures that disturb a frame of mind laboriously edified with chants and organings In any playhouse reverend fathers may see what can be done with a little art and how to move high sentiments it is necessary to drill the supernumeraries and have every stool in its proper place One other circumstance distressed me I could bear a Miserere myself having had a good deal of open air exercise of late but I wished the old people somewhere else It was neither the right sort of music nor the right sort of divinity for men and women who have come through most accidents by this time and probably have an opinion of their own upon the tragic element in life A person up in years can generally do his own Miserere for himself although I notice that such an one often prefers Jubilate Deo for his ordinary singing On the whole the most religious exercise for the aged is probably to recall their own experience so many friends dead so many hopes disappointed so many slips and stumbles and withal so many bright days and smiling providences there is surely the matter of a very eloquent sermon in all this On the whole I was greatly solemnized In the little pictorial map of our whole Inland Voyage which my fancy still preserves and sometimes unrolls for the amusement of odd moments Noyon cathedral figures on a most preposterous scale and must be nearly as large as a department I can still see the faces of the priests as if they were at my elbow and hear Ave Maria ora pro nobis sounding through the church All Noyon is blotted out for me by these superior memories and I do not care to say more about the place It was but a stack of brown roofs at the best where I believe people live very reputably in a quiet way but the shadow of the church falls upon it when the sun is low and the five bells are heard in all quarters telling that the organ has begun If ever I join the Church of Rome I shall stipulate to be Bishop of Noyon on the Oise DOWN THE OISE TO COMPIEGNE The most patient people grow weary at last with being continually wetted with rain except of course in the Scottish Highlands where there are not enough fine intervals to point the difference That was like to be our case the day we left Noyon I remember nothing of the voyage it was nothing but clay banks and willows and rain incessant pitiless beating rain until we stopped to lunch at a little inn at Pimprez where the canal ran very near the river We were so sadly drenched that the landlady lit a few sticks in the chimney for our comfort there we sat in a steam of vapour lamenting our concerns The husband donned a game bag and strode out to shoot the wife sat in a far corner watching us I think we were worth looking at We grumbled over the misfortune of La Fere we forecast other La Feres in the future although things went better with the Cigarette for spokesman he had more aplomb altogether than I and a dull positive way of approaching a landlady that carried off the india rubber bags Talking of La Fere put us talking of the reservists Reservery said he seems a pretty mean way to spend one s autumn holiday About as mean returned I dejectedly as canoeing These gentlemen travel for their pleasure asked the landlady with unconscious irony It was too much The scales fell from our eyes Another wet day it was determined and we put the boats into the train The weather took the hint That was our last wetting The afternoon faired up grand clouds still voyaged in the sky but now singly and with a depth of blue around their path and a sunset in the daintiest rose and gold inaugurated a thick night of stars and a month of unbroken weather At the same time the river began to give us a better outlook into the country The banks were not so high the willows disappeared from along the margin and pleasant hills stood all along its course and marked their profile on the sky In a little while the canal coming to its last lock began to discharge its water houses on the Oise so that we had no lack of company to fear Here were all our old friends the Deo Gratias of Conde and the Four Sons of Aymon journeyed cheerily down stream along with us we exchanged waterside pleasantries with the steersman perched among the lumber or the driver hoarse with bawling to his horses and the children came and looked over the side as we paddled by We had never known all this while how much we missed them but it gave us a fillip to see the smoke from their chimneys A little below this junction we made another meeting of yet more account For there we were joined by the Aisne already a far travelled river and fresh out of Champagne Here ended the adolescence of the Oise this was his marriage day thenceforward he had a stately brimming march conscious of his own dignity and sundry dams He became a tranquil feature in the scene The trees and towns saw themselves in him as in a mirror He carried the canoes lightly on his broad breast there was no need to work hard against an eddy but idleness became the order of the day and mere straightforward dipping of the paddle now on this side now on that without intelligence or effort Truly we were coming into halcyon weather upon all accounts and were floated towards the sea like gentlemen We made Compiegne as the sun was going down a fine profile of a town above the river Over the bridge a regiment was parading to the drum People loitered on the quay some fishing some looking idly at the stream And as the two boats shot in along the water we could see them pointing them out and speaking one to another We landed at a floating lavatory where the washerwomen were still beating the clothes AT COMPIEGNE We put up at a big bustling hotel in Compiegne where nobody observed our presence Reservery and general militarismus as the Germans call it were rampant A camp of conical white tents without the town looked like a leaf out of a picture Bible sword belts decorated the walls of the cafes and the streets kept sounding all day long with military music It was not possible to be an Englishman and avoid a feeling of elation for the men who followed the drums were small and walked shabbily Each man inclined at his own angle and jolted to his own convenience as he went There was nothing of the superb gait with which a regiment of tall Highlanders moves behind its music solemn and inevitable like a natural phenomenon Who that has seen it can forget the drum major pacing in front the drummers tiger skins the pipers swinging plaids the strange elastic rhythm of the whole regiment footing it in time and the bang of the drum when the brasses cease and the shrill pipes take up the martial story in their place A girl at school in France began to describe one of our regiments on parade to her French schoolmates and as she went on she told me the recollection grew so vivid she became so proud to be the countrywoman of such soldiers and so sorry to be in another country that her voice failed her and she burst into tears I have never forgotten that girl and I think she very nearly deserves a statue To call her a young lady with all its niminy associations would be to offer her an insult She may rest assured of one thing although she never should marry a heroic general never see any great or immediate result of her life she will not have lived in vain for her native land But though French soldiers show to ill advantage on parade on the march they are gay alert and willing like a troop of fox hunters I remember once seeing a company pass through the forest of Fontainebleau on the Chailly road between the Bas Breau and the Reine Blanche One fellow walked a little before the rest and sang a loud audacious marching song The rest bestirred their feet and even swung their muskets in time A young officer on horseback had hard ado to keep his countenance at the words You never saw anything so cheerful and spontaneous as their gait schoolboys do not look more eagerly at hare and hounds and you would have thought it impossible to tire such willing marchers My great delight in Compiegne was the town hall I doted upon the town hall It is a monument of Gothic insecurity all turreted and gargoyled and slashed and bedizened with half a score of architectural fancies Some of the niches are gilt and painted and in a great square panel in the centre in black relief on a gilt ground Louis XII rides upon a pacing horse with hand on hip and head thrown back There is royal arrogance in every line of him the stirruped foot projects insolently from the frame the eye is hard and proud the very horse seems to be treading with gratification over prostrate serfs and to have the breath of the trumpet in his nostrils So rides for ever on the front of the town hall the good king Louis XII the father of his people Over the king s head in the tall centre turret appears the dial of a clock and high above that three little mechanical figures each one with a hammer in his hand whose business it is to chime out the hours and halves and quarters for the burgesses of Compiegne The centre figure has a gilt breast plate the two others wear gilt trunk hose and they all three have elegant flapping hats like cavaliers As the quarter approaches they turn their heads and look knowingly one to the other and then kling go the three hammers on three little bells below The hour follows deep and sonorous from the interior of the tower and the gilded gentlemen rest from their labours with contentment I had a great deal of healthy pleasure from their manoeuvres and took good care to miss as few performances as possible and I found that even the Cigarette while he pretended to despise my enthusiasm was more or less a devotee himself There is something highly absurd in the exposition of such toys to the outrages of winter on a housetop They would be more in keeping in a glass case before a Nuernberg clock Above all at night when the children are abed and even grown people are snoring under quilts does it not seem impertinent to leave these ginger bread figures winking and tinkling to the stars and the rolling moon The gargoyles may fitly enough twist their ape like heads fitly enough may the potentate bestride his charger like a centurion in an old German print of the Via Dolorosa but the toys should be put away in a box among some cotton until the sun rises and the children are abroad again to be amused In Compiegne post office a great packet of letters awaited us and the authorities were for this occasion only so polite as to hand them over upon application In some ways our journey may be said to end with this letter bag at Compiegne The spell was broken We had partly come home from that moment No one should have any correspondence on a journey it is bad enough to have to write but the receipt of letters is the death of all holiday feeling Out of my country and myself I go I wish to take a dive among new conditions for a while as into another element I have nothing to do with my friends or my affections for the time when I came away I left my heart at home in a desk or sent it forward with my portmanteau to await me at my destination After my journey is over I shall not fail to read your admirable letters with the attention they deserve But I have paid all this money look you and paddled all these strokes for no other purpose than to be abroad and yet you keep me at home with your perpetual communications You tug the string and I feel that I am a tethered bird You pursue me all over Europe with the little vexations that I came away to avoid There is no discharge in the war of life I am well aware but shall there not be so much as a week s furlough We were up by six the day we were to leave They had taken so little note of us that I hardly thought they would have condescended on a bill But they did with some smart particulars too and we paid in a civilized manner to an uninterested clerk and went out of that hotel with the india rubber bags unremarked No one cared to know about us It is not possible to rise before a village but Compiegne was so grown a town that it took its ease in the morning and we were up and away while it was still in dressing gown and slippers The streets were left to people washing doorsteps nobody was in full dress but the cavaliers upon the town hall they were all washed with dew spruce in their gilding and full of intelligence and a sense of professional responsibility Kling went they on the bells for the half past six as we went by I took it kindly of them to make me this parting compliment they never were in better form not even at noon upon a Sunday There was no one to see us off but the early washerwomen early and late who were already beating the linen in their floating lavatory on the river They were very merry and matutinal in their ways plunged their arms boldly in and seemed not to feel the shock It would be dispiriting to me this early beginning and first cold dabble of a most dispiriting day s work But I believe they would have been as unwilling to change days with us as we could be to change with them They crowded to the door to watch us paddle away into the thin sunny mists upon the river and shouted heartily alter us till we were through the bridge CHANGED TIMES There is a sense in which those mists never rose from off our journey and from that time forth they lie very densely in my note book As long as the Oise was a small rural river it took us near by people s doors and we could hold a conversation with natives in the riparian fields But now that it had grown so wide the life along shore passed us by at a distance It was the same difference as between a great public highway and a country by path that wanders in and out of cottage gardens We now lay in towns where nobody troubled us with questions we had floated into civilized life where people pass without salutation In sparsely inhabited places we make all we can of each encounter but when it comes to a city we keep to ourselves and never speak unless we have trodden on a man s toes In these waters we were no longer strange birds and nobody supposed we had travelled farther than from the last town I remember when we came into L Isle Adam for instance how we met dozens of pleasure boats outing it for the afternoon and there was nothing to distinguish the true voyager from the amateur except perhaps the filthy condition of my sail The company in one boat actually thought they recognized me for a neighbour Was there ever anything more wounding All the romance had come down to that Now on the upper Oise where nothing sailed as a general thing but fish a pair of canoeists could not be thus vulgarly explained away we were strange and picturesque intruders and out of people s wonder sprang a sort of light and passing intimacy all along our route There is nothing but tit for tat in this world though sometimes it be a little difficult to trace for the scores are older than we ourselves and there has never yet been a settling day since things were You get entertainment pretty much in proportion as you give As long as we were a sort of odd wanderers to be stared at and followed like a quack doctor or a caravan we had no want of amusement in return but as soon as we sank into commonplace ourselves all whom we met were similarly disenchanted And here is one reason of a dozen why the world is dull to dull persons In our earlier adventures there was generally something to do and that quickened us Even the showers of rain had a revivifying effect and shook up the brain from torpor But now when the river no longer ran in a proper sense only glided seaward with an even out right but imperceptible speed and when the sky smiled upon us day after day without variety we began to slip into that golden doze of the mind which follows upon much exercise in the open air I have stupefied myself in this way more than once indeed I dearly love the feeling but I never had it to the same degree as when paddling down the Oise It was the apotheosis of stupidity We ceased reading entirely Sometimes when I found a new paper I took a particular pleasure in reading a single number of the current novel but I never could bear more than three installments and even the second was a disappointment As soon as the tale became in any way perspicuous it lost all merit in my eyes only a single scene or as is the way with these feuilletons half a scene without antecedent or consequence like a piece of a dream had the knack of fixing my interest The less I saw of the novel the better I liked it a pregnant reflection But for the most part as I said we neither of us read anything in the world and employed the very little while we were awake between bed and dinner in poring upon maps I have always been fond of maps and can voyage in an atlas with the greatest enjoyment The names of places are singularly inviting the contour of coasts and rivers is enthralling to the eye and to hit in a map upon some place you have heard of before makes history a new possession But we thumbed our charts on these evenings with the blankest unconcern We cared not a fraction for this place or that We stared at the sheet as children listen to their rattle and read the names of towns or villages to forget them again at once We had no romance in the matter there was nobody so fancy free If you had taken the maps away while we were studying them most intently it is a fair bet whether we might not have continued to study the table with the same delight About one thing we were mightily taken up and that was eating I think I made a god of my belly I remember dwelling in imagination upon this or that dish till my mouth watered and long before we got in for the night my appetite was a clamant instant annoyance Sometimes we paddled alongside for a while and whetted each other with gastronomical fancies as we went Cake and sherry a homely refection but not within reach upon the Oise trotted through my head for many a mile and once as we were approaching Verberie the Cigarette brought my heart into my mouth by the suggestion of oyster patties and Sauterne I suppose none of us recognise the great part that is played in life by eating and drinking The appetite is so imperious that we can stomach the least interesting viands and pass off a dinner hour thankfully enough on bread and water just as there are men who must read something if it were only Bradshaw s Guide But there is a romance about the matter after all Probably the table has more devotees than love and I am sure that food is much more generally entertaining than scenery Do you give in as Walt Whitman would say that you are any the less immortal for that The true materialism is to be ashamed of what we are To detect the flavour of aean olive is no less a piece of human perfection than to find beauty in the colours of the sunset Canoeing was easy work To dip the paddle at the proper inclination now right now left to keep the head down stream to empty the little pool that gathered in the lap of the apron to screw up the eyes against the glittering sparkles of sun upon the water or now and again to pass below the whistling tow rope of the Deo Gratias of Conde or the Four Sons of Aymon there was not much art in that certain silly muscles managed it between sleep and waking and meanwhile the brain had a whole holiday and went to sleep We took in at a glance the larger features of the scene and beheld with half an eye bloused fishers and dabbling washerwomen on the bank Now and again we might be half wakened by some church spire by a leaping fish or by a trail of river grass that clung about the paddle and had to be plucked off and thrown away But these luminous intervals were only partially luminous A little more of us was called into action but never the whole The central bureau of nerves what in some moods we call Ourselves enjoyed its holiday without disturbance like a Government office The great wheels of intelligence turned idly in the head like fly wheels grinding no grist I have gone on for half an hour at a time counting my strokes and forgetting the hundreds I flatter myself the beasts that perish could not underbid that as a low form of consciousness And what a pleasure it was What a hearty tolerant temper did it bring about There is nothing captious about a man who has attained to this the one possible apotheosis in life the Apotheosis of Stupidity and he begins to feel dignified and longaevous like a tree There was one odd piece of practical metaphysics which accompanied what I may call the depth if I must not call it the intensity of my abstraction What philosophers call me and not me ego and non ego preoccupied me whether I would or no There was less me and more not me than I was accustomed to expect I looked on upon somebody else who managed the paddling I was aware of somebody else s feet against the stretcher my own body seemed to have no more intimate relation to me than the canoe or the river or the river banks Nor this alone something inside my mind a part of my brain a province of my proper being had thrown off allegiance and set up for itself or perhaps for the somebody else who did the paddling I had dwindled into quite a little thing in a corner of myself I was isolated in my own skull Thoughts presented themselves unbidden they were not my thoughts they were plainly some one else s and I considered them like a part of the landscape I take it in short that I was about as near Nirvana as would be convenient in practical life and if this be so I make the Buddhists my sincere compliments tis an agreeable state not very consistent with mental brilliancy not exactly profitable in a money point of view but very calm golden and incurious and one that sets a man superior to alarms It may be best figured by supposing yourself to get dead drunk and yet keep sober to enjoy it I have a notion that open air labourers must spend a large portion of their days in this ecstatic stupor which explains their high composure and endurance A pity to go to the expense of laudanum when here is a better paradise for nothing This frame of mind was the great exploit of our voyage take it all in all It was the farthest piece of travel accomplished Indeed it lies so far from beaten paths of language that I despair of getting the reader into sympathy with the smiling complacent idiocy of my condition when ideas came and went like motes in a sunbeam when trees and church spires along the bank surged up from time to time into my notice like solid objects through a rolling cloudland when the rhythmical swish of boat and paddle in the water became a cradle song to lull my thoughts asleep when a piece of mud on the deck was sometimes an intolerable eyesore and sometimes quite a companion for me and the object of pleased consideration and all the time with the river running and the shores changing upon either hand I kept counting my strokes and forgetting the hundreds the happiest animal in France DOWN THE OISE CHURCH INTERIORS We made our first stage below Compiegne to Pont Sainte Maxence I was abroad a little after six the next morning The air was biting and smelt of frost In an open place a score of women wrangled together over the day s market and the noise of their negotiation sounded thin and querulous like that of sparrows on a winter s morning The rare passengers blew into their hands and shuffled in their wooden shoes to set the blood agog The streets were full of icy shadow although the chimneys were smoking overhead in golden sunshine If you wake early enough at this season of the year you may get up in December to break your fast in June I found my way to the church for there is always something to see about a church whether living worshipers or dead men s tombs you find there the deadliest earnest and the hollowest deceit and even where it is not a piece of history it will be certain to leak out some contemporary gossip It was scarcely so cold in the church as it was without but it looked colder The white nave was positively arctic to the eye and the tawdriness of a continental altar looked more forlorn than usual in the solitude and the bleak air Two priests sat in the chancel reading and waiting penitents and out in the nave one very old woman was engaged in her devotions It was a wonder how she was able to pass her beads when healthy young people were breathing in their palms and slapping their chest but though this concerned me I was yet more dispirited by the nature of her exercises She went from chair to chair from altar to altar circumnavigating the church To each shrine she dedicated an equal number of beads and an equal length of time Like a prudent capitalist with a somewhat cynical view of the commercial prospect she desired to place her supplications in a great variety of heavenly securities She would risk nothing on the credit of any single intercessor Out of the whole company of saints and angels not one but was to suppose himself her champion elect against the Great Assize I could only think of it as a dull transparent jugglery based upon unconscious unbelief She was as dead an old woman as ever I saw no more than bone and parchment curiously put together Her eyes with which she interrogated mine were vacant of sense It depends on what you call seeing whether you might not call her blind Perhaps she had known love perhaps borne children suckled them and given them pet names But now that was all gone by and had left her neither happier nor wiser and the best she could do with her mornings was to come up here into the cold church and juggle for a slice of heaven It was not without a gulp that I escaped into the streets and the keen morning air Morning why how tired of it she would be before night and if she did not sleep how then It is fortunate that not many of us are brought up publicly to justify our lives at the bar of threescore years and ten fortunate that such a number are knocked opportunely on the head in what they call the flower of their years and go away to suffer for their follies in private somewhere else Otherwise between sick children and discontented old folk we might be put out of all conceit of life I had need of all my cerebral hygiene during that day s paddle the old devotee stuck in my throat sorely But I was soon in the seventh heaven of stupidity and knew nothing but that somebody was paddling a canoe while I was counting his strokes and forgetting the hundreds I used sometimes to be afraid I should remember the hundreds which would have made a toil of a pleasure but the terror was chimerical they went out of my mind by enchantment and I knew no more than the man in the moon about my only occupation At Creil where we stopped to lunch we left the canoes in another floating lavatory which as it was high noon was packed with washerwomen red handed and loud voiced and they and their broad jokes are about all I remember of the place I could look up my history books if you were very anxious and tell you a date or two for it figured rather largely in the English wars But I prefer to mention a girls boarding school which had an interest for us because it was a girls boarding school and because we imagined we had rather an interest for it At least there were the girls about the garden and here were we on the river and there was more than one handkerchief waved as we went by It caused quite a stir in my heart and yet how we should have wearied and despised each other these girls and I if we had been introduced at a croquet party But this is a fashion I love to kiss the hand or wave a handkerchief to people I shall never see again to play with possibility and knock in a peg for fancy to hang upon It gives the traveller a jog reminds him that he is not a traveller everywhere and that his journey is no more than a siesta by the way on the real march of life The church at Creil was a nondescript place in the inside splashed with gaudy lights from the windows and picked out with medallions of the Dolorous Way But there was one oddity in the way of an ex voto which pleased me hugely a faithful model of a canal boat swung from the vault with a written aspiration that God should conduct the Saint Nicolas of Creil to a good haven The thing was neatly executed and would have made the delight of a party of boys on the waterside But what tickled me was the gravity of the peril to be conjured You might hang up the model of a sea going ship and welcome one that is to plough a furrow round the world and visit the tropic or the frosty poles runs dangers that are well worth a candle and a mass But the Saint Nicolas of Creil which was to be tugged for some ten years by patient draught horses in a weedy canal with the poplars chattering overhead and the skipper whistling at the tiller which was to do all its errands in green inland places and never get out of sight of a village belfry in all its cruising why you would have thought if anything could be done without the intervention of Providence it would be that But perhaps the skipper was a humorist or perhaps a prophet reminding people of the seriousness of life by this preposterous token At Creil as at Noyon Saint Joseph seemed a favourite saint on the score of punctuality Day and hour can be specified and grateful people do not fail to specify them on a votive tablet when prayers have been punctually and neatly answered Whenever time is a consideration Saint Joseph is the proper intermediary I took a sort of pleasure in observing the vogue he had in France for the good man plays a very small part in my religion at home Yet I could not help fearing that where the Saint is so much commended for exactitude he will be expected to be very grateful for his tablet This is foolishness to us Protestants and not of great importance anyway Whether people s gratitude for the good gifts that come to them be wisely conceived or dutifully expressed is a secondary matter after all so long as they feel gratitude The true ignorance is when a man does not know that he has received a good gift or begins to imagine that he has got it for himself The self made man is the funniest wind bag after all There is a marked difference between decreeing light in chaos and lighting the gas in a metropolitan back parlour with a box of patent matches and do what we will there is always something made to our hand if it were only our fingers But there was something worse than foolishness placarded in Creil Church The Association of the Living Rosary of which I had never previously heard is responsible for that This Association was founded according to the printed advertisement by a brief of Pope Gregory Sixteenth on the seventeenth of January eighteen thirty two according to a coloured bas relief it seems to have been founded sometime or other by the Virgin giving one rosary to Saint Dominic and the Infant Saviour giving another to Saint Catharine of Siena Pope Gregory is not so imposing but he is nearer hand I could not distinctly make out whether the Association was entirely devotional or had an eye to good works at least it is highly organized the names of fourteen matrons and misses were filled in for each week of the month as associates with one other generally a married woman at the top for zelatrice the leader of the band Indulgences plenary and partial follow on the performance of the duties of the Association The partial indulgences are attached to the recitation of the rosary On the recitation of the required dizaine a partial indulgence promptly follows When people serve the kingdom of heaven with a pass book in their hands I should always be afraid lest they should carry the same commercial spirit into their dealings with their fellow men which would make a sad and sordid business of this life There is one more article however of happier import All these indulgences it appeared are applicable to souls in purgatory For God s sake ye ladies of Creil apply them all to the souls in purgatory without delay Burns would take no hire for his last songs preferring to serve his country out of unmixed love Suppose you were to imitate the exciseman mesdames and even if the souls in purgatory were not greatly bettered some souls in Creil upon the Oise would find themselves none the worse either here or hereafter I cannot help wondering as I transcribe these notes whether a Protestant born and bred is in a fit state to understand these signs and do them what justice they deserve and I cannot help answering that he is not They cannot look so merely ugly and mean to the faithful as they do to me I see that as clearly as a proposition in Euclid For these believers are neither weak nor wicked They can put up their tablet commending Saint Joseph for his despatch as if he were still a village carpenter they can recite the required dizaine and metaphorically pocket the indulgence as if they had done a job for Heaven and then they can go out and look down unabashed upon this wonderful river flowing by and up without confusion at the pin point stars which are themselves great worlds full of flowing rivers greater than the Oise I see it as plainly I say as a proposition in Euclid that my Protestant mind has missed the point and that there goes with these deformities some higher and more religious spirit than I dream I wonder if other people would make the same allowances for me Like the ladies of Creil having recited my rosary of toleration I look for my indulgence on the spot PRECY AND THE MARIONNETTES We made Precy about sundown The plain is rich with tufts of poplar In a wide luminous curve the Oise lay under the hillside A faint mist began to rise and confound the different distances together There was not a sound audible but that of the sheep bells in some meadows by the river and the creaking of a cart down the long road that descends the hill The villas in their gardens the shops along the street all seemed to have been deserted the day before and I felt inclined to walk discreetly as one feels in a silent forest All of a sudden we came round a corner and there in a little green round the church was a bevy of girls in Parisian costumes playing croquet Their laughter and the hollow sound of ball and mallet made a cheery stir in the neighbourhood and the look of these slim figures all corseted and ribboned produced an answerable disturbance in our hearts We were within sniff of Paris it seemed And here were females of our own species playing croquet just as if Precy had been a place in real life instead of a stage in the fairyland of travel For to be frank the peasant woman is scarcely to be counted as a woman at all and after having passed by such a succession of people in petticoats digging and hoeing and making dinner this company of coquettes under arms made quite a surprising feature in the landscape and convinced us at once of being fallible males The inn at Precy is the worst inn in France Not even in Scotland have I found worse fare It was kept by a brother and sister neither of whom was out of their teens The sister so to speak prepared a meal for us and the brother who had been tippling came in and brought with him a tipsy butcher to entertain us as we ate We found pieces of loo warm pork among the salad and pieces of unknown yielding substance in the ragout The butcher entertained us with pictures of Parisian life with which he professed himself well acquainted the brother sitting the while on the edge of the billiard table toppling precariously and sucking the stump of a cigar In the midst of these diversions bang went a drum past the house and a hoarse voice began issuing a proclamation It was a man with marionnettes announcing a performance for that evening He had set up his caravan and lighted his candles on another part of the girls croquet green under one of those open sheds which are so common in France to shelter markets and he and his wife by the time we strolled up there were trying to keep order with the audience It was the most absurd contention The show people had set out a certain number of benches and all who sat upon them were to pay a couple of sous for the accommodation They were always quite full a bumper house as long as nothing was going forward but let the show woman appear with an eye to a collection and at the first rattle of her tambourine the audience slipped off the seats and stood round on the outside with their hands in their pockets It certainly would have tried an angel s temper The showman roared from the proscenium he had been all over France and nowhere nowhere not even on the borders of Germany had he met with such misconduct Such thieves and rogues and rascals as he called them And every now and again the wife issued on another round and added her shrill quota to the tirade I remarked here as elsewhere how far more copious is the female mind in the material of insult The audience laughed in high good humour over the man s declamations but they bridled and cried aloud under the woman s pungent sallies She picked out the sore points She had the honour of the village at her mercy Voices answered her angrily out of the crowd and received a smarting retort for their trouble A couple of old ladies beside me who had duly paid for their seats waxed very red and indignant and discoursed to each other audibly about the impudence of these mountebanks but as soon as the show woman caught a whisper of this she was down upon them with a swoop if mesdames could persuade their neighbours to act with common honesty the mountebanks she assured them would be polite enough mesdames had probably had their bowl of soup and perhaps a glass of wine that evening the mountebanks also had a taste for soup and did not choose to have their little earnings stolen from them before their eyes Once things came as far as a brief personal encounter between the showman and some lads in which the former went down as readily as one of his own marionnettes to a peal of jeering laughter I was a good deal astonished at this scene because I am pretty well acquainted with the ways of French strollers more or less artistic and have always found them singularly pleasing Any stroller must be dear to the right thinking heart if it were only as a living protest against offices and the mercantile spirit and as something to remind us that life is not by necessity the kind of thing we generally make it Even a German band if you see it leaving town in the early morning for a campaign in country places among trees and meadows has a romantic flavour for the imagination There is nobody under thirty so dead but his heart will stir a little at sight of a gypsies camp We are not cotton spinners all or at least not all through There is some life in humanity yet and youth will now and again find a brave word to say in dispraise of riches and throw up a situation to go strolling with a knapsack An Englishman has always special facilities for intercourse with French gymnasts for England is the natural home of gymnasts This or that fellow in his tights and spangles is sure to know a word or two of English to have drunk English aff n aff and perhaps performed in an English music hall He is a countryman of mine by profession He leaps like the Belgian boating men to the notion that I must be an athlete myself But the gymnast is not my favourite he has little or no tincture of the artist in his composition his soul is small and pedestrian for the most part since his profession makes no call upon it and does not accustom him to high ideas But if a man is only so much of an actor that he can stumble through a farce he is made free of a new order of thoughts He has something else to think about beside the money box He has a pride of his own and what is of far more importance he has an aim before him that he can never quite attain He has gone upon a pilgrimage that will last him his life long because there is no end to it short of perfection He will better upon himself a little day by day or even if he has given up the attempt he will always remember that once upon a time he had conceived this high ideal that once upon a time he had fallen in love with a star Tis better to have loved and lost Although the moon should have nothing to say to Endymion although he should settle down with Audrey and feed pigs do you not think he would move with a better grace and cherish higher thoughts to the end The lout he meets at church never had a fancy above Audrey s snood but there is a reminiscence in Endymion s heart that like a spice keeps it fresh and haughty To be even one of the outskirters of art leaves a fine stamp on a man s countenance I remember once dining with a party in the inn at Chateau Landon Most of them were unmistakable bagmen others well to do peasantry but there was one young fellow in a blouse whose face stood out from among the rest surprisingly It looked more finished more of the spirit looked out through it it had a living expressive air and you could see that his eyes took things in My companion and I wondered greatly who and what he could be It was fair time in Chateau Landon and when we went along to the booths we had our question answered for there was our friend busily fiddling for the peasants to caper to He was a wandering violinist A troop of strollers once came to the inn where I was staying in the Department of Seine et Marne There was a father and mother two daughters brazen blowsy hussies who sang and acted without an idea of how to set about either and a dark young man like a tutor a recalcitrant house painter who sang and acted not amiss The mother was the genius of the party so far as genius can be spoken of with regard to such a pack of incompetent humbugs and her husband could not find words to express his admiration for her comic countryman You should see my old woman said he and nodded his beery countenance One night they performed in the stable yard with flaring lamps a wretched exhibition coldly looked upon by a village audience Next night as soon as the lamps were lighted there came a plump of rain and they had to sweep away their baggage as fast as possible and make off to the barn where they harboured cold wet and supperless In the morning a dear friend of mine who has as warm a heart for strollers as I have myself made a little collection and sent it by my hands to comfort them for their disappointment I gave it to the father he thanked me cordially and we drank a cup together in the kitchen talking of roads and audiences and hard times When I was going up got my old stroller and off with his hat I am afraid said he that Monsieur will think me altogether a beggar but I have another demand to make upon him I began to hate him on the spot We play again to night he went on Of course I shall refuse to accept any more money from Monsieur and his friends who have been already so liberal But our programme of to night is something truly creditable and I cling to the idea that Monsieur will honour us with his presence And then with a shrug and a smile Monsieur understands the vanity of an artist Save the mark The vanity of an artist That is the kind of thing that reconciles me to life a ragged tippling incompetent old rogue with the manners of a gentleman and the vanity of an artist to keep up his self respect But the man after my own heart is M de Vauversin It is nearly two years since I saw him first and indeed I hope I may see him often again Here is his first programme as I found it on the breakfast table and have kept it ever since as a relic of bright days Mesdames et Messieurs Mademoiselle Ferrario et M de Vauversin auront l honneur de chanter ce soir les morceaux suivants Mademoiselle Ferrario chantera Mignon Oiseaux legers France Des Francais dorment la Le chateau bleu Ou voulez vous aller M de Vauversin Madame Fountaine et M Robinet Les plongeurs a cheval Le mari mecontent Tais toi gamin Mon voisin l original Heureux comme ca Comme on est trompe They made a stage at one end of the salle a manger And what a sight it was to see M de Vauversin with a cigarette in his mouth twanging a guitar and following Mademoiselle Ferrario s eyes with the obedient kindly look of a dog The entertainment wound up with a tombola or auction of lottery tickets an admirable amusement with all the excitement of gambling and no hope of gain to make you ashamed of your eagerness for there all is loss you make haste to be out of pocket it is a competition who shall lose most money for the benefit of M de Vauversin and Mademoiselle Ferrario M de Vauversin is a small man with a great head of black hair a vivacious and engaging air and a smile that would be delightful if he had better teeth He was once an actor in the Chatelet but he contracted a nervous affection from the heat and glare of the footlights which unfitted him for the stage At this crisis Mademoiselle Ferrario otherwise Mademoiselle Rita of the Alcazar agreed to share his wandering fortunes I could never forget the generosity of that lady said he He wears trousers so tight that it has long been a problem to all who knew him how he manages to get in and out of them He sketches a little in water colours he writes verses he is the most patient of fishermen and spent long days at the bottom of the inn garden fruitlessly dabbling a line in the clear river You should hear him recounting his experiences over a bottle of wine such a pleasant vein of talk as he has with a ready smile at his own mishaps and every now and then a sudden gravity like a man who should hear the surf roar while he was telling the perils of the deep For it was no longer ago than last night perhaps that the receipts only amounted to a franc and a half to cover three francs of railway fare and two of board and lodging The Maire a man worth a million of money sat in the front seat repeatedly applauding Mlle Ferrario and yet gave no more than three sous the whole evening Local authorities look with such an evil eye upon the strolling artist Alas I know it well who have been myself taken for one and pitilessly incarcerated on the strength of the misapprehension Once M de Vauversin visited a commissary of police for permission to sing The commissary who was smoking at his ease politely doffed his hat upon the singer s entrance mister Commissary he began I am an artist And on went the commissary s hat again No courtesy for the companions of Apollo They are as degraded as that said M de Vauversin with a sweep of his cigarette But what pleased me most was one outbreak of his when we had been talking all the evening of the rubs indignities and pinchings of his wandering life Someone said it would be better to have a million of money down and Mlle Ferrario admitted that she would prefer that mightily Eh bien moi non not I cried De Vauversin striking the table with his hand If anyone is a failure in the world is it not I I had an art in which I have done things well as well as some better perhaps than others and now it is closed against me I must go about the country gathering coppers and singing nonsense Do you think I regret my life Do you think I would rather be a fat burgess like a calf Not I I have had moments when I have been applauded on the boards I think nothing of that but I have known in my own mind sometimes when I had not a clap from the whole house that I had found a true intonation or an exact and speaking gesture and then messieurs I have known what pleasure was what it was to do a thing well what it was to be an artist And to know what art is is to have an interest for ever such as no burgess can find in his petty concerns Tenez messieurs je vais vous le dire it is like a religion Such making some allowance for the tricks of memory and the inaccuracies of translation was the profession of faith of M de Vauversin I have given him his own name lest any other wanderer should come across him with his guitar and cigarette and Mademoiselle Ferrario for should not all the world delight to honour this unfortunate and loyal follower of the Muses May Apollo send him rhymes hitherto undreamed of may the river be no longer scanty of her silver fishes to his lure may the cold not pinch him on long winter rides nor the village jack in office affront him with unseemly manners and may he never miss Mademoiselle Ferrario from his side to follow with his dutiful eyes and accompany on the guitar The marionnettes made a very dismal entertainment They performed a piece called Pyramus and Thisbe in five mortal acts and all written in Alexandrines fully as long as the performers One marionnette was the king another the wicked counselor a third credited with exceptional beauty represented Thisbe and then there were guards and obdurate fathers and walking gentlemen Nothing particular took place during the two or three acts that I sat out but you will be pleased to learn that the unities were properly respected and the whole piece with one exception moved in harmony with classical rules That exception was the comic countryman a lean marionnette in wooden shoes who spoke in prose and in a broad patois much appreciated by the audience He took unconstitutional liberties with the person of his sovereign kicked his fellow marionnettes in the mouth with his wooden shoes and whenever none of the versifying suitors were about made love to Thisbe on his own account in comic prose This fellow s evolutions and the little prologue in which the showman made a humorous eulogium of his troop praising their indifference to applause and hisses and their single devotion to their art were the only circumstances in the whole affair that you could fancy would so much as raise a smile But the villagers of Precy seemed delighted Indeed so long as a thing is an exhibition and you pay to see it it is nearly certain to amuse If we were charged so much a head for sunsets or if God sent round a drum before the hawthorns came in flower what a work should we not make about their beauty But these things like good companions stupid people early cease to observe and the Abstract Bagman tittups past in his spring gig and is positively not aware of the flowers along the lane or the scenery of the weather overhead BACK TO THE WORLD Of the next two days sail little remains in my mind and nothing whatever in my note book The river streamed on steadily through pleasant riverside landscapes Washerwomen in blue dresses fishers in blue blouses diversified the green banks and the relation of the two colours was like that of the flower and the leaf in the forget me not A symphony in forget me not I think Theophile Gautier might thus have characterized that two days panorama The sky was blue and cloudless and the sliding surface of the river held up in smooth places a mirror to the heaven and the shores The washerwomen hailed us laughingly and the noise of trees and water made an accompaniment to our dozing thoughts as we fleeted down the stream The great volume the indefatigable purpose of the river held the mind in chain It seemed now so sure of its end so strong and easy in its gait like a grown man full of determination The surf was roaring for it on the sands of Havre For my own part slipping along this moving thoroughfare in my fiddle case of a canoe I also was beginning to grow aweary for my ocean To the civilized man there must come sooner or later a desire for civilization I was weary of dipping the paddle I was weary of living on the skirts of life I wished to be in the thick of it once more I wished to get to work I wished to meet people who understood my own speech and could meet with me on equal terms as a man and no longer as a curiosity And so a letter at Pontoise decided us and we drew up our keels for the last time out of that river of Oise that had faithfully piloted them through rain and sunshine for so long For so many miles had this fleet and footless beast of burthen charioted our fortunes that we turned our back upon it with a sense of separation We had made a long detour out of the world but now we were back in the familiar places where life itself makes all the running and we are carried to meet adventure without a stroke of the paddle Now we were to return like the voyager in the play and see what rearrangements fortune had perfected the while in our surroundings what surprises stood ready made for us at home and whither and how far the world had voyaged in our absence You may paddle all day long but it is when you come back at nightfall and look in at the familiar room that you find Love or Death awaiting you beside the stove and the most beautiful adventures are not those we go to seek EPILOGUE The country where they journeyed that green breezy valley of the Loing is one very attractive to cheerful and solitary people The weather was superb all night it thundered and lightened and the rain fell in sheets by day the heavens were cloudless the sun fervent the air vigorous and pure They walked separate the Cigarette plodding behind with some philosophy the lean Arethusa posting on ahead Thus each enjoyed his own reflections by the way each had perhaps time to tire of them before he met his comrade at the designated inn and the pleasures of society and solitude combined to fill the day The Arethusa carried in his knapsack the works of Charles of Orleans and employed some of the hours of travel in the concoction of English roundels In this path he must thus have preceded mister Lang mister Dobson mister Henley and all contemporary roundeleers but for good reasons he will be the last to publish the result The Cigarette walked burthened with a volume of Michelet And both these books it will be seen played a part in the subsequent adventure The Arethusa was unwisely dressed He is no precisian in attire but by all accounts he was never so ill inspired as on that tramp having set forth indeed upon a moment s notice from the most unfashionable spot in Europe Barbizon On his head he wore a smoking cap of Indian work the gold lace pitifully frayed and tarnished A flannel shirt of an agreeable dark hue which the satirical called black a light tweed coat made by a good English tailor ready made cheap linen trousers and leathern gaiters completed his array In person he is exceptionally lean and his face is not like those of happier mortals a certificate For years he could not pass a frontier or visit a bank without suspicion the police everywhere but in his native city looked askance upon him and although I am sure it will not be credited he is actually denied admittance to the casino of Monte Carlo If you will imagine him dressed as above stooping under his knapsack walking nearly five miles an hour with the folds of the ready made trousers fluttering about his spindle shanks and still looking eagerly round him as if in terror of pursuit the figure when realized is far from reassuring When Villon journeyed perhaps by the same pleasant valley to his exile at Roussillon I wonder if he had not something of the same appearance Something of the same preoccupation he had beyond a doubt for he too must have tinkered verses as he walked with more success than his successor And if he had anything like the same inspiring weather the same nights of uproar men in armour rolling and resounding down the stairs of heaven the rain hissing on the village streets the wild bull s eye of the storm flashing all night long into the bare inn chamber the same sweet return of day the same unfathomable blue of noon the same high coloured halcyon eves and above all if he had anything like as good a comrade anything like as keen a relish for what he saw and what he ate and the rivers that he bathed in and the rubbish that he wrote I would exchange estates to day with the poor exile and count myself a gainer But there was another point of similarity between the two journeys for which the Arethusa was to pay dear both were gone upon in days of incomplete security It was not long after the Franco Prussian war Swiftly as men forget that countryside was still alive with tales of uhlans and outlying sentries and hairbreadth scapes from the ignominious cord and pleasant momentary friendships between invader and invaded A year at the most two years later you might have tramped all that country over and not heard one anecdote And a year or two later you would if you were a rather ill looking young man in nondescript array have gone your rounds in greater safety for along with more interesting matter the Prussian spy would have somewhat faded from men s imaginations For all that our voyager had got beyond Chateau Renard before he was conscious of arousing wonder On the road between that place and Chatillon sur Loing however he encountered a rural postman they fell together in talk and spoke of a variety of subjects but through one and all the postman was still visibly preoccupied and his eyes were faithful to the Arethusa s knapsack At last with mysterious roguishness he inquired what it contained and on being answered shook his head with kindly incredulity Non said he non vous avez des portraits And then with a languishing appeal Voyons show me the portraits It was some little time before the Arethusa with a shout of laughter recognized his drift By portraits he meant indecent photographs and in the Arethusa an austere and rising author he thought to have identified a pornographic colporteur When country folk in France have made up their minds as to a person s calling argument is fruitless Along all the rest of the way the postman piped and fluted meltingly to get a sight of the collection now he would upbraid now he would reason Voyons I will tell nobody then he tried corruption and insisted on paying for a glass of wine and at last when their ways separated Non said he ce n est pas bien de votre part O non ce n est pas bien And shaking his head with quite a sentimental sense of injury he departed unrefreshed On certain little difficulties encountered by the Arethusa at Chatillon sur Loing I have not space to dwell another Chatillon of grislier memory looms too near at hand But the next day in a certain hamlet called La Jussiere he stopped to drink a glass of syrup in a very poor bare drinking shop The hostess a comely woman suckling a child examined the traveller with kindly and pitying eyes You are not of this Department she asked The Arethusa told her he was English Ah she said surprised We have no English We have many Italians however and they do very well they do not complain of the people of hereabouts An Englishman may do very well also it will be something new Here was a dark saying over which the Arethusa pondered as he drank his grenadine but when he rose and asked what was to pay the light came upon him in a flash O pour vous replied the landlady a halfpenny Pour vous By heaven she took him for a beggar He paid his halfpenny feeling that it were ungracious to correct her But when he was forth again upon the road he became vexed in spirit The conscience is no gentleman he is a rabbinical fellow and his conscience told him he had stolen the syrup That night the travellers slept in Gien the next day they passed the river and set forth severally as their custom was on a short stage through the green plain upon the Berry side to Chatillon sur Loire It was the first day of the shooting and the air rang with the report of fire arms and the admiring cries of sportsmen Overhead the birds were in consternation wheeling in clouds settling and re arising And yet with all this bustle on either hand the road itself lay solitary The Arethusa smoked a pipe beside a milestone and I remember he laid down very exactly all he was to do at Chatillon how he was to enjoy a cold plunge to change his shirt and to await the Cigarette s arrival in sublime inaction by the margin of the Loire Fired by these ideas he pushed the more rapidly forward and came early in the afternoon and in a breathing heat to the entering in of that ill fated town Childe Roland to the dark tower came A polite gendarme threw his shadow on the path Monsieur est voyageur he asked And the Arethusa strong in his innocence forgetful of his vile attire replied I had almost said with gaiety So it would appear His papers are in order said the gendarme And when the Arethusa with a slight change of voice admitted he had none he was informed politely enough that he must appear before the Commissary The Commissary sat at a table in his bedroom stripped to the shirt and trousers but still copiously perspiring and when he turned upon the prisoner a large meaningless countenance that was like Bardolph s all whelks and bubuckles the dullest might have been prepared for grief Here was a stupid man sleepy with the heat and fretful at the interruption whom neither appeal nor argument could reach The Commissary You have no papers The Arethusa Not here The Commissary Why The Arethusa I have left them behind in my valise The Commissary You know however that it is forbidden to circulate without papers The Arethusa Pardon me I am convinced of the contrary I am here on my rights as an English subject by international treaty The Commissary with scorn You call yourself an Englishman The Arethusa I do The Commissary Humph What is your trade The Arethusa I am a Scottish Advocate The Commissary with singular annoyance A Scottish Advocate Do you then pretend to support yourself by that in this Department The Arethusa modestly disclaimed the pretension The Commissary had scored a point The Commissary Why then do you travel The Arethusa I travel for pleasure The Commissary pointing to the knapsack and with sublime incredulity Avec ca Voyez vous je suis un homme intelligent With that Look here I am a person of intelligence The culprit remaining silent under this home thrust the Commissary relished his triumph for a while and then demanded like the postman but with what different expectations to see the contents of the knapsack And here the Arethusa not yet sufficiently awake to his position fell into a grave mistake There was little or no furniture in the room except the Commissary s chair and table and to facilitate matters the Arethusa with all the innocence on earth leant the knapsack on a corner of the bed The Commissary fairly bounded from his seat his face and neck flushed past purple almost into blue and he screamed to lay the desecrating object on the floor The knapsack proved to contain a change of shirts of shoes of socks and of linen trousers a small dressing case a piece of soap in one of the shoes two volumes of the Collection Jannet lettered Poesies de Charles d Orleans a map and a version book containing divers notes in prose and the remarkable English roundels of the voyager still to this day unpublished the Commissary of Chatillon is the only living man who has clapped an eye on these artistic trifles He turned the assortment over with a contumelious finger it was plain from his daintiness that he regarded the Arethusa and all his belongings as the very temple of infection Still there was nothing suspicious about the map nothing really criminal except the roundels as for Charles of Orleans to the ignorant mind of the prisoner he seemed as good as a certificate and it was supposed the farce was nearly over The inquisitor resumed his seat The Commissary after a pause Eh bien je vais vous dire ce que vous etes Vous etes allemand el vous venez chanter a la foire Well then I will tell you what you are You are a German and have come to sing at the fair The Arethusa Would you like to hear me sing I believe I could convince you of the contrary The Commissary Pas de plaisanterie monsieur The Arethusa Well sir oblige me at least by looking at this book Here I open it with my eyes shut Read one of these songs read this one and tell me you who are a man of intelligence if it would be possible to sing it at a fair The Commissary critically Mais oui Tres bien The Arethusa Comment monsieur What But do you not observe it is antique It is difficult to understand even for you and me but for the audience at a fair it would be meaningless The Commissary taking a pen Enfin il faut en finir What is your name The Arethusa speaking with the swallowing vivacity of the English Robert Louis Stev ns n The Commissary aghast He Quoi The Arethusa perceiving and improving his advantage Rob rt Lou s Stev ns n The Commissary after several conflicts with his pen Eh bien il faut se passer du nom Ca ne s ecrit pas Well we must do without the name it is unspellable The above is a rough summary of this momentous conversation in which I have been chiefly careful to preserve the plums of the Commissary but the remainder of the scene perhaps because of his rising anger has left but little definite in the memory of the Arethusa The Commissary was not I think a practiced literary man no sooner at least had he taken pen in hand and embarked on the composition of the proces verbal than he became distinctly more uncivil and began to show a predilection for that simplest of all forms of repartee You lie Several times the Arethusa let it pass and then suddenly flared up refused to accept more insults or to answer further questions defied the Commissary to do his worst and promised him if he did that he should bitterly repent it Perhaps if he had worn this proud front from the first instead of beginning with a sense of entertainment and then going on to argue the thing might have turned otherwise for even at this eleventh hour the Commissary was visibly staggered But it was too late he had been challenged the proces verbal was begun and he again squared his elbows over his writing and the Arethusa was led forth a prisoner A step or two down the hot road stood the gendarmerie Thither was our unfortunate conducted and there he was bidden to empty forth the contents of his pockets A handkerchief a pen a pencil a pipe and tobacco matches and some ten francs of change that was all Not a file not a cipher not a scrap of writing whether to identify or to condemn The very gendarme was appalled before such destitution I regret he said that I arrested you for I see that you are no voyou And he promised him every indulgence The Arethusa thus encouraged asked for his pipe That he was told was impossible but if he chewed he might have some tobacco He did not chew however and asked instead to have his handkerchief Non said the gendarme Nous avons eu des histoires de gens qui se sont pendus No we have had histories of people who hanged themselves What cried the Arethusa And is it for that you refuse me my handkerchief But see how much more easily I could hang myself in my trousers The man was struck by the novelty of the idea but he stuck to his colours and only continued to repeat vague offers of service At least said the Arethusa be sure that you arrest my comrade he will follow me ere long on the same road and you can tell him by the sack upon his shoulders This promised the prisoner was led round into the back court of the building a cellar door was opened he was motioned down the stair and bolts grated and chains clanged behind his descending person The philosophic and still more the imaginative mind is apt to suppose itself prepared for any mortal accident Prison among other ills was one that had been often faced by the undaunted Arethusa Even as he went down the stairs he was telling himself that here was a famous occasion for a roundel and that like the committed linnets of the tuneful cavalier he too would make his prison musical I will tell the truth at once the roundel was never written or it should be printed in this place to raise a smile Two reasons interfered the first moral the second physical It is one of the curiosities of human nature that although all men are liars they can none of them bear to be told so of themselves To get and take the lie with equanimity is a stretch beyond the stoic and the Arethusa who had been surfeited upon that insult was blazing inwardly with a white heat of smothered wrath But the physical had also its part The cellar in which he was confined was some feet underground and it was only lighted by an unglazed narrow aperture high up in the wall and smothered in the leaves of a green vine The walls were of naked masonry the floor of bare earth by way of furniture there was an earthenware basin a water jug and a wooden bedstead with a blue grey cloak for bedding To be taken from the hot air of a summer s afternoon the reverberation of the road and the stir of rapid exercise and plunged into the gloom and damp of this receptacle for vagabonds struck an instant chill upon the Arethusa s blood Now see in how small a matter a hardship may consist the floor was exceedingly uneven under foot with the very spade marks I suppose of the labourers who dug the foundations of the barrack and what with the poor twilight and the irregular surface walking was impossible The caged author resisted for a good while but the chill of the place struck deeper and deeper and at length with such reluctance as you may fancy he was driven to climb upon the bed and wrap himself in the public covering There then he lay upon the verge of shivering plunged in semi darkness wound in a garment whose touch he dreaded like the plague and in a spirit far removed from resignation telling the roll of the insults he had just received These are not circumstances favourable to the muse Meantime to look at the upper surface where the sun was still shining and the guns of sportsmen were still noisy through the tufted plain the Cigarette was drawing near at his more philosophic pace In those days of liberty and health he was the constant partner of the Arethusa and had ample opportunity to share in that gentleman s disfavour with the police Many a bitter bowl had he partaken of with that disastrous comrade He was himself a man born to float easily through life his face and manner artfully recommending him to all There was but one suspicious circumstance he could not carry off and that was his companion He will not readily forget the Commissary in what is ironically called the free town of Frankfort on the Main nor the Franco Belgian frontier nor the inn at La Fere last but not least he is pretty certain to remember Chatillon sur Loire At the town entry the gendarme culled him like a wayside flower and a moment later two persons in a high state of surprise were confronted in the Commissary s office For if the Cigarette was surprised to be arrested the Commissary was no less taken aback by the appearance and appointments of his captive Here was a man about whom there could be no mistake a man of an unquestionable and unassailable manner in apple pie order dressed not with neatness merely but elegance ready with his passport at a word and well supplied with money a man the Commissary would have doffed his hat to on chance upon the highway and this beau cavalier unblushingly claimed the Arethusa for his comrade The conclusion of the interview was foregone of its humours I remember only one Baronet demanded the magistrate glancing up from the passport Alors monsieur vous etes le fils d un baron And when the Cigarette his one mistake throughout the interview denied the soft impeachment Alors from the Commissary ce n est pas voire passeport But these were ineffectual thunders he never dreamed of laying hands upon the Cigarette presently he fell into a mood of unrestrained admiration gloating over the contents of the knapsack commending our friend s tailor Ah what an honoured guest was the Commissary entertaining What suitable clothes he wore for the warm weather What beautiful maps what an attractive work of history he carried in his knapsack You are to understand there was now but one point of difference between them what was to be done with the Arethusa the Cigarette demanding his release the Commissary still claiming him as the dungeon s own Now it chanced that the Cigarette had passed some years of his life in Egypt where he had made acquaintance with two very bad things cholera morbus and pashas and in the eye of the Commissary as he fingered the volume of Michelet it seemed to our traveller there was something Turkish I pass over this lightly it is highly possible there was some misunderstanding highly possible that the Commissary charmed with his visitor supposed the attraction to be mutual and took for an act of growing friendship what the Cigarette himself regarded as a bribe And at any rate was there ever a bribe more singular than an odd volume of Michelet s history The work was promised him for the morrow before our departure and presently after either because he had his price or to show that he was not the man to be behind in friendly offices Eh bien he said je suppose qu il faut lacher votre camarade And he tore up that feast of humour the unfinished proces verbal Ah if he had only torn up instead the Arethusa s roundels There are many works burnt at Alexandria there are many treasured in the British Museum that I could better spare than the proces verbal of Chatillon Poor bubuckled Commissary I begin to be sorry that he never had his Michelet perceiving in him fine human traits a broad based stupidity a gusto in his magisterial functions a taste for letters a ready admiration for the admirable And if he did not admire the Arethusa he was not alone in that To the imprisoned one shivering under the public covering there came suddenly a noise of bolts and chains He sprang to his feet ready to welcome a companion in calamity and instead of that the door was flung wide the friendly gendarme appeared above in the strong daylight and with a magnificent gesture being probably a student of the drama Vous etes libre he said None too soon for the Arethusa I doubt if he had been half an hour imprisoned but by the watch in a man s brain which was the only watch he carried he should have been eight times longer and he passed forth with ecstasy up the cellar stairs into the healing warmth of the afternoon sun and the breath of the earth came as sweet as a cow s into his nostril and he heard again and could have laughed for pleasure the concord of delicate noises that we call the hum of life And here it might be thought that my history ended but not so this was an act drop and not the curtain Upon what followed in front of the barrack since there was a lady in the case I scruple to expatiate The wife of the Marechal des logis was a handsome woman and yet the Arethusa was not sorry to be gone from her society Something of her image cool as a peach on that hot afternoon still lingers in his memory yet more of her conversation You have there a very fine parlour said the poor gentleman Ah said Madame la Marechale des logis you are very well acquainted with such parlours And you should have seen with what a hard and scornful eye she measured the vagabond before her I do not think he ever hated the Commissary but before that interview was at an end he hated Madame la Marechale His passion as I am led to understand by one who was present stood confessed in a burning eye a pale cheek and a trembling utterance Madame meanwhile tasting the joys of the matador goading him with barbed words and staring him coldly down It was certainly good to be away from this lady and better still to sit down to an excellent dinner in the inn Here too the despised travellers scraped acquaintance with their next neighbour a gentleman of these parts returned from the day s sport who had the good taste to find pleasure in their society The dinner at an end the gentleman proposed the acquaintance should be ripened in the cafe The cafe was crowded with sportsmen conclamantly explaining to each other and the world the smallness of their bags About the centre of the room the Cigarette and the Arethusa sat with their new acquaintance a trio very well pleased for the travellers after their late experience were greedy of consideration and their sportsman rejoiced in a pair of patient listeners Suddenly the glass door flew open with a crash the Marechal des logis appeared in the interval gorgeously belted and befrogged entered with salutation strode up the room with a clang of spurs and weapons and disappeared through a door at the far end Close at his heels followed the Arethusa s gendarme of the afternoon imitating with a nice shade of difference the imperial bearing of his chief only as he passed he struck lightly with his open hand on the shoulder of his late captive and with that ringing dramatic utterance of which he had the secret Suivez said he The arrest of the members the oath of the Tennis Court the signing of the Declaration of Independence Mark Antony s oration all the brave scenes of history I conceive as having been not unlike that evening in the cafe at Chatillon Terror breathed upon the assembly A moment later when the Arethusa had followed his recaptors into the farther part of the house the Cigarette found himself alone with his coffee in a ring of empty chairs and tables all the lusty sportsmen huddled into corners all their clamorous voices hushed in whispering all their eyes shooting at him furtively as at a leper And the Arethusa Well he had a long sometimes a trying interview in the back kitchen The Marechal des logis who was a very handsome man and I believe both intelligent and honest had no clear opinion on the case He thought the Commissary had done wrong but he did not wish to get his subordinates into trouble and he proposed this that and the other to all of which the Arethusa with a growing sense of his position demurred In short suggested the Arethusa you want to wash your hands of further responsibility Well then let me go to Paris The Marechal des logis looked at his watch You may leave said he by the ten o clock train for Paris And at noon the next day the travellers were telling their misadventure in the dining room at Siron s TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY IN THE CEVENNES My dear Sidney Colvin The journey which this little book is to describe was very agreeable and fortunate for me After an uncouth beginning I had the best of luck to the end But we are all travellers in what John Bunyan calls the wilderness of this world all too travellers with a donkey and the best that we find in our travels is an honest friend He is a fortunate voyager who finds many We travel indeed to find them They are the end and the reward of life They keep us worthy of ourselves and when we are alone we are only nearer to the absent Every book is in an intimate sense a circular letter to the friends of him who writes it They alone take his meaning they find private messages assurances of love and expressions of gratitude dropped for them in every corner The public is but a generous patron who defrays the postage Yet though the letter is directed to all we have an old and kindly custom of addressing it on the outside to one Of what shall a man be proud if he is not proud of his friends And so my dear Sidney Colvin it is with pride that I sign myself Affectionately yours R L S VELAY Many are the mighty things and naught is more mighty than man He masters by his devices the tenant of the fields SOPHOCLES Who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass JOB TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY THE DONKEY THE PACK AND THE PACK SADDLE In a little place called Le Monastier in a pleasant highland valley fifteen miles from Le Puy I spent about a month of fine days Monastier is notable for the making of lace for drunkenness for freedom of language and for unparalleled political dissension There are adherents of each of the four French parties Legitimists Orleanists Imperialists and Republicans in this little mountain town and they all hate loathe decry and calumniate each other Except for business purposes or to give each other the lie in a tavern brawl they have laid aside even the civility of speech Tis a mere mountain Poland In the midst of this Babylon I found myself a rallying point every one was anxious to be kind and helpful to the stranger This was not merely from the natural hospitality of mountain people nor even from the surprise with which I was regarded as a man living of his own free will in Le Monastier when he might just as well have lived anywhere else in this big world it arose a good deal from my projected excursion southward through the Cevennes A traveller of my sort was a thing hitherto unheard of in that district I was looked upon with contempt like a man who should project a journey to the moon but yet with a respectful interest like one setting forth for the inclement Pole All were ready to help in my preparations a crowd of sympathizers supported me at the critical moment of a bargain not a step was taken but was heralded by glasses round and celebrated by a dinner or a breakfast It was already hard upon October before I was ready to set forth and at the high altitudes over which my road lay there was no Indian summer to be looked for I was determined if not to camp out at least to have the means of camping out in my possession for there is nothing more harassing to an easy mind than the necessity of reaching shelter by dusk and the hospitality of a village inn is not always to be reckoned sure by those who trudge on foot A tent above all for a solitary traveller is troublesome to pitch and troublesome to strike again and even on the march it forms a conspicuous feature in your baggage A sleeping sack on the other hand is always ready you have only to get into it it serves a double purpose a bed by night a portmanteau by day and it does not advertise your intention of camping out to every curious passer by This is a huge point If a camp is not secret it is but a troubled resting place you become a public character the convivial rustic visits your bedside after an early supper and you must sleep with one eye open and be up before the day I decided on a sleeping sack and after repeated visits to Le Puy and a deal of high living for myself and my advisers a sleeping sack was designed constructed and triumphantly brought home This child of my invention was nearly six feet square exclusive of two triangular flaps to serve as a pillow by night and as the top and bottom of the sack by day I call it the sack but it was never a sack by more than courtesy only a sort of long roll or sausage green waterproof cart cloth without and blue sheep s fur within It was commodious as a valise warm and dry for a bed There was luxurious turning room for one and at a pinch the thing might serve for two I could bury myself in it up to the neck for my head I trusted to a fur cap with a hood to fold down over my ears and a band to pass under my nose like a respirator and in case of heavy rain I proposed to make myself a little tent or tentlet with my waterproof coat three stones and a bent branch It will readily be conceived that I could not carry this huge package on my own merely human shoulders It remained to choose a beast of burden Now a horse is a fine lady among animals flighty timid delicate in eating of tender health he is too valuable and too restive to be left alone so that you are chained to your brute as to a fellow galley slave a dangerous road puts him out of his wits in short he s an uncertain and exacting ally and adds thirty fold to the troubles of the voyager What I required was something cheap and small and hardy and of a stolid and peaceful temper and all these requisites pointed to a donkey There dwelt an old man in Monastier of rather unsound intellect according to some much followed by street boys and known to fame as Father Adam Father Adam had a cart and to draw the cart a diminutive she ass not much bigger than a dog the colour of a mouse with a kindly eye and a determined under jaw There was something neat and high bred a quakerish elegance about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot Our first interview was in Monastier market place To prove her good temper one child after another was set upon her back to ride and one after another went head over heels into the air until a want of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms and the experiment was discontinued from a dearth of subjects I was already backed by a deputation of my friends but as if this were not enough all the buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain and the ass and I and Father Adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour At length she passed into my service for the consideration of sixty five francs and a glass of brandy The sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer so that Modestine as I instantly baptized her was upon all accounts the cheaper article Indeed that was as it should be for she was only an appurtenance of my mattress or self acting bedstead on four castors I had a last interview with Father Adam in a billiard room at the witching hour of dawn when I administered the brandy He professed himself greatly touched by the separation and declared he had often bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black bread for himself but this according to the best authorities must have been a flight of fancy He had a name in the village for brutally misusing the ass yet it is certain that he shed a tear and the tear made a clean mark down one cheek By the advice of a fallacious local saddler a leather pad was made for me with rings to fasten on my bundle and I thoughtfully completed my kit and arranged my toilette By way of armoury and utensils I took a revolver a little spirit lamp and pan a lantern and some halfpenny candles a jack knife and a large leather flask The main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothing besides my travelling wear of country velveteen pilot coat and knitted spencer some books and my railway rug which being also in the form of a bag made me a double castle for cold nights The permanent larder was represented by cakes of chocolate and tins of Bologna sausage All this except what I carried about my person was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag and by good fortune I threw in my empty knapsack rather for convenience of carriage than from any thought that I should want it on my journey For more immediate needs I took a leg of cold mutton a bottle of Beaujolais an empty bottle to carry milk an egg beater and a considerable quantity of black bread and white like Father Adam for myself and donkey only in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed Monastrians of all shades of thought in politics had agreed in threatening me with many ludicrous misadventures and with sudden death in many surprising forms Cold wolves robbers above all the nocturnal practical joker were daily and eloquently forced on my attention Yet in these vaticinations the true patent danger was left out Like Christian it was from my pack I suffered by the way Before telling my own mishaps let me in two words relate the lesson of my experience If the pack is well strapped at the ends and hung at full length not doubled for your life across the pack saddle the traveller is safe The saddle will certainly not fit such is the imperfection of our transitory life it will assuredly topple and tend to overset but there are stones on every roadside and a man soon learns the art of correcting any tendency to overbalance with a well adjusted stone On the day of my departure I was up a little after five by six we began to load the donkey and ten minutes after my hopes were in the dust The pad would not stay on Modestine s back for half a moment I returned it to its maker with whom I had so contumelious a passage that the street outside was crowded from wall to wall with gossips looking on and listening The pad changed hands with much vivacity perhaps it would be more descriptive to say that we threw it at each other s heads and at any rate we were very warm and unfriendly and spoke with a deal of freedom I had a common donkey pack saddle a barde as they call it fitted upon Modestine and once more loaded her with my effects The doubled sack my pilot coat for it was warm and I was to walk in my waistcoat a great bar of black bread and an open basket containing the white bread the mutton and the bottles were all corded together in a very elaborate system of knots and I looked on the result with fatuous content In such a monstrous deck cargo all poised above the donkey s shoulders with nothing below to balance on a brand new pack saddle that had not yet been worn to fit the animal and fastened with brand new girths that might be expected to stretch and slacken by the way even a very careless traveller should have seen disaster brewing That elaborate system of knots again was the work of too many sympathizers to be very artfully designed It is true they tightened the cords with a will as many as three at a time would have a foot against Modestine s quarters and be hauling with clenched teeth but I learned afterwards that one thoughtful person without any exercise of force can make a more solid job than half a dozen heated and enthusiastic grooms I was then but a novice even after the misadventure of the pad nothing could disturb my security and I went forth from the stable door as an ox goeth to the slaughter THE GREEN DONKEY DRIVER The bell of Monastier was just striking nine as I got quit of these preliminary troubles and descended the hill through the common As long as I was within sight of the windows a secret shame and the fear of some laughable defeat withheld me from tampering with Modestine She tripped along upon her four small hoofs with a sober daintiness of gait from time to time she shook her ears or her tail and she looked so small under the bundle that my mind misgave me We got across the ford without difficulty there was no doubt about the matter she was docility itself and once on the other bank where the road begins to mount through pine woods I took in my right hand the unhallowed staff and with a quaking spirit applied it to the donkey Modestine brisked up her pace for perhaps three steps and then relapsed into her former minuet Another application had the same effect and so with the third I am worthy the name of an Englishman and it goes against my conscience to lay my hand rudely on a female I desisted and looked her all over from head to foot the poor brute s knees were trembling and her breathing was distressed it was plain that she could go no faster on a hill God forbid thought I that I should brutalize this innocent creature let her go at her own pace and let me patiently follow What that pace was there is no word mean enough to describe it was something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run it kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time in five minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the muscles of the leg And yet I had to keep close at hand and measure my advance exactly upon hers for if I dropped a few yards into the rear or went on a few yards ahead Modestine came instantly to a halt and began to browse The thought that this was to last from here to Alais nearly broke my heart Of all conceivable journeys this promised to be the most tedious I tried to tell myself it was a lovely day I tried to charm my foreboding spirit with tobacco but I had a vision ever present to me of the long long roads up hill and down dale and a pair of figures ever infinitesimally moving foot by foot a yard to the minute and like things enchanted in a nightmare approaching no nearer to the goal In the meantime there came up behind us a tall peasant perhaps forty years of age of an ironical snuffy countenance and arrayed in the green tail coat of the country He overtook us hand over hand and stopped to consider our pitiful advance Your donkey says he is very old I told him I believed not Then he supposed we had come far I told him we had but newly left Monastier Et vous marchez comme ca cried he and throwing back his head he laughed long and heartily I watched him half prepared to feel offended until he had satisfied his mirth and then You must have no pity on these animals said he and plucking a switch out of a thicket he began to lace Modestine about the stern works uttering a cry The rogue pricked up her ears and broke into a good round pace which she kept up without flagging and without exhibiting the least symptom of distress as long as the peasant kept beside us Her former panting and shaking had been I regret to say a piece of comedy My deus ex machina before he left me supplied some excellent if inhumane advice presented me with the switch which he declared she would feel more tenderly than my cane and finally taught me the true cry or masonic word of donkey drivers Proot All the time he regarded me with a comical incredulous air which was embarrassing to confront and smiled over my donkey driving as I might have smiled over his orthography or his green tail coat But it was not my turn for the moment I was proud of my new lore and thought I had learned the art to perfection And certainly Modestine did wonders for the rest of the forenoon and I had a breathing space to look about me It was Sabbath the mountain fields were all vacant in the sunshine and as we came down through saint Martin de Frugeres the church was crowded to the door there were people kneeling without upon the steps and the sound of the priest s chanting came forth out of the dim interior It gave me a home feeling on the spot for I am a countryman of the Sabbath so to speak and all Sabbath observances like a Scottish accent strike in me mixed feelings grateful and the reverse It is only a traveller hurrying by like a person from another planet who can rightly enjoy the peace and beauty of the great ascetic feast The sight of the resting country does his spirit good There is something better than music in the wide unusual silence and it disposes him to amiable thoughts like the sound of a little river or the warmth of sunlight In this pleasant humour I came down the hill to where Goudet stands in a green end of a valley with Chateau Beaufort opposite upon a rocky steep and the stream as clear as crystal lying in a deep pool between them Above and below you may hear it wimpling over the stones an amiable stripling of a river which it seems absurd to call the Loire On all sides Goudet is shut in by mountains rocky footpaths practicable at best for donkeys join it to the outer world of France and the men and women drink and swear in their green corner or look up at the snow clad peaks in winter from the threshold of their homes in an isolation you would think like that of Homer s Cyclops But it is not so the postman reaches Goudet with the letter bag the aspiring youth of Goudet are within a day s walk of the railway at Le Puy and here in the inn you may find an engraved portrait of the host s nephew Regis Senac Professor of Fencing and Champion of the two Americas a distinction gained by him along with the sum of five hundred dollars at Tammany Hall New York on the tenth April eighteen seventy six I hurried over my midday meal and was early forth again But alas as we climbed the interminable hill upon the other side Proot seemed to have lost its virtue I prooted like a lion I prooted mellifluously like a sucking dove but Modestine would be neither softened nor intimidated She held doggedly to her pace nothing but a blow would move her and that only for a second I must follow at her heels incessantly belabouring A moment s pause in this ignoble toil and she relapsed into her own private gait I think I never heard of any one in as mean a situation I must reach the lake of Bouchet where I meant to camp before sundown and to have even a hope of this I must instantly maltreat this uncomplaining animal The sound of my own blows sickened me Once when I looked at her she had a faint resemblance to a lady of my acquaintance who formerly loaded me with kindness and this increased my horror of my cruelty To make matters worse we encountered another donkey ranging at will upon the roadside and this other donkey chanced to be a gentleman He and Modestine met nickering for joy and I had to separate the pair and beat down their young romance with a renewed and feverish bastinado If the other donkey had had the heart of a male under his hide he would have fallen upon me tooth and hoof and this was a kind of consolation he was plainly unworthy of Modestine s affection But the incident saddened me as did everything that spoke of my donkey s sex It was blazing hot up the valley windless with vehement sun upon my shoulders and I had to labour so consistently with my stick that the sweat ran into my eyes Every five minutes too the pack the basket and the pilot coat would take an ugly slew to one side or the other and I had to stop Modestine just when I had got her to a tolerable pace of about two miles an hour to tug push shoulder and readjust the load And at last in the village of Ussel saddle and all the whole hypothec turned round and grovelled in the dust below the donkey s belly She none better pleased incontinently drew up and seemed to smile and a party of one man two women and two children came up and standing round me in a half circle encouraged her by their example I had the devil s own trouble to get the thing righted and the instant I had done so without hesitation it toppled and fell down upon the other side Judge if I was hot And yet not a hand was offered to assist me The man indeed told me I ought to have a package of a different shape I suggested if he knew nothing better to the point in my predicament he might hold his tongue And the good natured dog agreed with me smilingly It was the most despicable fix I must plainly content myself with the pack for Modestine and take the following items for my own share of the portage a cane a quart flask a pilot jacket heavily weighted in the pockets two pounds of black bread and an open basket full of meats and bottles I believe I may say I am not devoid of greatness of soul for I did not recoil from this infamous burden I disposed it Heaven knows how so as to be mildly portable and then proceeded to steer Modestine through the village She tried as was indeed her invariable habit to enter every house and every courtyard in the whole length and encumbered as I was without a hand to help myself no words can render an idea of my difficulties A priest with six or seven others was examining a church in process of repair and he and his acolytes laughed loudly as they saw my plight I remembered having laughed myself when I had seen good men struggling with adversity in the person of a jackass and the recollection filled me with penitence That was in my old light days before this trouble came upon me God knows at least that I shall never laugh again thought I But oh what a cruel thing is a farce to those engaged in it A little out of the village Modestine filled with the demon set her heart upon a by road and positively refused to leave it I dropped all my bundles and I am ashamed to say struck the poor sinner twice across the face It was pitiful to see her lift her head with shut eyes as if waiting for another blow I came very near crying but I did a wiser thing than that and sat squarely down by the roadside to consider my situation under the cheerful influence of tobacco and a nip of brandy Modestine in the meanwhile munched some black bread with a contrite hypocritical air It was plain that I must make a sacrifice to the gods of shipwreck I threw away the empty bottle destined to carry milk I threw away my own white bread and disdaining to act by general average kept the black bread for Modestine lastly I threw away the cold leg of mutton and the egg whisk although this last was dear to my heart Thus I found room for everything in the basket and even stowed the boating coat on the top By means of an end of cord I slung it under one arm and although the cord cut my shoulder and the jacket hung almost to the ground it was with a heart greatly lightened that I set forth again I I had now an arm free to thrash Modestine and cruelly I chastised her If I were to reach the lake side before dark she must bestir her little shanks to some tune Already the sun had gone down into a windy looking mist and although there were still a few streaks of gold far off to the east on the hills and the black fir woods all was cold and grey about our onward path An infinity of little country by roads led hither and thither among the fields It was the most pointless labyrinth I could see my destination overhead or rather the peak that dominates it but choose as I pleased the roads always ended by turning away from it and sneaking back towards the valley or northward along the margin of the hills The failing light the waning colour the naked unhomely stony country through which I was travelling threw me into some despondency I promise you the stick was not idle I think every decent step that Modestine took must have cost me at least two emphatic blows There was not another sound in the neighbourhood but that of my unwearying bastinado Suddenly in the midst of my toils the load once more bit the dust and as by enchantment all the cords were simultaneously loosened and the road scattered with my dear possessions The packing was to begin again from the beginning and as I had to invent a new and better system I do not doubt but I lost half an hour It began to be dusk in earnest as I reached a wilderness of turf and stones It had the air of being a road which should lead everywhere at the same time and I was falling into something not unlike despair when I saw two figures stalking towards me over the stones They walked one behind the other like tramps but their pace was remarkable The son led the way a tall ill made sombre Scottish looking man the mother followed all in her Sunday s best with an elegantly embroidered ribbon to her cap and a new felt hat atop and proffering as she strode along with kilted petticoats a string of obscene and blasphemous oaths I hailed the son and asked him my direction He pointed loosely west and north west muttered an inaudible comment and without slackening his pace for an instant stalked on as he was going right athwart my path The mother followed without so much as raising her head I shouted and shouted after them but they continued to scale the hillside and turned a deaf ear to my outcries At last leaving Modestine by herself I was constrained to run after them hailing the while They stopped as I drew near the mother still cursing and I could see she was a handsome motherly respectable looking woman The son once more answered me roughly and inaudibly and was for setting out again But this time I simply collared the mother who was nearest me and apologizing for my violence declared that I could not let them go until they had put me on my road They were neither of them offended rather mollified than otherwise told me I had only to follow them and then the mother asked me what I wanted by the lake at such an hour I replied in the Scottish manner by inquiring if she had far to go herself She told me with another oath that she had an hour and a half s road before her And then without salutation the pair strode forward again up the hillside in the gathering dusk I returned for Modestine pushed her briskly forward and after a sharp ascent of twenty minutes reached the edge of a plateau The view looking back on my day s journey was both wild and sad Mount Mezenc and the peaks beyond saint Julien stood out in trenchant gloom against a cold glitter in the east and the intervening field of hills had fallen together into one broad wash of shadow except here and there the outline of a wooded sugar loaf in black here and there a white irregular patch to represent a cultivated farm and here and there a blot where the Loire the Gazeille or the Laussonne wandered in a gorge Soon we were on a high road and surprise seized on my mind as I beheld a village of some magnitude close at hand for I had been told that the neighbourhood of the lake was uninhabited except by trout The road smoked in the twilight with children driving home cattle from the fields and a pair of mounted stride legged women hat and cap and all dashed past me at a hammering trot from the canton where they had been to church and market I asked one of the children where I was At Bouchet saint Nicholas he told me Thither about a mile south of my destination and on the other side of a respectable summit had these confused roads and treacherous peasantry conducted me My shoulder was cut so that it hurt sharply my arm ached like tooth ache from perpetual beating I gave up the lake and my design to camp and asked for the auberge I HAVE A GOAD The auberge of Bouchet saint Nicholas was among the least pretentious I have ever visited but I saw many more of the like upon my journey 
6609-111351-0000	train-other-500	Indeed it was typical of these French highlands Imagine a cottage of two stories with a bench before the door the stable and kitchen in a suite so that Modestine and I could hear each other dining furniture of the plainest earthen floors
6609-111351-0001	train-other-500	a single bed chamber for travellers and that without any convenience but beds In the kitchen cooking and eating go forward side by side and the family sleep at night Any one who has a fancy to wash must do so in public at the common table
6609-111351-0002	train-other-500	The food is sometimes spare hard fish and omelette have been my portion more than once the wine is of the smallest the brandy abominable to man and the visit of a fat sow
6609-111351-0003	train-other-500	grouting under the table and rubbing against your legs is no impossible accompaniment to dinner But the people of the inn in nine cases out of ten show themselves friendly and considerate As soon as you cross the doors you cease to be a stranger
6609-111351-0004	train-other-500	and although these peasantry are rude and forbidding on the highway they show a tincture of kind breeding when you share their hearth At Bouchet for instance I uncorked my bottle of Beaujolais and asked the host to join me He would take but little
6609-111351-0005	train-other-500	I am an amateur of such wine do you see he said and I am capable of leaving you not enough In these hedge inns the traveller is expected to eat with his own knife unless he ask no other will be supplied
6609-111351-0006	train-other-500	with a glass a whang of bread and an iron fork the table is completely laid My knife was cordially admired by the landlord of Bouchet and the spring filled him with wonder I should never have guessed that he said
6609-111351-0007	train-other-500	I would bet he added weighing it in his hand that this cost you not less than five francs When I told him it had cost me twenty his jaw dropped He was a mild handsome sensible friendly old man astonishingly ignorant
6609-111351-0008	train-other-500	His wife who was not so pleasant in her manners knew how to read although I do not suppose she ever did so She had a share of brains and spoke with a cutting emphasis like one who ruled the roast
6609-111351-0009	train-other-500	My man knows nothing she said with an angry nod he is like the beasts And the old gentleman signified acquiescence with his head There was no contempt on her part and no shame on his the facts were accepted loyally and no more about the matter
6609-111351-0010	train-other-500	I was tightly cross examined about my journey and the lady understood in a moment and sketched out what I should put into my book when I got home Whether people harvest or not in such or such a place if there were forests studies of manners
none	none	 what for example I and the master of the house say to you 
6609-111351-0011	train-other-500	the beauties of Nature and all that And she interrogated me with a look It is just that said I
none	none	 You see she added to her husband 
6609-111351-0012	train-other-500	I understood that They were both much interested by the story of my misadventures In the morning said the husband I will make you something better than your cane Such a beast as that feels nothing it is in the proverb dur comme un ane
6609-111351-0013	train-other-500	you might beat her insensible with a cudgel and yet you would arrive nowhere Something better I little knew what he was offering
none	none	 The sleeping room was furnished with two beds I had one and I will own I was a little abashed to find a young man and his wife and child 
6609-111351-0014	train-other-500	in the act of mounting into the other This was my first experience of the sort and if I am always to feel equally silly and extraneous I pray God it be my last as well
6609-111351-0015	train-other-500	I kept my eyes to myself and know nothing of the woman except that she had beautiful arms and seemed no whit embarrassed by my appearance As a matter of fact the situation was more trying to me than to the pair
6609-111351-0016	train-other-500	A pair keep each other in countenance it is the single gentleman who has to blush But I could not help attributing my sentiments to the husband and sought to conciliate his tolerance with a cup of brandy from my flask He told me that he was a cooper of Alais
6609-111351-0017	train-other-500	travelling to saint Etienne in search of work and that in his spare moments he followed the fatal calling of a maker of matches Me he readily enough divined to be a brandy merchant I was up first in the morning Monday September twenty third
6609-111351-0018	train-other-500	and hastened my toilette guiltily so as to leave a clear field for madam the cooper s wife I drank a bowl of milk and set off to explore the neighbourhood of Bouchet It was perishing cold a grey windy wintry morning
6609-111351-0019	train-other-500	misty clouds flew fast and low the wind piped over the naked platform
none	none	 and the only speck of colour was away behind Mount Mezenc 
6609-111351-0020	train-other-500	and the eastern hills where the sky still wore the orange of the dawn It was five in the morning and four thousand feet above the sea and I had to bury my hands in my pockets and trot People were trooping out to the labours of the field by twos and threes
6609-111351-0021	train-other-500	and all turned round to stare upon the stranger I had seen them coming back last night I saw them going afield again and there was the life of Bouchet in a nutshell
6609-111351-0022	train-other-500	When I came back to the inn for a bit of breakfast the landlady was in the kitchen combing out her daughter s hair and I made her my compliments upon its beauty Oh no said the mother
none	none	 it is not so beautiful as it ought to be Look it is too fine 
6609-111351-0023	train-other-500	Thus does a wise peasantry console itself under adverse physical circumstances and by a startling democratic process the defects of the majority decide the type of beauty And where said I is monsieur

none	none	 Blessed be the man who invented goads Blessed the innkeeper of Bouchet saint Nicholas 
6609-111351-0025	train-other-500	who introduced me to their use This plain wand with an eighth of an inch of pin was indeed a sceptre when he put it in my hands Thenceforward Modestine was my slave
6609-111351-0026	train-other-500	A prick and she passed the most inviting stable door A prick and she broke forth into a gallant little trotlet that devoured the miles
6609-111351-0027	train-other-500	It was not a remarkable speed when all was said and we took four hours to cover ten miles at the best of it But what a heavenly change since yesterday No more wielding of the ugly cudgel no more flailing with an aching arm no more broadsword exercise
none	none	 but a discreet and gentlemanly fence 
6609-111351-0028	train-other-500	And what although now and then a drop of blood should appear on Modestine s mouse coloured wedge like rump I should have preferred it otherwise indeed but yesterday s exploits had purged my heart of all humanity The perverse little devil
6609-111351-0029	train-other-500	since she would not be taken with kindness must even go with pricking It was bleak and bitter cold and except a cavalcade of stride legged ladies and a pair of post runners the road was dead solitary all the way to Pradelles
6609-111351-0030	train-other-500	I scarce remember an incident but one A handsome foal with a bell about his neck came charging up to us upon a stretch of common sniffed the air martially as one about to do great deeds and suddenly thinking otherwise in his green young heart
6609-111351-0031	train-other-500	put about and galloped off as he had come the bell tinkling in the wind For a long while afterwards I saw his noble attitude as he drew up and heard the note of his bell and when I struck the high road the song of the telegraph wires seemed to continue the same music
6609-111351-0032	train-other-500	Pradelles stands on a hillside high above the Allier surrounded by rich meadows They were cutting aftermath on all sides which gave the neighbourhood this gusty autumn morning an untimely smell of hay
6609-111351-0033	train-other-500	On the opposite bank of the Allier the land kept mounting for miles to the horizon a tanned and sallow autumn landscape with black blots of fir wood and white roads wandering through the hills Over all this the clouds shed a uniform and purplish shadow
6609-111351-0034	train-other-500	sad and somewhat menacing exaggerating height and distance and throwing into still higher relief the twisted ribbons of the highway It was a cheerless prospect but one stimulating to a traveller

none	none	 and before three quarters of an hour I was goading Modestine down the deep descent that leads to Langogne on the Allier 
6609-111351-0042	train-other-500	On both sides of the road in big dusty fields farmers were preparing for next spring Every fifty yards a yoke of great necked stolid oxen were patiently haling at the plough
6609-111351-0043	train-other-500	I saw one of these mild formidable servants of the glebe who took a sudden interest in Modestine and me The furrow down which he was journeying lay at an angle to the road and his head was solidly fixed to the yoke
6609-111351-0044	train-other-500	like those of caryatides below a ponderous cornice but he screwed round his big honest eyes and followed us with a ruminating look until his master bade him turn the plough and proceed to reascend the field
6609-111351-0045	train-other-500	From all these furrowing ploughshares from the feet of oxen from a labourer here and there who was breaking the dry clods with a hoe the wind carried away a thin dust like so much smoke It was a fine busy breathing rustic landscape and as I continued to descend

6609-111351-0046	train-other-500	I had crossed the Loire the day before
none	none	 now I was to cross the Allier so near are these two confluents in their youth Just at the bridge of Langogne as the long promised rain was beginning to fall a lassie of some seven or eight addressed me in the sacramental phrase D ou saint ce que vous venez She did it with so high an air that she set me laughing and this cut her to the quick She was evidently one who reckoned on respect and stood looking after me in silent dudgeon as I crossed the bridge and entered the county of Gevaudan UPPER GEVAUDAN The way also here was very wearisome through dirt and slabbiness nor was there on all this ground so much as one inn or victualling house wherein to refresh the feebler sort PILGRIM S PROGRESS A CAMP IN THE DARK The next day Tuesday September twenty fourth it was two o clock in the afternoon before I got my journal written up and my knapsack repaired for I was determined to carry my knapsack in the future and have no more ado with baskets and half an hour afterwards I set out for Le Cheylard l Eveque a place on the borders of the forest of Mercoire A man I was told should walk there in an hour and a half and I thought it scarce too ambitious to suppose that a man encumbered with a donkey might cover the same distance in four hours All the way up the long hill from Langogne it rained and hailed alternately the wind kept freshening steadily although slowly plentiful hurrying clouds some dragging veils of straight rain shower others massed and luminous as though promising snow careered out of the north and followed me along my way I was soon out of the cultivated basin of the Allier and away from the ploughing oxen and such like sights of the country Moor heathery marsh tracts of rock and pines woods of birch all jewelled with the autumn yellow here and there a few naked cottages and bleak fields these were the characters of the country Hill and valley followed valley and hill the little green and stony cattle tracks wandered in and out of one another split into three or four died away in marshy hollows and began again sporadically on hillsides or at the borders of a wood There was no direct road to Cheylard and it was no easy affair to make a passage in this uneven country and through this intermittent labyrinth of tracks It must have been about four when I struck Sagnerousse and went on my way rejoicing in a sure point of departure Two hours afterwards the dusk rapidly falling in a lull of the wind I issued from a fir wood where I had long been wandering and found not the looked for village but another marish bottom among rough and tumble hills For some time past I had heard the ringing of cattle bells ahead and now as I came out of the skirts of the wood I saw near upon a dozen cows and perhaps as many more black figures which I conjectured to be children although the mist had almost unrecognisably exaggerated their forms These were all silently following each other round and round in a circle now taking hands now breaking up with chains and reverences A dance of children appeals to very innocent and lively thoughts but at nightfall on the marshes the thing was eerie and fantastic to behold Even I who am well enough read in Herbert Spencer felt a sort of silence fall for an instant on my mind The next I was pricking Modestine forward and guiding her like an unruly ship through the open In a path she went doggedly ahead of her own accord as before a fair wind but once on the turf or among heather and the brute became demented The tendency of lost travellers to go round in a circle was developed in her to the degree of passion and it took all the steering I had in me to keep even a decently straight course through a single field While I was thus desperately tacking through the bog children and cattle began to disperse until only a pair of girls remained behind From these I sought direction on my path The peasantry in general were but little disposed to counsel a wayfarer One old devil simply retired into his house and barricaded the door on my approach and I might beat and shout myself hoarse he turned a deaf ear Another having given me a direction which as I found afterwards I had misunderstood complacently watched me going wrong without adding a sign He did not care a stalk of parsley if I wandered all night upon the hills As for these two girls they were a pair of impudent sly sluts with not a thought but mischief One put out her tongue at me the other bade me follow the cows and they both giggled and joggled each other s elbows The Beast of Gevaudan ate about a hundred children of this district I began to think of him with sympathy Leaving the girls I pushed on through the bog and got into another wood and upon a well marked road It grew darker and darker Modestine suddenly beginning to smell mischief bettered the pace of her own accord and from that time forward gave me no trouble It was the first sign of intelligence I had occasion to remark in her At the same time the wind freshened into half a gale and another heavy discharge of rain came flying up out of the north At the other side of the wood I sighted some red windows in the dusk This was the hamlet of Fouzilhic three houses on a hillside near a wood of birches Here I found a delightful old man who came a little way with me in the rain to put me safely on the road for Cheylard He would hear of no reward but shook his hands above his head almost as if in menace and refused volubly and shrilly in unmitigated patois All seemed right at last My thoughts began to turn upon dinner and a fireside and my heart was agreeably softened in my bosom Alas and I was on the brink of new and greater miseries Suddenly at a single swoop the night fell I have been abroad in many a black night but never in a blacker A glimmer of rocks a glimmer of the track where it was well beaten a certain fleecy density or night within night for a tree this was all that I could discriminate The sky was simply darkness overhead even the flying clouds pursued their way invisibly to human eyesight I could not distinguish my hand at arm s length from the track nor my goad at the same distance from the meadows or the sky Soon the road that I was following split after the fashion of the country into three or four in a piece of rocky meadow Since Modestine had shown such a fancy for beaten roads I tried her instinct in this predicament But the instinct of an ass is what might be expected from the name in half a minute she was clambering round and round among some boulders as lost a donkey as you would wish to see I should have camped long before had I been properly provided but as this was to be so short a stage I had brought no wine no bread for myself and little over a pound for my lady friend Add to this that I and Modestine were both handsomely wetted by the showers But now if I could have found some water I should have camped at once in spite of all Water however being entirely absent except in the form of rain I determined to return to Fouzilhic and ask a guide a little farther on my way a little farther lend thy guiding hand The thing was easy to decide hard to accomplish In this sensible roaring blackness I was sure of nothing but the direction of the wind To this I set my face the road had disappeared and I went across country now in marshy opens now baffled by walls unscalable to Modestine until I came once more in sight of some red windows This time they were differently disposed It was not Fouzilhic but Fouzilhac a hamlet little distant from the other in space but worlds away in the spirit of its inhabitants I tied Modestine to a gate and groped forward stumbling among rocks plunging mid leg in bog until I gained the entrance of the village In the first lighted house there was a woman who would not open to me She could do nothing she cried to me through the door being alone and lame but if I would apply at the next house there was a man who could help me if he had a mind They came to the next door in force a man two women and a girl and brought a pair of lanterns to examine the wayfarer The man was not ill looking but had a shifty smile He leaned against the doorpost and heard me state my case All I asked was a guide as far as Cheylard C est que voyez vous il fait noir said he I told him that was just my reason for requiring help I understand that said he looking uncomfortable mais c est de la peine I was willing to pay I said He shook his head I rose as high as ten francs but he continued to shake his head Name your own price then said I Ce n est pas ca he said at length and with evident difficulty but I am not going to cross the door mais je ne sortirai pas de la porte I grew a little warm and asked him what he proposed that I should do Where are you going beyond Cheylard he asked by way of answer That is no affair of yours I returned for I was not going to indulge his bestial curiosity it changes nothing in my present predicament C est vrai ca he acknowledged with a laugh oui c est vrai Et d ou venez vous A better man than I might have felt nettled Oh said I I am not going to answer any of your questions so you may spare yourself the trouble of putting them I am late enough already I want help If you will not guide me yourself at least help me to find some one else who will Hold on he cried suddenly Was it not you who passed in the meadow while it was still day Yes yes said the girl whom I had not hitherto recognized it was monsieur I told him to follow the cow As for you mademoiselle said I you are a farceuse And added the man what the devil have you done to be still here What the devil indeed But there I was The great thing said I is to make an end of it and once more proposed that he should help me to find a guide C est que he said again c est que il fait noir Very well said I take one of your lanterns No he cried drawing a thought backward and again entrenching himself behind one of his former phrases I will not cross the door I looked at him I saw unaffected terror struggling on his face with unaffected shame he was smiling pitifully and wetting his lip with his tongue like a detected schoolboy I drew a brief picture of my state and asked him what I was to do I don t know he said I will not cross the door Here was the Beast of Gevaudan and no mistake Sir said I with my most commanding manners you are a coward And with that I turned my back upon the family party who hastened to retire within their fortifications and the famous door was closed again but not till I had overheard the sound of laughter Filia barbara pater barbarior Let me say it in the plural the Beasts of Gevaudan The lanterns had somewhat dazzled me and I ploughed distressfully among stones and rubbish heaps All the other houses in the village were both dark and silent and though I knocked at here and there a door my knocking was unanswered It was a bad business I gave up Fouzilhac with my curses The rain had stopped and the wind which still kept rising began to dry my coat and trousers Very well thought I water or no water I must camp But the first thing was to return to Modestine I am pretty sure I was twenty minutes groping for my lady in the dark and if it had not been for the unkindly services of the bog into which I once more stumbled I might have still been groping for her at the dawn My next business was to gain the shelter of a wood for the wind was cold as well as boisterous How in this well wooded district I should have been so long in finding one is another of the insoluble mysteries of this day s adventures but I will take my oath that I put near an hour to the discovery At last black trees began to show upon my left and suddenly crossing the road made a cave of unmitigated blackness right in front I call it a cave without exaggeration to pass below that arch of leaves was like entering a dungeon I felt about until my hand encountered a stout branch and to this I tied Modestine a haggard drenched desponding donkey Then I lowered my pack laid it along the wall on the margin of the road and unbuckled the straps I knew well enough where the lantern was but where were the candles I groped and groped among the tumbled articles and while I was thus groping suddenly I touched the spirit lamp Salvation This would serve my turn as well The wind roared unwearyingly among the trees I could hear the boughs tossing and the leaves churning through half a mile of forest yet the scene of my encampment was not only as black as the pit but admirably sheltered At the second match the wick caught flame The light was both livid and shifting but it cut me off from the universe and doubled the darkness of the surrounding night I tied Modestine more conveniently for herself and broke up half the black bread for her supper reserving the other half against the morning Then I gathered what I should want within reach took off my wet boots and gaiters which I wrapped in my waterproof arranged my knapsack for a pillow under the flap of my sleeping bag insinuated my limbs into the interior and buckled myself in like a bambino I opened a tin of Bologna sausage and broke a cake of chocolate and that was all I had to eat It may sound offensive but I ate them together bite by bite by way of bread and meat All I had to wash down this revolting mixture was neat brandy a revolting beverage in itself But I was rare and hungry ate well and smoked one of the best cigarettes in my experience Then I put a stone in my straw hat pulled the flap of my fur cap over my neck and eyes put my revolver ready to my hand and snuggled well down among the sheepskins I questioned at first if I were sleepy for I felt my heart beating faster than usual as if with an agreeable excitement to which my mind remained a stranger But as soon as my eyelids touched that subtle glue leaped between them and they would no more come separate The wind among the trees was my lullaby Sometimes it sounded for minutes together with a steady even rush not rising nor abating and again it would swell and burst like a great crashing breaker and the trees would patter me all over with big drops from the rain of the afternoon Night after night in my own bedroom in the country I have given ear to this perturbing concert of the wind among the woods but whether it was a difference in the trees or the lie of the ground or because I was myself outside and in the midst of it the fact remains that the wind sang to a different tune among these woods of Gevaudan I hearkened and hearkened and meanwhile sleep took gradual possession of my body and subdued my thoughts and senses but still my last waking effort was to listen and distinguish and my last conscious state was one of wonder at the foreign clamour in my ears Twice in the course of the dark hours once when a stone galled me underneath the sack and again when the poor patient Modestine growing angry pawed and stamped upon the road I was recalled for a brief while to consciousness and saw a star or two overhead and the lace like edge of the foliage against the sky When I awoke for the third time Wednesday September twenty fifth the world was flooded with a blue light the mother of the dawn I saw the leaves labouring in the wind and the ribbon of the road and on turning my head there was Modestine tied to a beech and standing half across the path in an attitude of inimitable patience I closed my eyes again and set to thinking over the experience of the night I was surprised to find how easy and pleasant it had been even in this tempestuous weather The stone which annoyed me would not have been there had I not been forced to camp blindfold in the opaque night and I had felt no other inconvenience except when my feet encountered the lantern or the second volume of Peyrat s Pastors of the Desert among the mixed contents of my sleeping bag nay more I had felt not a touch of cold and awakened with unusually lightsome and clear sensations With that I shook myself got once more into my boots and gaiters and breaking up the rest of the bread for Modestine strolled about to see in what part of the world I had awakened Ulysses left on Ithaca and with a mind unsettled by the goddess was not more pleasantly astray I have been after an adventure all my life a pure dispassionate adventure such as befell early and heroic voyagers and thus to be found by morning in a random woodside nook in Gevaudan not knowing north from south as strange to my surroundings as the first man upon the earth an inland castaway was to find a fraction of my daydreams realized I was on the skirts of a little wood of birch sprinkled with a few beeches behind it adjoined another wood of fir and in front it broke up and went down in open order into a shallow and meadowy dale All around there were bare hill tops some near some far away as the perspective closed or opened but none apparently much higher than the rest The wind huddled the trees The golden specks of autumn in the birches tossed shiveringly Overhead the sky was full of strings and shreds of vapour flying vanishing reappearing and turning about an axis like tumblers as the wind hounded them through heaven It was wild weather and famishing cold I ate some chocolate swallowed a mouthful of brandy and smoked a cigarette before the cold should have time to disable my fingers And by the time I had got all this done and had made my pack and bound it on the pack saddle the day was tiptoe on the threshold of the east We had not gone many steps along the lane before the sun still invisible to me sent a glow of gold over some cloud mountains that lay ranged along the eastern sky The wind had us on the stern and hurried us bitingly forward I buttoned myself into my coat and walked on in a pleasant frame of mind with all men when suddenly at a corner there was Fouzilhic once more in front of me Nor only that but there was the old gentleman who had escorted me so far the night before running out of his house at sight of me with hands upraised in horror My poor boy he cried what does this mean I told him what had happened He beat his old hands like clappers in a mill to think how lightly he had let me go but when he heard of the man of Fouzilhac anger and depression seized upon his mind This time at least said he there shall be no mistake And he limped along for he was very rheumatic for about half a mile and until I was almost within sight of Cheylard the destination I had hunted for so long CHEYLARD AND LUC Candidly it seemed little worthy of all this searching A few broken ends of village with no particular street but a succession of open places heaped with logs and fagots a couple of tilted crosses a shrine to Our Lady of all Graces on the summit of a little hill and all this upon a rattling highland river in the corner of a naked valley What went ye out for to see thought I to myself But the place had a life of its own I found a board commemorating the liberalities of Cheylard for the past year hung up like a banner in the diminutive and tottering church In eighteen seventy seven it appeared the inhabitants subscribed forty eight francs ten centimes for the Work of the Propagation of the Faith Some of this I could not help hoping would be applied to my native land Cheylard scrapes together halfpence for the darkened souls in Edinburgh while Balquhidder and Dunrossness bemoan the ignorance of Rome Thus to the high entertainment of the angels do we pelt each other with evangelists like schoolboys bickering in the snow The inn was again singularly unpretentious The whole furniture of a not ill to do family was in the kitchen the beds the cradle the clothes the plate rack the meal chest and the photograph of the parish priest There were five children one of whom was set to its morning prayers at the stair foot soon after my arrival and a sixth would ere long be forthcoming I was kindly received by these good folk They were much interested in my misadventure The wood in which I had slept belonged to them the man of Fouzilhac they thought a monster of iniquity and counseled me warmly to summon him at law because I might have died The good wife was horror stricken to see me drink over a pint of uncreamed milk You will do yourself an evil she said Permit me to boil it for you After I had begun the morning on this delightful liquor she having an infinity of things to arrange I was permitted nay requested to make a bowl of chocolate for myself My boots and gaiters were hung up to dry and seeing me trying to write my journal on my knee the eldest daughter let down a hinged table in the chimney corner for my convenience Here I wrote drank my chocolate and finally ate an omelette before I left The table was thick with dust for as they explained it was not used except in winter weather I had a clear look up the vent through brown agglomerations of soot and blue vapour to the sky and whenever a handful of twigs was thrown on to the fire my legs were scorched by the blaze The husband had begun life as a muleteer and when I came to charge Modestine showed himself full of the prudence of his art You will have to change this package said he it ought to be in two parts and then you might have double the weight I explained that I wanted no more weight and for no donkey hitherto created would I cut my sleeping bag in two It fatigues her however said the innkeeper it fatigues her greatly on the march Look Alas there were her two forelegs no better than raw beef on the inside and blood was running from under her tail They told me when I started and I was ready to believe it that before a few days I should come to love Modestine like a dog Three days had passed we had shared some misadventures and my heart was still as cold as a potato towards my beast of burden She was pretty enough to look at but then she had given proof of dead stupidity redeemed indeed by patience but aggravated by flashes of sorry and ill judged light heartedness And I own this new discovery seemed another point against her What the devil was the good of a she ass if she could not carry a sleeping bag and a few necessaries I saw the end of the fable rapidly approaching when I should have to carry Modestine AEsop was the man to know the world I assure you I set out with heavy thoughts upon my short day s march It was not only heavy thoughts about Modestine that weighted me upon the way it was a leaden business altogether For first the wind blew so rudely that I had to hold on the pack with one hand from Cheylard to Luc and second my road lay through one of the most beggarly countries in the world It was like the worst of the Scottish Highlands only worse cold naked and ignoble scant of wood scant of heather scant of life A road and some fences broke the unvarying waste and the line of the road was marked by upright pillars to serve in time of snow Why any one should desire to visit either Luc or Cheylard is more than my much inventing spirit can suppose For my part I travel not to go anywhere but to go I travel for travel s sake The great affair is to move to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly to come down off this feather bed of civilization and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints Alas as we get up in life and are more preoccupied with our affairs even a holiday is a thing that must be worked for To hold a pack upon a pack saddle against a gale out of the freezing north is no high industry but it is one that serves to occupy and compose the mind And when the present is so exacting who can annoy himself about the future I came out at length above the Allier A more unsightly prospect at this season of the year it would be hard to fancy Shelving hills rose round it on all sides here dabbled with wood and fields there rising to peaks alternately naked and hairy with pines The colour throughout was black or ashen and came to a point in the ruins of the castle of Luc which pricked up impudently from below my feet carrying on a pinnacle a tall white statue of Our Lady which I heard with interest weighed fifty quintals and was to be dedicated on the sixth of October Through this sorry landscape trickled the Allier and a tributary of nearly equal size which came down to join it through a broad nude valley in Vivarais The weather had somewhat lightened and the clouds massed in squadron but the fierce wind still hunted them through heaven and cast great ungainly splashes of shadow and sunlight over the scene Luc itself was a straggling double file of houses wedged between hill and river It had no beauty nor was there any notable feature save the old castle overhead with its fifty quintals of brand new Madonna But the inn was clean and large The kitchen with its two box beds hung with clean check curtains with its wide stone chimney its chimney shelf four yards long and garnished with lanterns and religious statuettes its array of chests and pair of ticking clocks was the very model of what a kitchen ought to be a melodrama kitchen suitable for bandits or noblemen in disguise Nor was the scene disgraced by the landlady a handsome silent dark old woman clothed and hooded in black like a nun Even the public bedroom had a character of its own with the long deal tables and benches where fifty might have dined set out as for a harvest home and the three box beds along the wall In one of these lying on straw and covered with a pair of table napkins did I do penance all night long in goose flesh and chattering teeth and sigh from time to time as I awakened for my sheepskin sack and the lee of some great wood OUR LADY OF THE SNOWS I behold The House the Brotherhood austere And what am I that I am here MATTHEW ARNOLD FATHER APOLLONARIS Next morning Thursday twenty sixth September I took the road in a new order The sack was no longer doubled but hung at full length across the saddle a green sausage six feet long with a tuft of blue wool hanging out of either end It was more picturesque it spared the donkey and as I began to see it would ensure stability blow high blow low But it was not without a pang that I had so decided For although I had purchased a new cord and made all as fast as I was able I was yet jealously uneasy lest the flaps should tumble out and scatter my effects along the line of march My way lay up the bald valley of the river along the march of Vivarais and Gevaudan The hills of Gevaudan on the right were a little more naked if anything than those of Vivarais upon the left and the former had a monopoly of a low dotty underwood that grew thickly in the gorges and died out in solitary burrs upon the shoulders and the summits Black bricks of fir wood were plastered here and there upon both sides and here and there were cultivated fields A railway ran beside the river the only bit of railway in Gevaudan although there are many proposals afoot and surveys being made and even as they tell me a station standing ready built in Mende A year or two hence and this may be another world The desert is beleaguered Now may some Languedocian Wordsworth turn the sonnet into patois Mountains and vales and floods heard YE that whistle At a place called La Bastide I was directed to leave the river and follow a road that mounted on the left among the hills of Vivarais the modern Ardeche for I was now come within a little way of my strange destination the Trappist monastery of Our Lady of the Snows The sun came out as I left the shelter of a pine wood and I beheld suddenly a fine wild landscape to the south High rocky hills as blue as sapphire closed the view and between these lay ridge upon ridge heathery craggy the sun glittering on veins of rock the underwood clambering in the hollows as rude as God made them at the first There was not a sign of man s hand in all the prospect and indeed not a trace of his passage save where generation after generation had walked in twisted footpaths in and out among the beeches and up and down upon the channeled slopes The mists which had hitherto beset me were now broken into clouds and fled swiftly and shone brightly in the sun I drew a long breath It was grateful to come after so long upon a scene of some attraction for the human heart I own I like definite form in what my eyes are to rest upon and if landscapes were sold like the sheets of characters of my boyhood one penny plain and twopence coloured I should go the length of twopence every day of my life But if things had grown better to the south it was still desolate and inclement near at hand A spidery cross on every hill top marked the neighbourhood of a religious house and a quarter of a mile beyond the outlook southward opening out and growing bolder with every step a white statue of the Virgin at the corner of a young plantation directed the traveller to Our Lady of the Snows Here then I struck leftward and pursued my way driving my secular donkey before me and creaking in my secular boots and gaiters towards the asylum of silence I had not gone very far ere the wind brought to me the clanging of a bell and somehow I can scarce tell why my heart sank within me at the sound I have rarely approached anything with more unaffected terror than the monastery of Our Lady of the Snows This it is to have had a Protestant education And suddenly on turning a corner fear took hold on me from head to foot slavish superstitious fear and though I did not stop in my advance yet I went on slowly like a man who should have passed a bourne unnoticed and strayed into the country of the dead For there upon the narrow new made road between the stripling pines was a mediaeval friar fighting with a barrowful of turfs Every Sunday of my childhood I used to study the Hermits of Marco Sadeler enchanting prints full of wood and field and mediaeval landscapes as large as a county for the imagination to go a travelling in and here sure enough was one of Marco Sadeler s heroes He was robed in white like any spectre and the hood falling back in the instancy of his contention with the barrow disclosed a pate as bald and yellow as a skull He might have been buried any time these thousand years and all the lively parts of him resolved into earth and broken up with the farmer s harrow I was troubled besides in my mind as to etiquette Durst I address a person who was under a vow of silence Clearly not But drawing near I doffed my cap to him with a far away superstitious reverence He nodded back and cheerfully addressed me Was I going to the monastery Who was I An Englishman Ah an Irishman then No I said a Scotsman A Scotsman Ah he had never seen a Scotsman before And he looked me all over his good honest brawny countenance shining with interest as a boy might look upon a lion or an alligator From him I learned with disgust that I could not be received at Our Lady of the Snows I might get a meal perhaps but that was all And then as our talk ran on and it turned out that I was not a pedlar but a literary man who drew landscapes and was going to write a book he changed his manner of thinking as to my reception for I fear they respect persons even in a Trappist monastery and told me I must be sure to ask for the Father Prior and state my case to him in full On second thoughts he determined to go down with me himself he thought he could manage for me better Might he say that I was a geographer No I thought in the interests of truth he positively might not Very well then with disappointment an author It appeared he had been in a seminary with six young Irishmen all priests long since who had received newspapers and kept him informed of the state of ecclesiastical affairs in England And he asked me eagerly after doctor Pusey for whose conversion the good man had continued ever since to pray night and morning I thought he was very near the truth he said and he will reach it yet there is so much virtue in prayer He must be a stiff ungodly Protestant who can take anything but pleasure in this kind and hopeful story While he was thus near the subject the good father asked me if I were a Christian and when he found I was not or not after his way he glossed it over with great good will The road which we were following and which this stalwart father had made with his own two hands within the space of a year came to a corner and showed us some white buildings a little farther on beyond the wood At the same time the bell once more sounded abroad We were hard upon the monastery Father Apollinaris for that was my companion s name stopped me I must not speak to you down there he said Ask for the Brother Porter and all will be well But try to see me as you go out again through the wood where I may speak to you I am charmed to have made your acquaintance And then suddenly raising his arms flapping his fingers and crying out twice I must not speak I must not speak he ran away in front of me and disappeared into the monastery door I own this somewhat ghastly eccentricity went a good way to revive my terrors But where one was so good and simple why should not all be alike I took heart of grace and went forward to the gate as fast as Modestine who seemed to have a disaffection for monasteries would permit It was the first door in my acquaintance of her which she had not shown an indecent haste to enter I summoned the place in form though with a quaking heart Father Michael the Father Hospitaller and a pair of brown robed brothers came to the gate and spoke with me a while I think my sack was the great attraction it had already beguiled the heart of poor Apollinaris who had charged me on my life to show it to the Father Prior But whether it was my address or the sack or the idea speedily published among that part of the brotherhood who attend on strangers that I was not a pedlar after all I found no difficulty as to my reception Modestine was led away by a layman to the stables and I and my pack were received into Our Lady of the Snows THE MONKS Father Michael a pleasant fresh faced smiling man perhaps of thirty five took me to the pantry and gave me a glass of liqueur to stay me until dinner We had some talk or rather I should say he listened to my prattle indulgently enough but with an abstracted air like a spirit with a thing of clay And truly when I remember that I descanted principally on my appetite and that it must have been by that time more than eighteen hours since Father Michael had so much as broken bread I can well understand that he would find an earthly savour in my conversation But his manner though superior was exquisitely gracious and I find I have a lurking curiosity as to Father Michael s past The whet administered I was left alone for a little in the monastery garden This is no more than the main court laid out in sandy paths and beds of parti coloured dahlias and with a fountain and a black statue of the Virgin in the centre The buildings stand around it four square bleak as yet unseasoned by the years and weather and with no other features than a belfry and a pair of slated gables Brothers in white brothers in brown passed silently along the sanded alleys and when I first came out three hooded monks were kneeling on the terrace at their prayers A naked hill commands the monastery upon one side and the wood commands it on the other It lies exposed to wind the snow falls off and on from October to May and sometimes lies six weeks on end but if they stood in Eden with a climate like heaven s the buildings themselves would offer the same wintry and cheerless aspect and for my part on this wild September day before I was called to dinner I felt chilly in and out When I had eaten well and heartily Brother Ambrose a hearty conversible Frenchman for all those who wait on strangers have the liberty to speak led me to a little room in that part of the building which is set apart for MM les retraitants It was clean and whitewashed and furnished with strict necessaries a crucifix a bust of the late Pope the Imitation in French a book of religious meditations and the Life of Elizabeth Seton evangelist it would appear of North America and of New England in particular As far as my experience goes there is a fair field for some more evangelisation in these quarters but think of Cotton Mather I should like to give him a reading of this little work in heaven where I hope he dwells but perhaps he knows all that already and much more and perhaps he and missus Seton are the dearest friends and gladly unite their voices in the everlasting psalm Over the table to conclude the inventory of the room hung a set of regulations for MM les retraitants what services they should attend when they were to tell their beads or meditate and when they were to rise and go to rest At the foot was a notable N B Le temps libre est employe a l examen de conscience a la confession a faire de bonnes resolutions et cetera To make good resolutions indeed You might talk as fruitfully of making the hair grow on your head I had scarce explored my niche when Brother Ambrose returned An English boarder it appeared would like to speak with me I professed my willingness and the friar ushered in a fresh young little Irishman of fifty a deacon of the Church arrayed in strict canonicals and wearing on his head what in default of knowledge I can only call the ecclesiastical shako He had lived seven years in retreat at a convent of nuns in Belgium and now five at Our Lady of the Snows he never saw an English newspaper he spoke French imperfectly and had he spoken it like a native there was not much chance of conversation where he dwelt With this he was a man eminently sociable greedy of news and simple minded like a child If I was pleased to have a guide about the monastery he was no less delighted to see an English face and hear an English tongue He showed me his own room where he passed his time among breviaries Hebrew Bibles and the Waverley Novels Thence he led me to the cloisters into the chapter house through the vestry where the brothers gowns and broad straw hats were hanging up each with his religious name upon a board names full of legendary suavity and interest such as Basil Hilarion Raphael or Pacifique into the library where were all the works of Veuillot and Chateaubriand and the Odes et Ballades if you please and even Moliere to say nothing of innumerable fathers and a great variety of local and general historians Thence my good Irishman took me round the workshops where brothers bake bread and make cart wheels and take photographs where one superintends a collection of curiosities and another a gallery of rabbits For in a Trappist monastery each monk has an occupation of his own choice apart from his religious duties and the general labours of the house Each must sing in the choir if he has a voice and ear and join in the haymaking if he has a hand to stir but in his private hours although he must be occupied he may be occupied on what he likes Thus I was told that one brother was engaged with literature while Father Apollinaris busies himself in making roads and the Abbot employs himself in binding books It is not so long since this Abbot was consecrated by the way and on that occasion by a special grace his mother was permitted to enter the chapel and witness the ceremony of consecration A proud day for her to have a son a mitred abbot it makes you glad to think they let her in In all these journeyings to and fro many silent fathers and brethren fell in our way Usually they paid no more regard to our passage than if we had been a cloud but sometimes the good deacon had a permission to ask of them and it was granted by a peculiar movement of the hands almost like that of a dog s paws in swimming or refused by the usual negative signs and in either case with lowered eyelids and a certain air of contrition as of a man who was steering very close to evil The monks by special grace of their Abbot were still taking two meals a day but it was already time for their grand fast which begins somewhere in September and lasts till Easter and during which they eat but once in the twenty four hours and that at two in the afternoon twelve hours after they have begun the toil and vigil of the day Their meals are scanty but even of these they eat sparingly and though each is allowed a small carafe of wine many refrain from this indulgence Without doubt the most of mankind grossly over eat themselves our meals serve not only for support but as a hearty and natural diversion from the labour of life Yet though excess may be hurtful I should have thought this Trappist regimen defective And I am astonished as I look back at the freshness of face and cheerfulness of manner of all whom I beheld A happier nor a healthier company I should scarce suppose that I have ever seen As a matter of fact on this bleak upland and with the incessant occupation of the monks life is of an uncertain tenure and death no infrequent visitor at Our Lady of the Snows This at least was what was told me But if they die easily they must live healthily in the meantime for they seemed all firm of flesh and high in colour and the only morbid sign that I could observe an unusual brilliancy of eye was one that served rather to increase the general impression of vivacity and strength Those with whom I spoke were singularly sweet tempered with what I can only call a holy cheerfulness in air and conversation There is a note in the direction to visitors telling them not to be offended at the curt speech of those who wait upon them since it is proper to monks to speak little The note might have been spared to a man the hospitallers were all brimming with innocent talk and in my experience of the monastery it was easier to begin than to break off a conversation With the exception of Father Michael who was a man of the world they showed themselves full of kind and healthy interest in all sorts of subjects in politics in voyages in my sleeping sack and not without a certain pleasure in the sound of their own voices As for those who are restricted to silence I can only wonder how they bear their solemn and cheerless isolation And yet apart from any view of mortification I can see a certain policy not only in the exclusion of women but in this vow of silence I have had some experience of lay phalansteries of an artistic not to say a bacchanalian character and seen more than one association easily formed and yet more easily dispersed With a Cistercian rule perhaps they might have lasted longer In the neighbourhood of women it is but a touch and go association that can be formed among defenceless men the stronger electricity is sure to triumph the dreams of boyhood the schemes of youth are abandoned after an interview of ten minutes and the arts and sciences and professional male jollity deserted at once for two sweet eyes and a caressing accent And next after this the tongue is the great divider I am almost ashamed to pursue this worldly criticism of a religious rule but there is yet another point in which the Trappist order appeals to me as a model of wisdom By two in the morning the clapper goes upon the bell and so on hour by hour and sometimes quarter by quarter till eight the hour of rest so infinitesimally is the day divided among different occupations The man who keeps rabbits for example hurries from his hutches to the chapel the chapter room or the refectory all day long every hour he has an office to sing a duty to perform from two when he rises in the dark till eight when he returns to receive the comfortable gift of sleep he is upon his feet and occupied with manifold and changing business I know many persons worth several thousands in the year who are not so fortunate in the disposal of their lives Into how many houses would not the note of the monastery bell dividing the day into manageable portions bring peace of mind and healthful activity of body We speak of hardships but the true hardship is to be a dull fool and permitted to mismanage life in our own dull and foolish manner From this point of view we may perhaps better understand the monk s existence A long novitiate and every proof of constancy of mind and strength of body is required before admission to the order but I could not find that many were discouraged In the photographer s studio which figures so strangely among the outbuildings my eye was attracted by the portrait of a young fellow in the uniform of a private of foot This was one of the novices who came of the age for service and marched and drilled and mounted guard for the proper time among the garrison of Algiers Here was a man who had surely seen both sides of life before deciding yet as soon as he was set free from service he returned to finish his novitiate This austere rule entitles a man to heaven as by right When the Trappist sickens he quits not his habit he lies in the bed of death as he has prayed and laboured in his frugal and silent existence and when the Liberator comes at the very moment even before they have carried him in his robe to lie his little last in the chapel among continual chantings joy bells break forth as if for a marriage from the slated belfry and proclaim throughout the neighbourhood that another soul has gone to God At night under the conduct of my kind Irishman I took my place in the gallery to hear compline and Salve Regina with which the Cistercians bring every day to a conclusion There were none of those circumstances which strike the Protestant as childish or as tawdry in the public offices of Rome A stern simplicity heightened by the romance of the surroundings spoke directly to the heart I recall the whitewashed chapel the hooded figures in the choir the lights alternately occluded and revealed the strong manly singing the silence that ensued the sight of cowled heads bowed in prayer and then the clear trenchant beating of the bell breaking in to show that the last office was over and the hour of sleep had come and when I remember I am not surprised that I made my escape into the court with somewhat whirling fancies and stood like a man bewildered in the windy starry night But I was weary and when I had quieted my spirits with Elizabeth Seton s memoirs a dull work the cold and the raving of the wind among the pines for my room was on that side of the monastery which adjoins the woods disposed me readily to slumber I was awakened at black midnight as it seemed though it was really two in the morning by the first stroke upon the bell All the brothers were then hurrying to the chapel the dead in life at this untimely hour were already beginning the uncomforted labours of their day The dead in life there was a chill reflection And the words of a French song came back into my memory telling of the best of our mixed existence Que t as de belles filles Girofle Girofla Que t as de belles filles L Amour les comptera And I blessed God that I was free to wander free to hope and free to love THE BOARDERS But there was another side to my residence at Our Lady of the Snows 
6609-111356-0000	train-other-500	At this late season there were not many boarders and yet I was not alone in the public part of the monastery This itself is hard by the gate with a small dining room on the ground floor and a whole corridor of cells similar to mine upstairs
6609-111356-0001	train-other-500	I have stupidly forgotten the board for a regular retraitant but it was somewhere between three and five francs a day and I think most probably the first Chance visitors like myself might give what they chose as a free will offering
6609-111356-0002	train-other-500	but nothing was demanded I may mention that when I was going away Father Michael refused twenty francs as excessive I explained the reasoning which led me to offer him so much but even then from a curious point of honour he would not accept it with his own hand
6609-111356-0003	train-other-500	I have no right to refuse for the monastery he explained but I should prefer if you would give it to one of the brothers I had dined alone because I arrived late but at supper I found two other guests
none	none	 One was a country parish priest who had walked over that morning from the seat of his cure near Mende to enjoy four days of solitude and prayer 
6609-111356-0004	train-other-500	He was a grenadier in person with the hale colour and circular wrinkles of a peasant and as he complained much of how he had been impeded by his skirts upon the march I have a vivid fancy portrait of him striding along upright big boned
none	none	 with kilted cassock through the bleak hills of Gevaudan 
6609-111356-0005	train-other-500	The other was a short grizzling thick set man from forty five to fifty dressed in tweed with a knitted spencer and the red ribbon of a decoration in his button hole This last was a hard person to classify
6609-111356-0006	train-other-500	He was an old soldier who had seen service and risen to the rank of commandant and he retained some of the brisk decisive manners of the camp On the other hand as soon as his resignation was accepted he had come to Our Lady of the Snows as a boarder
6609-111356-0007	train-other-500	and after a brief experience of its ways had decided to remain as a novice Already the new life was beginning to modify his appearance already he had acquired somewhat of the quiet and smiling air of the brethren
6609-111356-0008	train-other-500	and he was as yet neither an officer nor a Trappist but partook of the character of each And certainly here was a man in an interesting nick of life Out of the noise of cannon and trumpets
6609-111356-0009	train-other-500	he was in the act of passing into this still country bordering on the grave where men sleep nightly in their grave clothes and like phantoms communicate by signs At supper we talked politics
6609-111356-0010	train-other-500	I make it my business when I am in France to preach political good will and moderation and to dwell on the example of Poland much as some alarmists in England dwell on the example of Carthage The priest and the commandant assured me of their sympathy with all I said
6609-111356-0011	train-other-500	and made a heavy sighing over the bitterness of contemporary feeling Why you cannot say anything to a man with which he does not absolutely agree said I but he flies up at you in a temper They both declared that such a state of things was antichristian
none	none	 While we were thus agreeing what should my tongue stumble upon but a word in praise of Gambetta s moderation 
6609-111356-0012	train-other-500	The old soldier s countenance was instantly suffused with blood with the palms of his hands he beat the table like a naughty child
none	none	 Comment monsieur he shouted Comment Gambetta moderate 
6609-111356-0013	train-other-500	Will you dare to justify these words But the priest had not forgotten the tenor of our talk And suddenly in the height of his fury the old soldier found a warning look directed on his face
6609-111356-0014	train-other-500	the absurdity of his behaviour was brought home to him in a flash and the storm came to an abrupt end without another word It was only in the morning over our coffee Friday September twenty seventh that this couple found out I was a heretic
6609-111356-0015	train-other-500	I suppose I had misled them by some admiring expressions as to the monastic life around us and it was only by a point blank question that the truth came out I had been tolerantly used both by simple Father Apollinaris
6609-111356-0016	train-other-500	and astute Father Michael and the good Irish deacon when he heard of my religious weakness had only patted me upon the shoulder and said You must be a Catholic and come to heaven
none	none	 But I was now among a different sect of orthodox These two men were bitter and upright and narrow like the worst of Scotsmen and indeed upon my heart I fancy they were worse The priest snorted aloud like a battle horse Et vous pretendez mourir dans cette espece de croyance he demanded and there is no type used by mortal printers large enough to qualify his accent I humbly indicated that I had no design of changing 
6609-111356-0017	train-other-500	But he could not away with such a monstrous attitude No no he cried you must change You have come here God has led you here and you must embrace the opportunity I made a slip in policy
none	none	 I appealed to the family affections though I was speaking to a priest and a soldier 
6609-111356-0018	train-other-500	two classes of men circumstantially divorced from the kind and homely ties of life Your father and mother cried the priest Very well you will convert them in their turn when you go home I think I see my father s face
6609-111356-0019	train-other-500	I would rather tackle the Gaetulian lion in his den than embark on such an enterprise against the family theologian But now the hunt was up priest and soldier were in full cry for my conversion and the Work of the Propagation of the Faith
none	none	 for which the people of Cheylard subscribed forty eight francs ten centimes during eighteen seventy seven 
6609-111356-0020	train-other-500	was being gallantly pursued against myself
none	none	 It was an odd but most effective proselytizing 
6609-111356-0021	train-other-500	They never sought to convince me in argument where I might have attempted some defence but took it for granted that I was both ashamed and terrified at my position and urged me solely on the point of time Now they said when God had led me to Our Lady of the Snows
6609-111356-0022	train-other-500	now was the appointed hour Do not be withheld by false shame observed the priest for my encouragement For one who feels very similarly to all sects of religion and who has never been able even for a moment
6609-111356-0023	train-other-500	to weigh seriously the merit of this or that creed on the eternal side of things however much he may see to praise or blame upon the secular and temporal side the situation thus created was both unfair and painful
6609-111356-0024	train-other-500	I committed my second fault in tact and tried to plead that it was all the same thing in the end and we were all drawing near by different sides to the same kind and undiscriminating Friend and Father
6609-111356-0025	train-other-500	That as it seems to lay spirits would be the only gospel worthy of the name But different men think differently and this revolutionary aspiration brought down the priest with all the terrors of the law
6609-111356-0026	train-other-500	He launched into harrowing details of hell The damned he said on the authority of a little book which he had read not a week before and which to add conviction to conviction he had fully intended to bring along with him in his pocket
6609-111356-0027	train-other-500	were to occupy the same attitude through all eternity in the midst of dismal tortures And as he thus expatiated
none	none	 he grew in nobility of aspect with his enthusiasm As a result the pair concluded that I should seek out the Prior since the Abbot was from home and lay my case immediately before him C est mon conseil comme ancien militaire observed the commandant et celui de monsieur comme pretre Oui added the cure sententiously nodding comme ancien militaire et comme pretre 
6609-111356-0028	train-other-500	At this moment whilst I was somewhat embarrassed how to answer in came one of the monks a little brown fellow as lively as a grig and with an Italian accent who threw himself at once into the contention
none	none	 but in a milder and more persuasive vein as befitted one of these pleasant brethren 
6609-111356-0029	train-other-500	Look at him he said The rule was very hard he would have dearly liked to stay in his own country Italy it was well known how beautiful it was the beautiful Italy but then there were no Trappists in Italy and he had a soul to save
6609-111356-0030	train-other-500	and here he was I am afraid I must be at bottom what a cheerful Indian critic has dubbed me a faddling hedonist for this description of the brother s motives gave me somewhat of a shock
6609-111356-0031	train-other-500	I should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake and not for ulterior purposes and this shows how profoundly I was out of sympathy with these good Trappists even when I was doing my best to sympathize
none	none	 But to the cure 
6609-111356-0032	train-other-500	the argument seemed decisive Hear that he cried And I have seen a marquis here a marquis a marquis he repeated the holy word three times over and other persons high in society and generals
6609-111356-0033	train-other-500	And here at your side is this gentleman who has been so many years in armies decorated an old warrior And here he is ready to dedicate himself to God I was by this time so thoroughly embarrassed
6609-111356-0034	train-other-500	that I pled cold feet and made my escape from the apartment It was a furious windy morning with a sky much cleared and long and potent intervals of sunshine and I wandered until dinner in the wild country towards the east
6609-111356-0035	train-other-500	sorely staggered and beaten upon by the gale but rewarded with some striking views At dinner the Work of the Propagation of the Faith was recommenced and on this occasion still more distastefully to me
6609-111356-0036	train-other-500	The priest asked me many questions as to the contemptible faith of my fathers and received my replies with a kind of ecclesiastical titter Your sect he said once for I think you will admit it would be doing it too much honour to call it a religion
none	none	 As you please monsieur said I La parole est a vous 
6609-111356-0037	train-other-500	At length I grew annoyed beyond endurance and although he was on his own ground and what is more to the purpose an old man and so holding a claim upon my toleration I could not avoid a protest against this uncivil usage
6609-111356-0038	train-other-500	He was sadly discountenanced I assure you he said I have no inclination to laugh in my heart I have no other feeling but interest in your soul And there ended my conversion Honest man
6609-111356-0039	train-other-500	he was no dangerous deceiver but a country parson full of zeal and faith
none	none	 Long may he tread Gevaudan with his kilted skirts 
6609-111356-0040	train-other-500	a man strong to walk and strong to comfort his parishioners in death I daresay he would beat bravely through a snowstorm where his duty called him
none	none	 and it is not always the most faithful believer who makes the cunningest apostle UPPER GEVAUDAN Continued The bed was made the room was fit By punctual eve the stars were lit The air was still the water ran No need there was for maid or man When we put up my ass and I At God s green caravanserai OLD PLAY ACROSS THE GOULET The wind fell during dinner and the sky remained clear so it was under better auspices that I loaded Modestine before the monastery gate My Irish friend accompanied me so far on the way As we came through the wood there was Pere Apollinaire hauling his barrow and he too quitted his labours to go with me for perhaps a hundred yards holding my hand between both of his in front of him I parted first from one and then from the other with unfeigned regret but yet with the glee of the traveller who shakes off the dust of one stage before hurrying forth upon another Then Modestine and I mounted the course of the Allier which here led us back into Gevaudan towards its sources in the forest of Mercoire It was but an inconsiderable burn before we left its guidance Thence over a hill our way lay through a naked plateau until we reached Chasserades at sundown The company in the inn kitchen that night were all men employed in survey for one of the projected railways They were intelligent and conversible and we decided the future of France over hot wine until the state of the clock frightened us to rest There were four beds in the little upstairs room and we slept six But I had a bed to myself and persuaded them to leave the window open He bourgeois il est cinq heures was the cry that wakened me in the morning Saturday September twenty eighth The room was full of a transparent darkness which dimly showed me the other three beds and the five different nightcaps on the pillows But out of the window the dawn was growing ruddy in a long belt over the hill tops and day was about to flood the plateau The hour was inspiriting and there seemed a promise of calm weather which was perfectly fulfilled I was soon under way with Modestine The road lay for a while over the plateau and then descended through a precipitous village into the valley of the Chassezac This stream ran among green meadows well hidden from the world by its steep banks the broom was in flower and here and there was a hamlet sending up its smoke At last the path crossed the Chassezac upon a bridge and forsaking this deep hollow set itself to cross the mountain of La Goulet It wound up through Lestampes by upland fields and woods of beech and birch and with every corner brought me into an acquaintance with some new interest Even in the gully of the Chassezac my ear had been struck by a noise like that of a great bass bell ringing at the distance of many miles but this as I continued to mount and draw nearer to it seemed to change in character and I found at length that it came from some one leading flocks afield to the note of a rural horn The narrow street of Lestampes stood full of sheep from wall to wall black sheep and white bleating with one accord like the birds in spring and each one accompanying himself upon the sheep bell round his neck It made a pathetic concert all in treble A little higher and I passed a pair of men in a tree with pruning hooks and one of them was singing the music of a bourree Still further and when I was already threading the birches the crowing of cocks came cheerfully up to my ears and along with that the voice of a flute discoursing a deliberate and plaintive air from one of the upland villages I pictured to myself some grizzled apple cheeked country schoolmaster fluting in his bit of a garden in the clear autumn sunshine All these beautiful and interesting sounds filled my heart with an unwonted expectation and it appeared to me that once past this range which I was mounting I should descend into the garden of the world Nor was I deceived for I was now done with rains and winds and a bleak country The first part of my journey ended here and this was like an induction of sweet sounds into the other and more beautiful There are other degrees of feyness as of punishment besides the capital and I was now led by my good spirits into an adventure which I relate in the interest of future donkey drivers The road zigzagged so widely on the hillside that I chose a short cut by map and compass and struck through the dwarf woods to catch the road again upon a higher level It was my one serious conflict with Modestine She would none of my short cut she turned in my face she backed she reared she whom I had hitherto imagined to be dumb actually brayed with a loud hoarse flourish like a cock crowing for the dawn I plied the goad with one hand with the other so steep was the ascent I had to hold on the pack saddle Half a dozen times she was nearly over backwards on the top of me half a dozen times from sheer weariness of spirit I was nearly giving it up and leading her down again to follow the road But I took the thing as a wager and fought it through I was surprised as I went on my way again by what appeared to be chill rain drops falling on my hand and more than once looked up in wonder at the cloudless sky But it was only sweat which came dropping from my brow Over the summit of the Goulet there was no marked road only upright stones posted from space to space to guide the drovers The turf underfoot was springy and well scented I had no company but a lark or two and met but one bullock cart between Lestampes and Bleymard In front of me I saw a shallow valley and beyond that the range of the Lozere sparsely wooded and well enough modeled in the flanks but straight and dull in outline There was scarce a sign of culture only about Bleymard the white high road from Villefort to Mende traversed a range of meadows set with spiry poplars and sounding from side to side with the bells of flocks and herds A NIGHT AMONG THE PINES From Bleymard after dinner although it was already late I set out to scale a portion of the Lozere An ill marked stony drove road guided me forward and I met nearly half a dozen bullock carts descending from the woods each laden with a whole pine tree for the winter s firing At the top of the woods which do not climb very high upon this cold ridge I struck leftward by a path among the pines until I hit on a dell of green turf where a streamlet made a little spout over some stones to serve me for a water tap In a more sacred or sequestered bower nor nymph nor faunus haunted The trees were not old but they grew thickly round the glade there was no outlook except north eastward upon distant hill tops or straight upward to the sky and the encampment felt secure and private like a room By the time I had made my arrangements and fed Modestine the day was already beginning to decline I buckled myself to the knees into my sack and made a hearty meal and as soon as the sun went down I pulled my cap over my eyes and fell asleep Night is a dead monotonous period under a roof but in the open world it passes lightly with its stars and dews and perfumes and the hours are marked by changes in the face of Nature What seems a kind of temporal death to people choked between walls and curtains is only a light and living slumber to the man who sleeps afield All night long he can hear Nature breathing deeply and freely even as she takes her rest she turns and smiles and there is one stirring hour unknown to those who dwell in houses when a wakeful influence goes abroad over the sleeping hemisphere and all the outdoor world are on their feet It is then that the cock first crows not this time to announce the dawn but like a cheerful watchman speeding the course of night Cattle awake on the meadows sheep break their fast on dewy hillsides and change to a new lair among the ferns and houseless men who have lain down with the fowls open their dim eyes and behold the beauty of the night At what inaudible summons at what gentle touch of Nature are all these sleepers thus recalled in the same hour to life Do the stars rain down an influence or do we share some thrill of mother earth below our resting bodies Even shepherds and old country folk who are the deepest read in these arcana have not a guess as to the means or purpose of this nightly resurrection Towards two in the morning they declare the thing takes place and neither know nor inquire further And at least it is a pleasant incident We are disturbed in our slumber only like the luxurious Montaigne that we may the better and more sensibly relish it We have a moment to look up on the stars And there is a special pleasure for some minds in the reflection that we share the impulse with all outdoor creatures in our neighbourhood that we have escaped out of the Bastille of civilization and are become for the time being a mere kindly animal and a sheep of Nature s flock When that hour came to me among the pines I wakened thirsty My tin was standing by me half full of water I emptied it at a draught and feeling broad awake after this internal cold aspersion sat upright to make a cigarette The stars were clear coloured and jewel like but not frosty A faint silvery vapour stood for the Milky Way All around me the black fir points stood upright and stock still By the whiteness of the pack saddle I could see Modestine walking round and round at the length of her tether I could hear her steadily munching at the sward but there was not another sound save the indescribable quiet talk of the runnel over the stones I lay lazily smoking and studying the colour of the sky as we call the void of space from where it showed a reddish grey behind the pines to where it showed a glossy blue black between the stars As if to be more like a pedlar I wear a silver ring This I could see faintly shining as I raised or lowered the cigarette and at each whiff the inside of my hand was illuminated and became for a second the highest light in the landscape A faint wind more like a moving coolness than a stream of air passed down the glade from time to time so that even in my great chamber the air was being renewed all night long I thought with horror of the inn at Chasserades and the congregated nightcaps with horror of the nocturnal prowesses of clerks and students of hot theatres and pass keys and close rooms I have not often enjoyed a more serene possession of myself nor felt more independent of material aids The outer world from which we cower into our houses seemed after all a gentle habitable place and night after night a man s bed it seemed was laid and waiting for him in the fields where God keeps an open house I thought I had rediscovered one of those truths which are revealed to savages and hid from political economists at the least I had discovered a new pleasure for myself And yet even while I was exulting in my solitude I became aware of a strange lack I wished a companion to lie near me in the starlight silent and not moving but ever within touch For there is a fellowship more quiet even than solitude and which rightly understood is solitude made perfect And to live out of doors with the woman a man loves is of all lives the most complete and free As I thus lay between content and longing a faint noise stole towards me through the pines I thought at first it was the crowing of cocks or the barking of dogs at some very distant farm but steadily and gradually it took articulate shape in my ears until I became aware that a passenger was going by upon the high road in the valley and singing loudly as he went There was more of good will than grace in his performance but he trolled with ample lungs and the sound of his voice took hold upon the hillside and set the air shaking in the leafy glens I have heard people passing by night in sleeping cities some of them sang one I remember played loudly on the bagpipes I have heard the rattle of a cart or carriage spring up suddenly after hours of stillness and pass for some minutes within the range of my hearing as I lay abed There is a romance about all who are abroad in the black hours and with something of a thrill we try to guess their business But here the romance was double first this glad passenger lit internally with wine who sent up his voice in music through the night and then I on the other hand buckled into my sack and smoking alone in the pine woods between four and five thousand feet towards the stars When I awoke again Sunday twenty ninth September many of the stars had disappeared only the stronger companions of the night still burned visibly overhead and away towards the east I saw a faint haze of light upon the horizon such as had been the Milky Way when I was last awake Day was at hand I lit my lantern and by its glow worm light put on my boots and gaiters then I broke up some bread for Modestine filled my can at the water tap and lit my spirit lamp to boil myself some chocolate The blue darkness lay long in the glade where I had so sweetly slumbered but soon there was a broad streak of orange melting into gold along the mountain tops of Vivarais A solemn glee possessed my mind at this gradual and lovely coming in of day I heard the runnel with delight I looked round me for something beautiful and unexpected but the still black pine trees the hollow glade the munching ass remained unchanged in figure Nothing had altered but the light and that indeed shed over all a spirit of life and of breathing peace and moved me to a strange exhilaration I drank my water chocolate which was hot if it was not rich and strolled here and there and up and down about the glade While I was thus delaying a gush of steady wind as long as a heavy sigh poured direct out of the quarter of the morning It was cold and set me sneezing The trees near at hand tossed their black plumes in its passage and I could see the thin distant spires of pine along the edge of the hill rock slightly to and fro against the golden east Ten minutes later the sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside scattering shadows and sparkles and the day had come completely I hastened to prepare my pack and tackle the steep ascent that lay before me but I had something on my mind It was only a fancy yet a fancy will sometimes be importunate I had been most hospitably received and punctually served in my green caravanserai The room was airy the water excellent and the dawn had called me to a moment I say nothing of the tapestries or the inimitable ceiling nor yet of the view which I commanded from the windows but I felt I was in some one s debt for all this liberal entertainment And so it pleased me in a half laughing way to leave pieces of money on the turf as I went along until I had left enough for my night s lodging I trust they did not fall to some rich and churlish drover THE COUNTRY OF THE CAMISARDS

6609-111359-0029	train-other-500	a sort of track appeared and began to go down a break neck slope turning like a corkscrew as it went It led into a valley between falling hills stubbly with rocks like a reaped field of corn and floored farther down with green meadows
6609-111359-0030	train-other-500	I followed the track with precipitation the steepness of the slope the continual agile turning of the line of the descent and the old unwearied hope of finding something new in a new country all conspired to lend me wings
6609-111359-0031	train-other-500	Yet a little lower and a stream began collecting itself together out of many fountains and soon making a glad noise among the hills Sometimes it would cross the track in a bit of waterfall with a pool in which Modestine refreshed her feet
6609-111359-0032	train-other-500	The whole descent is like a dream to me so rapidly was it accomplished I had scarcely left the summit ere the valley had closed round my path and the sun beat upon me walking in a stagnant lowland atmosphere
6609-111359-0033	train-other-500	The track became a road and went up and down in easy undulations I passed cabin after cabin but all seemed deserted and I saw not a human creature nor heard any sound except that of the stream
6609-111359-0034	train-other-500	I was however in a different country from the day before The stony skeleton of the world was here vigorously displayed to sun and air The slopes were steep and changeful Oak trees clung along the hills
6609-111359-0035	train-other-500	well grown wealthy in leaf and touched by the autumn with strong and luminous colours Here and there another stream would fall in from the right or the left down a gorge of snow white and tumultuary boulders

6609-111359-0039	train-other-500	and I heard in spirit the church bells clamouring all over Europe and the psalms of a thousand churches At length a human sound struck upon my ear a cry strangely modulated between pathos and derision
6609-111359-0040	train-other-500	and looking across the valley I saw a little urchin sitting in a meadow with his hands about his knees and dwarfed to almost comical smallness by the distance But the rogue had picked me out as I went down the road

6609-111359-0042	train-other-500	coming through so much clean hill air and crossing all the green valley sounded pleasant to my ear and seemed a thing rustic like the oaks or the river A little after the stream that I was following fell into the Tarn
none	none	 at Pont de Montvert of bloody memory PONT DE MONTVERT One of the first things I encountered in Pont de Montvert was if I remember rightly the Protestant temple but this was but the type of other novelties A subtle atmosphere distinguishes a town in England from a town in France or even in Scotland At Carlisle you can see you are in the one country at Dumfries thirty miles away you are as sure that you are in the other I should find it difficult to tell in what particulars Pont de Montvert differed from Monastier or Langogne or even Bleymard but the difference existed and spoke eloquently to the eyes The place with its houses its lanes its glaring riverbed wore an indescribable air of the South All was Sunday bustle in the streets and in the public houses as all had been Sabbath peace among the mountains There must have been near a score of us at dinner by eleven before noon and after I had eaten and drunken and sat writing up my journal I suppose as many more came dropping in one after another or by twos and threes In crossing the Lozere I had not only come among new natural features but moved into the territory of a different race These people as they hurriedly despatched their viands in an intricate sword play of knives questioned and answered me with a degree of intelligence which excelled all that I had met except among the railway folk at Chasserades They had open telling faces and were lively both in speech and manner They not only entered thoroughly into the spirit of my little trip but more than one declared if he were rich enough he would like to set forth on such another Even physically there was a pleasant change I had not seen a pretty woman since I left Monastier and there but one Now of the three who sat down with me to dinner one was certainly not beautiful a poor timid thing of forty quite troubled at this roaring table d hote whom I squired and helped to wine and pledged and tried generally to encourage with quite a contrary effect but the other two both married were both more handsome than the average of women And Clarisse What shall I say of Clarisse She waited the table with a heavy placable nonchalance like a performing cow her great grey eyes were steeped in amorous languor her features although fleshy were of an original and accurate design her mouth had a curl her nostril spoke of dainty pride her cheek fell into strange and interesting lines It was a face capable of strong emotion and with training it offered the promise of delicate sentiment It seemed pitiful to see so good a model left to country admirers and a country way of thought Beauty should at least have touched society then in a moment it throws off a weight that lay upon it it becomes conscious of itself it puts on an elegance learns a gait and a carriage of the head and in a moment patet dea Before I left I assured Clarisse of my hearty admiration She took it like milk without embarrassment or wonder merely looking at me steadily with her great eyes and I own the result upon myself was some confusion If Clarisse could read English I should not dare to add that her figure was unworthy of her face Hers was a case for stays but that may perhaps grow better as she gets up in years Pont de Montvert or Greenhill Bridge as we might say at home is a place memorable in the story of the Camisards It was here that the war broke out here that those southern Covenanters slew their Archbishop Sharpe The persecution on the one hand the febrile enthusiasm on the other are almost equally difficult to understand in these quiet modern days and with our easy modern beliefs and disbeliefs The Protestants were one and all beside their right minds with zeal and sorrow They were all prophets and prophetesses Children at the breast would exhort their parents to good works A child of fifteen months at Quissac spoke from its mother s arms agitated and sobbing distinctly and with a loud voice Marshal Villars has seen a town where all the women seemed possessed by the devil and had trembling fits and uttered prophecies publicly upon the streets A prophetess of Vivarais was hanged at Montpellier because blood flowed from her eyes and nose and she declared that she was weeping tears of blood for the misfortunes of the Protestants And it was not only women and children Stalwart dangerous fellows used to swing the sickle or to wield the forest axe were likewise shaken with strange paroxysms and spoke oracles with sobs and streaming tears A persecution unsurpassed in violence had lasted near a score of years and this was the result upon the persecuted hanging burning breaking on the wheel had been in vain the dragoons had left their hoofmarks over all the countryside there were men rowing in the galleys and women pining in the prisons of the Church and not a thought was changed in the heart of any upright Protestant Now the head and forefront of the persecution after Lamoignon de Bavile Francois de Langlade du Chayla pronounce Cheila Archpriest of the Cevennes and Inspector of Missions in the same country had a house in which he sometimes dwelt in the town of Pont de Montvert He was a conscientious person who seems to have been intended by nature for a pirate and now fifty five an age by which a man has learned all the moderation of which he is capable A missionary in his youth in China he there suffered martyrdom was left for dead and only succoured and brought back to life by the charity of a pariah We must suppose the pariah devoid of second sight and not purposely malicious in this act Such an experience it might be thought would have cured a man of the desire to persecute but the human spirit is a thing strangely put together and having been a Christian martyr Du Chayla became a Christian persecutor The Work of the Propagation of the Faith went roundly forward in his hands His house in Pont de Montvert served him as a prison There he closed the hands of his prisoners upon live coal and plucked out the hairs of their beards to convince them that they were deceived in their opinions And yet had not he himself tried and proved the inefficacy of these carnal arguments among the Buddhists in China Not only was life made intolerable in Languedoc but flight was rigidly forbidden One Massip a muleteer and well acquainted with the mountain paths had already guided several troops of fugitives in safety to Geneva and on him with another convoy consisting mostly of women dressed as men Du Chayla in an evil hour for himself laid his hands The Sunday following there was a conventicle of Protestants in the woods of Altefage upon Mount Bouges where there stood up one Seguier Spirit Seguier as his companions called him a wool carder tall black faced and toothless but a man full of prophecy He declared in the name of God that the time for submission had gone by and they must betake themselves to arms for the deliverance of their brethren and the destruction of the priests The next night twenty fourth July seventeen oh two a sound disturbed the Inspector of Missions as he sat in his prison house at Pont de Montvert the voices of many men upraised in psalmody drew nearer and nearer through the town It was ten at night he had his court about him priests soldiers and servants to the number of twelve or fifteen and now dreading the insolence of a conventicle below his very windows he ordered forth his soldiers to report But the psalm singers were already at his door fifty strong led by the inspired Seguier and breathing death To their summons the archpriest made answer like a stout old persecutor and bade his garrison fire upon the mob One Camisard for according to some it was in this night s work that they came by the name fell at this discharge his comrades burst in the door with hatchets and a beam of wood overran the lower story of the house set free the prisoners and finding one of them in the vine a sort of Scavenger s Daughter of the place and period redoubled in fury against Du Chayla and sought by repeated assaults to carry the upper floors But he on his side had given absolution to his men and they bravely held the staircase Children of God cried the prophet hold your hands Let us burn the house with the priest and the satellites of Baal The fire caught readily Out of an upper window Du Chayla and his men lowered themselves into the garden by means of knotted sheets some escaped across the river under the bullets of the insurgents but the archpriest himself fell broke his thigh and could only crawl into the hedge What were his reflections as this second martyrdom drew near A poor brave besotted hateful man who had done his duty resolutely according to his light both in the Cevennes and China He found at least one telling word to say in his defence for when the roof fell in and the upbursting flames discovered his retreat and they came and dragged him to the public place of the town raging and calling him damned If I be damned said he why should you also damn yourselves Here was a good reason for the last but in the course of his inspectorship he had given many stronger which all told in a contrary direction and these he was now to hear One by one Seguier first the Camisards drew near and stabbed him This they said is for my father broken on the wheel This for my brother in the galleys That for my mother or my sister imprisoned in your cursed convents Each gave his blow and his reason and then all kneeled and sang psalms around the body till the dawn With the dawn still singing they defiled away towards Frugeres farther up the Tarn to pursue the work of vengeance leaving Du Chayla s prison house in ruins and his body pierced with two and fifty wounds upon the public place Tis a wild night s work with its accompaniment of psalms and it seems as if a psalm must always have a sound of threatening in that town upon the Tarn But the story does not end even so far as concerns Pont de Montvert with the departure of the Camisards The career of Seguier was brief and bloody Two more priests and a whole family at Ladeveze from the father to the servants fell by his hand or by his orders and yet he was but a day or two at large and restrained all the time by the presence of the soldiery Taken at length by a famous soldier of fortune Captain Poul he appeared unmoved before his judges Your name they asked Pierre Seguier Why are you called Spirit Because the Spirit of the Lord is with me Your domicile Lately in the desert and soon in heaven Have you no remorse for your crimes I have committed none My soul is like a garden full of shelter and of fountains At Pont de Montvert on the twelfth of August he had his right hand stricken from his body and was burned alive And his soul was like a garden So perhaps was the soul of Du Chayla the Christian martyr And perhaps if you could read in my soul or I could read in yours our own composure might seem little less surprising Du Chayla s house still stands with a new roof beside one of the bridges of the town and if you are curious you may see the terrace garden into which he dropped IN THE VALLEY OF THE TARN A new road leads from Pont de Montvert to Florac by the valley of the Tarn a smooth sandy ledge it runs about half way between the summit of the cliffs and the river in the bottom of the valley and I went in and out as I followed it from bays of shadow into promontories of afternoon sun This was a pass like that of Killiecrankie a deep turning gully in the hills with the Tarn making a wonderful hoarse uproar far below and craggy summits standing in the sunshine high above A thin fringe of ash trees ran about the hill tops like ivy on a ruin but on the lower slopes and far up every glen the Spanish chestnut trees stood each four square to heaven under its tented foliage Some were planted each on its own terrace no larger than a bed some trusting in their roots found strength to grow and prosper and be straight and large upon the rapid slopes of the valley others where there was a margin to the river stood marshaled in a line and mighty like cedars of Lebanon Yet even where they grew most thickly they were not to be thought of as a wood but as a herd of stalwart individuals and the dome of each tree stood forth separate and large and as it were a little bill from among the domes of its companions They gave forth a faint sweet perfume which pervaded the air of the afternoon autumn had put tints of gold and tarnish in the green and the sun so shone through and kindled the broad foliage that each chestnut was relieved against another not in shadow but in light A humble sketcher here laid down his pencil in despair I wish I could convey a notion of the growth of these noble trees of how they strike out boughs like the oak and trail sprays of drooping foliage like the willow of how they stand on upright fluted columns like the pillars of a church or like the olive from the most shattered hole can put out smooth and youthful shoots and begin a new life upon the ruins of the old Thus they partake of the nature of many different trees and even their prickly top knots seen near at hand against the sky have a certain palm like air that impresses the imagination But their individuality although compounded of so many elements is but the richer and the more original And to look down upon a level filled with these knolls of foliage or to see a clan of old unconquerable chestnuts cluster like herded elephants upon the spur of a mountain is to rise to higher thoughts of the powers that are in Nature Between Modestine s laggard humour and the beauty of the scene we made little progress all that afternoon and at last finding the sun although still far from setting was already beginning to desert the narrow valley of the Tarn I began to cast about for a place to camp in This was not easy to find the terraces were too narrow and the ground where it was unterraced was usually too steep for a man to lie upon I should have slipped all night and awakened towards morning with my feet or my head in the river After perhaps a mile I saw some sixty feet above the road a little plateau large enough to hold my sack and securely parapeted by the trunk of an aged and enormous chestnut Thither with infinite trouble I goaded and kicked the reluctant Modestine and there I hastened to unload her There was only room for myself upon the plateau and I had to go nearly as high again before I found so much as standing room for the ass It was on a heap of rolling stones on an artificial terrace certainly not five feet square in all Here I tied her to a chestnut and having given her corn and bread and made a pile of chestnut leaves of which I found her greedy I descended once more to my own encampment The position was unpleasantly exposed One or two carts went by upon the road and as long as daylight lasted I concealed myself for all the world like a hunted Camisard behind my fortification of vast chestnut trunk for I was passionately afraid of discovery and the visit of jocular persons in the night Moreover I saw that I must be early awake for these chestnut gardens had been the scene of industry no further gone than on the day before The slope was strewn with lopped branches and here and there a great package of leaves was propped against a trunk for even the leaves are serviceable and the peasants use them in winter by way of fodder for their animals I picked a meal in fear and trembling half lying down to hide myself from the road and I daresay I was as much concerned as if I had been a scout from Joani s band above upon the Lozere or from Salomon s across the Tarn in the old times of psalm singing and blood Or indeed perhaps more for the Camisards had a remarkable confidence in God and a tale comes back into my memory of how the Count of Gevaudan riding with a party of dragoons and a notary at his saddlebow to enforce the oath of fidelity in all the country hamlets entered a valley in the woods and found Cavalier and his men at dinner gaily seated on the grass and their hats crowned with box tree garlands while fifteen women washed their linen in the stream Such was a field festival in seventeen oh three at that date Antony Watteau would be painting similar subjects This was a very different camp from that of the night before in the cool and silent pine woods It was warm and even stifling in the valley The shrill song of frogs like the tremolo note of a whistle with a pea in it rang up from the riverside before the sun was down In the growing dusk faint rustlings began to run to and fro among the fallen leaves from time to time a faint chirping or cheeping noise would fall upon my ear and from time to time I thought I could see the movement of something swift and indistinct between the chestnuts A profusion of large ants swarmed upon the ground bats whisked by and mosquitoes droned overhead The long boughs with their bunches of leaves hung against the sky like garlands and those immediately above and around me had somewhat the air of a trellis which should have been wrecked and half overthrown in a gale of wind Sleep for a long time fled my eyelids and just as I was beginning to feel quiet stealing over my limbs and settling densely on my mind a noise at my head startled me broad awake again and I will frankly confess it brought my heart into my mouth It was such a noise as a person would make scratching loudly with a finger nail it came from under the knapsack which served me for a pillow and it was thrice repeated before I had time to sit up and turn about Nothing was to be seen nothing more was to be heard but a few of these mysterious rustlings far and near and the ceaseless accompaniment of the river and the frogs I learned next day that the chestnut gardens are infested by rats rustling chirping and scraping were probably all due to these but the puzzle for the moment was insoluble and I had to compose myself for sleep as best I could in wondering uncertainty about my neighbours I was wakened in the grey of the morning Monday thirtieth September by the sound of footsteps not far off upon the stones and opening my eyes I beheld a peasant going by among the chestnuts by a footpath that I had not hitherto observed He turned his head neither to the right nor to the left and disappeared in a few strides among the foliage Here was an escape But it was plainly more than time to be moving The peasantry were abroad scarce less terrible to me in my nondescript position than the soldiers of Captain Poul to an undaunted Camisard I fed Modestine with what haste I could but as I was returning to my sack I saw a man and a boy come down the hillside in a direction crossing mine They unintelligibly hailed me and I replied with inarticulate but cheerful sounds and hurried forward to get into my gaiters The pair who seemed to be father and son came slowly up to the plateau and stood close beside me for some time in silence The bed was open and I saw with regret my revolver lying patently disclosed on the blue wool At last after they had looked me all over and the silence had grown laughably embarrassing the man demanded in what seemed unfriendly tones You have slept here Yes said I As you see Why he asked My faith I answered lightly I was tired He next inquired where I was going and what I had had for dinner and then without the least transition C est bien he added come along And he and his son without another word turned oil to the next chestnut tree but one which they set to pruning The thing had passed off more simply than I hoped He was a grave respectable man and his unfriendly voice did not imply that he thought he was speaking to a criminal but merely to an inferior I was soon on the road nibbling a cake of chocolate and seriously occupied with a case of conscience Was I to pay for my night s lodging I had slept ill the bed was full of fleas in the shape of ants there was no water in the room the very dawn had neglected to call me in the morning I might have missed a train had there been any in the neighbourhood to catch Clearly I was dissatisfied with my entertainment and I decided I should not pay unless I met a beggar The valley looked even lovelier by morning and soon the road descended to the level of the river Here in a place where many straight and prosperous chestnuts stood together making an aisle upon a swarded terrace I made my morning toilette in the water of the Tarn It was marvelously clear thrillingly cool the soap suds disappeared as if by magic in the swift current and the white boulders gave one a model for cleanliness To wash in one of God s rivers in the open air seems to me a sort of cheerful solemnity or semi pagan act of worship To dabble among dishes in a bedroom may perhaps make clean the body but the imagination takes no share in such a cleansing I went on with a light and peaceful heart and sang psalms to the spiritual ear as I advanced Suddenly up came an old woman who point blank demanded alms Good thought I here comes the waiter with the bill And I paid for my night s lodging on the spot Take it how you please but this was the first and the last beggar that I met with during all my tour A step or two farther I was overtaken by an old man in a brown nightcap clear eyed weather beaten with a faint excited smile A little girl followed him driving two sheep and a goat but she kept in our wake while the old man walked beside me and talked about the morning and the valley It was not much past six and for healthy people who have slept enough that is an hour of expansion and of open and trustful talk Connaissez vous le Seigneur he said at length I asked him what Seigneur he meant but he only repeated the question with more emphasis and a look in his eyes denoting hope and interest Ah said I pointing upwards I understand you now Yes I know Him He is the best of acquaintances The old man said he was delighted Hold he added striking his bosom it makes me happy here There were a few who knew the Lord in these valleys he went on to tell me not many but a few Many are called he quoted and few chosen My father said I it is not easy to say who know the Lord and it is none of our business Protestants and Catholics and even those who worship stones may know Him and be known by Him for He has made all I did not know I was so good a preacher The old man assured me he thought as I did and repeated his expressions of pleasure at meeting me We are so few he said They call us Moravians here but down in the Department of Gard where there are also a good number they are called Derbists after an English pastor I began to understand that I was figuring in questionable taste as a member of some sect to me unknown but I was more pleased with the pleasure of my companion than embarrassed by my own equivocal position Indeed I can see no dishonesty in not avowing a difference and especially in these high matters where we have all a sufficient assurance that whoever may be in the wrong we ourselves are not completely in the right The truth is much talked about but this old man in a brown nightcap showed himself so simple sweet and friendly that I am not unwilling to profess myself his convert He was as a matter of fact a Plymouth Brother Of what that involves in the way of doctrine I have no idea nor the time to inform myself but I know right well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world the children of one Father striving in many essential points to do and to become the same And although it was somewhat in a mistake that he shook hands with me so often and showed himself so ready to receive my words that was a mistake of the truth finding sort For charity begins blindfold and only through a series of similar misapprehensions rises at length into a settled principle of love and patience and a firm belief in all our fellow men If I deceived this good old man in the like manner I would willingly go on to deceive others And if ever at length out of our separate and sad ways we should all come together into one common house I have a hope to which I cling dearly that my mountain Plymouth Brother will hasten to shake hands with me again Thus talking like Christian and Faithful by the way he and I came down upon a hamlet by the Tarn It was but a humble place called La Vernede with less than a dozen houses and a Protestant chapel on a knoll Here he dwelt and here at the inn I ordered my breakfast The inn was kept by an agreeable young man a stone breaker on the road and his sister a pretty and engaging girl The village schoolmaster dropped in to speak with the stranger And these were all Protestants a fact which pleased me more than I should have expected and what pleased me still more they seemed all upright and simple people The Plymouth Brother hung round me with a sort of yearning interest and returned at least thrice to make sure I was enjoying my meal His behaviour touched me deeply at the time and even now moves me in recollection He feared to intrude but he would not willingly forego one moment of my society and he seemed never weary of shaking me by the hand When all the rest had drifted off to their day s work I sat for near half an hour with the young mistress of the house who talked pleasantly over her seam of the chestnut harvest and the beauties of the Tarn and old family affections broken up when young folk go from home yet still subsisting Hers I am sure was a sweet nature with a country plainness and much delicacy underneath and he who takes her to his heart will doubtless be a fortunate young man The valley below La Vernede pleased me more and more as I went forward Now the hills approached from either hand naked and crumbling and walled in the river between cliffs and now the valley widened and became green The road led me past the old castle of Miral on a steep past a battlemented monastery long since broken up and turned into a church and parsonage and past a cluster of black roofs the village of Cocures sitting among vineyards and meadows and orchards thick with red apples and where along the highway they were knocking down walnuts from the roadside trees and gathering them in sacks and baskets The hills however much the vale might open were still tall and bare with cliffy battlements and here and there a pointed summit and the Tarn still rattled through the stones with a mountain noise I had been led by bagmen of a picturesque turn of mind to expect a horrific country after the heart of Byron but to my Scottish eyes it seemed smiling and plentiful as the weather still gave an impression of high summer to my Scottish body although the chestnuts were already picked out by the autumn and the poplars that here began to mingle with them had turned into pale gold against the approach of winter There was something in this landscape smiling although wild that explained to me the spirit of the Southern Covenanters Those who took to the hills for conscience sake in Scotland had all gloomy and bedevilled thoughts for once that they received God s comfort they would be twice engaged with Satan but the Camisards had only bright and supporting visions They dealt much more in blood both given and taken yet I find no obsession of the Evil One in their records With a light conscience they pursued their life in these rough times and circumstances The soul of Seguier let us not forget was like a garden They knew they were on God s side with a knowledge that has no parallel among the Scots for the Scots although they might be certain of the cause could never rest confident of the person We flew says one old Camisard when we heard the sound of psalm singing we flew as if with wings We felt within us an animating ardour a transporting desire The feeling cannot be expressed in words It is a thing that must have been experienced to be understood However weary we might be we thought no more of our weariness and grew light so soon as the psalms fell upon our ears The valley of the Tarn and the people whom I met at La Vernede not only explain to me this passage but the twenty years of suffering which those who were so stiff and so bloody when once they betook themselves to war endured with the meekness of children and the constancy of saints and peasants FLORAC On a branch of the Tarn stands Florac the seat of a sub prefecture with an old castle an alley of planes many quaint street corners and a live fountain welling from the hill It is notable besides for handsome women and as one of the two capitals Alais being the other of the country of the Camisards The landlord of the inn took me after I had eaten to an adjoining cafe where I or rather my journey became the topic of the afternoon Every one had some suggestion for my guidance and the sub prefectorial map was fetched from the sub prefecture itself and much thumbed among coffee cups and glasses of liqueur Most of these kind advisers were Protestant though I observed that Protestant and Catholic intermingled in a very easy manner and it surprised me to see what a lively memory still subsisted of the religious war Among the hills of the south west by Mauchline Cumnock or Carsphairn in isolated farms or in the manse serious Presbyterian people still recall the days of the great persecution and the graves of local martyrs are still piously regarded But in towns and among the so called better classes I fear that these old doings have become an idle tale If you met a mixed company in the King s Arms at Wigtown it is not likely that the talk would run on Covenanters Nay at Muirkirk of Glenluce I found the beadle s wife had not so much as heard of Prophet Peden But these Cevenols were proud of their ancestors in quite another sense the war was their chosen topic its exploits were their own patent of nobility and where a man or a race has had but one adventure and that heroic we must expect and pardon some prolixity of reference They told me the country was still full of legends hitherto uncollected I heard from them about Cavalier s descendants not direct descendants be it understood but only cousins or nephews who were still prosperous people in the scene of the boy general s exploits and one farmer had seen the bones of old combatants dug up into the air of an afternoon in the nineteenth century in a field where the ancestors had fought and the great grandchildren were peaceably ditching Later in the day one of the Protestant pastors was so good as to visit me a young man intelligent and polite with whom I passed an hour or two in talk Florac he told me is part Protestant part Catholic and the difference in religion is usually doubled by a difference in politics You may judge of my surprise coming as I did from such a babbling purgatorial Poland of a place as Monastier when I learned that the population lived together on very quiet terms and there was even an exchange of hospitalities between households thus doubly separated Black Camisard and White Camisard militiaman and Miquelet and dragoon Protestant prophet and Catholic cadet of the White Cross they had all been sabring and shooting burning pillaging and murdering their hearts hot with indignant passion and here after a hundred and seventy years Protestant is still Protestant Catholic still Catholic in mutual toleration and mild amity of life But the race of man like that indomitable nature whence it sprang has medicating virtues of its own the years and seasons bring various harvests the sun returns after the rain and mankind outlives secular animosities as a single man awakens from the passions of a day We judge our ancestors from a more divine position and the dust being a little laid with several centuries we can see both sides adorned with human virtues and fighting with a show of right I have never thought it easy to be just and find it daily even harder than I thought I own I met these Protestants with delight and a sense of coming home I was accustomed to speak their language in another and deeper sense of the word than that which distinguishes between French and English for the true Babel is a divergence upon morals And hence I could hold more free communication with the Protestants and judge them more justly than the Catholics Father Apollinaris may pair off with my mountain Plymouth Brother as two guileless and devout old men yet I ask myself if I had as ready a feeling for the virtues of the Trappist or had I been a Catholic if I should have felt so warmly to the dissenter of La Vernede With the first I was on terms of mere forbearance but with the other although only on a misunderstanding and by keeping on selected points it was still possible to hold converse and exchange some honest thoughts In this world of imperfection we gladly welcome even partial intimacies And if we find but one to whom we can speak out of our heart freely with whom we can walk in love and simplicity without dissimulation we have no ground of quarrel with the world or God IN THE VALLEY OF THE MIMENTE On Tuesday first October we left Florac late in the afternoon a tired donkey and tired donkey driver A little way up the Tarnon a covered bridge of wood introduced us into the valley of the Mimente Steep rocky red mountains overhung the stream great oaks and chestnuts grew upon the slopes or in stony terraces here and there was a red field of millet or a few apple trees studded with red apples and the road passed hard by two black hamlets one with an old castle atop to please the heart of the tourist It was difficult here again to find a spot fit for my encampment Even under the oaks and chestnuts the ground had not only a very rapid slope but was heaped with loose stones and where there was no timber the hills descended to the stream in a red precipice tufted with heather The sun had left the highest peak in front of me and the valley was full of the lowing sound of herdsmen s horns as they recalled the flocks into the stable when I spied a bight of meadow some way below the roadway in an angle of the river Thither I descended and tying Modestine provisionally to a tree proceeded to investigate the neighbourhood A grey pearly evening shadow filled the glen objects at a little distance grew indistinct and melted bafflingly into each other and the darkness was rising steadily like an exhalation I approached a great oak which grew in the meadow hard by the river s brink when to my disgust the voices of children fell upon my ear and I beheld a house round the angle on the other bank I had half a mind to pack and be gone again but the growing darkness moved me to remain I had only to make no noise until the night was fairly come and trust to the dawn to call me early in the morning But it was hard to be annoyed by neighbours in such a great hotel A hollow underneath the oak was my bed Before I had fed Modestine and arranged my sack three stars were already brightly shining and the others were beginning dimly to appear I slipped down to the river which looked very black among its rocks to fill my can and dined with a good appetite in the dark for I scrupled to light a lantern while so near a house The moon which I had seen a pallid crescent all afternoon faintly illuminated the summit of the hills but not a ray fell into the bottom of the glen where I was lying The oak rose before me like a pillar of darkness and overhead the heartsome stars were set in the face of the night No one knows the stars who has not slept as the French happily put it a la belle etoile He may know all their names and distances and magnitudes and yet be ignorant of what alone concerns mankind their serene and gladsome influence on the mind The greater part of poetry is about the stars and very justly for they are themselves the most classical of poets These same far away worlds sprinkled like tapers or shaken together like a diamond dust upon the sky had looked not otherwise to Roland or Cavalier when in the words of the latter they had no other tent but the sky and no other bed than my mother earth All night a strong wind blew up the valley and the acorns fell pattering over me from the oak Yet on this first night of October the air was as mild as May and I slept with the fur thrown back I was much disturbed by the barking of a dog an animal that I fear more than any wolf A dog is vastly braver and is besides supported by the sense of duty If you kill a wolf you meet with encouragement and praise but if you kill a dog the sacred rights of property and the domestic affections come clamouring round you for redress At the end of a fagging day the sharp cruel note of a dog s bark is in itself a keen annoyance and to a tramp like myself he represents the sedentary and respectable world in its most hostile form There is something of the clergyman or the lawyer about this engaging animal and it he were not amenable to stones the boldest man would shrink from travelling afoot I respect dogs much in the domestic circle but on the highway or sleeping afield I both detest and fear them I was wakened next morning Wednesday October second by the same dog for I knew his bark making a charge down the bank and then seeing me sit up retreating again with great alacrity The stars were not yet quite extinguished The heaven was of that enchanting mild grey blue of the early morn A still clear light began to fall and the trees on the hillside were outlined sharply against the sky The wind had veered more to the north and no longer reached me in the glen but as I was going on with my preparations it drove a white cloud very swiftly over the hill top and looking up I was surprised to see the cloud dyed with gold In these high regions of the air the sun was already shining as at noon If only the clouds travelled high enough we should see the same thing all night long For it is always daylight in the fields of space As I began to go up the valley a draught of wind came down it out of the seat of the sunrise although the clouds continued to run overhead in an almost contrary direction A few steps farther and I saw a whole hillside gilded with the sun and still a little beyond between two peaks a centre of dazzling brilliancy appeared floating in the sky and I was once more face to face with the big bonfire that occupies the kernel of our system I met but one human being that forenoon a dark military looking wayfarer who carried a game bag on a baldric but he made a remark that seems worthy of record For when I asked him if he were Protestant or Catholic Oh said he I make no shame of my religion I am a Catholic He made no shame of it The phrase is a piece of natural statistics for it is the language of one in a minority I thought with a smile of Bavile and his dragoons and how you may ride rough shod over a religion for a century and leave it only the more lively for the friction Ireland is still Catholic the Cevennes still Protestant It is not a basketful of law papers nor the hoofs and pistol butts of a regiment of horse that can change one tittle of a ploughman s thoughts Outdoor rustic people have not many ideas but such as they have are hardy plants and thrive flourishingly in persecution One who has grown a long while in the sweat of laborious noons and under the stars at night a frequenter of hills and forests an old honest countryman has in the end a sense of communion with the powers of the universe and amicable relations towards his God Like my mountain Plymouth Brother he knows the Lord His religion does not repose upon a choice of logic it is the poetry of the man s experience the philosophy of the history of his life God like a great power like a great shining sun has appeared to this simple fellow in the course of years and become the ground and essence of his least reflections and you may change creeds and dogma by authority or proclaim a new religion with the sound of trumpets if you will but here is a man who has his own thoughts and will stubbornly adhere to them in good and evil He is a Catholic a Protestant or a Plymouth Brother in the same indefeasible sense that a man is not a woman or a woman not a man For he could not vary from his faith unless he could eradicate all memory of the past and in a strict and not a conventional meaning change his mind THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY I was now drawing near to Cassagnas a cluster of black roofs upon the hillside in this wild valley among chestnut gardens and looked upon in the clear air by many rocky peaks The road along the Mimente is yet new nor have the mountaineers recovered their surprise when the first cart arrived at Cassagnas But although it lay thus apart from the current of men s business this hamlet had already made a figure in the history of France Hard by in caverns of the mountain was one of the five arsenals of the Camisards where they laid up clothes and corn and arms against necessity forged bayonets and sabres and made themselves gunpowder with willow charcoal and saltpetre boiled in kettles To the same caves amid this multifarious industry the sick and wounded were brought up to heal and there they were visited by the two surgeons Chabrier and Tavan and secretly nursed by women of the neighbourhood Of the five legions into which the Camisards were divided it was the oldest and the most obscure that had its magazines by Cassagnas This was the band of Spirit Seguier men who had joined their voices with his in the sixty eighth Psalm as they marched down by night on the archpriest of the Cevennes Seguier promoted to heaven was succeeded by Salomon Couderc whom Cavalier treats in his memoirs as chaplain general to the whole army of the Camisards He was a prophet a great reader of the heart who admitted people to the sacrament or refused them by intentively viewing every man between the eyes and had the most of the Scriptures off by rote And this was surely happy since in a surprise in August seventeen oh three he lost his mule his portfolios and his Bible It is only strange that they were not surprised more often and more effectually for this legion of Cassagnas was truly patriarchal in its theory of war and camped without sentries leaving that duty to the angels of the God for whom they fought This is a token not only of their faith but of the trackless country where they harboured M de Caladon taking a stroll one fine day walked without warning into their midst as he might have walked into a flock of sheep in a plain and found some asleep and some awake and psalm singing A traitor had need of no recommendation to insinuate himself among their ranks beyond his faculty of singing psalms and even the prophet Salomon took him into a particular friendship Thus among their intricate hills the rustic troop subsisted and history can attribute few exploits to them but sacraments and ecstasies People of this tough and simple stock will not as I have just been saying prove variable in religion nor will they get nearer to apostasy than a mere external conformity like that of Naaman in the house of Rimmon When Louis XVI in the words of the edict convinced by the uselessness of a century of persecutions and rather from necessity than sympathy granted at last a royal grace of toleration Cassagnas was still Protestant and to a man it is so to this day There is indeed one family that is not Protestant but neither is it Catholic It is that of a Catholic cure in revolt who has taken to his bosom a schoolmistress And his conduct it is worth noting is disapproved by the Protestant villagers It is a bad idea for a man said one to go back from his engagements The villagers whom I saw seemed intelligent after a countrified fashion and were all plain and dignified in manner As a Protestant myself I was well looked upon and my acquaintance with history gained me further respect For we had something not unlike a religious controversy at table a gendarme and a merchant with whom I dined being both strangers to the place and Catholics The young men of the house stood round and supported me and the whole discussion was tolerantly conducted and surprised a man brought up among the infinitesimal and contentious differences of Scotland The merchant indeed grew a little warm and was far less pleased than some others with my historical acquirements But the gendarme was mighty easy over it all It s a bad idea for a man to change said he and the remark was generally applauded That was not the opinion of the priest and soldier at Our Lady of the Snows But this is a different race and perhaps the same great heartedness that upheld them to resist now enables them to differ in a kind spirit For courage respects courage but where a faith has been trodden out we may look for a mean and narrow population The true work of Bruce and Wallace was the union of the nations not that they should stand apart a while longer skirmishing upon their borders but that when the time came they might unite with self respect The merchant was much interested in my journey and thought it dangerous to sleep afield There are the wolves said he and then it is known you are an Englishman The English have always long purses and it might very well enter into some one s head to deal you an ill blow some night I told him I was not much afraid of such accidents and at any rate judged it unwise to dwell upon alarms or consider small perils in the arrangement of life Life itself I submitted was a far too risky business as a whole to make each additional particular of danger worth regard Something said I might burst in your inside any day of the week and there would be an end of you if you were locked in your room with three turns of the key Cependant said he coucher dehors God said I is everywhere Cependant coucher dehors he repeated and his voice was eloquent of terror He was the only person in all my voyage who saw anything hardy in so simple a proceeding although many considered it superfluous Only one on the other hand professed much delight in the idea and that was my Plymouth Brother who cried out when I told him I sometimes preferred sleeping under the stars to a close and noisy alehouse Now I see that you know the Lord The merchant asked me for one of my cards as I was leaving for he said I should be something to talk of in the future and desired me to make a note of his request and reason a desire with which I have thus complied A little after two I struck across the Mimente and took a rugged path southward up a hillside covered with loose stones and tufts of heather At the top as is the habit of the country the path disappeared and I left my she ass munching heather and went forward alone to seek a road I was now on the separation of two vast watersheds behind me all the streams were bound for the Garonne and the Western Ocean before me was the basin of the Rhone Hence as from the Lozere you can see in clear weather the shining of the Gulf of Lyons and perhaps from here the soldiers of Salomon may have watched for the topsails of Sir Cloudesley Shovel and the long promised aid from England You may take this ridge as lying in the heart of the country of the Camisards four of the five legions camped all round it and almost within view Salomon and Joani to the north Castanet and Roland to the south and when Julien had finished his famous work the devastation of the High Cevennes which lasted all through October and November seventeen oh three and during which four hundred and sixty villages and hamlets were with fire and pickaxe utterly subverted a man standing on this eminence would have looked forth upon a silent smokeless and dispeopled land Time and man s activity have now repaired these ruins Cassagnas is once more roofed and sending up domestic smoke and in the chestnut gardens in low and leafy corners many a prosperous farmer returns when the day s work is done to his children and bright hearth And still it was perhaps the wildest view of all my journey Peak upon peak chain upon chain of hills ran surging southward channeled and sculptured by the winter streams feathered from head to foot with chestnuts and here and there breaking out into a coronal of cliffs The sun which was still far from setting sent a drift of misty gold across the hill tops but the valleys were already plunged in a profound and quiet shadow A very old shepherd hobbling on a pair of sticks and wearing a black cap of liberty as if in honour of his nearness to the grave directed me to the road for saint Germain de Calberte There was something solemn in the isolation of this infirm and ancient creature Where he dwelt how he got upon this high ridge or how he proposed to get down again were more than I could fancy Not far off upon my right was the famous Plan de Font Morte where Poul with his Armenian sabre slashed down the Camisards of Seguier This methought might be some Rip van Winkle of the war who had lost his comrades fleeing before Poul and wandered ever since upon the mountains It might be news to him that Cavalier had surrendered or Roland had fallen fighting with his back against an olive And while I was thus working on my fancy I heard him hailing in broken tones and saw him waving me to come back with one of his two sticks I had already got some way past him but leaving Modestine once more retraced my steps Alas it was a very commonplace affair The old gentleman had forgot to ask the pedlar what he sold and wished to remedy this neglect I told him sternly Nothing Nothing cried he I repeated Nothing and made off It s odd to think of but perhaps I thus became as inexplicable to the old man as he had been to me The road lay under chestnuts and though I saw a hamlet or two below me in the vale and many lone houses of the chestnut farmers it was a very solitary march all afternoon and the evening began early underneath the trees But I heard the voice of a woman singing some sad old endless ballad not far off It seemed to be about love and a bel amoureux her handsome sweetheart and I wished I could have taken up the strain and answered her as I went on upon my invisible woodland way weaving like Pippa in the poem my own thoughts with hers What could I have told her Little enough and yet all the heart requires How the world gives and takes away and brings sweethearts near only to separate them again into distant and strange lands but to love is the great amulet which makes the world a garden and hope which comes to all outwears the accidents of life and reaches with tremulous hand beyond the grave and death Easy to say yea but also by God s mercy both easy and grateful to believe We struck at last into a wide white high road carpeted with noiseless dust The night had come the moon had been shining for a long while upon the opposite mountain when on turning a corner my donkey and I issued ourselves into her light I had emptied out my brandy at Florac for I could bear the stuff no longer and replaced it with some generous and scented Volnay and now I drank to the moon s sacred majesty upon the road It was but a couple of mouthfuls yet I became thenceforth unconscious of my limbs and my blood flowed with luxury Even Modestine was inspired by this purified nocturnal sunshine and bestirred her little hoofs as to a livelier measure The road wound and descended swiftly among masses of chestnuts Hot dust rose from our feet and flowed away Our two shadows mine deformed with the knapsack hers comically bestridden by the pack now lay before us clearly outlined on the road and now as we turned a corner went off into the ghostly distance and sailed along the mountain like clouds From time to time a warm wind rustled down the valley and set all the chestnuts dangling their bunches of foliage and fruit the ear was filled with whispering music and the shadows danced in tune And next moment the breeze had gone by and in all the valley nothing moved except our travelling feet On the opposite slope the monstrous ribs and gullies of the mountain were faintly designed in the moonshine and high overhead in some lone house there burned one lighted window one square spark of red in the huge field of sad nocturnal colouring At a certain point as I went downward turning many acute angles the moon disappeared behind the hill and I pursued my way in great darkness until another turning shot me without preparation into saint Germain de Calberte The place was asleep and silent and buried in opaque night Only from a single open door some lamplight escaped upon the road to show me that I was come among men s habitations The two last gossips of the evening still talking by a garden wall directed me to the inn The landlady was getting her chicks to bed the fire was already out and had not without grumbling to be rekindled half an hour later and I must have gone supperless to roost THE LAST DAY When I awoke Thursday second October and hearing a great flourishing of cocks and chuckling of contented hens betook me to the window of the clean and comfortable room where I had slept the night I looked forth on a sunshiny morning in a deep vale of chestnut gardens It was still early and the cockcrows and the slanting lights and the long shadows encouraged me to be out and look round me saint Germain de Calberte is a great parish nine leagues round about At the period of the wars and immediately before the devastation it was inhabited by two hundred and seventy five families of which only nine were Catholic and it took the cure seventeen September days to go from house to house on horseback for a census But the place itself although capital of a canton is scarce larger than a hamlet It lies terraced across a steep slope in the midst of mighty chestnuts The Protestant chapel stands below upon a shoulder in the midst of the town is the quaint old Catholic church It was here that poor Du Chayla the Christian martyr kept his library and held a court of missionaries here he had built his tomb thinking to lie among a grateful population whom he had redeemed from error and hither on the morrow of his death they brought the body pierced with two and fifty wounds to be interred Clad in his priestly robes he was laid out in state in the church The cure taking his text from Second Samuel twentieth chapter and twelfth verse And Amasa wallowed in his blood in the highway preached a rousing sermon and exhorted his brethren to die each at his post like their unhappy and illustrious superior In the midst of this eloquence there came a breeze that Spirit Seguier was near at hand and behold all the assembly took to their horses heels some east some west and the cure himself as far as Alais Strange was the position of this little Catholic metropolis a thimbleful of Rome in such a wild and contrary neighbourhood On the one hand the legion of Salomon overlooked it from Cassagnas on the other it was cut off from assistance by the legion of Roland at Mialet The cure Louvrelenil although he took a panic at the arch priest s funeral and so hurriedly decamped to Alais stood well by his isolated pulpit and thence uttered fulminations against the crimes of the Protestants Salomon besieged the village for an hour and a half but was beaten back The militiamen on guard before the cure s door could be heard in the black hours singing Protestant psalms and holding friendly talk with the insurgents And in the morning although not a shot had been fired there would not be a round of powder in their flasks Where was it gone All handed over to the Camisards for a consideration Untrusty guardians for an isolated priest That these continual stirs were once busy in saint Germain de Calberte the imagination with difficulty receives all is now so quiet the pulse of human life now beats so low and still in this hamlet of the mountains Boys followed me a great way off like a timid sort of lion hunters and people turned round to have a second look or came out of their houses as I went by My passage was the first event you would have fancied since the Camisards There was nothing rude or forward in this observation it was but a pleased and wondering scrutiny like that of oxen or the human infant yet it wearied my spirits and soon drove me from the street I took refuge on the terraces which are here greenly carpeted with sward and tried to imitate with a pencil the inimitable attitudes of the chestnuts as they bear up their canopy of leaves Ever and again a little wind went by and the nuts dropped all around me with a light and dull sound upon the sward The noise was as of a thin fall of great hailstones but there went with it a cheerful human sentiment of an approaching harvest and farmers rejoicing in their gains Looking up I could see the brown nut peering through the husk which was already gaping and between the stems the eye embraced an amphitheatre of hill sunlit and green with leaves I have not often enjoyed a place more deeply I moved in an atmosphere of pleasure and felt light and quiet and content But perhaps it was not the place alone that so disposed my spirit Perhaps some one was thinking of me in another country or perhaps some thought of my own had come and gone unnoticed and yet done me good For some thoughts which sure would be the most beautiful vanish before we can rightly scan their features as though a god travelling by our green highways should but ope the door give one smiling look into the house and go again for ever Was it Apollo or Mercury or Love with folded wings Who shall say But we go the lighter about our business and feel peace and pleasure in our hearts I dined with a pair of Catholics They agreed in the condemnation of a young man a Catholic who had married a Protestant girl and gone over to the religion of his wife A Protestant born they could understand and respect indeed they seemed to be of the mind of an old Catholic woman who told me that same day there was no difference between the two sects save that wrong was more wrong for the Catholic who had more light and guidance but this of a man s desertion filled them with contempt It s a bad idea for a man to change said one It may have been accidental but you see how this phrase pursued me and for myself I believe it is the current philosophy in these parts I have some difficulty in imagining a better It s not only a great flight of confidence for a man to change his creed and go out of his family for heaven s sake but the odds are nay and the hope is that with all this great transition in the eyes of man he has not changed himself a hairbreadth to the eyes of God Honour to those who do so for the wrench is sore But it argues something narrow whether of strength or weakness whether of the prophet or the fool in those who can take a sufficient interest in such infinitesimal and human operations or who can quit a friendship for a doubtful process of the mind And I think I should not leave my old creed for another changing only words for other words but by some brave reading embrace it in spirit and truth and find wrong as wrong for me as for the best of other communions The phylloxera was in the neighbourhood and instead of wine we drank at dinner a more economical juice of the grape La Parisienne they call it It is made by putting the fruit whole into a cask with water one by one the berries ferment and burst what is drunk during the day is supplied at night in water so with ever another pitcher from the well and ever another grape exploding and giving out its strength one cask of Parisienne may last a family till spring It is as the reader will anticipate a feeble beverage but very pleasant to the taste What with dinner and coffee it was long past three before I left saint Germain de Calberte I went down beside the Gardon of Mialet a great glaring watercourse devoid of water and through saint Etienne de Vallee Francaise or Val Francesque as they used to call it and towards evening began to ascend the hill of saint Pierre It was a long and steep ascent Behind me an empty carriage returning to saint Jean du Gard kept hard upon my tracks and near the summit overtook me The driver like the rest of the world was sure I was a pedlar but unlike others he was sure of what I had to sell He had noticed the blue wool which hung out of my pack at either end and from this he had decided beyond my power to alter his decision that I dealt in blue wool collars such as decorate the neck of the French draught horse I had hurried to the topmost powers of Modestine for I dearly desired to see the view upon the other side before the day had faded But it was night when I reached the summit the moon was riding high and clear and only a few grey streaks of twilight lingered in the west A yawning valley gulfed in blackness lay like a hole in created nature at my feet but the outline of the hills was sharp against the sky There was Mount Aigoal the stronghold of Castanet And Castanet not only as an active undertaking leader deserves some mention among Camisards for there is a spray of rose among his laurel and he showed how even in a public tragedy love will have its way In the high tide of war he married in his mountain citadel a young and pretty lass called Mariette There were great rejoicings and the bridegroom released five and twenty prisoners in honour of the glad event Seven months afterwards Mariette the Princess of the Cevennes as they called her in derision fell into the hands of the authorities where it was like to have gone hard with her But Castanet was a man of execution and loved his wife He fell on Valleraugue and got a lady there for a hostage and for the first and last time in that war there was an exchange of prisoners Their daughter pledge of some starry night upon Mount Aigoal has left descendants to this day Modestine and I it was our last meal together had a snack upon the top of saint Pierre I on a heap of stones she standing by me in the moonlight and decorously eating bread out of my hand The poor brute would eat more heartily in this manner for she had a sort of affection for me which I was soon to betray It was a long descent upon saint Jean du Gard and we met no one but a carter visible afar off by the glint of the moon on his extinguished lantern Before ten o clock we had got in and were at supper fifteen miles and a stiff hill in little beyond six hours FAREWELL MODESTINE On examination on the morning of October third Modestine was pronounced unfit for travel She would need at least two days repose according to the ostler but I was now eager to reach Alais for my letters and being in a civilized country of stage coaches I determined to sell my lady friend and be off by the diligence that afternoon Our yesterday s march with the testimony of the driver who had pursued us up the long hill of saint Pierre spread a favourable notion of my donkey s capabilities Intending purchasers were aware of an unrivaled opportunity Before ten I had an offer of twenty five francs and before noon after a desperate engagement I sold her saddle and all for five and thirty The pecuniary gain is not obvious but I had bought freedom into the bargain saint Jean du Gard is a large place and largely Protestant The maire a Protestant asked me to help him in a small matter which is itself characteristic of the country The young women of the Cevennes profit by the common religion and the difference of the language to go largely as governesses into England and here was one a native of Mialet struggling with English circulars from two different agencies in London I gave what help I could and volunteered some advice which struck me as being excellent One thing more I note The phylloxera has ravaged the vineyards in this neighbourhood and in the early morning under some chestnuts by the river I found a party of men working with a cider press I could not at first make out what they were after and asked one fellow to explain Making cider he said Oui c est comme ca Comme dans le nord There was a ring of sarcasm in his voice the country was going to the devil It was not until I was fairly seated by the driver and rattling through a rocky valley with dwarf olives that I became aware of my bereavement I had lost Modestine Up to that moment I had thought I hated her but now she was gone And O The difference to me For twelve days we had been fast companions we had travelled upwards of a hundred and twenty miles crossed several respectable ridges and jogged along with our six legs by many a rocky and many a boggy by road After the first day although sometimes I was hurt and distant in manner I still kept my patience and as for her poor soul she had come to regard me as a god She loved to eat out of my hand She was patient elegant in form the colour of an ideal mouse and inimitably small Her faults were those of her race and sex her virtues were her own Farewell and if for ever Father Adam wept when he sold her to me after I had sold her in my turn I was tempted to follow his example and being alone with a stage driver and four or five agreeable young men I did not hesitate to yield to my emotion A MOUNTAIN TOWN IN FRANCE A FRAGMENT eighteen seventy nine Originally intended to serve as the opening chapter of Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes Le Monastier is the chief place of a hilly canton in Haute Loire the ancient Velay As the name betokens the town is of monastic origin and it still contains a towered bulk of monastery and a church of some architectural pretensions the seat of an archpriest and several vicars It stands on the side of a hill above the river Gazeille about fifteen miles from Le Puy up a steep road where the wolves sometimes pursue the diligence in winter The road which is bound for Vivarais passes through the town from end to end in a single narrow street there you may see the fountain where women fill their pitchers there also some old houses with carved doors and pediments and ornamental work in iron For Monastier like Maybole in Ayrshire was a sort of country capital where the local aristocracy had their town mansions for the winter and there is a certain baron still alive and I am told extremely penitent who found means to ruin himself by high living in this village on the hills He certainly has claims to be considered the most remarkable spendthrift on record How he set about it in a place where there are no luxuries for sale and where the board at the best inn comes to little more than a shilling a day is a problem for the wise His son ruined as the family was went as far as Paris to sow his wild oats and so the cases of father and son mark an epoch in the history of centralization in France Not until the latter had got into the train was the work of Richelieu complete It is a people of lace makers The women sit in the streets by groups of five or six and the noise of the bobbins is audible from one group to another Now and then you will hear one woman clattering off prayers for the edification of the others at their work They wear gaudy shawls white caps with a gay ribbon about the head and sometimes a black felt brigand hat above the cap and so they give the street colour and brightness and a foreign air A while ago when England largely supplied herself from this district with the lace called torchon it was not unusual to earn five francs a day and five francs in Monastier is worth a pound in London Now from a change in the market it takes a clever and industrious workwoman to earn from three to four in the week or less than an eighth of what she made easily a few years ago The tide of prosperity came and went as with our northern pitmen and left nobody the richer The women bravely squandered their gains kept the men in idleness and gave themselves up as I was told to sweethearting and a merry life From week s end to week s end it was one continuous gala in Monastier people spent the day in the wine shops and the drum or the bagpipes led on the bourrees up to ten at night Now these dancing days are over Il n y a plus de jeunesse said Victor the garcon I hear of no great advance in what are thought the essentials of morality but the bourree with its rambling sweet interminable music and alert and rustic figures has fallen into disuse and is mostly remembered as a custom of the past Only on the occasion of the fair shall you hear a drum discreetly rattling in a wine shop or perhaps one of the company singing the measure while the others dance I am sorry at the change and marvel once more at the complicated scheme of things upon this earth and how a turn of fashion in England can silence so much mountain merriment in France The lace makers themselves have not entirely forgiven our countrywomen and I think they take a special pleasure in the legend of the northern quarter of the town called L Anglade because there the English free lances were arrested and driven back by the potency of a little Virgin Mary on the wall From time to time a market is held and the town has a season of revival cattle and pigs are stabled in the streets and pickpockets have been known to come all the way from Lyons for the occasion Every Sunday the country folk throng in with daylight to buy apples to attend mass and to visit one of the wine shops of which there are no fewer than fifty in this little town Sunday wear for the men is a green tail coat of some coarse sort of drugget and usually a complete suit to match I have never set eyes on such degrading raiment Here it clings there bulges and the human body with its agreeable and lively lines is turned into a mockery and laughing stock Another piece of Sunday business with the peasants is to take their ailments to the chemist for advice It is as much a matter for Sunday as church going I have seen a woman who had been unable to speak since the Monday before wheezing catching her breath endlessly and painfully coughing and yet she had waited upwards of a hundred hours before coming to seek help and had the week been twice as long she would have waited still There was a canonical day for consultation such was the ancestral habit to which a respectable lady must study to conform Two conveyances go daily to Le Puy but they rival each other in polite concessions rather than in speed Each will wait an hour or two hours cheerfully while an old lady does her marketing or a gentleman finishes the papers in a cafe The Courrier such is the name of one should leave Le Puy by two in the afternoon on the return voyage and arrive at Monastier in good time for a six o clock dinner But the driver dares not disoblige his customers He will postpone his departure again and again hour after hour and I have known the sun to go down on his delay These purely personal favours this consideration of men s fancies rather than the hands of a mechanical clock as marking the advance of the abstraction time makes a more humorous business of stage coaching than we are used to see it As far as the eye can reach one swelling line of hill top rises and falls behind another and if you climb an eminence it is only to see new and farther ranges behind these Many little rivers run from all sides in cliffy valleys and one of them a few miles from Monastier bears the great name of Loire The mean level of the country is a little more than three thousand feet above the sea which makes the atmosphere proportionally brisk and wholesome There is little timber except pines and the greater part of the country lies in moorland pasture The country is wild and tumbled rather than commanding an upland rather than a mountain district and the most striking as well as the most agreeable scenery lies low beside the rivers There indeed you will find many corners that take the fancy such as made the English noble choose his grave by a Swiss streamlet where Nature is at her freshest and looks as young as on the seventh morning Such a place is the course of the Gazeille where it waters the common of Monastier and thence downward till it joins the Loire a place to hear birds singing a place for lovers to frequent The name of the river was perhaps suggested by the sound of its passage over the stones for it is a great warbler and at night after I was in bed in Monastier I could hear it go singing down the valley till I fell asleep On the whole this is a Scottish landscape although not so noble as the best in Scotland and by an odd coincidence the population is in its way as Scottish as the country They have abrupt uncouth Fifeshire manners and accost you as if you were trespassing with an Ou saint ce que vous allez only translatable into the Lowland Whau r ye gaun They keep the Scottish Sabbath There is no labour done on that day but to drive in and out the various pigs and sheep and cattle that make so pleasant a tinkling in the meadows The lace makers have disappeared from the street Not to attend mass would involve social degradation and you may find people reading Sunday books in particular a sort of Catholic Monthly Visitor on the doings of Our Lady of Lourdes I remember one Sunday when I was walking in the country that I fell on a hamlet and found all the inhabitants from the patriarch to the baby gathered in the shadow of a gable at prayer One strapping lass stood with her back to the wall and did the solo part the rest chiming in devoutly Not far off a lad lay flat on his face asleep among some straw to represent the worldly element Again this people is eager to proselytize and the postmaster s daughter used to argue with me by the half hour about my heresy until she grew quite flushed I have heard the reverse process going on between a Scots woman and a French girl and the arguments in the two cases were identical Each apostle based her claim on the superior virtue and attainments of her clergy and clinched the business with a threat of hell fire Pas bong pretres ici said the Presbyterian bong pretres en Ecosse And the postmaster s daughter taking up the same weapon plied me so to speak with the butt of it instead of the bayonet We are a hopeful race it seems and easily persuaded for our good One cheerful circumstance I note in these guerrilla missions that each side relies on hell and Protestant and Catholic alike address themselves to a supposed misgiving in their adversary s heart And I call it cheerful for faith is a more supporting quality than imagination Here as in Scotland many peasant families boast a son in holy orders And here also the young men have a tendency to emigrate It is certainly not poverty that drives them to the great cities or across the seas for many peasant families I was told have a fortune of at least forty thousand francs The lads go forth pricked with the spirit of adventure and the desire to rise in life and leave their homespun elders grumbling and wondering over the event Once at a village called Laussonne I met one of these disappointed parents a drake who had fathered a wild swan and seen it take wing and disappear The wild swan in question was now an apothecary in Brazil He had flown by way of Bordeaux and first landed in America bare headed and barefoot and with a single halfpenny in his pocket And now he was an apothecary Such a wonderful thing is an adventurous life I thought he might as well have stayed at home but you never can tell wherein a man s life consists nor in what he sets his pleasure one to drink another to marry a third to write scurrilous articles and be repeatedly caned in public and now this fourth perhaps to be an apothecary in Brazil As for his old father he could conceive no reason for the lad s behaviour I had always bread for him he said he ran away to annoy me He loved to annoy me He had no gratitude But at heart he was swelling with pride over his travelled offspring and he produced a letter out of his pocket where as he said it was rotting a mere lump of paper rags and waved it gloriously in the air This comes from America he cried six thousand leagues away And the wine shop audience looked upon it with a certain thrill I soon became a popular figure and was known for miles in the country Ou saint ce que vous allez was changed for me into Quoi vous rentrez au Monastier ce soir and in the town itself every urchin seemed to know my name although no living creature could pronounce it There was one particular group of lace makers who brought out a chair for me whenever I went by and detained me from my walk to gossip They were filled with curiosity about England its language its religion the dress of the women and were never weary of seeing the Queen s head on English postage stamps or seeking for French words in English Journals The language in particular filled them with surprise Do they speak patois in England I was once asked and when I told them not Ah then French said they No no I said not French Then they concluded they speak patois You must obviously either speak French or patois Talk of the force of logic here it was in all its weakness I gave up the point but proceeding to give illustrations of ray native jargon I was met with a new mortification Of all patois they declared that mine was the most preposterous and the most jocose in sound At each new word there was a new explosion of laughter and some of the younger ones were glad to rise from their chairs and stamp about the street in ecstasy and I looked on upon their mirth in a faint and slightly disagreeable bewilderment Bread which sounds a commonplace plain sailing monosyllable in England was the word that most delighted these good ladies of Monastier it seemed to them frolicsome and racy like a page of Pickwick and they all got it carefully by heart as a stand by I presume for winter evenings I have tried it since then with every sort of accent and inflection but I seem to lack the sense of humour They were of all ages children at their first web of lace a stripling girl with a bashful but encouraging play of eyes solid married women and grandmothers some on the top of their age and some falling towards decrepitude One and all were pleasant and natural ready to laugh and ready with a certain quiet solemnity when that was called for by the subject of our talk Life since the fall in wages had begun to appear to them with a more serious air The stripling girl would sometimes laugh at me in a provocative and not unadmiring manner if I judge aright and one of the grandmothers who was my great friend of the party gave me many a sharp word of judgment on my sketches my heresy or even my arguments and gave them with a wry mouth and a humorous twinkle in her eye that were eminently Scottish But the rest used me with a certain reverence as something come from afar and not entirely human Nothing would put them at their ease but the irresistible gaiety of my native tongue Between the old lady and myself I think there was a real attachment She was never weary of sitting to me for her portrait in her best cap and brigand hat and with all her wrinkles tidily composed and though she never failed to repudiate the result she would always insist upon another trial It was as good as a play to see her sitting in judgment over the last No no she would say that is not it I am old to be sure but I am better looking than that We must try again When I was about to leave she bade me good bye for this life in a somewhat touching manner We should not meet again she said it was a long farewell and she was sorry But life is so full of crooks old lady that who knows I have said good bye to people for greater distances and times and please God I mean to see them yet again One thing was notable about these women from the youngest to the oldest and with hardly an exception In spite of their piety they could twang off an oath with Sir Toby Belch in person There was nothing so high or so low in heaven or earth or in the human body but a woman of this neighbourhood would whip out the name of it fair and square by way of conversational adornment My landlady who was pretty and young dressed like a lady and avoided patois like a weakness commonly addressed her child in the language of a drunken bully And of all the swearers that I ever heard commend me to an old lady in Gondet a village of the Loire I was making a sketch and her curse was not yet ended when I had finished it and took my departure It is true she had a right to be angry for here was her son a hulking fellow visibly the worse for drink before the day was well begun But it was strange to hear her unwearying flow of oaths and obscenities endless like a river and now and then rising to a passionate shrillness in the clear and silent air of the morning In city slums the thing might have passed unnoticed but in a country valley and from a plain and honest countrywoman this beastliness of speech surprised the ear The Conductor as he is called of Roads and Bridges was my principal companion He was generally intelligent and could have spoken more or less falsetto on any of the trite topics but it was his specialty to have a generous taste in eating This was what was most indigenous in the man it was here he was an artist and I found in his company what I had long suspected that enthusiasm and special knowledge are the great social qualities and what they are about whether white sauce or Shakespeare s plays an altogether secondary question I used to accompany the Conductor on his professional rounds and grew to believe myself an expert in the business I thought I could make an entry in a stone breaker s time book or order manure off the wayside with any living engineer in France Gondet was one of the places we visited together and Laussonne where I met the apothecary s father was another There at Laussonne George Sand spent a day while she was gathering materials for the Marquis de Villemer and I have spoken with an old man who was then a child running about the inn kitchen and who still remembers her with a sort of reverence It appears that he spoke French imperfectly for this reason George Sand chose him for companion and whenever he let slip a broad and picturesque phrase in patois she would make him repeat it again and again till it was graven in her memory The word for a frog particularly pleased her fancy and it would be curious to know if she afterwards employed it in her works The peasants who knew nothing of letters and had never so much as heard of local colour could not explain her chattering with this backward child and to them she seemed a very homely lady and far from beautiful the most famous man killer of the age appealed so little to Velaisian swine herds On my first engineering excursion which lay up by Crouzials towards Mount Mezenc and the borders of Ardeche I began an improving acquaintance with the foreman road mender He was in great glee at having me with him passed me off among his subalterns as the supervising engineer and insisted on what he called the gallantry of paying for my breakfast in a roadside wine shop On the whole he was a man of great weather wisdom some spirits and a social temper But I am afraid he was superstitious When he was nine years old he had seen one night a company of bourgeois et dames qui faisaient la manege avec des chaises and concluded that he was in the presence of a witches Sabbath I suppose but venture with timidity on the suggestion that this may have been a romantic and nocturnal picnic party Again coming from Pradelles with his brother they saw a great empty cart drawn by six enormous horses before them on the road The driver cried aloud and filled the mountains with the cracking of his whip He never seemed to go faster than a walk yet it was impossible to overtake him and at length at the corner of a hill the whole equipage disappeared bodily into the night At the time people said it was the devil qui s amusait a faire ca I suggested there was nothing more likely as he must have some amusement The foreman said it was odd but there was less of that sort of thing than formerly C est difficile he added a expliquer When we were well up on the moors and the Conductor was trying some road metal with the gauge Hark said the foreman do you hear nothing We listened and the wind which was blowing chilly out of the east brought a faint tangled jangling to our ears It is the flocks of Vivarais said he For every summer the flocks out of all Ardeche are brought up to pasture on these grassy plateaux Here and there a little private flock was being tended by a girl one spinning with a distaff another seated on a wall and intently making lace This last when we addressed her leaped up in a panic and put out her arms like a person swimming to keep us at a distance and it was some seconds before we could persuade her of the honesty of our intentions The Conductor told me of another herdswoman from whom he had once asked his road while he was yet new to the country and who fled from him driving her beasts before her until he had given up the information in despair A tale of old lawlessness may yet be read in these uncouth timidities The winter in these uplands is a dangerous and melancholy time Houses are snowed up and wayfarers lost in a flurry within hail of their own fireside No man ventures abroad without meat and a bottle of wine which he replenishes at every wine shop and even thus equipped he takes the road with terror All day the family sits about the fire in a foul and airless hovel and equally without work or diversion The father may carve a rude piece of furniture but that is all that will be done until the spring sets in again and along with it the labours of the field It is not for nothing that you find a clock in the meanest of these mountain habitations A clock and an almanack you would fancy were indispensable in such a life EDINBURGH PICTURESQUE NOTES EDINBURGH CHAPTER I INTRODUCTORY The ancient and famous metropolis of the North sits overlooking a windy estuary from the slope and summit of three hills No situation could be more commanding for the head city of a kingdom none better chosen for noble prospects From her tall precipice and terraced gardens she looks far and wide on the sea and broad champaigns To the east you may catch at sunset the spark of the May lighthouse where the Firth expands into the German Ocean and away to the west over all the carse of Stirling you can see the first snows upon Ben Ledi But Edinburgh pays cruelly for her high seat in one of the vilest climates under heaven She is liable to be beaten upon by all the winds that blow to be drenched with rain to be buried in cold sea fogs out of the east and powdered with the snow as it comes flying southward from the Highland hills The weather is raw and boisterous in winter shifty and ungenial in summer and a downright meteorological purgatory in the spring The delicate die early and I as a survivor among bleak winds and plumping rain have been sometimes tempted to envy them their fate For all who love shelter and the blessings of the sun who hate dark weather and perpetual tilting against squalls there could scarcely be found a more unhomely and harassing place of residence Many such aspire angrily after that Somewhere else of the imagination where all troubles are supposed to end They lean over the great bridge which joins the New Town with the Old that windiest spot or high altar in this northern temple of the winds and watch the trains smoking out from under them and vanishing into the tunnel on a voyage to brighter skies Happy the passengers who shake off the dust of Edinburgh and have heard for the last time the cry of the east wind among her chimney tops And yet the place establishes an interest in people s hearts go where they will they find no city of the same distinction go where they will they take a pride in their old home Venice it has been said differs from all other cities in the sentiment which she inspires The rest may have admirers she only a famous fair one counts lovers in her train And indeed even by her kindest friends Edinburgh is not considered in a similar sense These like her for many reasons not any one of which is satisfactory in itself They like her whimsically if you will and somewhat as a virtuoso dotes upon his cabinet Her attraction is romantic in the narrowest meaning of the term Beautiful as she is she is not so much beautiful as interesting She is pre eminently Gothic and all the more so since she has set herself off with some Greek airs and erected classic temples on her crags In a word and above all she is a curiosity The Palace of Holyrood has been left aside in the growth of Edinburgh and stands grey and silent in a workman s quarter and among breweries and gas works It is a house of many memories Great people of yore kings and queens buffoons and grave ambassadors played their stately farce for centuries in Holyrood Wars have been plotted dancing has lasted deep into the night murder has been done in its chambers There Prince Charlie held his phantom levees and in a very gallant manner represented a fallen dynasty for some hours Now all these things of clay are mingled with the dust the king s crown itself is shown for sixpence to the vulgar but the stone palace has outlived these changes For fifty weeks together it is no more than a show for tourists and a museum of old furniture but on the fifty first behold the palace reawakened and mimicking its past The Lord Commissioner a kind of stage sovereign sits among stage courtiers a coach and six and clattering escort come and go before the gate at night the windows are lighted up and its near neighbours the workmen may dance in their own houses to the palace music And in this the palace is typical There is a spark among the embers from time to time the old volcano smokes Edinburgh has but partly abdicated and still wears in parody her metropolitan trappings Half a capital and half a country town the whole city leads a double existence it has long trances of the one and flashes of the other like the king of the Black Isles it is half alive and half a monumental marble There are armed men and cannon in the citadel overhead you may see the troops Marshalled on the high parade and at night after the early winter evenfall and in the morning before the laggard winter dawn the wind carries abroad over Edinburgh the sound of drums and bugles Grave judges sit bewigged in what was once the scene of imperial deliberations Close by in the High Street perhaps the trumpets may sound about the stroke of noon and you see a troop of citizens in tawdry masquerade tabard above heather mixture trouser below and the men themselves trudging in the mud among unsympathetic bystanders The grooms of a well appointed circus tread the streets with a better presence And yet these are the Heralds and Pursuivants of Scotland who are about to proclaim a new law of the United Kingdom before two score boys and thieves and hackney coachmen Meanwhile every hour the bell of the University rings out over the hum of the streets and every hour a double tide of students coming and going fills the deep archways And lastly one night in the spring time or say one morning rather at the peep of day late folk may hear the voices of many men singing a psalm in unison from a church on one side of the old High Street and a little after or perhaps a little before the sound of many men singing a psalm in unison from another church on the opposite side of the way There will be something in the words about the dew of Hermon and how goodly it is to see brethren dwelling together in unity And the late folk will tell themselves that all this singing denotes the conclusion of two yearly ecclesiastical parliaments the parliaments of Churches which are brothers in many admirable virtues but not specially like brothers in this particular of a tolerant and peaceful life Again meditative people will find a charm in a certain consonancy between the aspect of the city and its odd and stirring history Few places if any offer a more barbaric display of contrasts to the eye In the very midst stands one of the most satisfactory crags in nature a Bass Rock upon dry land rooted in a garden shaken by passing trains carrying a crown of battlements and turrets and describing its warlike shadow over the liveliest and brightest thoroughfare of the new town From their smoky beehives ten stories high the unwashed look down upon the open squares and gardens of the wealthy and gay people sunning themselves along Princes Street with its mile of commercial palaces all beflagged upon some great occasion see across a gardened valley set with statues where the washings of the old town flutter in the breeze at its high windows And then upon all sides what a clashing of architecture In this one valley where the life of the town goes most busily forward there may be seen shown one above and behind another by the accidents of the ground buildings in almost every style upon the globe Egyptian and Greek temples Venetian palaces and Gothic spires are huddled one over another in a most admired disorder while above all the brute mass of the Castle and the summit of Arthur s Seat look down upon these imitations with a becoming dignity as the works of Nature may look down upon the monuments of Art But Nature is a more indiscriminate patroness than we imagine and in no way frightened of a strong effect The birds roost as willingly among the Corinthian capitals as in the crannies of the crag the same atmosphere and daylight close the eternal rock and yesterday s imitation portico and as the soft northern sunshine throws out everything into a glorified distinctness or easterly mists coming up with the blue evening fuse all these incongruous features into one and the lamps begin to glitter along the street and faint lights to burn in the high windows across the valley the feeling grows upon you that this also is a piece of nature in the most intimate sense that this profusion of eccentricities this dream in masonry and living rock is not a drop scene in a theatre but a city in the world of every day reality connected by railway and telegraph wire with all the capitals of Europe and inhabited by citizens of the familiar type who keep ledgers and attend church and have sold their immortal portion to a daily paper By all the canons of romance the place demands to be half deserted and leaning towards decay birds we might admit in profusion the play of the sun and winds and a few gypsies encamped in the chief thoroughfare but these citizens with their cabs and tramways their trains and posters are altogether out of key Chartered tourists they make free with historic localities and rear their young among the most picturesque sites with a grand human indifference To see them thronging by in their neat clothes and conscious moral rectitude and with a little air of possession that verges on the absurd is not the least striking feature of the place one And the story of the town is as eccentric as its appearance For centuries it was a capital thatched with heather and more than once in the evil days of English invasion it has gone up in flame to heaven a beacon to ships at sea It was the jousting ground of jealous nobles not only on Greenside or by the King s Stables where set tournaments were fought to the sound of trumpets and under the authority of the royal presence but in every alley where there was room to cross swords and in the main street where popular tumult under the Blue Blanket alternated with the brawls of outlandish clansmen and retainers Down in the Palace John Knox reproved his queen in the accents of modern democracy In the town in one of those little shops plastered like so many swallows nests among the buttresses of the old Cathedral that familiar autocrat James VI would gladly share a bottle of wine with George Heriot the goldsmith Up on the Pentland Hills that so quietly look down on the Castle with the city lying in waves around it those mad and dismal fanatics the Sweet Singers haggard from long exposure on the moors sat day and night with tearful psalms to see Edinburgh consumed with fire from heaven like another Sodom or Gomorrah There in the Grassmarket stiff necked covenanting heroes offered up the often unnecessary but not less honourable sacrifice of their lives and bade eloquent farewell to sun moon and stars and earthly friendships or died silent to the roll of drums Down by yon outlet rode Grahame of Claverhouse and his thirty dragoons with the town beating to arms behind their horses tails a sorry handful thus riding for their lives but with a man at the head who was to return in a different temper make a dash that staggered Scotland to the heart and die happily in the thick of fight There Aikenhead was hanged for a piece of boyish incredulity there a few years afterwards David Hume ruined Philosophy and Faith an undisturbed and well reputed citizen and thither in yet a few years more Burns came from the plough tail as to an academy of gilt unbelief and artificial letters There when the great exodus was made across the valley and the new town began to spread abroad its draughty parallelograms and rear its long frontage on the opposing hill there was such a flitting such a change of domicile and dweller as was never excelled in the history of cities the cobbler succeeded the earl the beggar ensconced himself by the judge s chimney what had been a palace was used as a pauper refuge and great mansions were so parceled out among the least and lowest in society that the hearth stone of the old proprietor was thought large enough to be partitioned off into a bedroom by the new one These sentences have I hear given offence in my native town and a proportionable pleasure to our rivals of Glasgow I confess the news caused me both pain and merriment May I remark as a balm for wounded fellow townsmen that there is nothing deadly in my accusations Small blame to them if they keep ledgers tis an excellent business habit Church going is not that ever I heard a subject of reproach decency of linen is a mark of prosperous affairs and conscious moral rectitude one of the tokens of good living It is not their fault if the city calls for something more specious by the way of inhabitants A man in a frock coat looks out of place upon an Alp or Pyramid although he has the virtues of a Peabody and the talents of a Bentham And let them console themselves they do as well as anybody else the population of let us say Chicago would cut quite as rueful a figure on the same romantic stage To the Glasgow people I would say only one word but that is of gold I have not yet written a book about Glasgow CHAPTER II OLD TOWN THE LANDS The Old Town it is pretended is the chief characteristic and from a picturesque point of view the liver wing of Edinburgh It is one of the most common forms of depreciation to throw cold water on the whole by adroit over commendation of a part since everything worth judging whether it be a man a work of art or only a fine city must be judged upon its merits as a whole The Old Town depends for much of its effect on the new quarters that lie around it on the sufficiency of its situation and on the hills that back it up If you were to set it somewhere else by itself it would look remarkably like Stirling in a bolder and loftier edition The point is to see this embellished Stirling planted in the midst of a large active and fantastic modern city for there the two react in a picturesque sense and the one is the making of the other The Old Town occupies a sloping ridge or tail of diluvial matter protected in some subsidence of the waters by the Castle cliffs which fortify it to the west On the one side of it and the other the new towns of the south and of the north occupy their lower broader and more gentle hill tops Thus the quarter of the Castle overtops the whole city and keeps an open view to sea and land It dominates for miles on every side and people on the decks of ships or ploughing in quiet country places over in Fife can see the banner on the Castle battlements and the smoke of the Old Town blowing abroad over the subjacent country A city that is set upon a hill It was I suppose from this distant aspect that she got her nickname of Auld Reekie Perhaps it was given her by people who had never crossed her doors day after day from their various rustic Pisgahs they had seen the pile of building on the hill top and the long plume of smoke over the plain so it appeared to them so it had appeared to their fathers tilling the same field and as that was all they knew of the place it could be all expressed in these two words Indeed even on a nearer view the Old Town is properly smoked and though it is well washed with rain all the year round it has a grim and sooty aspect among its younger suburbs It grew under the law that regulates the growth of walled cities in precarious situations not in extent but in height and density Public buildings were forced wherever there was room for them into the midst of thoroughfares thoroughfares were diminished into lanes houses sprang up story after story neighbour mounting upon neighbour s shoulder as in some Black Hole of Calcutta until the population slept fourteen or fifteen deep in a vertical direction The tallest of these lands as they are locally termed have long since been burnt out but to this day it is not uncommon to see eight or ten windows at a flight and the cliff of building which hangs imminent over Waverley Bridge would still put many natural precipices to shame The cellars are already high above the gazer s head planted on the steep hillside as for the garret all the furniture may be in the pawnshop but it commands a famous prospect to the Highland hills The poor man may roost up there in the centre of Edinburgh and yet have a peep of the green country from his window he shall see the quarters of the well to do fathoms underneath with their broad squares and gardens he shall have nothing overhead but a few spires the stone top gallants of the city and perhaps the wind may reach him with a rustic pureness and bring a smack of the sea or of flowering lilacs in the spring It is almost the correct literary sentiment to deplore the revolutionary improvements of mister Chambers and his following It is easy to be a conservator of the discomforts of others indeed it is only our good qualities we find it irksome to conserve Assuredly in driving streets through the black labyrinth a few curious old corners have been swept away and some associations turned out of house and home But what slices of sunlight what breaths of clean air have been let in And what a picturesque world remains untouched You go under dark arches and down dark stairs and alleys The way is so narrow that you can lay a hand on either wall so steep that in greasy winter weather the pavement is almost as treacherous as ice Washing dangles above washing from the windows the houses bulge outwards upon flimsy brackets you see a bit of sculpture in a dark corner at the top of all a gable and a few crowsteps are printed on the sky Here you come into a court where the children are at play and the grown people sit upon their doorsteps and perhaps a church spire shows itself above the roofs Here in the narrowest of the entry you find a great old mansion still erect with some insignia of its former state some scutcheon some holy or courageous motto on the lintel The local antiquary points out where famous and well born people had their lodging and as you look up out pops the head of a slatternly woman from the countess s window The Bedouins camp within Pharaoh s palace walls and the old war ship is given over to the rats We are already a far way from the days when powdered heads were plentiful in these alleys with jolly port wine faces underneath Even in the chief thoroughfares Irish washings flutter at the windows and the pavements are encumbered with loiterers These loiterers are a true character of the scene Some shrewd Scotch workmen may have paused on their way to a job debating Church affairs and politics with their tools upon their arm But the most part are of a different order skulking jail birds unkempt barefoot children big mouthed robust women in a sort of uniform of striped flannel petticoat and short tartan shawl among these a few supervising constables and a dismal sprinkling of mutineers and broken men from higher ranks in society with some mark of better days upon them like a brand In a place no larger than Edinburgh and where the traffic is mostly centred in five or six chief streets the same face comes often under the notice of an idle stroller In fact from this point of view Edinburgh is not so much a small city as the largest of small towns It is scarce possible to avoid observing your neighbours and I never yet heard of any one who tried It has been my fortune in this anonymous accidental way to watch more than one of these downward travellers for some stages on the road to ruin One man must have been upwards of sixty before I first observed him and he made then a decent personable figure in broadcloth of the best For three years he kept falling grease coming and buttons going from the square skirted coat the face puffing and pimpling the shoulders growing bowed the hair falling scant and grey upon his head and the last that ever I saw of him he was standing at the mouth of an entry with several men in moleskin three parts drunk and his old black raiment daubed with mud I fancy that I still can hear him laugh There was something heart breaking in this gradual declension at so advanced an age you would have thought a man of sixty out of the reach of these calamities you would have thought that he was niched by that time into a safe place in life whence he could pass quietly and honourably into the grave One of the earliest marks of these degringolades is that the victim begins to disappear from the New Town thoroughfares and takes to the High Street like a wounded animal to the woods And such an one is the type of the quarter It also has fallen socially A scutcheon over the door somewhat jars in sentiment where there is a washing at every window The old man when I saw him last wore the coat in which he had played the gentleman three years before and that was just what gave him so pre eminent an air of wretchedness It is true that the over population was at least as dense in the epoch of lords and ladies and that nowadays some customs which made Edinburgh notorious of yore have been fortunately pretermitted But an aggregation of comfort is not distasteful like an aggregation of the reverse Nobody cares how many lords and ladies and divines and lawyers may have been crowded into these houses in the past perhaps the more the merrier The glasses clink around the china punch bowl some one touches the virginals there are peacocks feathers on the chimney and the tapers burn clear and pale in the red firelight That is not an ugly picture in itself nor will it become ugly upon repetition All the better if the like were going on in every second room the land would only look the more inviting Times are changed In one house perhaps twoscore families herd together and perhaps not one of them is wholly out of the reach of want The great hotel is given over to discomfort from the foundation to the chimney tops everywhere a pinching narrow habit scanty meals and an air of sluttishness and dirt In the first room there is a birth in another a death in a third a sordid drinking bout and the detective and the Bible reader cross upon the stairs High words are audible from dwelling to dwelling and children have a strange experience from the first only a robust soul you would think could grow up in such conditions without hurt And even if God tempers His dispensations to the young and all the ill does not arise that our apprehensions may forecast the sight of such a way of living is disquieting to people who are more happily circumstanced Social inequality is nowhere more ostentatious than at Edinburgh I have mentioned already how to the stroller along Princes Street the High Street callously exhibits its back garrets It is true there is a garden between And although nothing could be more glaring by way of contrast sometimes the opposition is more immediate sometimes the thing lies in a nutshell and there is not so much as a blade of grass between the rich and poor To look over the South Bridge and see the Cowgate below full of crying hawkers is to view one rank of society from another in the twinkling of an eye One night I went along the Cowgate after every one was abed but the policeman and stopped by hazard before a tall land The moon touched upon its chimneys and shone blankly on the upper windows there was no light anywhere in the great bulk of building but as I stood there it seemed to me that I could hear quite a body of quiet sounds from the interior doubtless there were many clocks ticking and people snoring on their backs And thus as I fancied the dense life within made itself faintly audible in my ears family after family contributing its quota to the general hum and the whole pile beating in tune to its time pieces like a great disordered heart Perhaps it was little more than a fancy altogether but it was strangely impressive at the time and gave me an imaginative measure of the disproportion between the quantity of living flesh and the trifling walls that separated and contained it There was nothing fanciful at least but every circumstance of terror and reality in the fall of the land in the High Street The building had grown rotten to the core the entry underneath had suddenly closed up so that the scavenger s barrow could not pass cracks and reverberations sounded through the house at night the inhabitants of the huge old human bee hive discussed their peril when they encountered on the stair some had even left their dwellings in a panic of fear and returned to them again in a fit of economy or self respect when in the black hours of a Sunday morning the whole structure ran together with a hideous uproar and tumbled story upon story to the ground The physical shock was felt far and near and the moral shock travelled with the morning milkmaid into all the suburbs The church bells never sounded more dismally over Edinburgh than that grey forenoon Death had made a brave harvest and like Samson by pulling down one roof destroyed many a home None who saw it can have forgotten the aspect of the gable here it was plastered there papered according to the rooms here the kettle still stood on the hob high overhead and there a cheap picture of the Queen was pasted over the chimney So by this disaster you had a glimpse into the life of thirty families all suddenly cut off from the revolving years The land had fallen and with the land how much Far in the country people saw a gap in the city ranks and the sun looked through between the chimneys in an unwonted place And all over the world in London in Canada in New Zealand fancy what a multitude of people could exclaim with truth The house that I was born in fell last night CHAPTER III THE PARLIAMENT CLOSE Time has wrought its changes most notably around the precinct of saint Giles s Church The church itself if it were not for the spire would be unrecognizable the Krames are all gone not a shop is left to shelter in its buttresses and zealous magistrates and a misguided architect have shorn the design of manhood and left it poor naked and pitifully pretentious As saint Giles s must have had in former days a rich and quaint appearance now forgotten so the neighbourhood was bustling sunless and romantic It was here that the town was most overbuilt but the overbuilding has been all rooted out and not only a free fairway left along the High Street with an open space on either side of the church but a great porthole knocked in the main line of the lands gives an outlook to the north and the New Town There is a silly story of a subterranean passage between the Castle and Holyrood and a bold Highland piper who volunteered to explore its windings He made his entrance by the upper end playing a strathspey the curious footed it after him down the street following his descent by the sound of the chanter from below until all of a sudden about the level of saint Giles s the music came abruptly to an end and the people in the street stood at fault with hands uplifted Whether he was choked with gases or perished in a quag or was removed bodily by the Evil One remains a point of doubt but the piper has never again been seen or heard of from that day to this Perhaps he wandered down into the land of Thomas the Rhymer and some day when it is least expected may take a thought to revisit the sunlit upper world That will be a strange moment for the cabmen on the stance beside saint Giles s when they hear the drone of his pipes reascending from the bowels of the earth below their horses feet But it is not only pipers who have vanished many a solid bulk of masonry has been likewise spirited into the air Here for example is the shape of a heart let into the causeway This was the site of the Tolbooth the Heart of Midlothian a place old in story and name father to a noble book The walls are now down in the dust there is no more squalor carceris for merry debtors no more cage for the old acknowledged prison breaker but the sun and the wind play freely over the foundations of the jail Nor is this the only memorial that the pavement keeps of former days The ancient burying ground of Edinburgh lay behind saint Giles s Church running downhill to the Cowgate and covering the site of the present Parliament House It has disappeared as utterly as the prison or the Luckenbooths and for those ignorant of its history I know only one token that remains In the Parliament Close trodden daily underfoot by advocates two letters and a date mark the resting place of the man who made Scotland over again in his own image the indefatigable undissuadable John Knox He sleeps within call of the church that so often echoed to his preaching Hard by the reformer a bandy legged and garlanded Charles Second made of lead bestrides a tun bellied charger The King has his back turned and as you look seems to be trotting clumsily away from such a dangerous neighbour Often for hours together these two will be alone in the close for it lies out of the way of all but legal traffic On one side the south wall of the church on the other the arcades of the Parliament House inclose this irregular bight of causeway and describe their shadows on it in the sun At either end from round saint Giles s buttresses you command a look into the High Street with its motley passengers but the stream goes by east and west and leaves the Parliament Close to Charles the Second and the birds Once in a while a patient crowd may be seen loitering there all day some eating fruit some reading a newspaper and to judge by their quiet demeanour you would think they were waiting for a distribution of soup tickets The fact is far otherwise within in the Justiciary Court a man is upon trial for his life and these are some of the curious for whom the gallery was found too narrow Towards afternoon if the prisoner is unpopular there will be a round of hisses when he is brought forth Once in a while too an advocate in wig and gown hand upon mouth full of pregnant nods sweeps to and fro in the arcade listening to an agent and at certain regular hours a whole tide of lawyers hurries across the space The Parliament Close has been the scene of marking incidents in Scottish history Thus when the Bishops were ejected from the Convention in sixteen eighty eight all fourteen of them gathered together with pale faces and stood in a cloud in the Parliament Close poor episcopal personages who were done with fair weather for life Some of the west country Societarians standing by who would have rejoiced more than in great sums to be at their hanging hustled them so rudely that they knocked their heads together It was not magnanimous behaviour to dethroned enemies but one at least of the Societarians had groaned in the boots and they had all seen their dear friends upon the scaffold Again at the woeful Union it was here that people crowded to escort their favourite from the last of Scottish parliaments people flushed with nationality as Boswell would have said ready for riotous acts and fresh from throwing stones at the author of Robinson Crusoe as he looked out of window One of the pious in the seventeenth century going to pass his trials examinations as we now say for the Scottish Bar beheld the Parliament Close open and had a vision of the mouth of Hell This and small wonder was the means of his conversion Nor was the vision unsuitable to the locality for after an hospital what uglier piece is there in civilization than a court of law Hither come envy malice and all uncharitableness to wrestle it out in public tourney crimes broken fortunes severed households the knave and his victim gravitate to this low building with the arcade To how many has not saint Giles s bell told the first hour after ruin I think I see them pause to count the strokes and wander on again into the moving High Street stunned and sick at heart A pair of swing doors gives admittance to a hall with a carved roof hung with legal portraits adorned with legal statuary lighted by windows of painted glass and warmed by three vast fires This the Salle des pas perdus of the Scottish Bar Here by a ferocious custom idle youths must promenade from ten till two From end to end singly or in pairs or trios the gowns and wigs go back and forward Through a hum of talk and footfalls the piping tones of a Macer announce a fresh cause and call upon the names of those concerned Intelligent men have been walking here daily for ten or twenty years without a rag of business or a shilling of reward In process of time they may perhaps be made the Sheriff Substitute and Fountain of Justice at Lerwick or Tobermory There is nothing required you would say but a little patience and a taste for exercise and bad air To breathe dust and bombazine to feed the mind on cackling gossip to hear three parts of a case and drink a glass of sherry to long with indescribable longings for the hour when a man may slip out of his travesty and devote himself to golf for the rest of the afternoon and to do this day by day and year after year may seem so small a thing to the inexperienced But those who have made the experiment are of a different way of thinking and count it the most arduous form of idleness More swing doors open into pigeon holes where Judges of the First Appeal sit singly and halls of audience where the supreme Lords sit by three or four Here you may see Scott s place within the bar where he wrote many a page of Waverley novels to the drone of judicial proceeding You will hear a good deal of shrewdness and as their Lordships do not altogether disdain pleasantry a fair proportion of dry fun The broadest of broad Scotch is now banished from the bench but the courts still retain a certain national flavour We have a solemn enjoyable way of lingering on a case We treat law as a fine art and relish and digest a good distinction There is no hurry point after point must be rightly examined and reduced to principle judge after judge must utter forth his obiter dicta to delighted brethren Besides the courts there are installed under the same roof no less than three libraries two of no mean order confused and semi subterranean full of stairs and galleries where you may see the most studious looking wigs fishing out novels by lantern light in the very place where the old Privy Council tortured Covenanters As the Parliament House is built upon a slope although it presents only one story to the north it measures half a dozen at least upon the south and range after range of vaults extend below the libraries Few places are more characteristic of this hilly capital You descend one stone stair after another and wander by the flicker of a match in a labyrinth of stone cellars Now you pass below the Outer Hall and hear overhead brisk but ghostly the interminable pattering of legal feet Now you come upon a strong door with a wicket on the other side are the cells of the police office and the trap stair that gives admittance to the dock in the Justiciary Court Many a foot that has gone up there lightly enough has been dead heavy in the descent Many a man s life has been argued away from him during long hours in the court above But just now that tragic stage is empty and silent like a church on a week day with the bench all sheeted up and nothing moving but the sunbeams on the wall A little farther and you strike upon a room not empty like the rest but crowded with productions from bygone criminal cases a grim lumber lethal weapons poisoned organs in a jar a door with a shot hole through the panel behind which a man fell dead I cannot fancy why they should preserve them unless it were against the Judgment Day At length as you continue to descend you see a peep of yellow gaslight and hear a jostling whispering noise ahead next moment you turn a corner and there in a whitewashed passage is a machinery belt industriously turning on its wheels You would think the engine had grown there of its own accord like a cellar fungus and would soon spin itself out and fill the vaults from end to end with its mysterious labours In truth it is only some gear of the steam ventilator and you will find the engineers at hand and may step out of their door into the sunlight For all this while you have not been descending towards the earth s centre but only to the bottom of the hill and the foundations of the Parliament House low down to be sure but still under the open heaven and in a field of grass The daylight shines garishly on the back windows of the Irish quarter on broken shutters wry gables old palsied houses on the brink of ruin a crumbling human pig sty fit for human pigs There are few signs of life besides a scanty washing or a face at a window the dwellers are abroad but they will return at night and stagger to their pallets CHAPTER IV LEGENDS The character of a place is often most perfectly expressed in its associations An event strikes root and grows into a legend when it has happened amongst congenial surroundings Ugly actions above all in ugly places have the true romantic quality and become an undying property of their scene To a man like Scott the different appearances of nature seemed each to contain its own legend ready made which it was his to call forth in such or such a place only such or such events ought with propriety to happen and in this spirit he made the Lady of the Lake for Ben Venue the Heart of Midlothian for Edinburgh and the Pirate so indifferently written but so romantically conceived for the desolate islands and roaring tideways of the North The common run of mankind have from generation to generation an instinct almost as delicate as that of Scott but where he created new things they only forget what is unsuitable among the old and by survival of the fittest a body of tradition becomes a work of art So in the low dens and high flying garrets of Edinburgh people may go back upon dark passages in the town s adventures and chill their marrow with winter s tales about the fire tales that are singularly apposite and characteristic not only of the old life but of the very constitution of built nature in that part and singularly well qualified to add horror to horror when the wind pipes around the tall lands and hoots adown arched passages and the far spread wilderness of city lamps keeps quavering and flaring in the gusts Here it is the tale of Begbie the bank porter stricken to the heart at a blow and left in his blood within a step or two of the crowded High Street There people hush their voices over Burke and Hare over drugs and violated graves and the resurrection men smothering their victims with their knees Here again the fame of Deacon Brodie is kept piously fresh A great man in his day was the Deacon well seen in good society crafty with his hands as a cabinet maker and one who could sing a song with taste Many a citizen was proud to welcome the Deacon to supper and dismissed him with regret at a timeous hour who would have been vastly disconcerted had he known how soon and in what guise his visitor returned Many stories are told of this redoubtable Edinburgh burglar but the one I have in my mind most vividly gives the key of all the rest A friend of Brodie s nested some way towards heaven in one of these great lands had told him of a projected visit to the country and afterwards detained by some affairs put it off and stayed the night in town The good man had lain some time awake it was far on in the small hours by the Tron bell when suddenly there came a creak a jar a faint light Softly he clambered out of bed and up to a false window which looked upon another room and there by the glimmer of a thieves lantern was his good friend the Deacon in a mask It is characteristic of the town and the town s manners that this little episode should have been quietly tided over and quite a good time elapsed before a great robbery an escape a Bow Street runner a cock fight an apprehension in a cupboard in Amsterdam and a last step into the air off his own greatly improved gallows drop brought the career of Deacon William Brodie to an end But still by the mind s eye he may be seen a man harassed below a mountain of duplicity slinking from a magistrate s supper room to a thieves ken and pickeering among the closes by the flicker of a dark lamp Or where the Deacon is out of favour perhaps some memory lingers of the great plagues and of fatal houses still unsafe to enter within the memory of man For in time of pestilence the discipline had been sharp and sudden and what we now call stamping out contagion was carried on with deadly rigour The officials in their gowns of grey with a white saint Andrew s cross on back and breast and white cloth carried before them on a staff perambulated the city adding the terror of man s justice to the fear of God s visitation The dead they buried on the Borough Muir the living who had concealed the sickness were drowned if they were women in the Quarry Holes and if they were men were hanged and gibbeted at their own doors and wherever the evil had passed furniture was destroyed and houses closed And the most bogeyish part of the story is about such houses Two generations back they still stood dark and empty people avoided them as they passed by the boldest schoolboy only shouted through the key hole and made off for within it was supposed the plague lay ambushed like a basilisk ready to flow forth and spread blain and pustule through the city What a terrible next door neighbour for superstitious citizens A rat scampering within would send a shudder through the stoutest heart Here if you like was a sanitary parable addressed by our uncleanly forefathers to their own neglect And then we have Major Weir for although even his house is now demolished old Edinburgh cannot clear herself of his unholy memory He and his sister lived together in an odour of sour piety She was a marvelous spinster he had a rare gift of supplication and was known among devout admirers by the name of Angelical Thomas He was a tall black man and ordinarily looked down to the ground a grim countenance and a big nose His garb was still a cloak and somewhat dark and he never went without his staff How it came about that Angelical Thomas was burned in company with his staff and his sister in gentler manner hanged and whether these two were simply religious maniacs of the more furious order or had real as well as imaginary sins upon their old world shoulders are points happily beyond the reach of our intention At least it is suitable enough that out of this superstitious city some such example should have been put forth the outcome and fine flower of dark and vehement religion And at least the facts struck the public fancy and brought forth a remarkable family of myths It would appear that the Major s staff went upon his errands and even ran before him with a lantern on dark nights Gigantic females stentoriously laughing and gaping with tehees of laughter at unseasonable hours of night and morning haunted the purlieus of his abode His house fell under such a load of infamy that no one dared to sleep in it until municipal improvement leveled the structure with the ground And my father has often been told in the nursery how the devil s coach drawn by six coal black horses with fiery eyes would drive at night into the West Bow and belated people might see the dead Major through the glasses Another legend is that of the two maiden sisters A legend I am afraid it may be in the most discreditable meaning of the term or perhaps something worse a mere yesterday s fiction But it is a story of some vitality and is worthy of a place in the Edinburgh kalendar This pair inhabited a single room from the facts it must have been double bedded and it may have been of some dimensions but when all is said it was a single room Here our two spinsters fell out on some point of controversial divinity belike but fell out so bitterly that there was never a word spoken between them black or white from that day forward You would have thought they would separate but no whether from lack of means or the Scottish fear of scandal they continued to keep house together where they were A chalk line drawn upon the floor separated their two domains it bisected the doorway and the fireplace so that each could go out and in and do her cooking without violating the territory of the other So for years they company existed in a hateful silence their meals their ablutions their friendly visitors exposed to an unfriendly scrutiny and at night in the dark watches each could hear the breathing of her enemy Never did four walls look down upon an uglier spectacle than these sisters rivaling in unsisterliness Here is a canvas for Hawthorne to have turned into a cabinet picture he had a Puritanic vein which would have fitted him to treat this Puritanic horror he could have shown them to us in their sicknesses and at their hideous twin devotions thumbing a pair of great Bibles or praying aloud for each other s penitence with marrowy emphasis now each with kilted petticoat at her own corner of the fire on some tempestuous evening now sitting each at her window looking out upon the summer landscape sloping far below them towards the firth and the field paths where they had wandered hand in hand or as age and infirmity grew upon them and prolonged their toilettes and their hands began to tremble and their heads to nod involuntarily growing only the more steeled in enmity with years until one fine day at a word a look a visit or the approach of death their hearts would melt and the chalk boundary be overstepped for ever Alas to those who know the ecclesiastical history of the race the most perverse and melancholy in man s annals this will seem only a figure of much that is typical of Scotland and her high seated capital above the Forth a figure so grimly realistic that it may pass with strangers for a caricature We are wonderful patient haters for conscience sake up here in the North I spoke in the first of these papers of the Parliaments of the Established and Free Churches and how they can hear each other singing psalms across the street There is but a street between them in space but a shadow between them in principle and yet there they sit enchanted and in damnatory accents pray for each other s growth in grace It would be well if there were no more than two but the sects in Scotland form a large family of sisters and the chalk lines are thickly drawn and run through the midst of many private homes Edinburgh is a city of churches as though it were a place of pilgrimage You will see four within a stone cast at the head of the West Bow Some are crowded to the doors some are empty like monuments and yet you will ever find new ones in the building Hence that surprising clamour of church bells that suddenly breaks out upon the Sabbath morning from Trinity and the sea skirts to Morningside on the borders of the hills I have heard the chimes of Oxford playing their symphony in a golden autumn morning and beautiful it was to hear But in Edinburgh all manner of loud bells join or rather disjoin in one swelling brutal babblement of noise Now one overtakes another and now lags behind it now five or six all strike on the pained tympanum at the same punctual instant of time and make together a dismal chord of discord and now for a second all seem to have conspired to hold their peace Indeed there are not many uproars in this world more dismal than that of the Sabbath bells in Edinburgh a harsh ecclesiastical tocsin the outcry of incongruous orthodoxies calling on every separate conventicler to put up a protest each in his own synagogue against right hand extremes and left hand defections And surely there are few worse extremes than this extremity of zeal and few more deplorable defections than this disloyalty to Christian love Shakespeare wrote a comedy of Much Ado about Nothing The Scottish nation made a fantastic tragedy on the same subject And it is for the success of this remarkable piece that these bells are sounded every Sabbath morning on the hills above the Forth How many of them might rest silent in the steeple how many of these ugly churches might be demolished and turned once more into useful building material if people who think almost exactly the same thoughts about religion would condescend to worship God under the same roof But there are the chalk lines And which is to pocket pride and speak the foremost word CHAPTER V GREYFRIARS It was Queen Mary who threw open the gardens of the Grey Friars a new and semi rural cemetery in those days although it has grown an antiquity in its turn and been superseded by half a dozen others The Friars must have had a pleasant time on summer evenings for their gardens were situated to a wish with the tall Castle and the tallest of the Castle crags in front Even now it is one of our famous Edinburgh points of view and strangers are led thither to see by yet another instance how strangely the city lies upon her hills The enclosure is of an irregular shape the double church of Old and New Greyfriars stands on the level at the top a few thorns are dotted here and there and the ground falls by terrace and steep slope towards the north The open shows many slabs and table tombstones and all round the margin the place is girt by an array of aristocratic mausoleums appallingly adorned Setting aside the tombs of Roubilliac which belong to the heroic order of graveyard art we Scotch stand to my fancy highest among nations in the matter of grimly illustrating death We seem to love for their own sake the emblems of time and the great change and even around country churches you will find a wonderful exhibition of skulls and crossbones and noseless angels and trumpets pealing for the Judgment Day Every mason was a pedestrian Holbein he had a deep consciousness of death and loved to put its terrors pithily before the churchyard loiterer he was brimful of rough hints upon mortality and any dead farmer was seized upon to be a text The classical examples of this art are in Greyfriars In their time these were doubtless costly monuments and reckoned of a very elegant proportion by contemporaries and now when the elegance is not so apparent the significance remains You may perhaps look with a smile on the profusion of Latin mottoes some crawling endwise up the shaft of a pillar some issuing on a scroll from angels trumpets on the emblematic horrors the figures rising headless from the grave and all the traditional ingenuities in which it pleased our fathers to set forth their sorrow for the dead and their sense of earthly mutability But it is not a hearty sort of mirth Each ornament may have been executed by the merriest apprentice whistling as he plied the mallet but the original meaning of each and the combined effect of so many of them in this quiet enclosure is serious to the point of melancholy Round a great part of the circuit houses of a low class present their backs to the churchyard Only a few inches separate the living from the dead Here a window is partly blocked up by the pediment of a tomb there where the street falls far below the level of the graves a chimney has been trained up the back of a monument and a red pot looks vulgarly over from behind A damp smell of the graveyard finds its way into houses where workmen sit at meat Domestic life on a small scale goes forward visibly at the windows The very solitude and stillness of the enclosure which lies apart from the town s traffic serves to accentuate the contrast As you walk upon the graves you see children scattering crumbs to feed the sparrows you hear people singing or washing dishes or the sound of tears and castigation the linen on a clothes pole flaps against funereal sculpture or perhaps the cat slips over the lintel and descends on a memorial urn And as there is nothing else astir these incongruous sights and noises take hold on the attention and exaggerate the sadness of the place Greyfriars is continually overrun by cats I have seen one afternoon as many as thirteen of them seated on the grass beside old Milne the Master Builder all sleek and fat and complacently blinking as if they had fed upon strange meats Old Milne was chanting with the saints as we may hope and cared little for the company about his grave but I confess the spectacle had an ugly side for me and I was glad to step forward and raise my eyes to where the Castle and the roofs of the Old Town and the spire of the Assembly Hall stood deployed against the sky with the colourless precision of engraving An open outlook is to be desired from a churchyard and a sight of the sky and some of the world s beauty relieves a mind from morbid thoughts I shall never forget one visit It was a grey dropping day the grass was strung with rain drops and the people in the houses kept hanging out their shirts and petticoats and angrily taking them in again as the weather turned from wet to fair and back again A gravedigger and a friend of his a gardener from the country accompanied me into one after another of the cells and little courtyards in which it gratified the wealthy of old days to enclose their old bones from neighbourhood In one under a sort of shrine we found a forlorn human effigy very realistically executed down to the detail of his ribbed stockings and holding in his hand a ticket with the date of his demise He looked most pitiful and ridiculous shut up by himself in his aristocratic precinct like a bad old boy or an inferior forgotten deity under a new dispensation the burdocks grew familiarly about his feet the rain dripped all round him and the world maintained the most entire indifference as to who he was or whither he had gone In another a vaulted tomb handsome externally but horrible inside with damp and cobwebs there were three mounds of black earth and an uncovered thigh bone This was the place of interment it appeared of a family with whom the gardener had been long in service He was among old acquaintances This ll be Miss Marg et s said he giving the bone a friendly kick The auld I have always an uncomfortable feeling in a graveyard at sight of so many tombs to perpetuate memories best forgotten but I never had the impression so strongly as that day People had been at some expense in both these cases to provoke a melancholy feeling of derision in the one and an insulting epithet in the other The proper inscription for the most part of mankind I began to think is the cynical jeer cras tibi That if anything will stop the mouth of a carper since it both admits the worst and carries the war triumphantly into the enemy s camp Greyfriars is a place of many associations There was one window in a house at the lower end now demolished which was pointed out to me by the gravedigger as a spot of legendary interest Burke the resurrection man infamous for so many murders at five shillings a head used to sit thereat with pipe and nightcap to watch burials going forward on the green In a tomb higher up which must then have been but newly finished John Knox according to the same informant had taken refuge in a turmoil of the Reformation Behind the church is the haunted mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie Bloody Mackenzie Lord Advocate in the Covenanting troubles and author of some pleasing sentiments on toleration Here in the last century an old Heriot s Hospital boy once harboured from the pursuit of the police The Hospital is next door to Greyfriars a courtly building among lawns where on Founder s Day you may see a multitude of children playing Kiss in the Ring and Round the Mulberry bush Thus when the fugitive had managed to conceal himself in the tomb his old schoolmates had a hundred opportunities to bring him food and there he lay in safety till a ship was found to smuggle him abroad But his must have been indeed a heart of brass to lie all day and night alone with the dead persecutor and other lads were far from emulating him in courage When a man s soul is certainly in hell his body will scarce lie quiet in a tomb however costly some time or other the door must open and the reprobate come forth in the abhorred garments of the grave It was thought a high piece of prowess to knock at the Lord Advocate s mausoleum and challenge him to appear Bluidy Mackenzie come oot if ye daur sang the foolhardy urchins But Sir George had other affairs on hand and the author of an essay on toleration continues to sleep peacefully among the many whom he so intolerantly helped to slay For this infelix campus as it is dubbed in one of its own inscriptions an inscription over which doctor Johnson passed a critical eye is in many ways sacred to the memory of the men whom Mackenzie persecuted It was here on the flat tombstones that the Covenant was signed by an enthusiastic people In the long arm of the churchyard that extends to Lauriston the prisoners from Bothwell Bridge fed on bread and water and guarded life for life by vigilant marksmen lay five months looking for the scaffold or the plantations And while the good work was going forward in the Grassmarket idlers in Greyfriars might have heard the throb of the military drums that drowned the voices of the martyrs Nor is this all for down in the corner farthest from Sir George there stands a monument dedicated in uncouth Covenanting verse to all who lost their lives in that contention There is no moorsman shot in a snow shower beside Irongray or company monell there is not one of the two hundred who were drowned off the Orkneys nor so much as a poor over driven Covenanting slave in the American plantations but can lay claim to a share in that memorial and if such things interest just men among the shades can boast he has a monument on earth as well as Julius Caesar or the Pharaohs Where they may all lie I know not Far scattered bones indeed But if the reader cares to learn how some of them or some part of some of them found their way at length to such honourable sepulture let him listen to the words of one who was their comrade in life and their apologist when they were dead Some of the insane controversial matter I omit as well as some digressions but leave the rest in Patrick Walker s language and orthography The never to be forgotten mister James Renwlck told me that he was Witness to their Public Murder at the Gallowlee between Leith and Edinburgh when he saw the Hangman hash and hagg off all their Five heads with Patrick Foreman s Right Hand Their Bodies were all buried at the Gallows Foot their Heads with Patrick s Hand were brought and put upon five Pikes on the Pleasaunce Port mister Renwick told me that it was the first public Action that his Hand was at to conveen Friends and lift their murthered Bodies and carried them to the West Churchyard of Edinburgh not Greyfriars this time and buried them there Then they came about the City and took down these Five Heads and that Hand and Day being come they went quickly up the Pleasaunce and when they came to Lauristoun Yards upon the South side of the City they durst not venture being so light to go and bury their Heads with their Bodies which they designed it being present death if any of them had been found Alexander Tweedie a Friend being with them who at that Time was Gardner in these Yards concluded to bury them in his Yard being in a Box wrapped in Linen where they lay forty five Years except three Days being executed upon the tenth of October sixteen eighty one and found the seventh Day of October seventeen twenty six That Piece of Ground lay for some years unlaboured and trenching it the Gardner found them which affrighted him the Box was consumed mister Schaw the Owner of these Yards caused lift them and lay them upon a Table in his Summer house mister Schaw s mother was so kind as to cut out a Linen cloth and cover them They lay Twelve Days there where all had Access to see them Alexander Tweedie the foresaid Gardner said when dying There was a Treasure hid in his Yard but neither Gold nor Silver Daniel Tweedie his Son came along with me to that Yard and told me that his Father planted a white Rose bush above them and farther down the Yard a red Rose bush which were more fruitful than any other Bush in the Yard Many came to see the heads out of Curiosity yet I rejoiced to see so many concerned grave Men and Women favouring the Dust of our Martyrs There were Six of us concluded to bury them upon the Nineteenth Day of October seventeen twenty six and every one of us to acquaint Friends of the Day and Hour being Wednesday the Day of the Week on which most of them were executed and at four of the Clock at Night being the Hour that most of them went to their resting Graves We caused make a compleat Coffin for them in Black with four Yards of fine Linen the way that our Martyrs Corps were managed Accordingly we kept the aforesaid Day and Hour and doubled the Linen and laid the Half of it below them their nether Jaws being parted from their Heads but being young Men their Teeth remained All were Witness to the Holes in each of their Heads which the Hangman broke with his Hammer and according to the Bigness of their Sculls we laid the Jaws to them and drew the other Half of the Linen above them and stufft the Coffin with Shavings Some prest hard to go thorow the chief Parts of the City as was done at the Revolution but this we refused considering that it looked airy and frothy to make such Show of them and inconsistent with the solid serious Observing of such an affecting surprizing unheard of Dispensation But took the ordinary Way of other Burials from that Place to wit we went east the Back of the Wall and in at Bristo Port and down the Way to the Head of the Cowgate and turned up to the Churchyard where they were interred closs to the Martyrs Tomb with the greatest Multitude of People Old and Young Men and Women Ministers and others that ever I saw together And so there they were at last in their resting graves So long as men do their duty even if it be greatly in a misapprehension they will be leading pattern lives and whether or not they come to lie beside a martyrs monument we may be sure they will find a safe haven somewhere in the providence of God It is not well to think of death unless we temper the thought with that of heroes who despised it Upon what ground is of small account if it be only the bishop who was burned for his faith in the antipodes his memory lightens the heart and makes us walk undisturbed among graves And so the martyrs monument is a wholesome heartsome spot in the field of the dead and as we look upon it a brave influence comes to us from the land of those who have won their discharge and in another phrase of Patrick Walker s got cleanly off the stage CHAPTER VI NEW TOWN TOWN AND COUNTRY It is as much a matter of course to decry the New Town as to exalt the Old and the most celebrated authorities have picked out this quarter as the very emblem of what is condemnable in architecture Much may be said much indeed has been said upon the text but to the unsophisticated who call anything pleasing if it only pleases them the New Town of Edinburgh seems in itself not only gay and airy but highly picturesque An old skipper invincibly ignorant of all theories of the sublime and beautiful once propounded as his most radiant notion for Paradise The new town of Edinburgh with the wind the matter of a point free He has now gone to that sphere where all good tars are promised pleasant weather in the song and perhaps his thoughts fly somewhat higher But there are bright and temperate days with soft air coming from the inland hills military music sounding bravely from the hollow of the gardens the flags all waving on the palaces of Princes Street when I have seen the town through a sort of glory and shaken hands in sentiment with the old sailor And indeed for a man who has been much tumbled round Orcadian skerries what scene could be more agreeable to witness On such a day the valley wears a surprising air of festival It seems I do not know how else to put my meaning as if it were a trifle too good to be true It is what Paris ought to be It has the scenic quality that would best set off a life of unthinking open air diversion It was meant by nature for the realization of the society of comic operas And you can imagine if the climate were but towardly how all the world and his wife would flock into these gardens in the cool of the evening to hear cheerful music to sip pleasant drinks to see the moon rise from behind Arthur s Seat and shine upon the spires and monuments and the green tree tops in the valley Alas and the next morning the rain is splashing on the window and the passengers flee along Princes Street before the galloping squalls It cannot be denied that the original design was faulty and short sighted and did not fully profit by the capabilities of the situation The architect was essentially a town bird and he laid out the modern city with a view to street scenery and to street scenery alone The country did not enter into his plan he had never lifted his eyes to the hills If he had so chosen every street upon the northern slope might have been a noble terrace and commanded an extensive and beautiful view But the space has been too closely built many of the houses front the wrong way intent like the Man with the Muck Rake on what is not worth observation and standing discourteously back foremost in the ranks and in a word it is too often only from attic windows or here and there at a crossing that you can get a look beyond the city upon its diversified surroundings But perhaps it is all the more surprising to come suddenly on a corner and see a perspective of a mile or more of falling street and beyond that woods and villas and a blue arm of sea and the hills upon the farther side Fergusson our Edinburgh poet Burns s model once saw a butterfly at the Town Cross and the sight inspired him with a worthless little ode This painted countryman the dandy of the rose garden looked far abroad in such a humming neighbourhood and you can fancy what moral considerations a youthful poet would supply But the incident in a fanciful sort of way is characteristic of the place Into no other city does the sight of the country enter so far if you do not meet a butterfly you shall certainly catch a glimpse of far away trees upon your walk and the place is full of theatre tricks in the way of scenery You peep under an arch you descend stairs that look as if they would land you in a cellar you turn to the back window of a grimy tenement in a lane and behold you are face to face with distant and bright prospects You turn a corner and there is the sun going down into the Highland hills You look down an alley and see ships tacking for the Baltic For the country people to see Edinburgh on her hill tops is one thing it is another for the citizen from the thick of his affairs to overlook the country It should be a genial and ameliorating influence in life it should prompt good thoughts and remind him of Nature s unconcern that he can watch from day to day as he trots officeward how the Spring green brightens in the wood or the field grows black under a moving ploughshare I have been tempted in this connection to deplore the slender faculties of the human race with its penny whistle of a voice its dull ears and its narrow range of sight If you could see as people are to see in heaven if you had eyes such as you can fancy for a superior race if you could take clear note of the objects of vision not only a few yards but a few miles from where you stand think how agreeably your sight would be entertained how pleasantly your thoughts would be diversified as you walked the Edinburgh streets For you might pause in some business perplexity in the midst of the city traffic and perhaps catch the eye of a shepherd as he sat down to breathe upon a heathery shoulder of the Pentlands or perhaps some urchin clambering in a country elm would put aside the leaves and show you his flushed and rustic visage or a fisher racing seawards with the tiller under his elbow and the sail sounding in the wind would fling you a salutation from between Anst er and the May To be old is not the same thing as to be picturesque nor because the Old Town bears a strange physiognomy does it at all follow that the New Town shall look commonplace Indeed apart from antique houses it is curious how much description would apply commonly to either The same sudden accidents of ground a similar dominating site above the plain and the same superposition of one rank of society over another are to be observed in both Thus the broad and comely approach to Princes Street from the east lined with hotels and public offices makes a leap over the gorge of the Low Calton if you cast a glance over the parapet you look direct into that sunless and disreputable confluent of Leith Street and the same tall houses open upon both thoroughfares This is only the New Town passing overhead above its own cellars walking so to speak over its own children as is the way of cities and the human race But at the Dean Bridge you may behold a spectacle of a more novel order The river runs at the bottom of a deep valley among rocks and between gardens the crest of either bank is occupied by some of the most commodious streets and crescents in the modern city and a handsome bridge unites the two summits Over this every afternoon private carriages go spinning by and ladies with card cases pass to and fro about the duties of society And yet down below you may still see with its mills and foaming weir the little rural village of Dean Modern improvement has gone overhead on its high level viaduct and the extended city has cleanly overleapt and left unaltered what was once the summer retreat of its comfortable citizens Every town embraces hamlets in its growth Edinburgh herself has embraced a good few but it is strange to see one still surviving and to see it some hundreds of feet below your path Is it Torre del Greco that is built above buried Herculaneum Herculaneum was dead at least but the sun still shines upon the roofs of Dean the smoke still rises thriftily from its chimneys the dusty miller comes to his door looks at the gurgling water hearkens to the turning wheel and the birds about the shed and perhaps whistles an air of his own to enrich the symphony for all the world as if Edinburgh were still the old Edinburgh on the Castle Hill and Dean were still the quietest of hamlets buried a mile or so in the green country It is not so long ago since magisterial David Hume lent the authority of his example to the exodus from the Old Town and took up his new abode in a street which is still so oddly may a jest become perpetuated known as Saint David Street Nor is the town so large but a holiday schoolboy may harry a bird s nest within half a mile of his own door There are places that still smell of the plough in memory s nostrils Here one had heard a blackbird on a hawthorn there another was taken on summer evenings to eat strawberries and cream and you have seen a waving wheatfield on the site of your present residence The memories of an Edinburgh boy are but partly memories of the town I look back with delight on many an escalade of garden walls many a ramble among lilacs full of piping birds many an exploration in obscure quarters that were neither town nor country and I think that both for my companions and myself there was a special interest a point of romance and a sentiment as of foreign travel when we hit in our excursions on the butt end of some former hamlet and found a few rustic cottages embedded among streets and squares The tunnel to the Scotland Street Station the sight of the trains shooting out of its dark maw with the two guards upon the brake the thought of its length and the many ponderous edifices and open thoroughfares above were certainly things of paramount impressiveness to a young mind It was a subterranean passage although of a larger bore than we were accustomed to in Ainsworth s novels and these two words subterranean passage were in themselves an irresistible attraction and seemed to bring us nearer in spirit to the heroes we loved and the black rascals we secretly aspired to imitate To scale the Castle Rock from West Princes Street Gardens and lay a triumphal hand against the rampart itself was to taste a high order of romantic pleasure And there are other sights and exploits which crowd back upon my mind under a very strong illumination of remembered pleasure But the effect of not one of them all will compare with the discoverer s joy and the sense of old Time and his slow changes on the face of this earth with which I explored such corners as Cannon mills or Water Lane or the nugget of cottages at Broughton Market They were more rural than the open country and gave a greater impression of antiquity than the oldest land upon the High Street They too like Fergusson s butterfly had a quaint air of having wandered far from their own place they looked abashed and homely with their gables and their creeping plants their outside stairs and running null streams there were corners that smelt like the end of the country garden where I spent my Aprils and the people stood to gossip at their doors as they might have done in Colinton or Cramond In a great measure we may and shall eradicate this haunting flavour of the country The last elm is dead in Elm Row and the villas and the workmen s quarters spread apace on all the borders of the city We can cut down the trees we can bury the grass under dead paving stones we can drive brisk streets through all our sleepy quarters and we may forget the stories and the play grounds of our boyhood But we have some possessions that not even the infuriate zeal of builders can utterly abolish and destroy Nothing can abolish the hills unless it be a cataclysm of nature which shall subvert Edinburgh Castle itself and lay all her florid structures in the dust And as long as we have the hills and the Firth we have a famous heritage to leave our children Our windows at no expense to us are mostly artfully stained to represent a landscape And when the Spring comes round and the hawthorn begins to flower and the meadows to smell of young grass even in the thickest of our streets the country hill tops find out a young man s eyes and set his heart beating for travel and pure air CHAPTER VII THE VILLA QUARTERS mister Ruskin s denunciation of the New Town of Edinburgh includes as I have heard it repeated nearly all the stone and lime we have to show Many however find a grand air and something settled and imposing in the better parts and upon many as I have said the confusion of styles induces an agreeable stimulation of the mind But upon the subject of our recent villa architecture I am frankly ready to mingle my tears with mister Ruskin s and it is a subject which makes one envious of his large declamatory and controversial eloquence Day by day one new villa one new object of offence is added to another all around Newington and Morningside the dismalest structures keep springing up like mushrooms the pleasant hills are loaded with them each impudently squatted in its garden each roofed and carrying chimneys like a house And yet a glance of an eye discovers their true character They are not houses for they were not designed with a view to human habitation and the internal arrangements are as they tell me fantastically unsuited to the needs of man They are not buildings for you can scarcely say a thing is built where every measurement is in clamant disproportion with its neighbour They belong to no style to art only to a form of business much to be regretted Why should it be cheaper to erect a structure where the size of the windows bears no rational relation to the size of the front Is there any profit in a misplaced chimney stalk Does a hard working greedy builder gain more on a monstrosity than on a decent cottage of equal plainness Frankly we should say No Bricks may be omitted and green timber employed in the construction of even a very elegant design and there is no reason why a chimney should be made to vent because it is so situated as to look comely from without On the other hand there is a noble way of being ugly a high aspiring fiasco like the fall of Lucifer There are daring and gaudy buildings that manage to be offensive without being contemptible and we know that fools rush in where angels fear to tread But to aim at making a commonplace villa and to make it insufferably ugly in each particular to attempt the homeliest achievement and to attain the bottom of derided failure not to have any theory but profit and yet at an equal expense to outstrip all competitors in the art of conceiving and rendering permanent deformity and to do this in what is by nature one of the most agreeable neighbourhoods in Britain what are we to say but that this also is a distinction hard to earn although not greatly worshipful Indifferent buildings give pain to the sensitive but these things offend the plainest taste It is a danger which threatens the amenity of the town and as this eruption keeps spreading on our borders we have ever the farther to walk among unpleasant sights before we gain the country air If the population of Edinburgh were a living autonomous body it would arise like one man and make night hideous with arson the builders and their accomplices would be driven to work like the Jews of yore with the trowel in one hand and the defensive cutlass in the other and as soon as one of these masonic wonders had been consummated right minded iconoclasts should fall thereon and make an end of it at once Possibly these words may meet the eye of a builder or two It is no use asking them to employ an architect for that would be to touch them in a delicate quarter and its use would largely depend on what architect they were minded to call in But let them get any architect in the world to point out any reasonably well proportioned villa not his own design and let them reproduce that model to satiety CHAPTER VIII THE CALTON HILL The east of New Edinburgh is guarded by a craggy hill of no great elevation which the town embraces The old London road runs on one side of it while the New Approach leaving it on the other hand completes the circuit You mount by stairs in a cutting of the rock to find yourself in a field of monuments Dugald Stewart has the honours of situation and architecture Burns is memorialized lower down upon a spur Lord Nelson as befits a sailor gives his name to the top gallant of the Calton Hill This latter erection has been differently and yet in both cases aptly compared to a telescope and a butterchurn comparisons apart it ranks among the vilest of men s handiworks But the chief feature is an unfinished range of columns the Modern Ruin as it has been called an imposing object from far and near and giving Edinburgh even from the sea that false air of a modern Athens which has earned for her so many slighting speeches It was meant to be a National Monument and its present state is a very suitable monument to certain national characteristics The old Observatory a quaint brown building on the edge of the steep and the New Observatory a classical edifice with a dome occupy the central portion of the summit All these are scattered on a green turf browsed over by some sheep The scene suggests reflections on fame and on man s injustice to the dead You see Dugald Stewart rather more handsomely commemorated than Burns Immediately below in the Canongate churchyard lies Robert Fergusson Burns s master in his art who died insane while yet a stripling and if Dugald Stewart has been somewhat too boisterously acclaimed the Edinburgh poet on the other hand is most unrighteously forgotten The votaries of Burns a crew too common in all ranks in Scotland and more remarkable for number than discretion eagerly suppress all mention of the lad who handed to him the poetic impulse and up to the time when he grew famous continued to influence him in his manner and the choice of subjects Burns himself not only acknowledged his debt in a fragment of autobiography but erected a tomb over the grave in Canongate churchyard This was worthy of an artist but it was done in vain and although I think I have read nearly all the biographies of Burns I cannot remember one in which the modesty of nature was not violated or where Fergusson was not sacrificed to the credit of his follower s originality There is a kind of gaping admiration that would fain roll Shakespeare and Bacon into one to have a bigger thing to gape at and a class of men who cannot edit one author without disparaging all others They are indeed mistaken if they think to please the great originals and whoever puts Fergusson right with fame cannot do better than dedicate his labours to the memory of Burns who will be the best delighted of the dead Of all places for a view this Calton Hill is perhaps the best since you can see the Castle which you lose from the Castle and Arthur s Seat which you cannot see from Arthur s Seat It is the place to stroll on one of those days of sunshine and east wind which are so common in our more than temperate summer The breeze comes off the sea with a little of the freshness and that touch of chill peculiar to the quarter which is delightful to certain very ruddy organizations and greatly the reverse to the majority of mankind It brings with it a faint floating haze a cunning decolouriser although not thick enough to obscure outlines near at hand But the haze lies more thickly to windward at the far end of Musselburgh Bay and over the Links of Aberlady and Berwick Law and the hump of the Bass Rock it assumes the aspect of a bank of thin sea fog Immediately underneath upon the south you command the yards of the High School and the towers and courts of the new Jail a large place castellated to the extent of folly standing by itself on the edge of a steep cliff and often joyfully hailed by tourists as the Castle In the one you may perhaps see female prisoners taking exercise like a string of nuns in the other schoolboys running at play and their shadows keeping step with them From the bottom of the valley a gigantic chimney rises almost to the level of the eye a taller and a shapelier edifice than Nelson s Monument Look a little farther and there is Holyrood Palace with its Gothic frontal and ruined abbey and the red sentry pacing smartly to and fro before the door like a mechanical figure in a panorama By way of an outpost you can single out the little peak roofed lodge over which Rizzio s murderers made their escape and where Queen Mary herself according to gossip bathed in white wine to entertain her loveliness Behind and overhead lie the Queen s Park from Muschat s Cairn to Dumbiedykes saint Margaret s Loch and the long wall of Salisbury Crags and thence by knoll and rocky bulwark and precipitous slope the eye rises to the top of Arthur s Seat a hill for magnitude a mountain in virtue of its bold design This upon your left Upon the right the roofs and spires of the Old Town climb one above another to where the citadel prints its broad bulk and jagged crown of bastions on the western sky Perhaps it is now one in the afternoon and at the same instant of time a ball rises to the summit of Nelson s flagstaff close at hand and far away a puff of smoke followed by a report bursts from the half moon battery at the Castle This is the time gun by which people set their watches as far as the sea coast or in hill farms upon the Pentlands To complete the view the eye enfilades Princes Street black with traffic and has a broad look over the valley between the Old Town and the New here full of railway trains and stepped over by the high North Bridge upon its many columns and there green with trees and gardens On the north the Calton Hill is neither so abrupt in itself nor has it so exceptional an outlook and yet even here it commands a striking prospect A gully separates it from the New Town This is Greenside where witches were burned and tournaments held in former days Down that almost precipitous bank Bothwell launched his horse and so first as they say attracted the bright eyes of Mary It is now tessellated with sheets and blankets out to dry and the sound of people beating carpets is rarely absent Beyond all this the suburbs run out to Leith Leith camps on the seaside with her forest of masts Leith roads are full of ships at anchor the sun picks out the white pharos upon Inchkeith Island the Firth extends on either hand from the Ferry to the May the towns of Fifeshire sit each in its bank of blowing smoke along the opposite coast and the hills inclose the view except to the farthest east where the haze of the horizon rests upon the open sea There lies the road to Norway a dear road for Sir Patrick Spens and his Scots Lords and yonder smoke on the hither side of Largo Law is Aberdour from whence they sailed to seek a queen for Scotland O lang lang may the ladies sit Wi their fans into their hand Or e er they see Sir Patrick Spens Come sailing to the land The sight of the sea even from a city will bring thoughts of storm and sea disaster The sailors wives of Leith and the fisherwomen of Cockenzie not sitting languorously with fans but crowding to the tail of the harbour with a shawl about their ears may still look vainly for brave Scotsmen who will return no more or boats that have gone on their last fishing Since Sir Patrick sailed from Aberdour what a multitude have gone down in the North Sea Yonder is Auldhame where the London smack went ashore and wreckers cut the rings from ladies fingers and a few miles round Fife Ness is the fatal Inchcape now a star of guidance and the lee shore to the east of the Inchcape is that Forfarshire coast where Mucklebackit sorrowed for his son These are the main features of the scene roughly sketched How they are all tilted by the inclination of the ground how each stands out in delicate relief against the rest what manifold detail and play of sun and shadow animate and accentuate the picture is a matter for a person on the spot and turning swiftly on his heels to grasp and bind together in one comprehensive look It is the character of such a prospect to be full of change and of things moving The multiplicity embarrasses the eye and the mind among so much suffers itself to grow absorbed with single points You remark a tree in a hedgerow or follow a cart along a country road You turn to the city and see children dwarfed by distance into pygmies at play about suburban doorsteps you have a glimpse upon a thoroughfare where people are densely moving you note ridge after ridge of chimney stacks running downhill one behind another and church spires rising bravely from the sea of roofs At one of the innumerable windows you watch a figure moving on one of the multitude of roofs you watch clambering chimney sweeps The wind takes a run and scatters the smoke bells are heard far and near faint and loud to tell the hour or perhaps a bird goes dipping evenly over the housetops like a gull across the waves And here you are in the meantime on this pastoral hillside among nibbling sheep and looked upon by monumental buildings Return thither on some clear dark moonless night with a ring of frost in the air and only a star or two set sparsely in the vault of heaven and you will find a sight as stimulating as the hoariest summit of the Alps The solitude seems perfect the patient astronomer flat on his back under the Observatory dome and spying heaven s secrets is your only neighbour and yet from all round you there come up the dull hum of the city the tramp of countless people marching out of time the rattle of carriages and the continuous jingle of the tramway bells An hour or so before the gas was turned on lamplighters scoured the city in every house from kitchen to attic the windows kindled and gleamed forth into the dusk And so now although the town lies blue and darkling on her hills innumerable spots of the bright element shine far and near along the pavements and upon the high facades Moving lights of the railway pass and re pass below the stationary lights upon the bridge Lights burn in the Jail Lights burn high up in the tall lands and on the Castle turrets they burn low down in Greenside or along the Park They run out one beyond the other into the dark country They walk in a procession down to Leith and shine singly far along Leith Pier Thus the plan of the city and her suburbs is mapped out upon the ground of blackness as when a child pricks a drawing full of pinholes and exposes it before a candle not the darkest night of winter can conceal her high station and fanciful design every evening in the year she proceeds to illuminate herself in honour of her own beauty and as if to complete the scheme or rather as if some prodigal Pharaoh were beginning to extend to the adjacent sea and country half way over to Fife there is an outpost of light upon Inchkeith and far to seaward yet another on the May And while you are looking across upon the Castle Hill the drums and bugles begin to recall the scattered garrison the air thrills with the sound the bugles sing aloud and the last rising flourish mounts and melts into the darkness like a star a martial swan song fitly rounding in the labours of the day CHAPTER IX WINTER AND NEW YEAR The Scots dialect is singularly rich in terms of reproach against the winter wind Snell blae nirly and scowthering are four of these significant vocables they are all words that carry a shiver with them and for my part as I see them aligned before me on the page I am persuaded that a big wind comes tearing over the Firth from Burntisland and the northern hills I think I can hear it howl in the chimney and as I set my face northwards feel its smarting kisses on my cheek Even in the names of places there is often a desolate inhospitable sound and I remember two from the near neighbourhood of Edinburgh Cauldhame and Blaw weary that would promise but starving comfort to their inhabitants The inclemency of heaven which has thus endowed the language of Scotland with words has also largely modified the spirit of its poetry Both poverty and a northern climate teach men the love of the hearth and the sentiment of the family and the latter in its own right inclines a poet to the praise of strong waters In Scotland all our singers have a stave or two for blazing fires and stout potations to get indoors out of the wind and to swallow something hot to the stomach are benefits so easily appreciated where they dwelt And this is not only so in country districts where the shepherd must wade in the snow all day after his flock but in Edinburgh itself and nowhere more apparently stated than in the works of our Edinburgh poet Fergusson He was a delicate youth I take it and willingly slunk from the robustious winter to an inn fireside Love was absent from his life or only present if you prefer in such a form that even the least serious of Burns s amourettes was ennobling by comparison and so there is nothing to temper the sentiment of indoor revelry which pervades the poor boy s verses Although it is characteristic of his native town and the manners of its youth to the present day this spirit has perhaps done something to restrict his popularity He recalls a supper party pleasantry with something akin to tenderness and sounds the praises of the act of drinking as if it were virtuous or at least witty in itself The kindly jar the warm atmosphere of tavern parlours and the revelry of lawyers clerks do not offer by themselves the materials of rich existence It was not choice so much as an external fate that kept Fergusson in this round of sordid pleasures A Scot of poetic temperament and without religious exaltation drops as if by nature into the public house The picture may not be pleasing but what else is a man to do in this dog s weather To none but those who have themselves suffered the thing in the body can the gloom and depression of our Edinburgh winters be brought home For some constitutions there is something almost physically disgusting in the bleak ugliness of easterly weather the wind wearies the sickly sky depresses them and they turn back from their walk to avoid the aspect of the unrefulgent sun going down among perturbed and pallid mists The days are so short that a man does much of his business and certainly all his pleasure by the haggard glare of gas lamps The roads are as heavy as a fallow People go by so drenched and draggle tailed that I have often wondered how they found the heart to undress And meantime the wind whistles through the town as if it were an open meadow and if you lie awake all night you hear it shrieking and raving overhead with a noise of shipwrecks and of falling houses In a word life is so unsightly that there are times when the heart turns sick in a man s inside and the look of a tavern or the thought of the warm firelit study is like the touch of land to one who has been long struggling with the seas As the weather hardens towards frost the world begins to improve for Edinburgh people We enjoy superb sub arctic sunsets with the profile of the city stamped in indigo upon a sky of luminous green The wind may still be cold but there is a briskness in the air that stirs good blood People do not all look equally sour and downcast They fall into two divisions one the knight of the blue face and hollow paunch whom Winter has gotten by the vitals the other well lined with New year s fare conscious of the touch of cold on his periphery but stepping through it by the glow of his internal fires Such an one I remember triply cased in grease whom no extremity of temperature could vanquish Well would be his jovial salutation here s a sneezer And the look of these warm fellows is tonic and upholds their drooping fellow townsmen There is yet another class who do not depend on corporal advantages but support the winter in virtue of a brave and merry heart One shivering evening cold enough for frost but with too high a wind and a little past sundown when the lamps were beginning to enlarge their circles in the growing dusk a brace of barefoot lassies were seen coming eastward in the teeth of the wind If the one was as much as nine the other was certainly not more than seven They were miserably clad and the pavement was so cold you would have thought no one could lay a naked foot on it unflinching Yet they came along waltzing if you please while the elder sang a tune to give them music The person who saw this and whose heart was full of bitterness at the moment pocketed a reproof which has been of use to him ever since and which he now hands on with his good wishes to the reader At length Edinburgh with her satellite hills and all the sloping country is sheeted up in white If it has happened in the dark hours nurses pluck their children out of bed and run with them to some commanding window whence they may see the change that has been worked upon earth s face A the hills are covered wi snaw they sing and Winter s noo come fairly And the children marveling at the silence and the white landscape find a spell appropriate to the season in the words The reverberation of the snow increases the pale daylight and brings all objects nearer the eye The Pentlands are smooth and glittering with here and there the black ribbon of a dry stone dyke and here and there if there be wind a cloud of blowing snow upon a shoulder The Firth seems a leaden creek that a man might almost jump across between well powdered Lothian and well powdered Fife And the effect is not as in other cities a thing of half a day the streets are soon trodden black but the country keeps its virgin white and you have only to lift your eyes and look over miles of country snow An indescribable cheerfulness breathes about the city and the well fed heart sits lightly and beats gaily in the bosom It is New year s weather New year s Day the great national festival is a time of family expansions and of deep carousal Sometimes by a sore stroke of fate for this Calvinistic people the year s anniversary falls upon a Sunday when the public houses are inexorably closed when singing and even whistling is banished from our homes and highways and the oldest toper feels called upon to go to church Thus pulled about as if between two loyalties the Scots have to decide many nice cases of conscience and ride the marches narrowly between the weekly and the annual observance A party of convivial musicians next door to a friend of mine hung suspended in this manner on the brink of their diversions From ten o clock on Sunday night my friend heard them tuning their instruments and as the hour of liberty drew near each must have had his music open his bow in readiness across the fiddle his foot already raised to mark the time and his nerves braced for execution for hardly had the twelfth stroke sounded from the earliest steeple before they had launched forth into a secular bravura Currant loaf is now popular eating in all households For weeks before the great morning confectioners display stacks of Scots bun a dense black substance inimical to life and full moons of shortbread adorned with mottoes of peel or sugar plum in honour of the season and the family affections Frae Auld Reekie A guid New Year to ye a For the Auld Folk at Hame are among the most favoured of these devices Can you not see the carrier after half a day s journey on pinching hill roads draw up before a cottage in Teviotdale or perhaps in Manor Glen among the rowans and the old people receiving the parcel with moist eyes and a prayer for Jock or Jean in the city For at this season on the threshold of another year of calamity and stubborn conflict men feel a need to draw closer the links that unite them they reckon the number of their friends like allies before a war and the prayers grow longer in the morning as the absent are recommended by name into God s keeping On the day itself the shops are all shut as on a Sunday only taverns toyshops and other holiday magazines keep open doors Everyone looks for his handsel The postmen and the lamplighters have left at every house in their districts a copy of vernacular verses asking and thanking in a breath and it is characteristic of Scotland that these verses may have sometimes a touch of reality in detail of sentiment and a measure of strength in the handling All over the town you may see comforter d schoolboys hastening to squander their half crowns There are an infinity of visits to be paid all the world is in the street except the daintier classes the sacramental greeting is heard upon all sides Auld Lang Syne is much in people s mouths and whisky and shortbread are staple articles of consumption From an early hour a stranger will be impressed by the number of drunken men and by afternoon drunkenness has spread to the women With some classes of society it is as much a matter of duty to drink hard on New year s Day as to go to church on Sunday Some have been saving their wages for perhaps a month to do the season honour Many carry a whisky bottle in their pocket which they will press with embarrassing effusion on a perfect stranger It is not expedient to risk one s body in a cab or not at least until after a prolonged study of the driver The streets which are thronged from end to end become a place for delicate pilotage Singly or arm in arm some speechless others noisy and quarrelsome the votaries of the New Year go meandering in and out and cannoning one against another and now and again one falls and lies as he has fallen Before night so many have gone to bed or the police office that the streets seem almost clearer And as guisards and first footers are now not much seen except in country places when once the New Year has been rung in and proclaimed at the Tron railings the festivities begin to find their way indoors and something like quiet returns upon the town But think in these piled lands of all the senseless snorers all the broken heads and empty pockets Of old Edinburgh University was the scene of heroic snowballing and one riot obtained the epic honours of military intervention But the great generation I am afraid is at an end and even during my own college days the spirit appreciably declined Skating and sliding on the other hand are honoured more and more and curling being a creature of the national genius is little likely to be disregarded The patriotism that leads a man to eat Scots bun will scarcely desert him at the curling pond Edinburgh with its long steep pavements is the proper home of sliders many a happy urchin can slide the whole way to school and the profession of errand boy is transformed into a holiday amusement As for skating there is scarce any city so handsomely provided Duddingston Loch lies under the abrupt southern side of Arthur s Seat in summer a shield of blue with swans sailing from the reeds in winter a field of ringing ice The village church sits above it on a green promontory and the village smoke rises from among goodly trees At the church gates is the historical jougs a place of penance for the neck of detected sinners and the historical louping on stane from which Dutch built lairds and farmers climbed into the saddle Here Prince Charlie slept before the battle of Prestonpans and here Deacon Brodie or one of his gang stole a plough coulter before the burglary in Chessel s Court On the opposite side of the loch the ground rises to Craigmillar Castle a place friendly to Stuart Mariolaters It is worth a climb even in summer to look down upon the loch from Arthur s Seat but it is tenfold more so on a day of skating The surface is thick with people moving easily and swiftly and leaning over at a thousand graceful inclinations the crowd opens and closes and keeps moving through itself like water and the ice rings to half a mile away with the flying steel As night draws on the single figures melt into the dusk until only an obscure stir and coming and going of black clusters is visible upon the loch A little longer and the first torch is kindled and begins to flit rapidly across the ice in a ring of yellow reflection and this is followed by another and another until the whole field is full of skimming lights CHAPTER X TO THE PENTLAND HILLS On three sides of Edinburgh the country slopes downward from the city here to the sea there to the fat farms of Haddington there to the mineral fields of Linlithgow On the south alone it keeps rising until it not only out tops the Castle but looks down on Arthur s Seat The character of the neighbourhood is pretty strongly marked by a scarcity of hedges by many stone walls of varying height by a fair amount of timber some of it well grown but apt to be of a bushy northern profile and poor in foliage by here and there a little river Esk or Leith or Almond busily journeying in the bottom of its glen and from almost every point by a peep of the sea or the hills There is no lack of variety and yet most of the elements are common to all parts and the southern district is alone distinguished by considerable summits and a wide view From Boroughmuirhead where the Scottish army encamped before Flodden the road descends a long hill at the bottom of which and just as it is preparing to mount up on the other side it passes a toll bar and issues at once into the open country Even as I write these words they are becoming antiquated in the progress of events and the chisels are tinkling on a new row of houses The builders have at length adventured beyond the toll which held them in respect so long and proceed to career in these fresh pastures like a herd of colts turned loose As Lord Beaconsfield proposed to hang an architect by way of stimulation a man looking on these doomed meads imagines a similar example to deter the builders for it seems as if it must come to an open fight at last to preserve a corner of green country unbedevilled And here appropriately enough there stood in old days a crow haunted gibbet with two bodies hanged in chains I used to be shown when a child a flat stone in the roadway to which the gibbet had been fixed People of a willing fancy were persuaded and sought to persuade others that this stone was never dry And no wonder they would add for the two men had only stolen fourpence between them For about two miles the road climbs upwards a long hot walk in summer time You reach the summit at a place where four ways meet beside the toll of Fairmilehead The spot is breezy and agreeable both in name and aspect The hills are close by across a valley Kirk Yetton with its long upright scars visible as far as Fife and Allermuir the tallest on this side with wood and tilled field running high up on their borders and haunches all moulded into innumerable glens and shelvings and variegated with heather and fern The air comes briskly and sweetly off the hills pure from the elevation and rustically scented by the upland plants and even at the toll you may hear the curlew calling on its mate At certain seasons when the gulls desert their surfy forelands the birds of sea and mountain hunt and scream together in the same field by Fairmilehead The winged wild things intermix their wheelings the sea birds skim the tree tops and fish among the furrows of the plough These little craft of air are at home in all the world so long as they cruise in their own element and like sailors ask but food and water from the shores they coast Below over a stream the road passes Bow Bridge now a dairy farm but once a distillery of whisky It chanced some time in the past century that the distiller was on terms of good fellowship with the visiting officer of excise The latter was of an easy friendly disposition and a master of convivial arts Now and again he had to walk out of Edinburgh to measure the distiller s stock and although it was agreeable to find his business lead him in a friend s direction it was unfortunate that the friend should be a loser by his visits Accordingly when he got about the level of Fairmilehead the gauger would take his flute without which he never travelled from his pocket fit it together and set manfully to playing as if for his own delectation and inspired by the beauty of the scene His favourite air it seems was Over the Hills and Far Away At the first note the distiller pricked his ears A flute at Fairmilehead and playing Over the Hills and Far Away This must be his friendly enemy the gauger Instantly horses were harnessed and sundry barrels of whisky were got upon a cart driven at a gallop round Hill End and buried in the mossy glen behind Kirk Yetton In the same breath you may be sure a fat fowl was put to the fire and the whitest napery prepared for the back parlour A little after the gauger having had his fill of music for the moment came strolling down with the most innocent air imaginable and found the good people at Bow Bridge taken entirely unawares by his arrival but none the less glad to see him The distiller s liquor and the gauger s flute would combine to speed the moments of digestion and when both were somewhat mellow they would wind up the evening with Over the Hills and Far Away to an accompaniment of knowing glances And at least there is a smuggling story with original and half idyllic features A little farther the road to the right passes an upright stone in a field The country people call it General Kay s monument According to them an officer of that name had perished there in battle at some indistinct period before the beginning of history The date is reassuring for I think cautious writers are silent on the General s exploits But the stone is connected with one of those remarkable tenures of land which linger on into the modern world from Feudalism Whenever the reigning sovereign passes by a certain landed proprietor is held bound to climb on to the top trumpet in hand and sound a flourish according to the measure of his knowledge in that art Happily for a respectable family crowned heads have no great business in the Pentland Hills But the story lends a character of comicality to the stone and the passer by will sometimes chuckle to himself The district is dear to the superstitious Hard by at the back gate of Comiston a belated carter beheld a lady in white with the most beautiful clear shoes upon her feet who looked upon him in a very ghastly manner and then vanished and just in front is the Hunters Tryst once a roadside inn and not so long ago haunted by the devil in person Satan led the inhabitants a pitiful existence He shook the four corners of the building with lamentable outcries beat at the doors and windows over threw crockery in the dead hours of the morning and danced unholy dances on the roof Every kind of spiritual disinfectant was put in requisition chosen ministers were summoned out of Edinburgh and prayed by the hour pious neighbours sat up all night making a noise of psalmody but Satan minded them no more than the wind about the hill tops and it was only after years of persecution that he left the Hunters Tryst in peace to occupy himself with the remainder of mankind What with General Kay and the white lady and this singular visitation the neighbourhood offers great facilities to the makers of sun myths and without exactly casting in one s lot with that disenchanting school of writers one cannot help hearing a good deal of the winter wind in the last story That nicht says Burns in one of his happiest moments That nicht a child might understand The deil had business on his hand And if people sit up all night in lone places on the hills with Bibles and tremulous psalms they will be apt to hear some of the most fiendish noises in the world the wind will beat on doors and dance upon roofs for them and make the hills howl around their cottage with a clamour like the Judgment Day The road goes down through another valley and then finally begins to scale the main slope of the Pentlands A bouquet of old trees stands round a white farmhouse and from a neighbouring dell you can see smoke rising and leaves ruffling in the breeze Straight above the hills climb a thousand feet into the air The neighbourhood about the time of lambs is clamorous with the bleating of flocks and you will be awakened in the grey of early summer mornings by the barking of a dog or the voice of a shepherd shouting to the echoes This with the hamlet lying behind unseen is Swanston The place in the dell is immediately connected with the city Long ago this sheltered field was purchased by the Edinburgh magistrates for the sake of the springs that rise or gather there After they had built their water house and laid their pipes it occurred to them that the place was suitable for junketing Once entertained with jovial magistrates and public funds the idea led speedily to accomplishment and Edinburgh could soon boast of a municipal Pleasure House The dell was turned into a garden and on the knoll that shelters it from the plain and the sea winds they built a cottage looking to the hills They brought crockets and gargoyles from old saint Giles s which they were then restoring and disposed them on the gables and over the door and about the garden and the quarry which had supplied them with building material they draped with clematis and carpeted with beds of roses So much for the pleasure of the eye for creature comfort they made a capacious cellar in the hillside and fitted it with bins of the hewn stone In process of time the trees grew higher and gave shade to the cottage and the evergreens sprang up and turned the dell into a thicket There purple magistrates relaxed themselves from the pursuit of municipal ambition cocked hats paraded soberly about the garden and in and out among the hollies authoritative canes drew ciphering upon the path and at night from high up on the hills a shepherd saw lighted windows through the foliage and heard the voice of city dignitaries raised in song The farm is older It was first a grange of Whitekirk Abbey tilled and inhabited by rosy friars Thence after the Reformation it passed into the hands of a true blue Protestant family During the Covenanting troubles when a night conventicle was held upon the Pentlands the farm doors stood hospitably open till the morning the dresser was laden with cheese and bannocks milk and brandy and the worshipers kept lipping down from the hill between two exercises as couples visit the supper room between two dances of a modern ball In the Forty Five some foraging Highlanders from Prince Charlie s army fell upon Swanston in the dawn The great grandfather of the late farmer was then a little child him they awakened by plucking the blankets from his bed and he remembered when he was an old man their truculent looks and uncouth speech The churn stood full of cream in the dairy and with this they made their brose in high delight It was braw brose said one of them At last they made off laden like camels with their booty and Swanston Farm has lain out of the way of history from that time forward I do not know what may be yet in store for it On dark days when the mist runs low upon the hill the house has a gloomy air as if suitable for private tragedy But in hot July you can fancy nothing more perfect than the garden laid out in alleys and arbours and bright old fashioned flower plots and ending in a miniature ravine all trellis work and moss and tinkling waterfall and housed from the sun under fathoms of broad foliage The hamlet behind is one of the least considerable of hamlets and consists of a few cottages on a green beside a burn Some of them a strange thing in Scotland are models of internal neatness the beds adorned with patchwork the shelves arrayed with willow pattern plates the floors and tables bright with scrubbing or pipeclay and the very kettle polished like silver It is the sign of a contented old age in country places where there is little matter for gossip and no street sights Housework becomes an art and at evening when the cottage interior shines and twinkles in the glow of the fire the housewife folds her hands and contemplates her finished picture the snow and the wind may do their worst she has made herself a pleasant corner in the world The city might be a thousand miles away and yet it was close by that mister Bough painted the distant view of Edinburgh which has been engraved for this collection two and you have only to look at the cut to see how near it is at hand But hills and hill people are not easily sophisticated and if you walk out here on a summer Sunday it is as like as not the shepherd may set his dogs upon you But keep an unmoved countenance they look formidable at the charge but their hearts are in the right place and they will only bark and sprawl about you on the grass unmindful of their master s excitations Kirk Yetton forms the north eastern angle of the range thence the Pentlands trend off to south and west From the summit you look over a great expanse of champaign sloping to the sea and behold a large variety of distant hills There are the hills of Fife the hills of Peebles the Lammermoors and the Ochils more or less mountainous in outline more or less blue with distance Of the Pentlands themselves you see a field of wild heathery peaks with a pond gleaming in the midst and to that side the view is as desolate as if you were looking into Galloway or Applecross To turn to the other is like a piece of travel Far out in the lowlands Edinburgh shows herself making a great smoke on clear days and spreading her suburbs about her for miles the Castle rises darkly in the midst and close by Arthur s Seat makes a bold figure in the landscape All around cultivated fields and woods and smoking villages and white country roads diversify the uneven surface of the land Trains crawl slowly abroad upon the railway lines little ships are tacking in the Firth the shadow of a mountainous cloud as large as a parish travels before the wind the wind itself ruffles the wood and standing corn and sends pulses of varying colour across the landscape So you sit like Jupiter on Olympus and look down from afar upon men s life The city is as silent as a city of the dead from all its humming thoroughfares not a voice not a footfall reaches you upon the hill The sea surf the cries of ploughmen the streams and the mill wheels the birds and the wind keep up an animated concert through the plain from farm to farm dogs and crowing cocks contend together in defiance and yet from this Olympian station except for the whispering rumour of a train the world has fallen into a dead silence and the business of town and country grown voiceless in your ears A crying hill bird the bleat of a sheep a wind singing in the dry grass seem not so much to interrupt as to accompany the stillness but to the spiritual ear the whole scene makes a music at once human and rural and discourses pleasant reflections on the destiny of man The spiry habitable city ships the divided fields and browsing herds and the straight highways tell visibly of man s active and comfortable ways and you may be never so laggard and never so unimpressionable but there is something in the view that spirits up your blood and puts you in the vein for cheerful labour Immediately below is Fairmilehead a spot of roof and a smoking chimney where two roads no thicker than packthread intersect beside a hanging wood If you are fanciful you will be reminded of the gauger in the story And the thought of this old exciseman who once lipped and fingered on his pipe and uttered clear notes from it in the mountain air and the words of the song he affected carry your mind Over the hills and far away to distant countries and you have a vision of Edinburgh not as you see her in the midst of a little neighbourhood but as a boss upon the round world with all Europe and the deep sea for her surroundings For every place is a centre to the earth whence highways radiate or ships set sail for foreign ports the limit of a parish is not more imaginary than the frontier of an empire and as a man sitting at home in his cabinet and swiftly writing books so a city sends abroad an influence and a portrait of herself There is no Edinburgh emigrant far or near from China to Peru but he or she carries some lively pictures of the mind some sunset behind the Castle cliffs some snow scene some maze of city lamps indelible in the memory and delightful to study in the intervals of toil For any such if this book fall in their way here are a few more home pictures It would be pleasant if they should recognise a house where they had dwelt or a walk that they had taken two Reference to an etching in original edition END OF VOL I End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Works of Robert Louis Stevenson Swanston
