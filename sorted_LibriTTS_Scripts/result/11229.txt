none	none	Arthur Lister Browne M A Oxon F R C P It happened that for two years I had been spending most of my time in France and as Browne had a Norfolk practice I had not seen him during my visits to London Moreover though our friendship was of the most intimate kind we were both atrocious correspondents so that only two notes passed between us during those years Till last May there reached me the letter and the packet to which I refer The packet consisted of four note books quite crowded throughout with those giddy shapes of Pitman s shorthand whose ensemble so resembles startled swarms hovering in flighty poses on the wing They were scribbled in pencil with little distinction between thick and thin strokes few vowels so that their slow deciphering I can assure the reader has been no holiday The letter also was pencilled in shorthand and this letter together with the second of the note books which I have deciphered it was marked III I now publish I must say however that in some five instances there will occur sentences rather crutched by my own guess work and in two instances the characters were so impossibly mystical that I had to abandon the passage with a head ache But all this will be found immaterial to the general narrative The following is Browne s letter DEAR OLD SHIEL I have just been lying thinking of you and wishing that you were here to give one a last squeeze of the hand before I go for by all appearance going I am Four days ago I began to feel a soreness in the throat and passing by old Johnson s surgery at Selbridge went in and asked him to have a look at me He muttered something about membranous laryngitis which made me smile but by the time I reached home I was hoarse and not smiling before night I had dyspnoca and laryngeal stridor I at once telegraphed to London for Morgan and between him and Johnson they have been opening my trachea and burning my inside with chromic acid and the galvanic cautery The difficulty as to breathing has subsided and it is wonderful how little I suffer but I am much too old a hand not to know what s what the bronchi are involved too far involved and as a matter of absolute fact there isn t any hope Morgan is still I believe fondly dwelling upon the possibility of adding me to his successful tracheotomy statistics but prognosis was always my strong point and I say No The very small consolation of my death will be the beating of a specialist in his own line So we shall see I have been arranging some of my affairs this morning and remembered these notebooks I intended letting you have them months ago but my habit of putting things off and the fact that the lady was alive from whom I took down the words prevented me Now she is dead and as a literary man and a student of life you should be interested if you can manage to read them You may even find them valuable I am under a little morphia at present propped up in a nice little state of languor and as I am able to write without much effort I will tell you in the old Pitman s something about her Her name was Miss Mary Wilson she was about thirty when I met her forty five when she died and I knew her intimately all those fifteen years Do you know anything about the philosophy of the hypnotic trance Well that was the relation between us hypnotist and subject She had been under another man before my time but no one was ever so successful with her as I She suffered from tic douloureux of the fifth nerve She had had most of her teeth drawn before I saw her and an attempt had been made to wrench out the nerve on the left side by the external scission But it made no difference all the clocks in hell tick tacked in that poor woman s jaw and it was the mercy of Providence that ever she came across me My organisation was found to have almost complete and quite easy control over hers and with a few passes I could expel her Legion Well you never saw anyone so singular in personal appearance as my friend Miss Wilson Medicine man as I am I could never behold her suddenly without a sensation of shock she suggested so inevitably what we call the other world one detecting about her some odour of the worm with the feeling that here was rather ghost than woman And yet I can hardly convey to you the why of this except by dry details as to the contours of her lofty brow meagre lips pointed chin and ashen cheeks She was tall and deplorably emaciated her whole skeleton except the thigh bones being quite visible Her eyes were of the bluish hue of cigarette smoke and had in them the strangest feeble unearthly gaze while at thirty five her paltry wisp of hair was quite white She was well to do and lived alone in old Wooding Manor house five miles from Ash Thomas As you know I was beginning in these parts at the time and soon took up my residence at the manor She insisted that I should devote myself to her alone and that one patient constituted the most lucrative practice which I ever had Well I quickly found that in the state of trance Miss Wilson possessed very remarkable powers remarkable I mean not of course because peculiar to herself in kind but because they were so constant reliable exact and far reaching in degree The veriest fledgling in psychical science will now sit and discourse finically to you about the reporting powers of the mind in its trance state just as though it was something quite new This simple fact I assure you which the Psychical Research Society only after endless investigation admits to be scientific has been perfectly well known to every old crone since the Middle Ages and I assume long previously What an unnecessary air of discovery The certainty that someone in trance in Manchester can tell you what is going on in London or in Pekin was not of course left to the acumen of an office in Fleet Street and the society in establishing the fact beyond doubt for the general public has not gone one step toward explaining it They have in fact revealed nothing that many of us did not with absolute assurance know before But talking of poor Miss Wilson I say that her powers were remarkable because though not exceptional in genre they were so special in quantity so constant and far reaching I believe it to be a fact that in general the powers of trance manifest themselves more particularly with regard to space as distinct from time the spirit roams in the present it travels over a plain it does not usually attract the interest of observers by great ascents or by great descents I fancy that is so But Miss Wilson s gift was special to this extent that she travelled in every direction and easily in all but one north and south up and down in the past the present and the future This I discovered not at once but gradually She would emit a stream of sounds in the trance state I can hardly call it speech so murmurous yet guttural was the utterance mixed with puffy breath sounds at the languid lips This state was accompanied by an intense contraction of the pupils absence of the knee jerk considerable rigor and a rapt and arrant expression I got into the habit of sitting long hours at her bed side quite fascinated by her trying to catch the import of that opiate and visionary language which came puffing and fluttering in deliberate monotone from her lips Gradually in the course of months my ear learned to detect the words the veil was rent for me also and I was able to follow somewhat the course of her musing and wandering spirit At the end of six months I heard her one day repeat some words which were familiar to me They were these Such were the arts by which the Romans extended their conquests and attained the palm of victory and the concurring testimony of different authors enables us to describe them with precision I was startled they are part of Gibbon s Decline and Fall which I easily guessed that she had never read I said in a stern voice Where are you She replied Us are in a room eight hundred and eleven miles above A man is writing Us are reading I may tell you two things first that in trance she never spoke of herself as I nor even as we but for some unknown reason in the objective way as us us are she would say us will us went though of course she was an educated lady and I don t think ever lived in the West of England where 
7318_96151_000022_000002	train-clean-360	they say 
none	none	us in that way secondly when wandering in the past she always represented herself as being above the earth and higher the further back in time she went in describing present events she appears to have felt herself on the earth while as regards the future she invariably declared that us were so many miles within the earth To her excursions in this last direction however there seemed to exist certain fixed limits I say seemed for I cannot be sure and only mean that in spite of my efforts she never in fact went far in this direction Three four thousand miles were common figures on her lips in describing her distance above but her distance within never got beyond sixty three Usually she would say twenty twenty five She appeared in relation to the future to resemble a diver in the deep sea who the deeper he strives finds a more resistant pressure till at no great depth resistance becomes prohibition and he can no further strive I am afraid I can t go on though I had a good deal to tell you about this lady During fifteen years off and on I sat listening by her dim bed side to her murmuring trances At last my expert ear could detect the sense of her faintest sigh I heard the Decline and Fall from beginning to end Some of her reports were the most frivolous nonsense over others I have hung in a horror of interest Certainly my friend I have heard some amazing words proceed from those wan lips of Mary Wilson Sometimes I could hitch her repeatedly to any scene or subject that I chose by the mere exercise of my will at others the flighty waywardness of her spirit eluded and baffled me she resisted she disobeyed otherwise I might have sent you not four note books but twenty or forty About the fifth year it struck me that it would be well to jot down her more connected utterances since I knew shorthand The note book marked I one which seems to me the most curious belongs to the seventh year Its history like those of the other three is this I heard her one afternoon murmuring in the intonation used when reading the matter interested me I asked her where she was She replied Us are forty five miles within us read and another writes from which I concluded that she was some fifteen to thirty years in the future perusing an as yet unpublished work After that during some weeks I managed to keep her to the same subject and finally I fancy won pretty well the whole work I believe you would find it striking and hope you will be able to read my notes But no more of Mary Wilson now Rather let us think a little of A L Browne F R C P with a breathing tube in his trachea and Eternity under his pillow doctor Browne s letter then continues on a subject of no interest here The present writer may add that doctor Browne s prognosis of his own case proved correct for he passed away two days after writing the above My transcription of the shorthand book marked III I now proceed to give without comment merely reminding the reader that the words form the substance of a book or document to be written or to be motived according to Miss Wilson in that Future which no less than the Past substantively exists in the Present though like the Past we see it not I need only add that the title division into paragraphs c have been arbitrarily contrived by myself for the sake of form and convenience Footnote one This I intend to publish under the title of The Last Miracle II will bear that of The Lord of the Sea the present book is marked III The perusal of IV I have yet finished but so far do not consider it suitable for publication Here begins the note book marked III THE PURPLE CLOUD Well the memory seems to be getting rather impaired now rather weak What for instance was the name of that parson who preached just before the Boreal set out about the wickedness of any further attempt to reach the North Pole 
7376-96150-0000	train-other-500	I have forgotten Yet four years ago it was familiar to me as my own name Things which took place before the voyage seem to be getting a little cloudy in the memory now I have sat here
none	none	 in the loggia of this Cornish villa 
7376-96150-0001	train-other-500	to write down some sort of account of what has happened God knows why since no eye can ever read it and at the very beginning I cannot remember the parson s name
none	none	 He was a strange sort of man surely 
7376-96150-0002	train-other-500	a Scotchman from Ayrshire big and gaunt with tawny hair He used to go about London streets in shough and rough spun clothes a plaid flung from one shoulder Once I saw him in Holborn with his rather wild stalk
7376-96150-0003	train-other-500	frowning and muttering to himself He had no sooner come to London and opened chapel I think in Fetter Lane than the little room began to be crowded and when some years afterwards
none	none	 he moved to a big establishment in Kensington all sorts of men even from America and Australia flocked to hear the thunderstorms that he talked though certainly it was not an age apt to fly into enthusiasms over that species of pulpit prophets and prophecies But this particular man undoubtedly did wake the strong dark feelings that sleep in the heart his eyes were very singular and powerful 
7376-96150-0004	train-other-500	his voice from a whisper ran gathering like snow balls and crashed as I have heard the pack ice in commotion far yonder in the North while his gestures were as uncouth and gawky
7376-96150-0005	train-other-500	as some wild man s of the primitive ages Well this man what was his name Macintosh Mackay I think yes that was it Mackay
7376-96150-0006	train-other-500	Mackay saw fit to take offence at the new attempt to reach the Pole in the Boreal and for three Sundays when the preparations were nearing completion stormed against it at Kensington
7376-96150-0007	train-other-500	The excitement of the world with regard to the North Pole had at this date reached a pitch which can only be described as fevered though that word hardly expresses the strange ecstasy and unrest which prevailed
7376-96150-0008	train-other-500	for the abstract interest which mankind in mere desire for knowledge had always felt in this unknown region was now suddenly a thousand and a thousand times intensified
7376-96150-0009	train-other-500	by a new concrete interest a tremendous money interest And the new zeal had ceased to be healthy in its tone as the old zeal was
none	none	 for now the fierce demon Mammon was making his voice heard in this matter Within the ten years preceding the Boreal expedition no less than twenty seven expeditions had set out and failed 
7376-96150-0010	train-other-500	The secret of this new rage lay in the last will and testament of mister Charles P Stickney of Chicago
none	none	 that king of faddists supposed to be the richest individual who ever lived he just ten years before the Boreal undertaking had died bequeathing one hundred seventy five million dollars to the man of whatever nationality who first reached the Pole Such was the actual wording of the will the man who first reached 
7376-96150-0011	train-other-500	and from this loose method of designating the person intended had immediately burst forth a prolonged heat of controversy in Europe and America as to whether or no the testator meant the Chief
none	none	 of the first expedition which reached but it was finally decided on the highest legal authority that in any case the actual wording of the document held good and that it was the individual 
7376-96150-0012	train-other-500	whatever his station in the expedition whose foot first reached the ninetieth degree of north latitude
none	none	 who would have title to the fortune At all events the public ferment had risen as I say to a pitch of positive fever and as to the Boreal in particular the daily progress of her preparations was minutely discussed in the newspapers 
7376-96150-0013	train-other-500	everyone was an authority on her fitting and she was in every mouth a bet a hope a jest or a sneer for now at last it was felt that success was probable
none	none	 So this Mackay had an acutely interested audience if a somewhat startled and a somewhat cynical one A truly lion hearted man this must have been after all to dare proclaim a point of view so at variance with the spirit of his age One against four hundred millions they bent one way he the opposite saying that they were wrong all wrong People used to call him John the Baptist Redivivus 
7376-96150-0014	train-other-500	and without doubt he did suggest something of that sort I suppose that at the time when he had the face to denounce the Boreal there was not a sovereign on any throne in Europe who
7376-96150-0015	train-other-500	but for shame would have been glad of a subordinate post on board On the third Sunday night of his denunciation I was there in that Kensington chapel and I heard him
7376-96150-0016	train-other-500	And the wild talk he talked He seemed like a man delirious with inspiration The people sat quite spell bound while Mackay s prophesying voice ranged up and down through all the modulations of thunder
7376-96150-0017	train-other-500	from the hurrying mutter to the reverberant shock and climax and those who came to scoff remained to wonder Put simply
none	none	 what he said was this That there was undoubtedly some sort of Fate or Doom connected with the Poles of the earth in reference to the human race that man s continued failure in spite of continual efforts to reach them abundantly and super abundantly proved this and that this failure constituted a lesson and a warning which the race disregarded at its peril 
7376-96150-0018	train-other-500	The North Pole he said was not so very far away and the difficulties in the way of reaching it were not on the face of them so very great
7376-96150-0019	train-other-500	human ingenuity had achieved a thousand things a thousand times more difficult yet in spite of over half a dozen well planned efforts in the nineteenth century
7376-96150-0020	train-other-500	and thirty one in the twentieth man had never reached always he had been baulked
none	none	 baulked by some seeming chance some restraining Hand and herein lay the lesson herein the warning 
7376-96150-0021	train-other-500	Wonderfully really wonderfully like the Tree of Knowledge in Eden he said was that Pole
none	none	 all the rest of earth lying open and offered to man but That 
7376-96150-0022	train-other-500	persistently veiled and forbidden
none	none	 It was as when a father lays a hand upon his son with Not here my child wheresoever you will but not here But human beings he said were free agents with power to stop their ears and turn a callous consciousness to the whispers and warning indications of Heaven 
7376-96150-0023	train-other-500	and he believed he said that the time was now come when man would find it absolutely in his power to stand on that ninetieth of latitude and plant an impious right foot on the head of the earth
7376-96150-0024	train-other-500	just as it had been given into the absolute power of Adam to stretch an impious right hand and pluck of the Fruit of Knowledge
none	none	 but said he his voice pealing now into one long proclamation of awful augury just as the abuse of that power had been followed in the one case by catastrophe swift and universal so in the other he warned the entire race to look out thenceforth for nothing from God but a lowering sky and thundery weather 
7376-96150-0025	train-other-500	The man s frantic earnestness authoritative voice and savage gestures could not but have their effect upon all as for me I declare I sat as though a messenger from Heaven addressed me
7376-96150-0026	train-other-500	But I believe that I had not yet reached home
none	none	 when the whole impression of the discourse had passed from me like water from a duck s back The Prophet in the twentieth century was not a success John Baptist himself camel skin and all would have met with only tolerant shrugs I dismissed Mackay from my mind with the thought 
7376-96150-0027	train-other-500	He is behind his age I suppose But haven t I thought differently of Mackay since my God Three weeks it was about that before that Sunday night discourse I was visited by Clark
7376-96150-0028	train-other-500	the chief of the coming expedition a mere visit of friendship
none	none	 I had then been established about a year at No II Harley Street 
7376-96150-0029	train-other-500	and though under twenty five had I suppose as elite a practice as any doctor in Europe Elite but small I was able to maintain my state and move among the great
none	none	 but now and again I would feel the secret pinch of moneylessness Just about that time in fact I was only saved from considerable embarrassment by the success of my book Applications of Science to the Arts 
7376-96150-0030	train-other-500	In the course of conversation that afternoon Clark said to me in his light hap hazard way Do you know what I dreamed about you last night Adam Jeffson I dreamed that you were with us on the expedition I think he must have seen my start
7376-96150-0031	train-other-500	on the same night I had myself dreamed the same thing but not a word said I about it now There was a stammer in my tongue when I answered Who I on the expedition I would not go if I were asked
none	none	 Oh you would I wouldn t You forget that I am about to be married 
7376-96150-0032	train-other-500	Well we need not discuss the point
none	none	 as Peters is not going to die said he Still if anything did happen to him you know it is you I should come straight to Adam Jeffson Clark you jest I said 
7376-96150-0033	train-other-500	I know really very little of astronomy or magnetic phenomena Besides I am about to be married But what about your botany my friend
none	none	 There s what we should be wanting from you 
7376-96150-0034	train-other-500	and as for nautical astronomy poh
none	none	 a man with your scientific habit would pick all that up in no time You discuss the matter as gravely as though it were a possibility Clark 
7376-96150-0035	train-other-500	I said smiling Such a thought would never enter my head there is first of all my fiancee Ah the all important Countess eh
none	none	 Well but she as far as I know the lady would be the first to force you to go 
7376-96150-0036	train-other-500	The chance of stamping one s foot on the North Pole does not occur to a man every day my son Do talk of something else I said There is Peters Well of course there is Peters But believe me the dream I had was so clear
none	none	 Let me alone with your dreams and your Poles I laughed Yes I remember I pretended to laugh loud But my secret heart knew even then that one of those crises was occurring in my life which from my youth 
7376-96150-0037	train-other-500	has made it the most extraordinary which any creature of earth ever lived And I knew that this was so firstly because of the two dreams and secondly
none	none	 because when Clark was gone and I was drawing on my gloves to go to see my fiancee I heard distinctly the old two Voices talk within me and One said Go not to see her now and the Other Yes go go The two Voices of my life 
7376-96150-0038	train-other-500	An ordinary person reading my words would undoubtedly imagine that I mean only two ordinary contradictory impulses or else that I rave for what modern man could comprehend how real seeming were those voices
7376-96150-0039	train-other-500	how loud and how ever and again I heard them contend within me with a nearness
none	none	 nearer than breathing as it says in the poem and closer than hands and feet About the age of seven it happened first to me 
7376-96150-0040	train-other-500	I was playing one summer evening in a pine wood of my father s half a mile away was a quarry cliff and as I played it suddenly seemed as if someone said to me inside of me Just take a walk toward the cliff and as if someone else said
7376-96150-0041	train-other-500	Don t go that way at all mere whispers then which gradually as I grew up seemed to swell into cries of wrathful contention I did go toward the cliff it was steep thirty feet high
7376-96150-0042	train-other-500	and I fell Some weeks later on recovering speech I told my astonished mother that someone had pushed me over the edge and that someone else had caught me at the bottom
none	none	 One night soon after my eleventh birthday lying in bed the thought struck me that my life must be of great importance to some thing or things which I could not see 
7376-96150-0043	train-other-500	that two Powers which hated each other must be continually after me one wishing for some reason to kill me and the other for some reason to keep me alive one wishing me to do so and so
none	none	 and the other to do the opposite that I was not a boy like other boys 
7376-96150-0044	train-other-500	but a creature separate special marked for something Already I had notions touches of mood passing instincts
none	none	 as occult and primitive I verily believe as those of the first man that stepped so that such Biblical expressions as The Lord spake to So and so saying 
7376-96150-0045	train-other-500	have hardly ever suggested any question in my mind as to how the Voice was heard I did not find it so very difficult to comprehend that originally man had more ears than two
none	none	 nor should have been surprised to know that I in these latter days 
7376-96150-0046	train-other-500	more or less resembled those primeval ones But not a creature except perhaps my mother has ever dreamed me what I here state that I was I seemed the ordinary youth of my time bow in my Varsity eight
7376-96150-0047	train-other-500	cramming for exams dawdling in clubs When I had to decide as to a profession who could have suspected the conflict that transacted itself in my soul while my brain was indifferent to the matter
7376-96150-0048	train-other-500	that agony of strife with which the brawling voices shouted the one Be a scientist a doctor and the other Be a lawyer an engineer an artist be anything but a doctor A doctor I became
7376-96150-0049	train-other-500	and went to what had grown into the greatest of medical schools Cambridge and there it was that I came across a man named Scotland who had a rather odd view of the world He had rooms I remember in the New Court at Trinity
7376-96150-0050	train-other-500	and a set of us were generally there He was always talking about certain Black and White Powers till it became absurd and the men used to call him black and white mystery man
none	none	 because one day when someone said something about the black mystery of the universe Scotland interrupted him with the words the black and white mystery Quite well I remember Scotland now the sweetest gentle soul he was with a passion for cats and Sappho and the Anthology very short in stature with a Roman nose continually making the effort to keep his neck straight and draw his paunch in He used to say that the universe was being frantically contended for by two Powers a White and a Black that the White was the stronger but did not find the conditions on our particular planet very favourable to his success that he had got the best of it up to the Middle Ages in Europe but since then had been slowly and stubbornly giving way before the Black and that finally the Black would win not everywhere perhaps but here and would carry off if no other earth at least this one for his prize This was Scotland s doctrine which he never tired of repeating and while others heard him with mere toleration little could they divine with what agony of inward interest I cynically smiling there drank in his words Most profound most profound was the impression they made upon me But I was saying that when Clark left me I was drawing on my gloves to go to see my fiancee the Countess Clodagh when I heard the two voices most clearly Sometimes the urgency of one or other impulse is so overpowering that there is no resisting it and it was so then with the one that bid me go I had to traverse the distance between Harley Street and Hanover Square and all the time it was as though something shouted at my physical ear Since you go breathe no word of the Boreal and Clark s visit and another shout Tell tell hide nothing It seemed to last a month yet it was only some minutes before I was in Hanover Square and Clodagh in my arms 
7318_96151_000004_000000	train-clean-360	She was in my opinion the most superb of creatures Clodagh that haughty neck which seemed always scorning something just behind her left shoulder 
none	none	Superb but ah I know it now a godless woman Clodagh a bitter heart Clodagh once confessed to me that her favourite character in history was Lucrezia Borgia and when she saw my horror immediately added Well no I am only joking Such was her duplicity for I see now that she lived in the constant effort to hide her heinous heart from me Yet now I think of it how completely did Clodagh enthral me Our proposed marriage was opposed by both my family and hers by mine because her father and grandfather had died in lunatic asylums and by hers because forsooth I was neither a rich nor a noble match A sister of hers much older than herself had married a common country doctor Peters of Taunton and this so called mesalliance made the so called mesalliance with me doubly detestable in the eyes of her relatives But Clodagh s extraordinary passion for me was to be stemmed neither by their threats nor prayers What a flame after all was Clodagh 
7318_96151_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Sometimes she frightened me 
7318_96151_000007_000000	train-clean-360	She was at this date no longer young being by five years my senior as also by five years the senior of her nephew born from the marriage of her sister with Peters of Taunton 
none	none	This nephew was Peter Peters who was to accompany the Boreal expedition as doctor botanist and meteorological assistant 
7318_96151_000008_000000	train-clean-360	On that day of Clark s visit to me I had not been seated five minutes with Clodagh when I said 
none	none	doctor 
7318_96151_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Clark ha ha 
7318_96151_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 ha ha 
none	none	ha has been talking to me about the Expedition 
7318_96151_000009_000003	train-clean-360	He says that if anything happened to Peters I should be the first man he would run to 
7318_96151_000009_000004	train-clean-360	He has had an absurd dream 
none	none	The consciousness that filled me as I uttered these words was the wickedness of me the crooked wickedness 
7318_96151_000010_000001	train-clean-360	But I could no more help it than I could fly 
none	none	Clodagh was standing at a window holding a rose at her face For quite a minute she made no reply 
7318_96151_000011_000002	train-clean-360	I saw her sharp cut florid face in profile steadily bent and smelling 
7318_96151_000011_000003	train-clean-360	She said presently in her cold rapid way 
7318_96151_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 The man who first plants his foot on the North Pole will certainly be ennobled 
7318_96151_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I say nothing of the many millions 
7318_96151_000012_000002	train-clean-360	I only wish that I was a man 
7318_96151_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know that I have any special ambition that way I rejoined 
7318_96151_000060_000001	train-clean-360	I don t know 
none	none	that I have any special ambition that way I rejoined
7318_96151_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 I am very happy in my warm Eden with my Clodagh 
7318_96151_000013_000002	train-clean-360	I don t like the outer Cold 
7318_96151_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t let me think little of you she answered pettishly 
7318_96151_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Why should you Clodagh 
7318_96151_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I am not bound to desire to go to the North Pole am I 
none	none	But you would go I suppose if you could
7318_96151_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 I might I doubt it 
7318_96151_000017_000001	train-clean-360	There is our marriage 
7318_96151_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Marriage indeed 
none	none	It is the one thing to transform our marriage from a sneaking difficulty to a ten times triumphant event You mean if I personally were the first to stand at the Pole 
7318_96151_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But there are many in an expedition 
none	none	It is very unlikely that I personally For me you will Adam she began Will Clodagh I cried You say will there is not even the slightest shadow of a probability
7318_96151_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 But why 
none	none	There are still three weeks before the start They say 
7318_96151_000023_000000	train-clean-360	She stopped she stopped 
none	none	They say what 
7318_96151_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Her voice dropped 
7318_96151_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 That Peter takes atropine 
7318_96151_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 atropine 
none	none	Ah I started then 
7318_96151_000027_000001	train-clean-360	She moved from the window sat in a rocking chair and turned the leaves of a book without reading 
7318_96151_000027_000002	train-clean-360	We were silent she and I I standing looking at her she drawing the thumb across the leaf edges and beginning again contemplatively 
7318_96151_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Then she laughed dryly a little a dry mad laugh 
7318_96151_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did you start when I said that she asked reading now at random 
none	none	I 
7318_96151_000029_000003	train-clean-360	I did not start 
7318_96151_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I did not start Clodagh 
7318_96151_000029_000002	train-clean-360	What made you think that I started 
none	none	I did not start 
7318_96151_000029_000004	train-clean-360	Who told you Clodagh that Peters takes atropine 
none	none	He is my nephew I should know 
7318_96151_000030_000001	train-clean-360	But don t look dumbfoundered in that absurd fashion I have no intention of poisoning him in order to see you a multimillionaire and a Peer of the Realm 
7318_96151_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 My dearest Clodagh 
7318_96151_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I easily might however 
7318_96151_000032_000001	train-clean-360	He will be here presently 
7318_96151_000032_000002	train-clean-360	He is bringing mister Wilson for the evening Wilson was going as electrician of the expedition 
none	none	Clodagh I said believe me you jest in a manner which does not please me Do I really she answered with that haughty stiff half turn of her throat then I must be more exquisite But thank Heaven it is only a jest 
7318_96151_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Women are no longer admired for doing such things 
none	none	Ha ha ha no no longer admired Clodagh 
7318_96151_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Oh my good Lord let us change this talk 
7318_96151_000036_000000	train-clean-360	But now she could talk of nothing else 
7318_96151_000036_000001	train-clean-360	She got from me that afternoon the history of all the Polar expeditions of late years how far they reached by what aids and why they failed 
none	none	Her eyes shone she listened eagerly Before this time indeed she had been interested in the Boreal knew the details of her outfitting and was acquainted with several members of the expedition 
7318_96151_000036_000004	train-clean-360	But now suddenly her mind seemed wholly possessed my mention of Clark s visit apparently setting her well a burn with the Pole fever 
none	none	The passion of her kiss as I tore myself from her embrace that day I shall not forget 
7318_96151_000037_000001	train-clean-360	I went home with a pretty heavy heart 
7318_96151_000038_000000	train-clean-360	The house of doctor Peter Peters was three doors from mine on the opposite side of the street 
7318_96151_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Toward one that night his footman ran to knock me up with the news that Peters was very ill 
7318_96151_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I hurried to his bed side and knew by the first glance at his deliriums and his staring pupils that he was poisoned with atropine 
none	none	Wilson the electrician who had passed the evening with him at Clodagh s in Hanover Square was there
7318_96151_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 What on earth is the matter he said to me 
7318_96151_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Poisoned I answered 
7318_96151_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Good God what with 
none	none	Atropine
7318_96151_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Good Heavens 
7318_96151_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t be frightened I think he will recover 
7318_96151_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that certain 
7318_96151_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I think that is if he leaves off taking the drug Wilson 
none	none	What it is he who has poisoned himself 
7318_96151_000048_000000	train-clean-360	I hesitated I hesitated 
7318_96151_000048_000001	train-clean-360	But I said 
none	none	He is in the habit of taking atropine Wilson Three hours I remained there and God knows toiled hard for his life and when I left him in the dark of the fore day my mind was at rest he would recover 
7318_96151_000051_000000	train-clean-360	I slept till eleven A M and then hurried over again to Peters 
none	none	In the room were my two nurses and Clodagh 
7318_96151_000052_000000	train-clean-360	My beloved put her forefinger to her lips whispering 
none	none	Sh h h he is asleep 
7318_96151_000054_000000	train-clean-360	She came closer to my ear saying 
7318_96151_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I heard the news early 
7318_96151_000055_000001	train-clean-360	I am come to stay with him till the last 
7318_96151_000056_000000	train-clean-360	We looked at each other some time eye to eye steadily she and I but mine dropped before Clodagh s 
7318_96151_000056_000001	train-clean-360	A word was on my mouth to say but I said nothing 
7318_96151_000057_000000	train-clean-360	The recovery of Peters was not so steady as I had expected 
7318_96151_000057_000001	train-clean-360	At the end of the first week he was still prostrate 
7318_96151_000057_000002	train-clean-360	It was then that I said to Clodagh 
7318_96151_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Clodagh your presence at the bed side here somehow does not please me It is so unnecessary 
7318_96151_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Unnecessary certainly she replied but I always had a genius for nursing and a passion for watching the battles of the body 
none	none	Since no one objects why should you Ah I don t know 
7318_96151_000060_000002	train-clean-360	This is a case that I dislike 
7318_96151_000060_000003	train-clean-360	I have half a mind to throw it to the devil 
7318_96151_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Then do so 
7318_96151_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 And you too go home go home Clodagh 
none	none	But why if one does no harm 
7318_96151_000063_000001	train-clean-360	In these days of the corruption of the upper classes and Roman decadence of everything shouldn t every innocent whim be encouraged by you upright ones who strive against the tide 
7318_96151_000063_000002	train-clean-360	Whims are the brakes of crimes and this is mine 
none	none	I find a sensuous pleasure almost a sensual in dabbling in delicate drugs like Helen for that matter and Medea and Calypso and the great antique women who were all excellent chymists To study the human ship in a gale and the slow drama of its foundering isn t that a quite thrilling distraction 
7318_96151_000063_000005	train-clean-360	And I want you to get into the habit at once of letting me have my little way 
7318_96151_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Now she touched my hair with a lofty playfulness that soothed me but even then I looked upon the rumpled bed and saw that the man there was really very sick 
7318_96151_000065_000000	train-clean-360	I have still a nausea to write about it 
7318_96151_000065_000001	train-clean-360	Lucrezia Borgia in her own age may have been heroic but Lucrezia in this late century 
7318_96151_000065_000002	train-clean-360	One could retch up the heart 
none	none	The man grew sick on that bed I say 
7318_96151_000066_000001	train-clean-360	The second week passed and only ten days remained before the start of the expedition 
7318_96151_000067_000000	train-clean-360	At the end of that second week Wilson the electrician was one evening sitting by Peter s bedside when I entered 
none	none	At the moment Clodagh was about to administer a dose to Peters but seeing me she put down the medicine glass on the night table and came toward me and as she came I saw a sight which stabbed me for Wilson took up the deposited medicine glass elevated it looked at it smelled into it and he did it with a kind of hurried light fingered stealth and he did it with an under look and a meaningness of expression which I thought proved mistrust 
7318_96151_000069_000000	train-clean-360	Meantime Clark came each day 
none	none	He had himself a medical degree and about this time I called him in professionally together with Alleyne of Cavendish Square to consultation over Peters 
7318_96151_000069_000002	train-clean-360	The patient lay in a semi coma broken by passionate vomitings and his condition puzzled us all 
7318_96151_000069_000003	train-clean-360	I formally stated that he took atropine had been originally poisoned by atropine but we saw that his present symptoms were not atropine symptoms but it almost seemed of some other vegetable poison which we could not precisely name 
7318_96151_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 Mysterious thing said Clark to me when we were alone 
none	none	I don t understand it I said
7318_96151_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Who are the two nurses 
7318_96151_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh highly recommended people of my own 
none	none	At any rate my dream about you comes true Jeffson 
7318_96151_000074_000001	train-clean-360	It is clear that Peters is out of the running now 
7318_96151_000075_000000	train-clean-360	I shrugged 
7318_96151_000076_000000	train-clean-360	 I now formally invite you to join the expedition said Clark do you consent 
7318_96151_000077_000000	train-clean-360	I shrugged again 
7318_96151_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 Well if that means consent he said let me remind you that you have only eight days and all the world to do in them 
7318_96151_000079_000000	train-clean-360	This conversation occurred in the dining room of Peters house and as we passed through the door I saw Clodagh gliding down the passage outside rapidly away from us 
7318_96151_000080_000000	train-clean-360	Not a word I said to her that day about Clark s invitation 
7318_96151_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Yet I asked myself repeatedly Did she not know of it 
none	none	Had she not listened and heard 
7318_96151_000081_000000	train-clean-360	However that was about midnight to my great surprise Peters opened his eyes and smiled 
7318_96151_000081_000001	train-clean-360	By noon the next day his fine vitality which so fitted him for an Arctic expedition had re asserted itself 
7318_96151_000081_000002	train-clean-360	He was then leaning on an elbow talking to Wilson and except his pallor and strong stomach pains there was now hardly a trace of his late approach to death 
7318_96151_000081_000003	train-clean-360	For the pains I prescribed some quarter grain tablets of sulphate of morphia and went away 
7318_96151_000082_000000	train-clean-360	Now David Wilson and I never greatly loved each other and that very day he brought about a painful situation as between Peters and me by telling Peters that I had taken his place in the expedition 
7318_96151_000082_000001	train-clean-360	Peters a touchy fellow at once dictated a letter of protest to Clark and Clark sent Peters letter to me marked with a big note of interrogation in blue pencil 
none	none	Now all Peters preparations were made mine not and he had six days in which to recover himself I therefore wrote to Clark saying that the changed circumstances of course annulled my acceptance of his offer though I had already incurred the inconvenience of negotiating with a locum tenens 
7318_96151_000084_000000	train-clean-360	This decided it Peters was to go I stay 
none	none	The fifth day before the departure dawned It was a Friday the fifteenth June 
7318_96151_000084_000003	train-clean-360	Peters was now in an arm chair 
7318_96151_000084_000004	train-clean-360	He was cheerful but with a fevered pulse and still the stomach pains 
7318_96151_000084_000005	train-clean-360	I was giving him three quarter grains of morphia a day That Friday night at eleven P M I visited him and found Clodagh there talking to him 
none	none	Peters was smoking a cigar
7318_96151_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah Clodagh said I was waiting for you Adam 
7318_96151_000085_000001	train-clean-360	I didn t know whether I was to inject anything to night 
7318_96151_000085_000002	train-clean-360	Is it Yes or No 
7318_96151_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think Peters I said any more pains 
7318_96151_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Well perhaps you had better give us another quarter he answered there s still some trouble in the tummy off and on 
7318_96151_000088_000000	train-clean-360	 A quarter grain then Clodagh I said 
7318_96151_000089_000000	train-clean-360	As she opened the syringe box she remarked with a pout 
7318_96151_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Our patient has been naughty 
7318_96151_000090_000001	train-clean-360	He has taken some more atropine 
7318_96151_000091_000000	train-clean-360	I became angry at once 
7318_96151_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Peters I cried you know you have no right to be doing things like that without consulting me 
7318_96151_000092_000001	train-clean-360	Do that once more and I swear I have nothing further to do with you 
none	none	Rubbish said Peters why all this unnecessary heat 
7318_96151_000093_000001	train-clean-360	It was a mere flea bite 
7318_96151_000093_000002	train-clean-360	I felt that I needed it 
none	none	He injected it with his own hand remarked Clodagh She was now standing at the mantel piece having lifted the syringe box from the night table taken from its velvet lining both the syringe and the vial containing the morphia tablets and gone to the mantel piece to melt one of the tablets in a little of the distilled water there 
7318_96151_000095_000001	train-clean-360	Her back was turned upon us and she was a long time 
7318_96151_000095_000002	train-clean-360	I was standing Peters in his arm chair smoking 
none	none	Clodagh then began to talk about a Charity Bazaar which she had visited that afternoon She was long she was long The crazy thought passed through some dim region of my soul Why is she so long Ah that was a pain went Peters never mind the bazaar aunt think of the morphia Suddenly an irresistible impulse seized me to rush upon her to dash syringe tabloids glass and all from her hands I must have obeyed it I was on the tip top point of obeying my body already leant prone but at that instant a voice at the opened door behind me said
7318_96151_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 Well how is everything 
none	none	It was Wilson the electrician who stood there 
7318_96151_000100_000001	train-clean-360	With lightning swiftness I remembered an under look of mistrust which I had once seen on his face 
none	none	Oh well I would not and could not she was my love I stood like marble 
7318_96151_000101_000000	train-clean-360	Clodagh went to meet Wilson with frank right hand in the left being the fragile glass containing the injection 
7318_96151_000101_000001	train-clean-360	My eyes were fastened on her face it was full of reassurance of free innocence 
7318_96151_000101_000002	train-clean-360	I said to myself I must surely be mad 
7318_96151_000102_000000	train-clean-360	An ordinary chat began while Clodagh turned up Peters sleeve and kneeling there injected his fore arm 
7318_96151_000102_000001	train-clean-360	As she rose laughing at something said by Wilson the drug glass dropped from her hand and her heel by an apparent accident trod on it 
none	none	She put the syringe among a number of others on the mantel piece
7318_96151_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 Your friend has been naughty mister Wilson she said again with that same pout he has been taking more atropine 
none	none	Not really said Wilson
7318_96151_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me alone the whole of you answered Peters I ain t a child 
7318_96151_000106_000000	train-clean-360	These were the last intelligible words he ever spoke 
7318_96151_000106_000001	train-clean-360	He died shortly before one A M 
7318_96151_000106_000002	train-clean-360	He had been poisoned by a powerful dose of atropine 
none	none	From that moment to the moment when the Boreal bore me down the Thames all the world was a mere tumbling nightmare to me of which hardly any detail remains in my memory 
7318_96151_000107_000001	train-clean-360	Only I remember the inquest and how I was called upon to prove that Peters had himself injected himself with atropine 
7318_96151_000107_000002	train-clean-360	This was corroborated by Wilson and by Clodagh and the verdict was in accordance 
7318_96151_000108_000000	train-clean-360	And in all that chaotic hurry of preparation three other things only but those with clear distinctness now I remember 
7318_96151_000109_000000	train-clean-360	The first and chief is that tempest of words which I heard at Kensington from that big mouthed Mackay on the Sunday night 
none	none	What was it that led me busy as I was to that chapel that night 
7318_96151_000109_000002	train-clean-360	Well perhaps I know 
7318_96151_000110_000000	train-clean-360	There I sat and heard him and most strangely have those words of his peroration planted themselves in my brain when rising to a passion of prophecy he shouted And as in the one case transgression was followed by catastrophe swift and universal so in the other I warn the entire race to look out thenceforth for nothing from God but a lowering sky and thundery weather 
7318_96151_000111_000000	train-clean-360	And this second thing I remember that on reaching home I walked into my disordered library for I had had to hunt out some books where I met my housekeeper in the act of rearranging things 
7318_96151_000111_000001	train-clean-360	She had apparently lifted an old Bible by the front cover to fling it on the table for as I threw myself into a chair my eye fell upon the open print near the beginning 
7318_96151_000111_000002	train-clean-360	The print was very large and a shaded lamp cast a light upon it 
7318_96151_000111_000003	train-clean-360	I had been hearing Mackay s wild comparison of the Pole with the tree of Eden and that no doubt was the reason why such a start convulsed me for my listless eyes had chanced to rest upon some words

none	none	And a third thing I remember in all that turmoil of doubt and flurry that as the ship moved down with the afternoon tide a telegram was put into my hand it was a last word from Clodagh and she said only this Be first for Me The Boreal left saint Katherine s Docks in beautiful weather on the afternoon of the nineteenth June full of good hope bound for the Pole All about the docks was one region of heads stretched far in innumerable vagueness and down the river to Woolwich a continuous dull roar and murmur of bees droned from both banks to cheer our departure The expedition was partly a national affair subvented by Government and if ever ship was well found it was the Boreal She had a frame tougher far than any battle ship s capable of ramming some ten yards of drift ice and she was stuffed with sufficient pemmican codroe fish meal and so on to last us not less than six years We were seventeen all told the five Heads so to speak of the undertaking being Clark our Chief John Mew commander Aubrey Maitland meteorologist Wilson electrician and myself doctor botanist and assistant meteorologist The idea was to get as far east as the one hundred deg or the one hundred twenty deg of longitude to catch there the northern current to push and drift our way northward and when the ship could no further penetrate to leave her either three or else four of us on ski and with sledges drawn by dogs and reindeer make a dash for the Pole This had also been the plan of the last expedition that of the Nix and of several others The Boreal only differed from the Nix and others in that she was a thing of nicer design and of more exquisite forethought Our voyage was without incident up to the end of July when we encountered a drift of ice floes On the first August we were at Kabarova where we met our coal ship and took in a little coal for emergency liquid air being our proper motor also forty three dogs four reindeer and a quantity of reindeer moss and two days later we turned our bows finally northward and eastward passing through heavy slack ice under sail and liquid air in crisp weather till on the twenty seventh August we lay moored to a floe off the desolate island of Taimur The first thing which we saw here was a bear on the shore watching for young white fish and promptly Clark Mew and Lamburn engineer went on shore in the launch I and Maitland following in the pram each party with three dogs It was while climbing away inland that Maitland said to me When Clark leaves the ship for the dash to the Pole it is three not two of us after all that he is going to take with him making a party of four I Is that so Who knows Maitland Wilson does Clark has let it out in conversation with Wilson I Well the more the merrier Who will be the three Maitland Wilson is sure to be in it and there may be Mew making the third As to the fourth I suppose I shall get left out in the cold I More likely I Maitland Well the race is between us four Wilson Mew you and I It is a question of physical fitness combined with special knowledge You are too lucky a dog to get left out Jeffson I Well what does it matter so long as the expedition as a whole is successful That is the main thing Maitland Oh yes that s all very fine talk Jeffson But is it quite sincere Isn t it rather a pose to affect to despise one hundred seventy five million dollars I want to be in at the death and I mean to be if I can We are all more or less self interested Look I whispered a bear It was a mother and cub and with determined trudge she came wagging her low head having no doubt smelled the dogs We separated on the instant doubling different ways behind ice boulders wanting her to go on nearer the shore before killing but passing close she spied and bore down at a trot upon me I fired into her neck and at once with a roar she turned tail making now straight in Maitland s direction I saw him run out from cover some hundred yards away aiming his long gun but no report followed and in half a minute he was under her fore paws she striking out slaps at the barking shrinking dogs Maitland roared for my help and at that moment I poor wretch in far worse plight than he stood shivering in ague for suddenly one of those wrangles of the voices of my destiny was filling my bosom with loud commotion one urging me to fly to Maitland s aid one passionately commanding me be still But it lasted I believe some seconds only I ran and got a shot into the bear s brain and Maitland leapt up with a rent down his face But singular destiny Whatever I did if I did evil if I did good the result was the same tragedy dark and sinister Poor Maitland was doomed that voyage and my rescue of his life was the means employed to make his death the more certain I think that I have already written some pages back about a man called Scotland whom I met at Cambridge He was always talking about certain Black and White beings and their contention for the earth We others used to call him the black and white mystery man because one day but that is no matter now Well with regard to all that I have a fancy a whim of the mind quite wide of the truth no doubt but I have it here in my brain and I will write it down now It is this that there may have been some sort of arrangement or understanding between Black and White as in the case of Adam and the fruit that should mankind force his way to the Pole and the old forbidden secret biding there then some mishap should not fail to overtake the race of man that the White being kindly disposed to mankind did not wish this to occur and intended for the sake of the race to destroy our entire expedition before it reached and that the Black knowing that the White meant to do this and by what means used me me to outwit this design first of all working that I should be one of the party of four to leave the ship on ski But the childish attempt my God to read the immense riddle of the world I could laugh loud at myself and at poor Black and White Scotland too The thing can t be so simple Well we left Taimur the same day and good bye now to both land and open sea Till we passed the latitude of Cape Chelyuskin which we did not sight it was one succession of ice belts with Mew in the crow s nest tormenting the electric bell to the engine room the anchor hanging ready to drop and Clark taking soundings Progress was slow and the Polar night gathered round us apace as we stole still onward and onward into that blue and glimmering land of eternal frore We now left off bed coverings of reindeer skin and took to sleeping bags Eight of the dogs had died by the twenty fifth September when we were experiencing nineteen deg of frost In the darkest part of our night the Northern Light spread its silent solemn banner over us quivering round the heavens in a million fickle gauds The relations between the members of our little crew were excellent with one exception David Wilson and I were not good friends There was a something a tone in the evidence which he had given at the inquest on Peters which made me mad every time I thought of it He had heard Peters admit just before death that he Peters had administered atropine to himself and he had had to give evidence of that fact But he had given it in a most half hearted way so much so that the coroner had asked him What sir are you hiding from me Wilson had replied Nothing I have nothing to tell And from that day he and I had hardly exchanged ten words in spite of our constant companionship in the vessel and one day standing alone on a floe I found myself hissing with clenched fist If he dared suspect Clodagh of poisoning Peters I could kill him Up to seventy eight deg of latitude the weather had been superb but on the night of the seventh October well I remember it we experienced a great storm Our tub of a ship rolled like a swing drenching the whimpering dogs at every lurch and hurling everything on board into confusion The petroleum launch was washed from the davits down at one time to forty deg below zero sank the thermometer while a high aurora was whiffed into a dishevelled chaos of hues resembling the smeared palette of some turbulent painter of the skies or mixed battle of long robed seraphim and looking the very symbol of tribulation tempest wreck and distraction I for the first time was sick It was with a dizzy brain therefore that I went off watch to my bunk Soon indeed I fell asleep but the rolls and shocks of the ship combined with the heavy Greenland anorak which I had on and the state of my body together produced a fearful nightmare in which I was conscious of a vain struggle to move a vain fight for breath for the sleeping bag turned to an iceberg on my bosom Of Clodagh was my gasping dream I dreamed that she let fall drop by drop a liquid coloured like pomegranate seeds into a glass of water and she presented the glass to Peters The draught I knew was poisonous as death and in a last effort to break the bands of that dark slumber I was conscious as I jerked myself upright of screaming aloud Clodagh Clodagh Spare the man My eyes starting with horror opened to waking the electric light was shining in the cabin and there stood David Wilson looking at me Wilson was a big man with a massively built long face made longer by a beard and he had little nervous contractions of the flesh at the cheek bones and plenty of big freckles His clinging pose his smile of disgust his whole air as he stood crouching and lurching there I can shut my eyes and see now What he was doing in my cabin I did not know To think my good God that he should have been led there just then This was one of the four men starboard berths his was a port yet there he was But he explained at once Sorry to interrupt your innocent dreams says he the mercury in Maitland s thermometer is frozen and he asked me to hand him his spirits of wine one from his bunk I did not answer A hatred was in my heart against this man The next day the storm died away and either three or four days later the slush ice between the floes froze definitely The Boreal s way was thus blocked We warped her with ice anchors and the capstan into the position in which she should lay up for her winter s drift This was in about seventy nine deg twenty N The sun had now totally vanished from our bleak sky not to reappear till the following year Well there was sledging with the dogs and bear hunting among the hummocks as the months one by one went by One day Wilson by far our best shot got a walrus bull Clark followed the traditional pursuit of a Chief examining Crustacea Maitland and I were in a relation of close friendship and I assisted his meteorological observations in a snow hut built near the ship Often through the twenty four hours a clear blue moon very spectral very fair suffused all our dim and livid clime It was five days before Christmas that Clark made the great announcement he had determined he said if our splendid northward drift continued to leave the ship about the middle of next March for the dash to the Pole He would take with him the four reindeer all the dogs four sledges four kayaks and three companions The companions whom he had decided to invite were Wilson Mew and Maitland He said it at dinner and as he said it David Wilson glanced at my wan face with a smile of pleased malice for I was left out I remember well the aurora that night was in the sky and at its edge floated a moon surrounded by a ring with two mock moons But all shone very vaguely and far and a fog which had already lasted some days made the ship s bows indistinct to me as I paced the bridge on my watch two hours after Clark s announcement For a long time all was very still save for the occasional whine of a dog I was alone and it grew toward the end of my watch when Maitland would succeed me My slow tread tolled like a passing bell and the mountainous ice lay vague and white around me its sheeted ghastliness not less dreadfully silent than eternity itself Presently several of the dogs began barking together left off and began again I said to myself There is a bear about somewhere And after some five minutes I saw I thought that I saw it The fog had if anything thickened and it was now very near the end of my watch It had entered the ship I concluded by the boards which slanted from an opening in the port bulwarks down to the ice Once before in November a bear having smelled the dogs had ventured on board at midnight but then there had resulted a perfect hubbub among the dogs Now even in the midst of my excitement I wondered at their quietness though some whimpered with fear I thought I saw the creature steal forward from the hatchway toward the kennels a port and I ran noiselessly and seized the watch gun which stood always loaded by the companionway By this time the form had passed the kennels reached the bows and now was making toward me on the starboard side I took aim Never I thought had I seen so huge a bear though I made allowance for the magnifying effect of the fog My finger was on the trigger and at that moment a deathly shivering sickness took me the wrangling voices shouted at me with Shoot Shoot not Shoot Ah well that latter shout was irresistible I drew the trigger The report hooted through the Polar night The creature dropped both Wilson and Clark were up at once and we three hurried to the spot But the very first near glance showed a singular kind of bear Wilson put his hand to the head and a lax skin came away at his touch It was Aubrey Maitland who was underneath it and I had shot him dead For the past few days he had been cleaning skins among them the skin of the bear from which I had saved him at Taimur Now Maitland was a born pantomimist continually inventing practical jokes and perhaps to startle me with a false alarm in the very skin of the old Bruin which had so nearly done for him he had thrown it round him on finishing its cleaning and so in mere wanton fun had crept on deck at the hour of his watch The head of the bear skin and the fog must have prevented him from seeing me taking aim This tragedy made me ill for weeks I saw that the hand of Fate was upon me When I rose from bed poor Maitland was lying in the ice behind the great camel shaped hummock near us By the end of January we had drifted to eighty deg fifty five and it was then that Clark in the presence of Wilson asked me if I would make the fourth man in the place of poor Maitland for the dash in the spring As I said Yes I am willing David Wilson spat with a disgusted emphasis A minute later he sighed with Ah poor Maitland and drew in his breath with a tut tut God knows I had an impulse to spring then and there at his throat and strangle him but I curbed myself There remained now hardly a month before the dash and all hands set to work with a will measuring the dogs making harness and seal skin shoes for them overhauling sledges and kayaks and cutting every possible ounce of weight But we were not destined after all to set out that year About the twentieth February the ice began to pack and the ship was subjected to an appalling pressure We found it necessary to make trumpets of our hands to shout into one another s ears for the whole ice continent was crashing popping thundering everywhere in terrific upheaval Expecting every moment to see the Boreal crushed to splinters we had to set about unpacking provisions and placing sledges kayaks dogs and everything in a position for instant flight It lasted five days and was accompanied by a tempest from the north which by the end of February had driven us back south into latitude seventy nine deg forty Clark of course then abandoned the thought of the Pole for that summer And immediately afterwards we made a startling discovery our stock of reindeer moss was found to be somehow ridiculously small Egan our second mate was blamed but that did not help matters the sad fact remained Clark was advised to kill one or two of the deer but he pig headedly refused and by the beginning of summer they were all dead Well our northward drift recommenced Toward the middle of February we saw a mirage of the coming sun above the horizon there were flights of Arctic petrels and snow buntings and spring was with us In an ice pack of big hummocks and narrow lanes we made good progress all the summer When the last of the deer died my heart sank and when the dogs killed two of their number and a bear crushed a third I was fully expecting what actually came it was this Clark announced that he could now take only two companions with him in the spring and they were Wilson and Mew So once more I saw David Wilson s pleased smile of malice We settled into our second winter quarters Again came December and all our drear sunless gloom made worse by the fact that the windmill would not work leaving us without the electric light Ah me none but those who have felt it could dream of one half the mental depression of that long Arctic night how the soul takes on the hue of the world and without and within is nothing but gloom gloom and the reign of the Power of Darkness Not one of us but was in a melancholic dismal and dire mood and on the thirteenth December Lamburn the engineer stabbed Cartwright the old harpooner in the arm Three days before Christmas a bear came close to the ship and then turned tail Mew Wilson I and Meredith a general hand set out in pursuit After a pretty long chase we lost him and then scattered different ways It was very dim and after yet an hour s search I was returning weary and disgusted to the ship when I saw some shadow like a bear sailing away on my left and at the same time sighted a man I did not know whom running like a handicapped ghost some little distance to the right So I shouted out There he is come on This way The man quickly joined me but as soon as ever he recognised me stopped dead The devil must have suddenly got into him for he said No thanks Jeffson alone with you I am in danger of my life It was Wilson And I too forgetting at once all about the bear stopped and faced him I see said I But Wilson you are going to explain to me now what you mean you hear What do you mean Wilson What I say he answered deliberately eyeing me up and down alone with you I am in danger of my life Just as poor Maitland was and just as poor Peters was Certainly you are a deadly beast Fury leapt my God in my heart Black as the tenebrous Arctic night was my soul Do you mean said I that I want to put you out of the way in order to go in your place to the Pole Is that your meaning man That s about my meaning Jeffson says he you are a deadly beast you know Stop I said with blazing eye I am going to kill you Wilson as sure as God lives but I want to hear first Who told you that I killed Peters Your lover killed him with your collusion Why I heard you man in your beastly sleep calling the whole thing out And I was pretty sure of it before only I had no proofs By God I should enjoy putting a bullet into you Jeffson You wrong me you you wrong me I shrieked my eyes staring with ravenous lust for his blood and now I am going to pay you well for it Look out you I aimed my gun for his heart and I touched the trigger He held up his left hand Stop he said stop He was one of the coolest of men ordinarily There is no gallows on the Boreal but Clark could easily rig one for you I want to kill you too because there are no criminal courts up here and it would be doing a good action for my country But not here not now Listen to me don t shoot Later we can meet when all is ready so that no one may be the wiser and fight it all out As he spoke I let the gun drop It was better so I knew that he was much the best shot on the ship and I an indifferent one but 
7437_96153_000033_000000	train-clean-360	I did not care 
none	none	I did not care if I was killed It is a dim inclement land God knows and the spirit of darkness and distraction is there Twenty hours later we met behind the great saddle shaped hummock some six miles to the S E of the ship We had set out at different times so that no one might suspect And each brought a ship s lantern Wilson had dug an ice grave near the hummock leaving at its edge a heap of brash ice and snow to fill it We stood separated by an interval of perhaps seventy yards the grave between us each with a lantern at his feet Even so we were mere shadowy apparitions one to the other The air glowered very drearily and present in my inmost soul were the frills of cold A chill moon a mere abstraction of light seemed to hang far outside the universe The temperature was at fifty five deg below zero so that we had on wind clothes over our anoraks and heavy foot bandages under our Lap boots Nothing but a weird morgue seemed the world haunted with despondent madness and exactly like that world about us were the minds of us two poor men full of macabre bleak and funereal feelings Between us yawned an early grave for one or other of our bodies I heard Wilson cry out Are you ready Jeffson Aye Wilson cried I Then here goes cries he Even as he spoke he fired Surely the man was in deadly earnest to kill me But his shot passed harmlessly by me as indeed was only likely we were mere shadows one to the other I fired perhaps ten seconds later than he but in those ten seconds he stood perfectly revealed to me in clear lavender light An Arctic fire ball had traversed the sky showering abroad a sulphurous glamour over the snow landscape Before the intenser blue of its momentary shine had passed away I saw Wilson stagger forward and drop And him and his lantern I buried deep there under the rubble ice On the thirteenth March nearly three months later Clark Mew and I left the Boreal in latitude eighty five deg fifteen We had with us thirty two dogs three sledges three kayaks human provisions for one hundred twelve days and dog provisions for forty 
7437_96153_000001_000001	train-clean-360	Being now about three hundred forty miles from the Pole we hoped to reach it in forty three days then turning south and feeding living dogs with dead make either Franz Josef Land or Spitzbergen at which latter place we should very likely come up with a whaler 
7437_96153_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Well during the first days progress was very slow the ice being rough and laney and the dogs behaving most badly stopping dead at every difficulty and leaping over the traces 
none	none	Clark had had the excellent idea of attaching a gold beater s skin balloon with a lifting power of thirty five pounds to each sledge and we had with us a supply of zinc and sulphuric acid to repair the hydrogen waste from the bags but on the third day Mew over filled and burst his balloon and I and Clark had to cut ours loose in order to equalise weights for we could neither leave him behind turn back to the ship nor mend the bag So it happened that at the end of the fourth day out we had made only nineteen miles and could still from a hummock discern afar the leaning masts of the old Boreal 
7437_96153_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Clark led on ski captaining a sledge with four hundred lbs 
none	none	of instruments ammunition pemmican aleuronate bread Mew followed his sledge containing provisions only and last came I with a mixed freight 
7437_96153_000002_000005	train-clean-360	But on the third day Clark had an attack of snow blindness and Mew took his place 
7437_96153_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Pretty soon our sufferings commenced and they were bitter enough 
none	none	The sun though constantly visible day and night gave no heat 
7437_96153_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Our sleeping bags Clark and Mew slept together in one I in another were soaking wet all the night being thawed by our warmth and our fingers under wrappings of senne grass and wolf skin were always bleeding Sometimes our frail bamboo cane kayaks lying across the sledges would crash perilously against an ice ridge and they were our one hope of reaching land 
7437_96153_000003_000003	train-clean-360	But the dogs were the great difficulty we lost six mortal hours a day in harnessing and tending them 
none	none	On the twelfth day Clark took a single altitude observation and found that we were only in latitude eighty six deg forty five but the next day we passed beyond the furthest point yet reached by man viz eighty six deg fifty three attained by the Nix explorers four years previously 
7437_96153_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Our one secret thought now was food food our day long lust for the eating time 
7437_96153_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Mew suffered from Arctic thirst 
7437_96153_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Under these conditions man becomes in a few days not a savage only but a mere beast hardly a grade above the bear and walrus 
7437_96153_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Ah the ice A long and sordid nightmare was that God knows 
7437_96153_000006_000000	train-clean-360	On we pressed crawling our little way across the Vast upon whose hoar silence from Eternity until then Bootes only and that Great Bear had watched 
7437_96153_000007_000000	train-clean-360	After the eleventh day our rate of march improved all lanes disappeared and ridges became much less frequent 
none	none	By the fifteenth day I was leaving behind the ice grave of David Wilson at the rate of ten to thirteen miles a day 
7437_96153_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Yet as it were his arm reached out and touched me even there 
7437_96153_000009_000000	train-clean-360	His disappearance had been explained by a hundred different guesses on the ship all plausible enough 
none	none	I had no idea that anyone connected me in any way with his death But on our twenty second day of march one hundred forty miles from our goal he caused a conflagration of rage and hate to break out among us three It was at the end of a march when our stomachs were hollow our frames ready to drop and our mood ravenous and inflamed 
7437_96153_000011_000001	train-clean-360	One of Mew s dogs was sick it was necessary to kill it he asked me to do it 
7437_96153_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh said I you kill your own dog of course 
7437_96153_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I don t know he replied catching fire at once you ought to be used to killing Jeffson 
none	none	How do you mean Mew said I with a mad start for madness and the flames of Hell were instant and uppermost in us all you mean because my profession Profession damn it no he snarled like a dog go and dig up David Wilson I dare say you know where to find him and he will tell you my meaning right enough 
7437_96153_000016_000000	train-clean-360	I rushed at once to Clark who was stooping among the dogs unharnessing and savagely pushing his shoulder I exclaimed 
7437_96153_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 That beast accuses me of murdering David Wilson 
7437_96153_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Clark 
7437_96153_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I d split his skull as clean 
none	none	Go away Adam Jeffson and let me be snarled Clark Is that all you ve got to say about it then you
7437_96153_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 To the devil with you man say I and let me be cried he you know your own conscience best I suppose 
7437_96153_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Before this insult I stood with grinding teeth but impotent 
7437_96153_000023_000001	train-clean-360	However from that moment a deeper mood of brooding malice occupied my spirit Indeed the humour of us all was one of dangerous even murderous fierceness 
none	none	In that pursuit of riches into that region of cold we had become almost like the beasts that perish On the tenth April we passed the eighty ninth parallel of latitude and though sick to death both in spirit and body pressed still on 
7437_96153_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Like the lower animals we were stricken now with dumbness and hardly once in a week spoke a word one to the other but in selfish brutishness on through a real hell of cold we moved 
none	none	It is a cursed region beyond doubt cursed not meant to be penetrated by man and rapid and awful was the degeneration of our souls As for me never could I have conceived that savagery so heinous could brood in a human bosom as now I felt it brood in mine If men could enter into a country specially set apart for the habitation of devils and there become possessed of evil as we were so would they be 
7437_96153_000025_000000	train-clean-360	As we advanced the ice every day became smoother so that from four miles a day our rate increased to fifteen and finally as the sledges lightened to twenty 
7437_96153_000026_000000	train-clean-360	It was now that we began to encounter a succession of strange looking objects lying scattered over the ice whose number continually increased as we proceeded 
7437_96153_000026_000001	train-clean-360	They had the appearance of rocks or pieces of iron incrusted with glass fragments of various colours and they were of every size 
7437_96153_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Their incrustations we soon determined to be diamonds and other precious stones 
none	none	On our first twenty mile day Mew picked up a diamond crystal as large as a child s foot and such objects soon became common We thus found the riches which we sought beyond all dream but as the bear and the walrus find them for ourselves we had lost and it was a loss of riches barren as ashes for all those millions we would not have given an ounce of fish meal 
7437_96153_000026_000005	train-clean-360	Clark grumbled something about their being meteor stones whose ferruginous substance had been lured by the magnetic Pole and kept from frictional burning in their fall by the frigidity of the air and they quickly ceased to interest our sluggish minds except in so far as they obstructed our way 
none	none	We had all along had good weather till suddenly on the morning of the thirteenth April we were overtaken by a tempest from the S W of such mighty and solemn volume that the heart quailed beneath it 
7437_96153_000027_000001	train-clean-360	It lasted in its full power only an hour but during that time snatched two of our sledges long distances and compelled us to lie face downward 
none	none	We had travelled all the sun lit night and were gasping with fatigue so as soon as the wind allowed us to huddle together our scattered things we crawled into the sleeping bags and instantly slept 
7437_96153_000028_000000	train-clean-360	We knew that the ice was in awful upheaval around us we heard as our eyelids sweetly closed the slow booming of distant guns and brittle cracklings of artillery 
7437_96153_000028_000001	train-clean-360	This may have been a result of the tempest stirring up the ocean beneath the ice 
7437_96153_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Whatever it was we did not care we slept deep 
7437_96153_000029_000000	train-clean-360	We were within ten miles of the Pole 
none	none	In my sleep it was as though someone suddenly shook my shoulder with urgent Up up It was neither Clark nor Mew but a dream merely for Clark and Mew when I started up I saw lying still in their sleeping bag 
7437_96153_000031_000000	train-clean-360	I suppose it must have been about noon 
none	none	I sat staring a minute and my first numb thought was somehow this that the Countess Clodagh had prayed me Be first for her Wondrous little now cared I for the Countess Clodagh in her far unreal world of warmth precious little for the fortune which she coveted millions on millions of fortunes lay unregarded around me But that thought Be first was deeply suggested in my brain as if whispered there 
7437_96153_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Instinctively brutishly as the Gadarean swine rushed down a steep place I rubbing my daft eyes arose 
7437_96153_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The first thing which my mind opened to perceive was that while the tempest was less strong the ice was now in extraordinary agitation 
none	none	I looked abroad upon a vast plain stretched out to a circular but waving horizon and varied by many hillocks boulders and sparkling meteor stones that everywhere tinselled the blinding white some big as houses most small as limbs And this great plain was now rearranging itself in a widespread drama of havoc withdrawing in ravines like mutual backing curtsies then surging to clap together in passionate mountain peaks else jostling like the Symplegades fluent and inconstant as billows of the sea grinding itself piling itself pouring itself in cataracts of powdered ice while here and there I saw the meteor stones leap spasmodically in dusts and heaps like geysers or spurting froths in a steamer s wake a tremendous uproar meantime filling all the air 
7437_96153_000032_000003	train-clean-360	As I stood I plunged and staggered and I found the dogs sprawling with whimperings on the heaving floor 
none	none	I did not care Instinctively daftly brutishly I harnessed ten of them to my sledge put on Canadian snow shoes and was away northward alone 
7437_96153_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The sun shone with a clear benign but heatless shining a ghostly remote yet quite limpid light which seemed designed for the lighting of other planets and systems and to strike here by happy chance 
none	none	A great wind from the S W meantime sent thin snow sweepings flying northward past me The odometer which I had with me had not yet measured four miles when I began to notice two things first that the jewelled meteor stones were now accumulating beyond all limit filling my range of vision to the northern horizon with a dazzling glister in mounds and parterres and scattered disconnection they lay like largesse of autumn leaves spread out over those Elysian fields and fairy uplands of wealth trillions of billions so that I had need to steer my twining way among them 
7437_96153_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Now too I noticed that but for these stones all roughness had disappeared not a trace of the upheaval going on a little further south being here for the ice lay positively as smooth as a table before me It is my belief that this stretch of smooth ice has never never felt one shock or stir or throe and reaches right down to the bottom of the deep 
7437_96153_000036_000000	train-clean-360	And now with a wild hilarity I flew 
none	none	Gradually a dizziness a lunacy had seized upon me till finally up buoyed on air and dancing mad I sped I spun with grinning teeth that chattered and gibbered and eyeballs of distraction for a Fear too most cold and dreadful had its hand of ice upon my heart I being so alone in that place face to face with the Ineffable but still with a giddy levity and a fatal joy and a blind hilarity on I sped I spun 
7437_96153_000037_000000	train-clean-360	The odometer measured nine miles from my start 
none	none	I was in the immediate neighbourhood of the Pole I cannot say when it began but now I was conscious of a sound in my ears distinct and near a steady sound of splashing or fluttering resembling the noising of a cascade or brook and it grew 
7437_96153_000038_000001	train-clean-360	Forty more steps I took slide I could not now for the meteorites perhaps sixty perhaps eighty and now to my sudden horror I stood by a circular clean cut lake 
7437_96153_000039_000000	train-clean-360	One minute only swaying and nodding there I stood and then I dropped down flat in swoon 
none	none	In a hundred years I suppose I should never succeed in analysing why I swooned but my consciousness still retains the impression of that horrid thrill I saw nothing distinctly for my whole being reeled and toppled drunken like a spinning top in desperate death struggle at the moment when it flags and wobbles dissolutely to fall but the very instant that my eyes met what was before me I knew I knew that here was the Sanctity of Sanctities the old eternal inner secret of the Life of this Earth which it was a most burning shame for a man to see The lake I fancy must be a mile across and in its middle is a pillar of ice very low and broad and I had the clear impression or dream or notion that there was a name or word graven all round in the ice of the pillar in characters which I could never read and under the name a long date and the fluid of the lake seemed to me to be wheeling with a shivering ecstasy splashing and fluttering round the pillar always from west to east in the direction of the spinning of the earth and it was borne in upon me I can t at all say how that this fluid was the substance of a living creature and I had the distinct fancy as my senses failed that it was a creature with many dull and anguished eyes and that as it wheeled for ever round in fluttering lust it kept its eyes always turned upon the name and the date graven in the pillar But this must be my madness It must have been not less than an hour before a sense of life returned to me and when the thought stabbed my brain that a long long time I had lain there in the presence of those gloomy orbs my spirit seemed to groan and die within me In some minutes however I had scrambled to my feet clutched at a dog s harness and without one backward glance was flying from that place Half way to the halting place I waited Clark and Mew being very sick and doddering and unable to advance But they did not come Later on when I gathered force to go further I found that they had perished in the upheaval of the ice One only of the sledges half buried I saw near the spot of our bivouac Alone that same day I began my way southward and for five days made good progress On the eighth day I noticed stretched right across the south eastern horizon a region of purple vapour which luridly obscured the face of the sun and day after day I saw it steadily brooding there But what it could be I did not understand Well onward through the desert ice I continued my lonely way with a baleful shrinking terror in my heart for very stupendous alas is the burden of that Arctic solitude upon one poor human soul Sometimes on a halt I have lain and listened long to the hollow silence recoiling crushed by it hoping that at least one of the dogs might whine I have even crept shivering from the thawed sleeping bag to flog a dog so that I might hear a sound I had started from the Pole with a well filled sledge and the sixteen dogs left alive from the ice packing which buried my comrades This was on the evening of the thirteenth April I had saved from the wreck of our things most of the whey powder pemmican c as well as the theodolite compass chronometer train oil lamp for cooking and other implements I was therefore in no doubt as to my course and I had provisions for ninety days But ten days from the start my supply of dog food failed and I had to begin to slaughter my only companions one by one Well in the third week the ice became horribly rough and with moil and toil enough to wear a bear to death I did only five miles a day After the day s work I would crawl with a dying sigh into the sleeping bag clad still in the load of skins which stuck to me a mere filth of grease to sleep the sleep of a swine indifferent if I never woke Always day after day on the south eastern horizon brooded sullenly that curious stretched out region of purple vapour like the smoke of the conflagration of the world And I noticed that its length constantly reached out and out and silently grew Once I had a very pleasant dream I dreamed that I was in a garden an Arabian paradise so sweet was the perfume All the time however I had a sub consciousness of the gale which was actually blowing from the S E over the ice and at the moment when I awoke was half wittedly droning to myself It is a Garden of Peaches but I am not really in the garden I am really on the ice only the S E storm is wafting to me the aroma of this Garden of Peaches I opened my eyes I started I sprang to my feet For of all the miracles I could not doubt an actual aroma like peach blossom was in the algid air about me Before I could collect my astonished senses I began to vomit pretty violently and at the same time saw some of the dogs mere skeletons as they were vomiting too For a long time I lay very sick in a kind of daze and on rising found two of the dogs dead and all very queer The wind had now changed to the north Well on I staggered fighting every inch of my deplorably weary way This odour of peach blossom my sickness and the death of the two dogs remained a wonder to me Two days later to my extreme mystification and joy I came across a bear and its cub lying dead at the foot of a hummock I could not believe my eyes There she lay on her right side a spot of dirty white in a disordered patch of snow with one little eye open and her fierce looking mouth also and the cub lay across her haunch biting into her rough fur I set to work upon her and allowed the dogs a glorious feed on the blubber while I myself had a great banquet on the fresh meat I had to leave the greater part of the two carcasses and I can feel again now the hankering reluctance quite unnecessary as it turned out with which I trudged onwards Again and again I found myself asking Now what could have killed those two bears With brutish stolidness I plodded ever on almost like a walking machine sometimes nodding in sleep while I helped the dogs or manouvred the sledge over an ice ridge pushing or pulling On the third June a month and a half from my start I took an observation with the theodolite and found that I was not yet four hundred miles from the Pole in latitude eighty four deg fifty It was just as though some Will some Will was obstructing and retarding me However the intolerable cold was over and soon my clothes no longer hung stark on me like armour Pools began to appear in the ice and presently what was worse my God long lanes across which somehow I had to get the sledge But about the same time all fear of starvation passed away for on the sixth June I came across another dead bear on the seventh three and thenceforth in rapidly growing numbers I met not bears only but fulmars guillemots snipes Ross s gulls little awks all all lying dead on the ice And never anywhere a living thing save me and the two remaining dogs If ever a poor man stood shocked before a mystery it was I now I had a big fear on my heart On the second July the ice began packing dangerously and soon another storm broke loose upon me from the S W I left off my trek and put up the silk tent on a five acre square of ice surrounded by lanes and again for the second time as I lay down I smelled that delightful strange odour of peach blossom a mere whiff of it and presently afterwards was taken sick However it passed off this time in a couple of hours Now it was all lanes lanes alas yet no open water and such was the difficulty and woe of my life that sometimes I would drop flat on the ice and sob Oh no more no more my God here let me die The crossing of a lane might occupy ten or twelve entire hours and then on the other side I might find another one opening right before me Moreover on the eighth July one of the dogs after a feed on blubber suddenly died and there was left me only Reinhardt a white haired Siberian dog with little pert up sticking ears like a cat s Him too I had to kill on coming to open water This did not happen till the third August nearly four months from the Pole I can t think my God that any heart of man ever tholed the appalling nightmare and black abysm of sensations in which during those four long desert months I weltered for though I was as a brute I had a man s heart to feel What I had seen or dreamed at the Pole followed and followed me and if I shut my poor weary eyes to sleep those others yonder seemed to watch me still with their distraught and gloomy gaze and in my spinning dark dreams spun that eternal ecstasy of the lake However by the twenty eighth July I knew from the look of the sky and the absence of fresh water ice that the sea could not be far so I set to work and spent two days in putting to rights the now battered kayak This done I had no sooner resumed my way than I sighted far off a streaky haze which I knew to be the basalt cliffs of Franz Josef Land and in a craziness of joy I stood there waving my ski staff about my head with the senile cheers of a very old man In four days this land was visibly nearer sheer basaltic cliffs mixed with glacier forming apparently a great bay with two small islands in the mid distance and at fore day of the third August I arrived at the definite edge of the pack ice in moderate weather at about the freezing point I at once but with great reluctance shot Reinhardt and set to work to get the last of the provisions and the most necessary of the implements into the kayak making haste to put out to the toilless luxury of being borne on the water after all the weary trudge Within fourteen hours I was coasting with my little lug sail spread along the shore ice of that land It was midnight of a calm Sabbath and low on the horizon smoked the drowsing red sun ball as my canvas skiff lightly chopped her little way through this silent sea Silent silent for neither snort of walrus nor yelp of fox nor cry of startled kittiwake did I hear but all was still as the jet black shadow of the cliffs and glacier on the tranquil sea and many bodies of dead things strewed the surface of the water When I found a little fjord I went up it to the end where stood a stretch of basalt columns looking like a shattered temple of Antediluvians and when my foot at last touched land I sat down there a long long time in the rubbly snow and silently wept My eyes that night were like a fountain of tears For the firm land is health and sanity and dear to the life of man but I say that the great ungenial ice is a nightmare and a blasphemy and a madness and the realm of the Power of Darkness I knew that I was at Franz Josef Land somewhere or other in the neighbourhood of C Fligely about eighty two deg N and though it was so late and getting cold I still had the hope of reaching Spitzbergen that year by alternately sailing all open water and dragging the kayak over the slack drift ice All the ice which I saw was good flat fjord ice and the plan seemed feasible enough so after coasting about a little and then three days good rest in the tent at the bottom of a ravine of columnar basalt opening upon the shore I packed some bear and walrus flesh with what artificial food was left into the kayak and I set out early in the morning coasting the shore ice with sail and paddle In the afternoon I managed to climb a little way up an iceberg and made out that I was in a bay whose terminating headlands were invisible I accordingly decided to make S W by W to cross it but in doing so I was hardly out of sight of land when a northern storm overtook me toward midnight before I could think the little sail was all but whiffed away and the kayak upset I only saved it by the happy chance of being near a floe with an ice foot which projecting under the water gave me foot hold and I lay on the floe in a mooning state the whole night under the storm for I was half drowned And at once on recovering myself I abandoned all thought of whalers and of Europe for that year Happily my instruments c had been saved by the kayak deck when she capsized A hundred yards inland from the shore rim in a circular place where there was some moss and soil I built myself a semi subterranean Eskimo den for the long Polar night The spot was quite surrounded by high sloping walls of basalt except to the west where they opened in a three foot cleft to the shore and the ground was strewn with slabs and boulders of granite and basalt I found there a dead she bear two well grown cubs and a fox the latter having evidently fallen from the cliffs in three places the snow was quite red overgrown with a red lichen which at first I took for blood I did not even yet feel secure from possible bears and took care to make my den fairly tight a work which occupied me nearly four weeks for I had no tools save a hatchet knife and metal shod ski staff I dug a passage in the ground two feet wide two deep and ten long with perpendicular sides and at its north end a circular space twelve feet across also with perpendicular sides which I lined with stones the whole excavation I covered with inch thick walrus hide skinned during a whole bitter week from four of a number that lay about the shore ice for ridge pole I used a thin pointed rock which I found near though even so the roof remained nearly flat This when it was finished I stocked well putting in everything except the kayak blubber to serve both for fuel and occasional light and foods of several sorts which I procured by merely stretching out the hand The roof of both circular part and passage was soon buried under snow and ice and hardly distinguishable from the general level of the white clad ground Through the passage if I passed in or out I crawled flat on hands and knees but that was rare and in the little round interior mostly sitting in a cowering attitude I wintered harkening to the large and windy ravings of darkling December storms above me All those months the burden of a thought bowed me and an unanswered question like the slow turning of a mechanism revolved in my gloomy spirit for everywhere around me lay bears walruses foxes thousands upon thousands of little awks kittiwakes snow owls eider ducks gulls dead dead Almost the only living things which I saw were some walruses on the drift floes but very few compared with the number which I expected It was clear to me that some inconceivable catastrophe had overtaken the island during the summer destroying all life about it except some few of the amphibia cetacea and crustacea On the fifth December having crept out from the den during a southern storm I had for the third time a distant whiff of that self same odour of peach blossom but now without any after effects Well again came Christmas the New Year Spring and on the twenty second May I set out with a well stocked kayak The water was fairly open and the ice so good that at one place I could sail the kayak over it the wind sending me sliding at a fine pace Being on the west coast of Franz Josef Land I was in as favourable a situation as possible and I turned my bow southward with much hope keeping a good many days just in sight of land Toward the evening of my third day out I noticed a large flat floe presenting far off a singular and lovely sight for it seemed freighted thick with a profusion of pink and white roses showing in its clear crystal the empurpled reflection On getting near I saw that it was covered with millions of Ross s gulls all dead whose pretty rosy bosoms had given it that appearance Up to the twenty ninth June I made good progress southward and westward the weather being mostly excellent sometimes meeting dead bears floating away on floes sometimes dead or living walrus herds with troop after troop of dead kittiwakes glaucus and ivory gulls skuas and every kind of Arctic fowl On that last day the twenty ninth June I was about to encamp on a floe soon after midnight when happening to look toward the sun my eye fell far away south across the ocean of floes upon something the masts of a ship A phantom ship or a real ship it was all one real I must have instantly felt it could not be but at a sight so incredible my heart set to beating in my bosom as though I must surely die and feebly waving the cane oar about my head I staggered to my knees and thence with wry mouth toppled flat So overpoweringly sweet was the thought of springing once more like the beasts of Circe from a walrus into a man At this time I was tearing my bear s meat just like a bear I was washing my hands in walrus blood to produce a glairy sort of pink cleanliness in place of the black grease which chronically coated them Worn as I was I made little delay to set out for that ship and I had not travelled over water and ice four hours when to my in describable joy I made out from the top of a steep floe that she was the Boreal It seemed most strange that she should be anywhere hereabouts I could only conclude that she must have forced and drifted her way thus far westward out of the ice block in which our party had left her and perhaps now was loitering here in the hope of picking us up on our way to Spitzbergen In any case wild was the haste with which I fought my way to be at her my gasping mouth all the time drawn back in a rictus of laughter at the anticipation of their gladness to see me their excitement to hear the grand tidings of the Pole attained Anon I waved the paddle though I knew that they could not yet see me and then I dug deep at the whitish water What astonished me was her main sail and fore mast square sail set that calm morning and her screws were still for she moved not at all The sun was abroad like a cold spirit of light touching the great ocean room of floes with dazzling spots and a tint almost of rose was on the world as it were of a just dead bride in her spangles and white array The Boreal was the one little distant jet black spot in all this purity and upon her as though she were Heaven I paddled I panted But she was in a queerish state by nine A M I could see that Two of the windmill arms were not there and half lowered down her starboard beam a boat hung askew moreover soon after ten I could clearly see that her main sail had a long rent down the middle I could not at all make her out She was not anchored though a sheet anchor hung over at the starboard cathead she was not moored and two small ice floes one on each side were sluggishly bombarding her bows I began now to wave the paddle battling for my breath ecstatic crazy with excitement each second like a year to me Very soon I could make out someone at the bows leaning well over looking my way Something put it into my head that it was Sallitt and I began an impassioned shouting Hi Sallitt Hallo Hi I called I did not see him move I was still a good way off but there he stood leaning steadily over looking my way Between me and the ship now was all navigable water among the floes and the sight of him so visibly near put into me such a shivering eagerness that I was nothing else but a madman for the time sending the kayak flying with venomous digs in quick repeated spurts and mixing with the diggings my crazy wavings and with both the daft shoutings of Hallo Hi Bravo I have been to the Pole Well vanity vanity Nearer still I drew it was broad morning going on toward noon I was half a mile away I was fifty yards But on board the Boreal though now they must have heard me seen me I observed no movement of welcome but all all was still as death that still Arctic morning my God Only the ragged sail flapped a little and one on each side two ice floes sluggishly bombarded the bows with hollow sounds I was certain now that Sallitt it was who looked across the ice but when the ship swung a little round I noticed that the direction of his gaze was carried with her movement he no longer looking my way Why Sallitt I shouted reproachfully why Sallitt man I whined But even as I shouted and whined a perfect wild certainty was in my heart for an aroma like peach my God had been suddenly wafted from the ship upon me and I must have very well known then that that watchful outlook of Sallitt saw nothing and on the Boreal were dead men all indeed very soon I saw one of his eyes looking like a glass eye which has slid askew and glares distraught And now again my wretched body failed and my head dropped forward where I sat upon the kayak deck Well after a long time I lifted myself to look again at that forlorn and wandering craft There she lay quiet tragic as it were culpable of the dark secret she bore and Sallitt who had been such good friends with me would not cease his stare I knew quite well why he was there he had leant over to vomit and had leant ever since his forearms pressed on the bulwark beam his left knee against the boards and his left shoulder propped on the cathead When I came quite near I saw that with every bump of the two floes against the bows his face shook in response and nodded a little strange to say he had no covering on his head and I noted the play of the faint breezes in his uncut hair After a time I would approach no more for I was afraid I did not dare the silence of the ship seemed so sacred and awful and till late afternoon I sat there watching the black and massive hull Above her water line emerged all round a half floating fringe of fresh green sea weed proving old neglect an abortive attempt had apparently been made to lower or take in the larch wood pram for there she hung by a jammed davit rope stern up bow in the water the only two arms of the windmill moved this way and that through some three degrees with an andante creaking sing song some washed clothes tied on the bow sprit rigging to dry were still there the iron casing all round the bluff bows was red and rough with rust at several points the rigging was in considerable tangle occasionally the boom moved a little with a tortured skirling cadence and the sail rotten I presume from exposure for she had certainly encountered no bad weather gave out anon a heavy languid flap at a rent down the middle Besides Sallitt looking out there where he had jammed himself I saw no one By a paddle stroke now and another presently I had closely approached her about four in the afternoon though my awe of the ship was complicated by that perfume of hers whose fearful effects I knew My tentative approach however proved to me when I remained unaffected that here and now whatever danger there had been was past and finally by a hanging rope with a thumping desperation of heart I clambered up her beam They had died it seemed very suddenly for nearly all the twelve were in poses of activity Egan was in the very act of ascending the companion way Lamburn was sitting against the chart room door apparently cleaning two carbines Odling at the bottom of the engine room stair seemed to be drawing on a pair of reindeer komagar and Cartwright who was often in liquor had his arms frozen tight round the neck of Martin whom he seemed to be kissing they two lying stark at the foot of the mizzen mast Over all over men decks rope coils in the cabin in the engine room between skylight leaves on every shelf in every cranny lay a purplish ash or dust very impalpably fine And steadily reigning throughout the ship like the very spirit of death was that aroma of peach blossom Here it had reigned as I could see from the log dates from the rust on the machinery from the look of the bodies from a hundred indications during something over a year It was therefore mainly by the random workings of winds and currents that this fragrant ship of death had been brought hither to me And this was the first direct intimation which I had that the Unseen Powers whoever and whatever they may be who through the history of the world had been so very very careful to conceal their Hand from the eyes of men hardly any longer intended to be at the pains to conceal their Hand from me It was just as though the Boreal had been openly presented to me by a spiritual agency which though I could not see it I could readily apprehend The dust though very thin and flighty above decks lay thickly deposited below and after having made a tour of investigation throughout the ship the first thing which I did was to examine that though I had tasted nothing all day and was exhausted to death I found my own microscope where I had left it in the box in my berth to starboard though I had to lift up Egan to get at it and to step over Lamburn to enter the chart room but there toward evening I sat at the table and bent to see if I could make anything of the dust while it seemed to me as if all the myriad spirits of men that have sojourned on the earth and angel and devil and all Time and all Eternity hung silent round for my decision and such an ague had me that for a long time my wandering finger tips all ataxic with agitation eluded every delicate effort which I made and I could nothing do Of course I know that an odour of peach blossom in the air resulting in death could only be associated with some vaporous effluvium of cyanogen or of hydrocyanic prussic acid or of both and when I at last managed to examine some of the dust under the microscope I was not therefore surprised to find among the general mass of purplish ash a number of bright yellow particles which could only be minute crystals of potassic ferrocyanide What potassic ferrocyanide was doing on board the Boreal I did not know and I had neither the means nor the force of mind alas to dive then further into the mystery I understood only that by some extraordinary means the air of the region just south of the Polar environ had been impregnated with a vapour which was either cyanogen or some product of cyanogen also that this deadly vapour which is very soluble had by now either been dissolved by the sea or else dispersed into space probably the latter leaving only its faint after perfume and seeing this I let my poor abandoned head drop again on the table and long hours I sat there staring mad for I had a suspicion my God and a fear in my breast The Boreal I found contained sufficient provisions untouched by the dust in cases casks c to last me probably fifty years After two days when I had partially scrubbed and boiled the filth of fifteen months from my skin and solaced myself with better food I overhauled her thoroughly and spent three more days in oiling and cleaning the engine Then all being ready I dragged my twelve dead and laid them together in two rows on the chart room floor and I hoisted for love the poor little kayak which had served me through so many tribulations At nine in the morning of the sixth July a week from my first sighting of the Boreal I descended to the engine room to set out The screws like those of most quite modern ships were driven by the simple contrivance of a constant stream of liquid air contained in very powerful tanks exploding through capillary tubes into non expansion slide valve chests much as in the ordinary way with steam a motor which gave her in spite of her bluff hulk a speed of sixteen knots It is therefore the simplest thing for one man to take these ships round the world since their movement or stopping depend upon nothing but the depressing or raising of a steel handle provided that one does not get blown to the sky meantime as liquid air in spite of its thousand advantages occasionally blows people At any rate I had tanks of air sufficient to last me through twelve years voyaging and there was the ordinary machine on board for making it with forty tons of coal in case of need in the bunkers and two excellent Belleville boilers so I was well supplied with motors at least The ice here was quite slack and I do not think I ever saw Arctic weather so bright and gay the temperature at forty one deg I found that I was midway between Franz Josef and Spitzbergen in latitude seventy nine deg twenty three N and longitude thirty nine deg E my way was perfectly clear and something almost like a mournful hopefulness was in me as the engines slid into their clanking turmoil and those long silent screws began to churn the Arctic sea I ran up with alacrity and took my stand at the wheel and the bows of my eventful Argo turned southward and westward When I needed food or sleep the ship slept too when I awoke she continued her way Sixteen hours a day sometimes I stood sentinel at that wheel overlooking the varied monotony of the ice sea till my knees would give and I wondered why a wheel at which one might sit was not contrived rather delicate steering being often required among the floes and bergs By now however I was less weighted with my ball of Polar clothes and stood almost slim in a Lap great coat a round Siberian fur cap on my head At midnight when I threw myself into my old berth it was just as though the engines subsided now into silence were a dead thing and had a ghost which haunted me for I heard them still and yet not them but the silence of their ghost Sometimes I would startle from sleep horrified to the heart at some sound of exploding iceberg or bumping floe noising far through that white mystery of quietude where the floes and bergs were as floating tombs and the world a liquid cemetery Never could I describe the strange Doom s day shock with which such a sound would recall me from far depths of chaos to recollection of myself for often times both waking and in nightmare I did not know on which planet I was nor in which Age but felt myself adrift in the great gulf of time and space and circumstance without bottom for my consciousness to stand upon and the world was all mirage and a new show to me and the boundaries of dream and waking lost Well the weather was most fair all the time and the sea like a pond During the morning of the fifth day the eleventh July I entered and went moving down an extraordinary long avenue of snow bergs and floes most regularly placed half a mile across and miles long like a Titanic double procession of statues or the Ming Tombs but rising and sinking on the cadenced swell many towering high throwing placid shadows on the aisle between some being of a lucid emerald tint and three or four pouring down cascades that gave a far and chaunting sound The sea between was of a strange thick bluishness almost like raw egg white while as always here some snow clouds white and woolly floated in the pale sky Down this avenue which produced a mysterious impression of Cyclopean cathedrals and odd sequesteredness I had not passed a mile when I sighted a black object at the end I rushed to the shrouds and very soon made out a whaler Again the same panting agitations mad rage to be at her at once possessed me I flew to the indicator turned the lever to full then back to give the wheel a spin then up the main mast ratlins waving a long foot bandage of vadmel tweed picked up at random and by the time I was within five hundred yards of her had worked myself to such a pitch that I was again shouting that futile madness Hullo Hi Bravo I have been to the Pole And those twelve dead that I had in the chart room there must have heard me and the men on the whaler must have heard me and smiled their smile For as to that whaler I should have known better at once if I had not been crazy since she looked like a ship of death her boom slamming to port and starboard on the gentle heave of the sea and her fore sail reefed that serene morning Only when I was quite near her and hurrying down to stop the engines did the real truth with perfect suddenness drench my heated brain and I almost ran into her I was so stunned However I stopped the Boreal in time and later on lowered the kayak and boarded the other This ship had evidently been stricken silent in the midst of a perfect drama of activity for I saw not one of her crew of sixty two who was not busy except one boy I found her a good sized thing of five hundred odd tons ship rigged with auxiliary engine of seventy horse power and pretty heavily armour plated round the bows There was no part of her which I did not over haul and I could see that they had had a great time with whales for a mighty carcass attached to the outside of the ship by the powerful cant purchase tackle had been in process of flensing and cutting in and on the deck two great blankets of blubber looking each a ton weight surrounded by twenty seven men in many attitudes some terrifying to see some disgusting several grotesque all so unhuman the whale dead and the men dead too and death was there and the rank flourishing germs of Inanity and a mesmerism and a silence whose dominion was established and its reign was growing old Four of them who had been removing the gums from a mass of stratified whalebone at the mizzen mast foot were quite imbedded in whale flesh also in a barrel lashed to the top of the main top gallant masthead was visible the head of a man with a long pointed beard looking steadily out over the sea to the S W which made me notice that five only of the probable eight or nine boats were on board and after visiting the tween decks where I saw considerable quantities of stowed whalebone plates and about fifty or sixty iron oil tanks and cut up blubber and after visiting cabin engine room fo cas le where I saw a lonely boy of fourteen with his hand grasping a bottle of rum under all the turned up clothes in a chest he at the moment of death being evidently intent upon hiding it and after two hours search of the ship I got back to my own and half an hour later came upon all the three missing whale boats about a mile apart and steered zig zag near to each They contained five men each and a steerer and one had the harpoon gun fired with the loose line coiled round and round the head and upper part of the stroke line manager and in the others hundreds of fathoms of coiled rope with toggle irons whale lances hand harpoons and dropped heads and grins and lazy abandon and eyes that stared and eyes that dozed and eyes that winked After this I began to sight ships not infrequently and used regularly to have the three lights burning all night On the twelfth July I met one on the fifteenth two on the sixteenth one on the seventeenth three on the eighteenth two all Greenlanders I think but of the nine I boarded only three the glass quite clearly showing me when yet far off that on the others was no life and on the three which I boarded were dead men so that that suspicion which I had and that fear grew very heavy upon me I went on southward day after day southward sentinel there at my wheel clear sunshine by day when the calm pale sea sometimes seemed mixed with regions of milk and at night the immense desolation of a world lit by a sun that was long dead and by a light that was gloom It was like Night blanched in death then and wan as the very kingdom of death and Hades I have seen it most terrifying that neuter state and limbo of nothingness when unreal sea and spectral sky all boundaries lost mingled in a vast shadowy void of ghastly phantasmagoria pale to utter huelessness at whose centre I as if annihilated seemed to swoon in immensity of space Into this disembodied world would come anon waftures of that peachy scent which I knew and their frequency rapidly grew But still the Boreal moved traversing as it were bottomless Eternity and I reached latitude seventy two deg not far now from Northern Europe And now as to that blossomy peach scent even while some floes were yet around me I was just like some fantastic mariner who having set out to search for Eden and the Blessed Islands finds them and balmy gales from their gardens come out while he is yet afar to meet him with their perfumes of almond and champac cornel and jasmin and lotus For I had now reached a zone where the peach aroma was constant all the world seemed embalmed in its spicy fragrance and I could easily imagine myself voyaging beyond the world toward some clime of perpetual and enchanting Spring Well I saw at last what whalers used to call the blink of the ice that is to say its bright apparition or reflection in the sky when it is left behind or not yet come to By this time I was in a region where a good many craft of various sorts were to be seen I was continually meeting them and not one did I omit to investigate while many I boarded in the kayak or the larch wood pram Just below latitude seventy deg I came upon a good large fleet of what I supposed to be Lafoden cod and herring fishers which must have drifted somewhat on a northward current They had had a great season for the boats were well laden with curing fish I went from one to the other on a zig zag course they being widely scattered some mere dots to the glass on the horizon The evening was still and clear with that astral Arctic clearness the sun just beginning his low couched nightly drowse These sturdy looking brown boats stood rocking gently there with slow creaking noises as of things whining in slumber without the least damage awaiting the appalling storms of the winter months on that tenebrous sea when a dark doom and a deep grave would not fail them The fishers were braw carles wearing many of them fringes of beard well back from the chin point with hanging woollen caps In every case I found below decks a number of cruses of corn brandy marked aquavit two of which I took into the pram In one of the smacks an elderly fisher was kneeling in a forward sprawling pose clasping the lug mast with his arms the two knees wide apart head thrown back and the yellow eye balls with their islands of grey iris staring straight up the mast pole At another of them instead of boarding in the pram I shut off the Boreal s liquid air at such a point that by delicate steering she slackened down to a stoppage just a beam of the smack upon whose deck I was thus able to jump down After looking around I descended the three steps aft into the dark and garrety below decks and with stooping back went calling in an awful whisper Anyone Anyone Nothing answered me and when I went up again the Boreal had drifted three yards beyond my reach There being a dead calm I had to plunge into the water and in that half minute there a sudden cold throng of unaccountable terrors beset me and I can feel again now that abysmal desolation of loneliness and sense of a hostile and malign universe bent upon eating me up for the ocean seemed to me nothing but a great ghost Two mornings later I came upon another school rather larger boats these which I found to be Brittany cod fishers Most of these too I boarded In every below decks was a wooden or earthenware image of the Virgin painted in gaudy faded colours and in one case I found a boy who had been kneeling before the statue but was toppled sideways now his knees still bent and the cross of Christ in his hand These stalwart blue woollen blouses and tarpaulin sou westers lay in every pose of death every detail of feature and expression still perfectly preserved The sloops were all the same all all with sing song creaks they rocked a little nonchalantly each as it were with a certain sub consciousness of its own personality and callous unconsciousness of all the others round it yet each a copy of the others the same hooks and lines disembowelling knives barrels of salt and pickle piles and casks of opened cod kegs of biscuit and low creaking rockings and a bilgy smell and dead men The next day about eighty miles south of the latitude of Mount Hekla I sighted a big ship which turned out to be the French cruiser Lazare Treport I boarded and overhauled her during three hours her upper main and armoured deck deck by deck to her lowest black depths even childishly spying up the tubes of her two big rusted turret guns Three men in the engine room had been much mangled after death I presume by a burst boiler floating about eight hundred yards to the north east lay a long boat of hers low in the water crammed with marines one oar still there jammed between the row lock and the rower s forced back chin on the ship s starboard deck in the long stretch of space between the two masts the blue jackets had evidently been piped up for they lay there in a sort of serried disorder to the number of two hundred and seventy five Nothing could be of suggestion more tragic than the wasted and helpless power of this poor wandering vessel around whose stolid mass myriads of wavelets busy as aspen leaves bickered with a continual weltering splash that was quite loud to hear I sat a good time that afternoon in one of her steely port main deck casemates on a gun carriage my head sunken on my breast furtively eyeing the bluish turned up feet all shrunk exsanguined of a sailor who lay on his back before me his soles were all that I could see the rest of him lying head downwards beyond the steel door sill Drenched in seas of lugubrious reverie I sat till with a shuddering start I awoke paddled back to the Boreal and till sleep conquered me went on my way At ten the next morning coming on deck I spied to the west a group of craft and turned my course upon them They turned out to be eight Shetland sixerns which must have drifted north eastward hither I examined them well but they were as the long list of the others for all the men and all the boys and all the dogs on them were dead I could have come to land a long time before I did but I would not I was so afraid For I was used to the silence of the ice and I was used to the silence of the sea but God knows it I was afraid of the silence of the land Once on the fifteenth July I had seen a whale or thought I did spouting very remotely afar on the S E horizon and on the nineteenth I distinctly saw a shoal of porpoises vaulting the sea surface in their swift successive manner northward and seeing them I had said pitifully to myself Well I am not quite alone in the world then my good God not quite alone Moreover some days later the Boreal had found herself in a bank of cod making away northward millions of fish for I saw them and one afternoon caught three hand running with the hook So the sea at least had its tribes to be my mates But if I should find the land as still as the sea without even the spouting whale or school of tumbling sea hogs if Paris were dumber than the eternal ice what then I asked myself should I do I could have made short work and landed at Shetland for I found myself as far westward as longitude eleven deg twenty three W but I would not I was so afraid The shrinking within me to face that vague suspicion which I had turned me first to a foreign land I made for Norway and on the first night of this definite intention at about nine o clock the weather being gusty the sky lowering the air sombrous and the sea hard looking dark and ridged I was steaming along at a good rate holding the wheel my poor port and starboard lights still burning there when without the least notice I received the roughest physical shock of my life being shot bodily right over the wheel thence as from a cannon twenty feet to the cabin door through it head foremost down the companion way and still beyond some six yards along the passage I had crashed into some dark and dead ship probably of large size though I never saw her nor any sign of her and all that night and the next day till four in the afternoon the Boreal went driving alone over the sea whither she would for I lay unconscious When I woke I found that I had received really very small injuries considering but I sat there on the floor a long time in a sulky morose disgusted and bitter mood and when I rose pettishly stopped the ship s engines seeing my twelve dead all huddled and disfigured Now I was afraid to steam by night and even in the daytime I would not go on for three days for I was childishly angry with I know not what and inclined to quarrel with Those whom I could not see However on the fourth day a rough swell which knocked the ship about and made me very uncomfortable coaxed me into moving and I did so with bows turned eastward and southward I sighted the Norway coast four days later in latitude sixty three deg nineteen at noon of the eleventh August and pricked off my course to follow it but it was with a slow and dawdling reluctance that I went at much less than half speed In some eight hours as I knew from the chart I ought to sight the lighthouse light on Smoelen Island and when quiet night came the black water being branded with trails of still moonlight I passed quite close to it between ten and twelve almost under the shadow of the mighty hills but oh my God no light was there And all the way down I marked the rugged sea board slumber darkling afar or near with never alas one friendly light Well on the fifteenth August I had another of those maniac raptures whose passing away would have left an elephant racked and prostrate During four days I had seen not one sign of present life on the Norway coast only hills hills dead and dark and floating craft all dead and dark and my eyes now I found had acquired a crazy fixity of stare into the very bottom of the vacant abyss of nothingness while I remained unconscious of being save of one point rainbow blue far down in the infinite which passed slowly from left to right before my consciousness a little way then vanished came back and passed slowly again from left to right continually till some prick or voice in my brain would startle me into the consciousness that I was staring whispering the profound confidential warning You must not stare so or it is over with you Well lost in a blank trance of this sort I was leaning over the wheel during the afternoon of the fifteenth when it was as if some instinct or premonition in my soul leapt up and said aloud If you look just yonder you will see I started and in one instant had surged up from all that depth of reverie to reality I glanced to the right and there at last my God I saw something human which moved rapidly moved at last and it came to me That sense of recovery of waking of new solidity of the comfortable usual a million fold too intense for words how sweetly consoling it was Again now as I write I can fancy and feel it the rocky solidity the adamant ordinary on which to base the feet and live From the day when I stood at the Pole and saw there the dizzy thing that made me swoon there had come into my way not one sign or trace that other beings like myself were alive on the earth with me till now suddenly I had the sweet indubitable proof for on the south western sea not four knots away I saw a large swift ship and her bows which were sharp as a hatchet were steadily chipping through the smooth sea at a pretty high pace throwing out profuse ribbony foams that went wide vawering with outward undulations far behind her length as she ran the sea in haste straight northward At the moment I was steering about S E by S fifteen miles out from a shadowy blue series of Norway mountains and just giving the wheel one frantic spin to starboard to bring me down upon her I flew to the bridge leant my back on the main mast which passed through it put a foot on the white iron rail before me and there at once felt all the mocking devils of distracted revelry possess me as I caught the cap from my long hairs and commenced to wave and wave and wave red faced maniac that I was for at the second nearer glance I saw that she was flying an ensign at the main and a long pennant at the main top and I did not know what she was flying those flags there for and I was embittered and driven mad With distinct minuteness did she print herself upon my consciousness in that five minutes interval she was painted a dull and cholera yellow like many Russian ships and there was a faded pink space at her bows under the line where the yellow ceased the ensign at her main I made out to be the blue and white saltire and she was clearly a Russian passenger liner two masted two funnelled though from her funnels came no trace of smoke and the position of her steam cones was anywhere All about her course the sea was spotted with wobbling splendours of the low sun large coarse blots of glory near the eye but lessening to a smaller pattern in the distance and at the horizon refined to a homogeneous band of livid silver The double speed of the Boreal and the other hastening opposite ways must have been thirty eight or forty knots and the meeting was accomplished in certainly less than five minutes yet into that time I crowded years of life I was shouting passionately at her my eyes starting from my head my face all inflamed with rage the most prone loud and urgent For she did not stop nor signal nor make sign of seeing me but came furrowing down upon me like Juggernaut with steadfast run I lost reason thought memory purpose sense of relation in that access of delirium which transported me and can only remember now that in the midst of my shouting a word uttered by the fiends who used my throat to express their frenzy set me laughing high and madly for I was crying Hi Bravo Why don t you stop Madmen I have been to the Pole That instant an odour arose and came and struck upon my brain most detestable most execrable and while one might count ten I was aware of her near sounding engines and that cursed charnel went tearing past me on her maenad way not fifteen yards from my eyes and nostrils She was a thing my God from which the vulture and the jackal prowling for offal would fly with shrieks of loathing I had a glimpse of decks piled thick with her festered dead In big black letters on the round retreating yellow stern my eye corner caught the word Yaroslav as I bent over the rail to retch and cough and vomit at her She was a horrid thing This ship had certainly been pretty far south in tropical or sub tropical latitudes with her great crowd of dead for all the bodies which I had seen till then so far from smelling ill seemed to give out a certain perfume of the peach She was evidently one of those many ships of late years which have substituted liquid air for steam yet retained their old steam funnels c in case of emergency for air I believe was still looked at askance by several builders on account of the terrible accidents which it sometimes caused The Boreal herself is a similar instance of both motors This vessel the Yaroslav must have been left with working engines when her crew were overtaken by death and her air tanks being still unexhausted must have been ranging the ocean with impunity ever since during I knew not how many months or it might be years Well I coasted Norway for nearly a hundred and sixty miles without once going nearer land than two or three miles for something held me back But passing the fjord mouth where I knew that Aadheim was I suddenly turned the helm to port almost before I knew that I was doing it and made for land In half an hour I was moving up an opening in the land with mountains on either hand streaky crags at their summit umbrageous boscage below and the whole softened as it were by veils woven of the rainbow This arm of water lies curved about like a thread which one drops only the curves are much more pointed so that every few minutes the scene was changed though the vessel just crawled her way up and I could see behind me nothing of what was passed or only a land locked gleam like a lake I never saw water so polished and glassy like clarid polished marble reflecting everything quite clean cut in its lucid abysm over which hardly the faintest zephyr breathed that still sun down it wimpled about the bluff Boreal which seemed to move as if careful not to bruise it in rich wrinkles and creases like glycerine or dewy trickling lotus oil yet it was only the sea and the spectacle yonder was only crags and autumn foliage and mountain slope yet all seemed caught up and chaste rapt in a trance of rose and purple and made of the stuff of dreams and bubbles of pollen of flowers and rinds of the peach I saw it not only with delight but with complete astonishment having forgotten as was too natural in all that long barrenness of ice and sea that anything could be so ethereally fair yet homely too human familiar and consoling The air here was richly spiced with that peachy scent and there was a Sabbath and a nepenthe and a charm in that place at that hour as it were of those gardens of Hesperus and fields of asphodel reserved for the spirits of the just Alas but I had the glass at my side and for me nepenthe was mixed with a despair immense as the vault of heaven my good God for anon I would take it up to spy some perched hut of the peasant or burg of the bonder on the peaks and I saw no one there and to the left at the third marked bend of the fjord where there is one of those watch towers that these people used for watching in coming fish I spied lying on a craggy slope just before the tower a body which looked as if it must surely tumble head long but did not And when I saw that I felt definitely for the first time that shoreless despair which I alone of men have felt high beyond the stars and deep as hell and I fell to staring again that blank stare of Nirvana and the lunacy of Nothingness wherein Time merges in Eternity and all being like one drop of water flies scattered to fill the bottomless void of space and is lost The Boreal s bow walking over a little empty fishing boat roused me and a minute later just before I came to a new promontory and bend I saw two people The shore there is some three feet above the water and edged with boulders of rock about which grows a fringe of shrubs and small trees behind this fringe is a path curving upward through a sombre wooded little gorge and on the path near the water I saw a driver of one of those Norwegian sulkies that were called karjolers he on the high front seat was dead lying sideways and backwards with low head resting on the wheel and on a trunk strapped to a frame on the axle behind was a boy his head too resting sideways on the wheel near the other s and the little pony was dead pitched forward on its head and fore knees tilting the shafts downward and some distance from them on the water floated an empty skiff When I turned the next fore land I all at once began to see a number of craft which increased as I advanced most of them small boats with some schooners sloops and larger craft the majority a ground and suddenly now I was conscious that mingling with that delicious odour of spring blossoms profoundly modifying yet not destroying it was another odour wafted to me on the wings of the very faint land breeze and Man I said is decomposing for I knew it well it was the odour of human corruption 
7437_96157_000001_000000	train-clean-360	The fjord opened finally in a somewhat wider basin shut in by quite steep high towering mountains which reflected themselves in the water to their last cloudy crag and at the end of this I saw ships a quay and a modest homely old town 
none	none	Not a sound not one only the languidly working engines of the Boreal Here it was clear the Angel of Silence had passed and his scythe mown 
7437_96157_000003_000000	train-clean-360	I ran and stopped the engines and without anchoring got down into an empty boat that lay at the ship s side when she stopped and I paddled twenty yards toward the little quay 
none	none	There was a brigantine with all her courses set three jibs stay sails square sails main and fore sails and gaff top sail looking hanging and listless in that calm place and wedded to a still copy of herself mast downward in the water there were three lumber schooners a forty ton steam boat a tiny barque five Norway herring fishers and ten or twelve shallops and the sailing craft had all fore and aft sails set and about each as I passed among them brooded an odour that was both sweet and abhorrent an odour more suggestive of the very genius of mortality the inner mind and meaning of Azrael than aught that I could have conceived for all as I soon saw were crowded with dead Well I went up the old mossed steps in that strange dazed state in which one notices frivolous things I remember for instance feeling the lightness of my new clothes for the weather was quite mild and the day before I had changed to Summer things having on now only a common undyed woollen shirt the sleeves rolled up and cord trousers with a belt and a cloth cap over my long hair and an old pair of yellow shoes without laces and without socks And I stood on the unhewn stones of the edge of the quay and looked abroad over a largish piece of unpaved ground which lay between the first house row and the quay What I saw was not only most woeful but wildly startling woeful because a great crowd of people had assembled and lay dead there and wildly startling because something in their tout ensemble told me in one minute why they were there in such number 
7437_96157_000006_000000	train-clean-360	They were there in the hope and with the thought to fly westward by boat 
none	none	And the something which told me this was a certain foreign air about that field of the dead as the eye rested on it something un northern southern and Oriental Two yards from my feet as I stepped to the top lay a group of three one a Norway peasant girl in skirt of olive green scarlet stomacher embroidered bodice Scotch bonnet trimmed with silver lace and big silver shoe buckles the second was an old Norway man in knee breeches and eighteenth century small clothes and red worsted cap and the third was I decided an old Jew of the Polish Pale in gaberdine and skull cap with ear locks I went nearer to where they lay thick as reaped stubble between the quay and a little stone fountain in the middle of the space and I saw among those northern dead two dark skinned women in costly dress either Spanish or Italian and the yellower mortality of a Mongolian probably a Magyar and a big negro in zouave dress and some twenty five obvious French and two Morocco fezes and the green turban of a shereef and the white of an Ulema 
7437_96157_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And I asked myself this question How came these foreign stragglers here in this obscure northern town 
7437_96157_000011_000000	train-clean-360	And my wild heart answered There has been an impassioned stampede northward and westward of all the tribes of Man 
7437_96157_000011_000001	train-clean-360	And this that I Adam Jeffson here see is but the far tossed spray of that monstrous infuriate flood 
7437_96157_000012_000000	train-clean-360	Well I passed up a street before me careful careful where I trod 
none	none	It was not utterly silent nor was the quay square but haunted by a pretty dense cloud of mosquitoes and dreamy twinges of music like the drawing of the violin bow in elf land The street was narrow pavered steep and dark and the sensations with which I poor bent man passed through that dead town only Atlas fabled to bear the burden of this Earth could divine I thought to myself If now a wave from the Deep has washed over this planetary ship of earth and I who alone happened to be in the extreme bows am the sole survivor of that crew 
7437_96157_000013_000001	train-clean-360	What then my God shall I do 
7437_96157_000014_000000	train-clean-360	I felt I felt that in this townlet save the water gnats of Norway was no living thing that the hum and the savour of Eternity filled and wrapped and embalmed it 
none	none	The houses are mostly of wood some of them fairly large with a porte cochere leading into a semi circular yard around which the building stands very steep roofed and shingled in view of the heavy snow masses of winter 
7437_96157_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Glancing into one open casement near the ground I saw an aged woman stout and capped lie on her face before a very large porcelain stove but I paced on without stoppage traversed several streets and came out as it became dark upon a piece of grass land leading downward to a mountain gorge 
7437_96157_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It was some distance along this gorge that I found myself sitting the next morning and how and in what trance I passed that whole blank night is obliterated from my consciousness 
7437_96157_000015_000003	train-clean-360	When I looked about with the return of light I saw majestic fir grown mountains on either hand almost meeting overhead at some points deeply shading the mossy gorge 
none	none	I rose and careless of direction went still onward and walked and walked for hours unconscious of hunger there was a profusion of wild mountain strawberries very tiny which must grow almost into winter a few of which I ate there were blue gentianellas and lilies of the valley and luxuriance of verdure and a noise of waters Occasionally I saw little cataracts on high fluttering like white wild rags for they broke in the mid fall and were caught away and scattered patches also of reaped hay and barley hung up in a singular way on stakes six feet high I suppose to dry there were perched huts and a seemingly inaccessible small castle or burg but none of these did I enter and five bodies only I saw in the gorge a woman with a babe and a man with two small oxen 
7437_96157_000016_000000	train-clean-360	About three in the afternoon I was startled to find myself there and turned back 
none	none	It was dark when I again passed through those gloomy streets of Aadheim making for the quay and now I felt both my hunger and a dropping weariness I had no thought of entering any house but as I passed by one open porte cochere something I know not what made me turn sharply in for my mind had become as fluff on the winds not working of its own action but the sport of impulses that seemed external I went across the yard and ascended a wooden spiral stair by a twilight which just enabled me to pick my way among five or six vague forms fallen there 
7437_96157_000016_000004	train-clean-360	In that confined place fantastic qualms beset me I mounted to the first landing and tried the door but it was locked I mounted to the second the door was open and with a chill reluctance I took a step inward where all was pitch darkness the window stores being drawn 
7437_96157_000016_000005	train-clean-360	I hesitated it was very dark 
none	none	I tried to utter that word of mine but it came in a whisper inaudible to my ears I tried again and this time heard myself say anyone At the same time I had made another step forward and trodden upon a soft abdomen and at that contact terrors the most cold and ghastly thrilled me through and through for it was as though I saw in that darkness the sudden eyeballs of Hell and frenzy glare upon me and with a low gurgle of affright I was gone helter skelter down the stairs treading upon flesh across the yard and down the street with pelting feet and open arms and sobbing bosom for I thought that all Aadheim was after me nor was my horrid haste appeased till I was on board the Boreal and moving down the fjord 
7437_96157_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Out to sea then I went again and within the next few days I visited Bergen and put in at Stavanger 
7437_96157_000017_000001	train-clean-360	And I saw that Bergen and Stavanger were dead 
7437_96157_000018_000000	train-clean-360	It was then on the nineteenth August that I turned my bow toward my native land 
7437_96157_000019_000000	train-clean-360	From Stavanger I steered a straight course for the Humber 
7437_96157_000020_000000	train-clean-360	I had no sooner left behind me the Norway coast than I began to meet the ships the ships ship after ship and by the time I entered the zone of the ordinary alternation of sunny day and sunless night I was moving through the midst of an incredible number of craft a mighty and wide spread fleet 
none	none	Over all that great expanse of the North Sea where in its most populous days of trade the sailor might perhaps sight a sail or two I had now at every moment at least ten or twelve within scope of the glass oftentimes as many as forty forty five And very still they lay on a still sea itself a dead thing livid as the lips of death and there was an intensity in the calm that was appalling for the ocean seemed weighted and the air drugged Extremely slow was my advance for at first I would not leave any ship however remotely small without approaching sufficiently to investigate her at least with the spy glass and a strange multitudinous mixture of species they were trawlers in hosts war ships of every nation used it seemed as passenger boats smacks feluccas liners steam barges great four masters with sails Channel boats luggers a Venetian burchiello colliers yachts remorqueurs training ships dredgers two dahabeeahs with curving gaffs Marseilles fishers a Maltese speronare American off shore sail Mississippi steam boats Sorrento lug schooners Rhine punts yawls old frigates and three deckers called to novel use Stromboli caiques Yarmouth tubs xebecs Rotterdam flat bottoms floats mere gunwaled rafts anything from anywhere that could bear a human freight on water had come and was here and all I knew had been making westward or northward or both and all I knew were crowded and all were tombs listlessly wandering my God on the wandering sea with their dead 
7437_96157_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And so fair was the world about them too the brightest suavest autumn weather all the still air aromatic with that vernal perfume of peach yet not so utterly still but if I passed close to the lee of any floating thing the spicy stirrings of morning or evening wafted me faint puffs of the odour of mortality over ripe for the grave 
none	none	So abominable and accursed did this become to me such a plague and a hissing vague as was the offence that I began to shun rather than seek the ships and also I now dropped my twelve whom I had kept to be my companions all the way from the Far North one by one into the sea for now I had definitely passed into a zone of settled warmth I was convinced however that the poison whatever it might be had some embalming or antiseptic effect upon the bodies at Aadheim Bergen and Stavanger for instance where the temperature permitted me to go without a jacket only the merest hints and whiffs of the processes of dissolution had troubled me Very benign I say and pleasant to see was sky and sea during all that voyage but it was at sun set that my sense of the wondrously beautiful was roused and excited in spite of that great burden which I carried Certainly I never saw sun sets resembling those nor could have conceived of aught so flamboyant extravagant and bewitched for the whole heaven seemed turned into an arena for warring Hierarchies warring for the universe or it was like the wild countenance of God defeated and flying marred and bloody from His enemies But many evenings I watched with unintelligent awe believing it but a portent of the un sheathed sword of the Almighty till one morning a thought pricked me like a sword for I suddenly remembered the great sun sets of the later nineteenth century witnessed in Europe America and I believe over the world after the eruption of the volcano of Krakatoa And whereas I had before said to myself If now a wave from the Deep has washed over this planetary ship of earth I said now A wave but not from the Deep a wave rather which she had reserved and has spouted from her own un motherly entrails I had some knowledge of Morse telegraphy and of the manipulation of tape machines telegraphic typing machines and the ordinary wireless transmitter and coherer as of most little things of that sort which came within the outskirts of the interest of a man of science I had collaborated with Professor Stanistreet in the production of a text book called Applications of Science to the Arts which had brought us some notoriety and on the whole the minutiae of modern things were still pretty fresh in my memory 
7437_96157_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I could therefore have wired from Bergen or Stavanger supposing the batteries not run down to somewhere but I would not I was so afraid afraid lest for ever from nowhere should come one answering click or flash or stirring 
none	none	I could have made short work and landed at Hull but I would not I was so afraid 
7437_96157_000030_000001	train-clean-360	For I was used to the silence of the ice and I was used to the silence of the sea but I was afraid of the silence of England 
none	none	I came in sight of the coast on the morning of the twenty sixth August somewhere about Hornsea but did not see any town for I put the helm to port and went on further south no longer bothering with the instruments but coasting at hap hazard now in sight of land and now in the centre of a circle of sea not admitting to myself the motive of this loitering slowness nor thinking at all but ignoring the deep buried fear of the to morrow which I shirked and instinctively hiding myself in to day I passed the Wash I passed Yarmouth Felixstowe By now the things that floated motionless on the sea were beyond numbering for I could hardly lower my eyes ten minutes and lift them without seeing yet another there so that soon after dusk I too had to lie still among them all till morning for they lay dark and to move at any pace would have been to drown the already dead Well I came to the Thames mouth and lay pretty well in among the Flats and Pan Sands towards eight one evening not seven miles from Sheppey and the North Kent coast and I did not see any Nore Light nor Girdler Light and all along the coast I had seen no light but as to that I said not one word to myself not admitting it nor letting my heart know what my brain thought nor my brain know what my heart surmised but with a daft and mock mistrustful under look I would regard the darkling land holding it a sentient thing that would be playing a prank upon a poor man like me And the next morning when I moved again my furtive eye corners were very well aware of the Prince s Channel light ship and also the Tongue ship for there they were but I would not look at them at all nor go near them for I did not wish to have anything to do with whatever might have happened beyond my own ken and it was better to look straight before seeing nothing and concerning one s self with one s self The next evening after having gone out to sea again I was in a little to the E by S of the North Foreland and I saw no light there nor any Sandhead light but over the sea vast signs of wreckage and the coasts were strewn with old wrecked fleets I turned about S E very slowly moving for anywhere hereabouts hundreds upon hundreds of craft lay dead within a ten mile circle of sea and by two in the fore day had wandered up well in sight of the French cliffs for I had said I will go and see the light beam of the great revolving drum on Calais pier that nightly beams half way over sea to England And the moon shone clear in the southern heaven that morning like a great old dying queen whose Court swarms distantly from around her diffident pale and tremulous the paler the nearer and I could see the mountain shadows on her spotty full face and her misty aureole and her lights on the sea as it were kisses stolen in the kingdom of sleep and all among the quiet ships mysterious white trails and powderings of light like palace corridors in some fairy land forlorn full of breathless wan whispers scandals and runnings to and fro with leers and agitated last embraces and flight of the princess and death bed of the king and on the N E horizon a bank of brown cloud that seemed to have no relation with the world and yonder not far the white coast cliffs not so low as at Calais near but arranged in masses separated by vales of sward each with its wreck but no light of any revolving drum I saw I could not sleep that night for all the operations of my mind and body seemed in abeyance Mechanically I turned the ship westward again and when the sun came up there hardly two miles from me were the cliffs of Dover and on the crenulated summit of the Castle I spied the Union Jack hang motionless I heard eight nine o clock strike in the cabin and I was still at sea But some mad audacious whisper was at my brain and at ten point thirty the second September immediately opposite the Cross Wall Custom House the Boreal s anchor chain after a voyage of three years two months and fourteen days ran thundering thundering through the starboard hawse hole Ah heaven but I must have been stark mad to let the anchor go for the effect upon me of that shocking obstreperous hubbub breaking in upon all that cemetery repose that blessed morning and lasting it seemed a year was most appalling and at the sudden racket I stood excruciated with shivering knees and flinching heart God knows for not less terrifically uproarious than the clatter of the last Trump it raged and raged and I thought that all the billion dead could not fail to start and rise at alarum so excessive and question me with their eyes On the top of the Cross Wall near I saw a grey crab fearlessly crawl at the end where the street begins I saw a single gas light palely burn that broad day and at its foot a black man lay on his face clad only in a shirt and one boot the harbour was almost packed with every sort of craft and on a Calais Dover boat eight yards from my stern which must have left Calais crowded to suffocation I saw the rotted dead lie heaped she being unmoored and continually grinding against an anchored green brig And when I saw that I dropped down upon my knees at the capstan and my poor heart sobbed out the frail cry Well Lord God Thou hast destroyed the work of Thy hand After a time I got up went below in a state of somnambulism took a packet of pemmican cakes leapt to land and went following the railway that runs from the Admiralty Pier In an enclosed passage ten yards long with railway masonry on one side I saw five dead lie and could not believe that I was in England for all were dark skinned people three gaudily dressed and two in flowing white robes It was the same when I turned into a long street leading northward for here were a hundred or more and never saw I except in Constantinople where I once lived eighteen months so variegated a mixture of races black brunette brown yellow white in all the shades some emaciated like people dead from hunger and overlooking them all one English boy with a clean Eton collar sitting on a bicycle supported by a lamp post which his arms clasped he proving clearly the extraordinary suddenness of the death which had overtaken them all I did not know whither nor why I went nor had I the least idea whether all this was visually seen by me in the world which I had known or in some other or was all phantasy of my disembodied spirit for I had the thought that I too might be dead since old ages and my spirit wandering now through the universe of space in which there is neither north nor south nor up nor down nor measure nor relation nor aught whatever save an uneasy consciousness of a dream about bottomlessness Of grief or pain I think I felt nothing though I have a sort of memory now that some sound resembling a sob or groan though it was neither came at regular clockwork intervals from my bosom during three or four days Meantime my brain registered like a tape machine details the most frivolous the most ludicrous the name of a street Strond Street Snargate Street the round fur cap black fur for the side white ermine for the top of a portly Karaite priest on his back whose robes had been blown to his spread knees as if lifted and neatly folded there a violin bow gripped between the thick irregular teeth of a little Spaniard with brushed back hair and mad looking eyes odd shoes on the foot of a French girl one black one brown They lay in the street about as numerous as gunners who fall round their carriage at intervals of five to ten feet the majority as was the case also in Norway and on the ships in poses of distraction with spread arms or wildly distorted limbs like men who the instant before death called upon the rocks and hills to cover them On the left I came to an opening in the land called I believe The Shaft and into this I turned climbing a very great number of steps almost covered at one point with dead the steps I began to count but left off then the dead and left off Finally at the top which must be even higher than the Castle I came to a great open space laid out with gravel walks and saw fortifications barracks a citadel I did not know the town except by passings through and was surprised at the breadth of view Between me and the Castle to the east lay the district of crowding houses brick and ragstone mixed in the distance with vague azure haze and to the right the harbour the sea with their ships and visible around me on the heights seven or eight dead biting the dust the sun now high and warm with hardly a cloud in the sky and yonder a mist which was the coast of France It seemed too big for one poor man My head nodded I sat on a bench black painted and hard the seat and back of horizontal boards with intervals and as I looked I nodded heavy headed and weary for it was too big for me And as I nodded with forehead propped on my left hand and the packet of pemmican cakes in my right there was in my head somehow an old street song of my childhood and I groaned it sleepily like coronachs and drear funereal nenias dirging and the packet beat time in my right hand falling and raising falling heavily and rising in time I ll buy the ring You ll rear the kids Servants to wait on our ting ting ting Ting ting Won t we be happy Ting ting That shall be it I ll buy the ring You ll rear the kids Servants to wait on our ting ting ting So maundering I fell forward upon my face and for twenty three hours the living undistinguished from the dead I slept there I was awakened by drizzle leapt up looked at a silver chronometer which attached by a leather to my belt I carried in my breeches pocket and saw that it was ten A M The sky was dark and a moaning wind almost a new thing now to me had arisen I ate some pemmican for I had a reluctance needless as it turned out to touch any of the thousand luxuries here sufficient no doubt in a town like Dover alone to last me five or six hundred years if I could live so long and having eaten I descended The Shaft and spent the whole day though it rained and blustered continually in wandering about Reasoning in my numb way from the number of ships on the sea I expected to find the town over crowded with dead but this was not so and I should say at a venture that not a thousand English nor fifteen thousand foreigners were in it for that westward rage and stampede must have operated here also leaving the town empty but for the ever new coming hosts The first thing which I did was to go into an open grocer s shop which was also a post and telegraph office with the notion I suppose to get a message through to London In the shop a single gas light was burning its last and this with that near the pier were the only two that I saw and ghastly enough they looked transparently wannish and as it were ashamed like blinking night things overtaken by the glare of day I conjectured that they had so burned and watched during months or years for they were now blazing diminished with streaks and rays in the flame as if by effort and if these were the only two they must have needed time to all but exhaust the works Before the counter lay a fashionably dressed negro with a number of tied parcels scattered about him and on the counter an empty till and behind it a tall thin woman with her face resting sideways in the till fingers clutching the outer counter rim and such an expression of frantic terror as I never saw I got over the counter to a table behind a wire gauze and like a numb fool went over the Morse alphabet in my mind before touching the transmitting key though I knew no code words and there big enough to be seen was the ABC dial and who was to answer my message I did not ask myself for habit was still strong upon me and my mind refused to reason from what I saw to what I did not see but the moment I touched the key and peered greedily at the galvanometer needle at my right I saw that it did not move for no current was passing and with a kind of fright I was up leapt and got away from the place though there was a great number of telegrams about the receiver which if I had been in my senses I would have stopped and read Turning the corner of the next street I saw wide open the door of a substantial large house and went in From bottom to top there was no one there except one English girl sitting back in an easy chair in the drawing room which was richly furnished with Valenciennes curtains and azure satin things She was a girl of the lowest class hardly clad in black rags and there she lay with hanging jaw in a very crooked and awkward pose a jemmy at her feet in her left hand a roll of bank notes and in her lap three watches In fact the bodies which I saw here were in general either those of new come foreigners or else of the very poor the very old or the very young But what made me remember this house was that I found here on one of the sofas a newspaper The Kent Express and sitting unconscious of my dead neighbour I pored a long while over what was written there It said in a passage which I tore out and kept Telegraphic communication with Tilsit Insterburg Warsaw Cracow Przemysl Gross Wardein Karlsburg and many smaller towns lying immediately eastward of the twenty first parallel of longitude has ceased during the night In some at least of them there must have been operators still at their duty undrawn into the great westward rushing torrent but as all messages from Western Europe have been answered only by that dread mysterious silence which just three months and two days since astounded the world in the case of Eastern New Zealand we can only assume that these towns too have been added to the long and mournful list indeed after last evening s Paris telegrams we might have prophesied with some certainty not merely their overthrow but even the hour of it for the rate uniformity of the slow riding vapour which is touring our globe is no longer doubtful and has even been definitely fixed by Professor Craven at one hundred one two miles per day or four miles three hundred thirty yards per hour Its nature its origin remains of course nothing but matter of conjecture for it leaves no living thing behind it nor God knows is that of any moment now to us who remain The rumour that it is associated with an odour of almonds is declared on high authority to be improbable but the morose purple of its impending gloom has been attested by tardy fugitives from the face of its rolling and smoky march Is this the end We do not and cannot believe it Will the pure sky which we to day see above us be invaded in nine days or less by this smoke of the Pit of Darkness In spite of the assurances of the scientists we still doubt For if so to what purpose that long drama of History in which we seem to see the Hand of the Dramaturgist Surely the end of a Fifth Act should be obvious satisfying to one s sense of the complete but History so far long as it has been resembles rather a Prologue than a Fifth Act Can it be that the Manager utterly dissatisfied would sweep all off and hang up the piece for ever Certainly the sins of mankind have been as scarlet and if the fair earth which he has turned into Hell send forth now upon him the smoke of Hell little the wonder But we cannot yet believe There is a sparing strain in nature and through the world as a thread is spun a silence which smiles and on the end of events we find placarded large the words Why were ye afraid A dignified Hope therefore even now when we cower beneath this worldwide shadow of the wings of the Condor of Death becomes us and indeed we see such an attitude among some of the humblest of our people from whose heart ascends the cry Though He slay me yet will I trust in Him Here therefore O Lord O Lord look down and save But even as we thus write of hope Reason if we would hear her whispers us fool and inclement is the sky of earth No more ships can New York Harbour contain and whereas among us men die weekly of privations by the hundred thousand yonder across the sea they perish by the million for where the rich are pinched how can the poor live Already seven hundred out of the one thousand millions of our race have perished and the empires of civilisation have crumbled like sand castles in a horror of anarchy Thousands upon thousands of unburied dead anticipating the more deliberate doom that comes and smokes and rides and comes and comes and does not fail encumber the streets of London Manchester Liverpool The guides of the nation have fled the father stabs his child and the wife her husband for a morsel of food the fields lie waste wanton crowds carouse in our churches universities palaces banks and hospitals we understand that late last night three territorial regiments the Munster Fusiliers and the Lotian and East Lancashire Regiments riotously disbanded themselves shooting two officers infectious diseases as we all know have spread beyond limit in several towns the police seem to have disappeared and in nearly all every vestige of decency the results following upon the sudden release of the convicts appear to be monstrous in the respective districts and within three short months Hell seems to have acquired this entire planet sending forth Horror like a rabid wolf and Despair like a disastrous sky to devour and confound her Hear therefore O Lord and forgive our iniquities O Lord we beseech Thee Look down O Lord and spare When I had read this and the rest of the paper which had one whole sheet side blank I sat a long hour there eyeing a little patch of the purple ash on a waxed board near the corner where the girl sat with her time pieces so useless in her Eternity and there was not a feeling in me except a pricking of curiosity which afterwards became morbid and ravenous to know something more of that cloud or smoke of which this man spoke of its dates its origin its nature its minute details Afterwards I went down and entered several houses searching for more papers but did not find any then I found a paper shop which was open with boards outside but either it had been deserted or printing must have stopped about the date of the paper which I had read for the only three news papers there were dated long prior and I did not read them Now it was raining and a blustering autumn day it was distributing the odours of the world and bringing me continual mixed whiffs of flowers and the hateful stench of decay But I would not mind it much I wandered and wandered till I was tired of spahi and bashi bazouk of Greek and Catalan of Russian pope and Coptic abuna of dragoman and Calmuck of Egyptian maulawi and Afghan mullah Neapolitan and sheik and the nightmare of wild poses colours stuffs and garbs the yellow green kefie of the Bedouin shawl turbans of Baghdad the voluminous rose silk tob of women and face veils and stark distorted nakedness and sashes of figured muslin and the workman s cords and the red tarboosh About four for very weariness I was sitting on a door steep bent beneath the rain but soon was up again fascinated no doubt by this changing bazaar of sameness its chance combinations and permutations and novelty in monotony About five I was at a station marked Harbour Station in and about which lay a considerable crowd but not one train I sat again and rested rose and roamed again soon after six I found myself at another station called Priory and here I saw two long trains both crowded one on a siding and one at the up platform I examined both engines and found them of the old boiler steam type with manholes heaters autoclaves feed pump c now rare in western countries except England In one there was no water but in that at the platform the float lever barely tilted toward the float showed that there was some in the boiler Of this one I overhauled all the machinery and found it good though rusted There was plenty of fuel and oil which I supplemented from a near shop and during ninety minutes my brain and hands worked with an intelligence as it were automatic of their own motion After three journeys across the station and street I saw the fire blaze well and the manometer move when the lever of the safety valve whose load I lightened by half an atmosphere lifted I jumped down and tried to disconnect the long string of carriages from the engine but failed the coupling being an automatic arrangement new to me nor did I care It was now very dark but there was still oil for bull s eye and lantern and I lit them I forgot nothing I rolled driver and stoker the guard was absent one to the platform one upon the rails and I took their place there At about eight point thirty I ran out from Dover my throttle valve pealing high a long falsetto through the bleak and desolate night My aim was London But even as I set out my heart smote me I knew nothing of the metals their junctions facing points sidings shuntings and complexities Even as to whether I was going toward or away from London I was not sure But just in proportion as my first timorousness of the engine hardened into familiarity and self sureness I quickened speed wilfully with an obstinacy deaf and blind Finally from a mere crawl at first I was flying at a shocking velocity while something tongue in cheek seemed to whisper me There must be other trains blocking the lines at stations in yards and everywhere it is a maniac s ride a ride of death and Flying Dutchman s frenzy remember your dark five deep brigade of passengers who rock and bump together and will suffer in a collision But with mulish stubbornness I thought They wished to go to London and on I raged not wildly exhilarated so far as I can remember nor lunatic but feeling the dull glow of a wicked and morose Unreason urge in my bosom while I stoked all blackened at the fire or saw the vague mass of dead horse or cow running trees and fields and dark homestead and deep slumbering farm flit ghostly athwart the murky air as the half blind saw men like trees walking Long however it did not last I could not have been twenty miles from Dover when on a long reach of straight lines I made out before me a tarpaulined mass opposite a signal point and at once callousness changed to terror within me But even as I plied the brake I felt that it was too late I rushed to the gangway to make a wild leap down an embankment to the right but was thrown backward by a quick series of rough bumps caused by eight or ten cattle which lay there across the lines and when I picked myself up and leapt some seconds before the impact the speed must have considerably slackened for I received no fracture but lay in semi coma in a patch of yellow flowered whin on level ground and was even conscious of a fire on the lines forty yards away and all the night of vague thunder sounding from somewhere About five or half past in the morning I was sitting up rubbing my eyes in a dim light mixed with drizzle I could see that the train of my last night s debauch was a huddled up chaos of fallen carriages and disfigured bodies A five barred gate on my left opened into a hedge and swung with creaks two yards from my feet lay a little shaggy pony with swollen wan abdomen the very picture of death and also about me a number of dead wet birds I picked myself up passed through the gate and walked up a row of trees to a house at their end I found it to be a little country tavern with a barn forming one house the barn part much larger than the tavern part I went into the tavern by a small side door behind the bar into a parlour up a little stair into two rooms but no one was there I then went round into the barn which was paved with cobble stones and there lay a dead mare and foal some fowls with two cows A ladder stair led to a closed trap door in the floor above I went up and in the middle of a wilderness of hay saw nine people labourers no doubt five men and four women huddled together and with them a tin pail containing the last of some spirit so that these had died merry I slept three hours among them and afterwards went back to the tavern and had some biscuits of which I opened a new tin with some ham jam and apples of which I made a good meal for my pemmican was gone Afterwards I went following the rail track on foot for the engines of both the collided trains were smashed I knew northward from southward by the position of the sun and after a good many stoppages at houses and by railway banks I came at about eleven in the night to a great and populous town By the Dane John and the Cathedral I immediately recognised it as Canterbury which I knew quite well And I walked up Castle Street to the High Street conscious for the first time of that regularly repeated sound like a sob or groan which was proceeding from my throat As there was no visible moon and these old streets very dim I had to pick my way lest I should desecrate the dead with my foot and they all should rise with hue and cry to hunt me However the bodies here were not numerous most as before being foreigners and these scattered about this strict old English burg that mourning dark night presented such a scene of the baneful wrath of God and all abomination of desolation as broke me quite down at one place where I stood in travail with jeremiads and sore sobbings and lamentations crying out upon it all God knows Only when I stood at the west entrance of the Cathedral I could discern spreading up the dark nave to the lantern to the choir a phantasmagorical mass of forms I went a little inward and striking three matches peered nearer the two transepts too seemed crowded the cloister doorway was blocked the southwest porch thronged so that a great congregation must have flocked hither shortly before their fate overtook them Here it was that I became definitely certain that the after odour of the poison was not simply lingering in the air but was being more or less given off by the bodies for the blossomy odour of this church actually overcame that other odour the whole rather giving the scent of old mouldy linens long embalmed in cedars Well away with stealthy trot I ran from the abysmal silence of that place and in Palace Street near made one of those sudden immoderate rackets that seemed to outrage the universe and left me so woefully faint decrepit and gasping for life the noise of the train was different for there I was flying but here a captive and which way I ran was capture Passing in Palace Street I saw a little lampshop and wanting a lantern tried to get in but the door was locked so after going a few steps and kicking against a policeman s truncheon I returned to break the window glass I knew that it would make a fearful noise and for some fifteen or twenty minutes stood hesitating but never could I have dreamed my good God of such a noise so passionate so dominant so divulgent and O Heaven so long lasting for I seemed to have struck upon the weak spot of some planet which came suddenly tumbling with protracted bellowing and debacle about my ears It was a good hour before I would climb in but then quickly found what I wanted and some big oil cans and till one or two in the morning the innovating flicker of my lantern went peering at random into the gloomy nooks of the town Under a deep old Gothic arch that spanned a pavered alley I saw the little window of a little house of rubble and between the two diamond paned sashes rags tightly beaten in the idea evidently being to make the place air tight against the poison When I went in I found the door of that room open though it too apparently had been stuffed at the edges and on the threshold an old man and woman lay low I conjectured that thus protected they had remained shut in till either hunger or the lack of oxygen in the used up air drove them forth whereupon the poison still active must have instantly ended them I found afterwards that this expedient of making air tight had been widely resorted to and it might well have proved successful if both the supply of inclosed air and of food had been anywhere commensurate with the durability of the poisonous state Weary weary as I grew some morbid persistence sustained me and I would not rest About four in the morning I was at a station again industriously bending poor wretch at the sooty task of getting another engine ready for travel This time when steam was up I succeeded in uncoupling the carriages from the engine and by the time morning broke I was lightly gliding away over the country whither I did not know but making for London Now I went with more intelligence and caution and got on very well travelling seven days never at night except it was very clear never at more than twenty or twenty five miles and crawling through tunnels I do not know the maze into which the train took me for very soon after leaving Canterbury it must have gone down some branch line and though the names were marked at stations that hardly helped me for of their situation relatively to London I was seldom sure Moreover again and again was my progress impeded by trains on the metals when I would have to run back to a shunting point or a siding and in two instances these being far behind changed from my own to the impeding engine On the first day I travelled unhindered till noon when I stopped in open country that seemed uninhabited for ages only that half a mile to the left on a shaded sward was a large stone house of artistic design coated with tinted harling the roof of red Ruabon tiles and timbered gables I walked to it after another row with putting out the fire and arranging for a new one the day being bright and mild with great masses of white cloud in the sky The house had an outer and an inner hall three reception rooms fine oil paintings a kind of museum and a large kitchen In a bed room above stairs I found three women with servants caps and a footman arranged in a strange symmetrical way head to head like rays of a star As I stood looking at them I could have sworn my good God that I heard someone coming up the stairs But it was some slight creaking of the breeze in the house augmented a hundredfold to my inflamed and fevered hearing for used for years now to this silence of Eternity it is as though I hear all sounds through an ear trumpet I went down and after eating and drinking some clary water made of brandy sugar cinnamon and rose water which I found in plenty I lay down on a sofa in the inner hall and slept a quiet sleep until near midnight I went out then still possessed with the foolish greed to reach London and after getting the engine to rights went off under a clear black sky thronged with worlds and far sown spawn some of them I thought perhaps like this of mine whelmed and drowned in oceans of silence with one only inhabitant to see it and hear its silence And all the long night I travelled stopping twice only once to get the coal from an engine which had impeded me and once to drink some water which I took care as always should be running water When I felt my head nod and my eyes close about five A M I threw myself just outside the arch of a tunnel upon a grassy bank pretty thick with stalks and flowers the workings of early dawn being then in the east and there till near eleven slept On waking I noticed that the country now seemed more like Surrey than Kent there was that regular swell and sinking of the land but in fact though it must have been either it looked like neither for already all had an aspect of return to a state of wild nature and I could see that for a year at the least no hand had tended the soil Near before me was a stretch of lucerne of such extraordinary growth that I was led during that day and the succeeding one to examine the condition of vegetation with some minuteness and nearly everywhere I detected a certain hypertrophie tendency in stamens calycles pericarps and pistils in every sort of bulbiferous growth that I looked at in the rushes above all the fronds mosses lichens and all cryptogamia and in the trefoils clover especially and some creepers Many crop fields it was clear had been prepared but not sown some had not been reaped and in both cases I was struck with their appearance of rankness as I was also when in Norway and was all the more surprised that this should be the case at a time when a poison whose action is the arrest of oxidation had traversed the earth I could only conclude that its presence in large volumes in the lower strata of the atmosphere had been more or less temporary and that the tendency to exuberance which I observed was due to some principle by which Nature acts with freer energy and larger scope in the absence of man Two yards from the rails I saw when I got up a little rill beside a rotten piece of fence barely oozing itself onward under masses of foul and stagnant fungoids and here there was a sudden splash and life and I caught sight of the hind legs of a diving young frog I went and lay on my belly poring over the clear dulcet little water and presently saw two tiny bleaks or ablets go gliding low among the swaying moss hair of the bottom rocks and thought how gladly would I be one of them with my home so thatched and shady and my life drowned in their wide eyed reverie At any rate these little creatures are alive the batrachians also and as I found the next day pupae and chrysales of one sort or another for to my deep emotion I saw a little white butterfly staggering in the air over the flower garden of a rustic station named Butley It was while I was lying there poring upon that streamlet that a thought came into my head for I said to myself If now I be here alone alone alone alone alone one on the earth and my girth have a spread of twenty five thousand miles what will happen to my mind Into what kind of creature shall I writhe and change I may live two years so What will have happened then I may live five years ten What will have happened after the five the ten I may live twenty thirty forty Already already there are things that peep and sprout within me I wanted food and fresh running water and walked from the engine half a mile through fields of lucerne whose luxuriance quite hid the foot paths and reached my shoulder After turning the brow of a hill I came to a park passing through which I saw some dead deer and three persons and emerged upon a terraced lawn at the end of which stood an Early English house of pale brick with copings plinths stringcourses of limestone and spandrels of carved marble and some distance from the porch a long table or series of tables in the open air still spread with cloths that were like shrouds after a month of burial and the table had old foods on it and some lamps and all around it and all on the lawn were dead peasants I seemed to know the house probably from some print which I may have seen but I could not make out the escutcheon though I saw from its simplicity that it must be very ancient Right across the facade spread still some of the letters in evergreens of the motto Many happy returns of the day so that someone must have come of age or something for inside all was gala and it was clear that these people had defied a fate which they of course foreknew I went nearly throughout the whole spacious place of thick carpeted halls marbles and famous oils antlers and arras and gilt saloons and placid large bed chambers and it took me an hour There were here not less than a hundred and eighty people In the first of a vista of three large reception rooms lay what could only have been a number of quadrille parties for to the coup d oeil they presented a two and two appearance made very repulsive by their jewels and evening dress I had to steel my heart to go through this house for I did not know if these people were looking at me as soon as my back was turned Once I was on the very point of flying for I was going up the great central stairway and there came a pelt of dead leaves against a window pane in a corridor just above on the first floor which thrilled me to the inmost soul But I thought that if I once fled they would all be at me from behind and I should be gibbering mad long long before I reached the outer hall and so stood my ground even defiantly advancing In a small dark bedroom in the north wing on the second floor that is to say at the top of the house I saw a tall young lady and a groom or wood man to judge by his clothes horribly riveted in an embrace on a settee she with a light coronet on her head in low necked dress and their lipless teeth still fiercely pressed together I collected in a bag a few delicacies from the under regions of this house Lyons sausages salami mortadel apples roes raisins artichokes biscuits a few wines a ham bottled fruit pickles coffee and so on with a gold plate tin opener cork screw fork c and dragged them all the long way back to the engine before I could eat My brain was in such a way that it was several days before the perfectly obvious means of finding my way to London since I wished to go there at all occurred to me and the engine went wandering the intricate railway system of the south country I having twice to water her with a coal bucket from a pool for the injector was giving no water from the tank under the coals and I did not know where to find any near tank sheds On the fifth evening instead of into London I ran into Guildford That night from eleven till the next day there was a great storm over England let me note it down And ten days later on the seventeenth of the month came another and on the twenty third another and I should be put to it to count the great number since And they do not resemble English storms but rather Arctic ones in a certain very suggestive something of personalness and a carousing malice and a Tartarus gloom which I cannot quite describe That night at Guildford after wandering about and becoming very weary I threw myself upon a cushioned pew in an old Norman church with two east apses called saint Mary s using a Bible cushion for pillow and placing some distance away a little tin lamp turned low whose ray served me for veilleuse through the night Happily I had taken care to close up everything or I feel sure the roof must have gone Only one dead an old lady in a chapel on the north side of the chancel whom I rather mistrusted was there with me and there I lay listening for after all I could not sleep a wink while outside vogued the immense tempest And I communed with myself thinking I poor man lost in this conflux of infinitudes and vortex of the world what can become of me my God For dark ah dark is the waste void into which from solid ground I am now plunged a million fathoms deep the sport of all the whirlwinds and it were better for me to have died with the dead and never to have seen the wrath and turbulence of the Ineffable nor to have heard the thrilling bleakness of the winds of Eternity when they pine and long and whimper and when they vociferate and blaspheme and when they expostulate and intrigue and implore and when they despair and die which ear of man should never hear For they mean to eat me up I know these Titanic darknesses and soon like a whiff I shall pass away and leave the world to them So till next morning I lay mumping with shivers and cowerings for the shocks of the storm pervaded the locked church to my very heart and there were thunders that night my God like callings and laughs and banterings exchanged between distant hill tops in Hell Well the next morning I went down the steep High Street and found a young nun at the bottom whom I had left the previous evening with a number of girls in uniform opposite the Guildhall half way up the street She must have been spun down arm over arm for the wind was westerly and whereas I had left her completely dressed to her wimple and beads she was now nearly stripped and her little flock scattered And branches of trees and wrecked houses and reeling clouds of dead leaves were everywhere that wild morning This town of Guildford appeared to be the junction of an extraordinary number of railway lines and before again setting out in the afternoon when the wind had lulled having got an A B C guide and a railway map I decided upon my line and upon a new engine feeling pretty sure now of making London only thirty miles away I then set out and about five o clock was at Surbiton near my aim I kept on expecting every few minutes to see the great city till darkness fell and still at considerable risk I went as I thought forward but no London was there I had in fact been on a loop line and at Surbiton gone wrong again for the next evening I found myself at Wokingham farther away than ever I slept on a rug in the passage of an inn called The Rose for there was a wild Russian looking man with projecting top teeth on a bed in the house whose appearance I did not like and it was late and I too tired to walk further and the next morning pretty early I set out again and at ten A M was at Reading The notion of navigating the land by precisely the same means as the sea simple and natural as it was had not at all occurred to me but at the first accidental sight of a compass in a little shop window near the river at Reading my difficulties as to getting to any desired place in the world vanished once and for all for a good chart or map the compass a pair of compasses and in the case of longer distances a quadrant sextant or theodolite with a piece of paper and pencil were all that were necessary to turn an engine into a land ship one choosing the lines that ran nearest the direction of one s course whenever they did not run precisely Thus provided I ran out from Reading about seven in the evening while there was still some light having spent there some nine hours This was the town where I first observed that shocking crush of humanity which I afterwards met in every large town west of London Here I should say the English were quite equal in number to the foreigners and there were enough of both God knows for London must have poured many here There were houses in every room of which and on the stairs the dead actually overlay each other and in the streets before them were points where only on flesh or under carriages was it possible to walk I went into the great County Gaol from which as I had read the prisoners had been released two weeks before hand and there I found the same pressed condition cells occupied by ten or twelve the galleries continuously rough paved with faces heads and old clothes shops of robes and in the parade ground against one wall a mass of human stuff like tough grey clay mixed with rags and trickling black gore where a crush as of hydraulic power must have acted At a corner between a gate and a wall near the biscuit factory of this town I saw a boy whom I believe to have been blind standing jammed at his wrist a chain ring and at the end of the chain a dog from his hap hazard posture I conjectured that he and chain and dog had been lifted from the street and placed so by the storm of the seventh of the month and what made it very curious was that his right arm pointed a little outward just over the dog so that at the moment when I first sighted him he seemed a drunken fellow setting his dog at me In fact all the dead I found much mauled and stripped and huddled and the earth seemed to be making an abortive effort to sweep her streets Well some little distance from Reading I saw a big flower seed farm looking dead in some plots and in others quite rank and here again fluttering quite near the engine two little winged aurelians in the quiet evening air I went on passing a great number of crowded trains on the down line two of them in collision and very broken up and one exploded engine even the fields and cuttings on either hand of the line had a rather populous look as if people when trains and vehicles failed had set to trudging westward in caravans and streams When I came to a long tunnel near Slough I saw round the foot of the arch an extraordinary quantity of wooden debris and as I went very slowly through was alarmed by the continuous bumping of the train which I knew was passing over bodies at the other end were more debris and I easily guessed that a company of desperate people had made the tunnel air tight at the two arches and provisioned themselves with the hope to live there till the day of destiny was passed whereupon their barricades must have been crashed through by some up train and themselves crushed or else other crowds mad to share their cave of refuge had stormed the boardings This latter as I afterwards found was a very usual event I should very soon have got to London now but as my bad luck would have it I met a long up train on the metals with not one creature in any part of it There was nothing to do but to tranship with all my things to its engine which I found in good condition with plenty of coal and water and to set it going a hateful labour I being already jet black from hair to toes However by half past ten I found myself stopped by another train only a quarter of a mile from Paddington and walked the rest of the way among trains in which the standing dead still stood propped by their neighbours and over metals where bodies were as ordinary and cheap as waves on the sea or twigs in a forest I believe that wild crowds had given chase on foot to moving trains or fore run them in the frenzied hope of inducing them to stop I came to the great shed of glass and girders which is the station the night being perfectly soundless moonless starless and the hour about eleven I found later that all the electric generating stations or all that I visited were intact that is to say must have been shut down before the arrival of the doom also that the gas works had almost certainly been abandoned some time previously so that this city of dreadful night in which at the moment when Silence choked it not less than forty to sixty millions swarmed and droned must have more resembled Tartarus and the foul shades of Hell than aught to which my fancy can liken it For coming nearer the platforms I saw that trains in order to move at all must have moved through a slough of bodies pushed from behind and forming a packed homogeneous mass on the metals and I knew that they had moved Nor could I now move unless I decided to wade for flesh was everywhere on the roofs of trains cramming the interval between them on the platforms splashing the pillars like spray piled on trucks and lorries a carnal quagmire and outside it filled the space between a great host of vehicles carpeting all that region of London And all here that odour of blossoms which nowhere yet save on one vile ship had failed was now wholly overcome by another and the thought was in my head my God that if the soul of man had sent up to Heaven the odour which his body gave to me then it was not so strange that things were as they were I got out from the station with ears God knows that still awaited the accustomed noising of this accursed town habituated as I now was to all the dumb and absent void of Soundlessness and I was overwhelmed in a new awe and lost in a wilder woesomeness when instead of lights and business I saw the long street which I knew brood darker than Babylons long desolate and in place of its ancient noising heard my God a shocking silence rising higher than I had ever heard it and blending with the silence of the inane eternal stars in heaven I could not get into any vehicle for some time for all thereabouts was practically a mere block but near the Park which I attained by stooping among wheels and selecting my foul steps I overhauled a Daimler car found in it two cylinders of petrol lit the ignition lamp removed with averted abhorrence three bodies mounted and broke that populous stillness And through streets nowhere empty of bodies I went urging eastward my jolting and spattered and humming way That I should have persisted with so much pains to come to this unbounded catacomb seems now singular to me for by that time I could not have been sufficiently daft to expect to find another being like myself on the earth though I cherished I remember the irrational hope of yet somewhere finding dog or cat or horse to be with me and would anon think bitterly of Reinhardt my Arctic dog which my own hand had shot But in reality a morbid curiosity must have been within me all the time to read the real truth of what had happened so far as it was known or guessed and to gloat upon all that drama and cup of trembling and pouring out of the vials of the wrath of God which must have preceded the actual advent of the end of Time This inquisitiveness had at every town which I reached made the search for newspapers uppermost in my mind but by bad luck I had found only four all of them ante dated to the one which I had read at Dover though their dates gave me some idea of the period when printing must have ceased viz soon after the seventeenth July about three months subsequent to my arrival at the Pole for none I found later than this date and these contained nothing scientific but only orisons and despairings On arriving therefore at London I made straight for the office of the Times only stopping at a chemist s in Oxford Street for a bottle of antiseptic to hold near my nose though having once left the neighbourhood of Paddington I had hardly much need of this I made my way to the square where the paper was printed to find that even there the ground was closely strewn with calpac and pugaree black abayeh and fringed praying shawl hob nail and sandal figured lungi and striped silk all very muddled and mauled Through the dark square to the twice dark building I passed and found open the door of an advertisement office but on striking a match saw that it had been lighted by electricity and had therefore to retrace my stumbling steps till I came to a shop of lamps in a near alley walking meantime with timid cares that I might hurt no one for in this enclosed neighbourhood I began to feel strange tremors and kept striking matches which so still was the black air hardly flickered When I returned to the building with a little lighted lamp I at once saw a file on a table and since there were a number of dead there and I wished to be alone I took the heavy mass of paper between my left arm and side and the lamp in my right hand passed then behind a counter and then to the right up a stair which led me into a very great building and complexity of wooden steps and corridors where I went peering the lamp visibly trembling in my hand for here also were the dead Finally I entered a good sized carpeted room with a baize covered table in the middle and large smooth chairs and on the table many manuscripts impregnated with purple dust and around were books in shelves This room had been locked upon a single man a tall man in a frock coat with a pointed grey beard who at the last moment had decided to fly from it for he lay at the threshold apparently fallen dead the moment he opened the door Him by drawing his feet aside I removed locked the door upon myself sat at the table before the dusty file and with the little lamp near began to search I searched and read till far into the morning But God knows He alone I had not properly filled the little reservoir with oil and at about three in the fore day it began to burn sullenly lower letting sparks and turning the glass grey and in my deepest chilly heart was the question Suppose the lamp goes out before the daylight I knew the Pole and cold I knew them well but to be frozen by panic my God I read I say I searched I would not stop but I read that night racked by terrors such as have never yet entered into the heart of man to conceive My flesh moved and crawled like a lake which here and there the breeze ruffles Sometimes for two three four minutes the profound interest of what I read would fix my mind and then I would peruse an entire column or two without consciousness of the meaning of one single word my brain all drawn away to the innumerable host of the wan dead that camped about me pierced with horror lest they should start and stand and accuse me for the grave and the worm was the world and in the air a sickening stirring of cerements and shrouds and the taste of the pale and insubstantial grey of ghosts seemed to infect my throat and faint odours of the loathsome tomb my nostrils and the toll of deep toned passing bells my ears finally the lamp smouldered very low and my charnel fancy teemed with the screwing down of coffins lych gates and sextons and the grating of ropes that lower down the dead and the first sound of the earth upon the lid of that strait and gloomy home of the mortal that lethal look of cold dead fingers I seemed to see before me the insipidness of dead tongues the pout of the drowned and the vapid froths that ridge their lips till my flesh was moist as with the stale washing waters of morgues and mortuaries and with such sweats as corpses sweat and the mawkish tear that lies on dead men s cheeks for what is one poor insignificant man in his flesh against a whole world of the disembodied he alone with them and nowhere nowhere another of his kind to whom to appeal against them I read and I searched but God God knows If a leaf of the paper which I slowly warily stealingly turned made but one faintest rustle how did that reveille boom in echoes through the vacant and haunted chambers of my poor aching heart my God and there was a cough in my throat which for a cruelly long time I would not cough till it burst in horrid clamour from my lips sending crinkles of cold through my inmost blood For with the words which I read were all mixed up visions of crawling hearses wails and lugubrious crapes and piercing shrieks of madness in strange earthy vaults and all the mournfulness of the black Vale of Death and the tragedy of corruption Twice during the ghostly hours of that night the absolute and undeniable certainty that some presence some most gashly silent being stood at my right elbow so thrilled me that I leapt to my feet to confront it with clenched fists and hairs that bristled stiff in horror and frenzy After that second time I must have fainted for when it was broad day I found my dropped head over the file of papers supported on my arms And I resolved then never again after sunset to remain in any house for that night was enough to kill a horse my good God and that this is a haunted planet I know What I read in the Times was not very definite for how could it be but in the main it confirmed inferences which I had myself drawn and fairly satisfied my mind There had been a battle royal in the paper between my old collaborator Professor Stanistreet and doctor Martin Rogers and never could I have conceived such an indecorous piece of business men like them calling one another tyro dreamer and in one place block head Stanistreet denied that the perfumed odour of almonds attributed to the advancing cloud could be due to anything but the excited fancy of the reporting fugitives because said he it was unknown that either Cn HCn or K fourFeCn six had been given out by volcanoes and the destructiveness to life of the travelling cloud could only be owing to company and CO two To this Rogers in an article characterised by extraordinary heat replied that he could not understand how even a tyro in chemical and geological phenomena would venture to rush into print with the statement that HCn had not commonly been given out by volcanoes that it had been he said was perfectly certain though whether it had been or not could not affect the decision of a reasoning mind as to whether it was being for that cyanogen as a matter of fact was not rare in nature though not directly occurring being one of the products of the common distillation of pit coal and found in roots peaches almonds and many tropical flora also that it had been actually pointed out as probable by more than one thinker that some salt or salts of Cn the potassic or the potassic ferrocyanide or both must exist in considerable stores in the earth at volcanic depths In reply to this Stanistreet in a two column article used the word dreamer and Rogers when Berlin had been already silenced finally replied with his amazing block head But in my opinion by far the most learned and lucid of the scientific dicta was from the rather unexpected source of Sloggett of the Dublin Science and Art Department he without fuss accepted the statements of the fugitive eye witnesses down to the assertion that the cloud as it rolled travelling seemed mixed from its base to the clouds with languid tongues of purple flame rose coloured at their edges This Sloggett explained was the characteristic flame of both cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid vapour which being inflammable may have become locally ignited in the passage over cities and only burned in that limited and languid way on account of the ponderous volumes of carbonic anhydride with which they must of course be mixed the dark empurpled colour was due to the presence of large quantities of the scoriae of the trappean rocks basalts green stone trachytes and the various porphyries This article was most remarkable for its clear divination because written so early not long in fact after the cessation of telegraphic communication with Australia and China and at a date so early Sloggett stated that the character of the devastation not only proved an eruption another but far greater Krakatoa probably in some South Sea region but indicated that its most active product must be not company but potassic ferrocyanide K fourFeCn six which undergoing distillation with the products of sulphur in the heat of eruption produced hydrocyanic acid HCn and this volatile acid he said remaining in a vaporous state in all climates above a temperature of twenty six point five deg C might involve the entire earth if the eruption proved sufficiently powerful travelling chiefly in a direction contrary to the earth s west to east motion the only regions which would certainly be exempt being the colder regions of the Arctic circles where the vapour of the acid would assume the liquid state and fall as rain He did not anticipate that vegetation would be permanently affected unless the eruption were of inconceivable duration and activity for though the poisonous quality of hydrocyanic acid consisted in its sudden and complete arrest of oxidation vegetation had two sources of life the soil as well as the air with this exception all life down to the lowest evolutionary forms would disappear here was the one point in which he was somewhat at fault until the earth reproduced them For the rest he fixed the rate of the on coming cloud at from one hundred to one hundred five miles a day and the date of eruption either the fourteenth fifteenth or sixteenth of April which was either one two or three days after the arrival of the Boreal party at the Pole and he concluded by saying that if the facts were as he had stated them then he could suggest no hiding place for the race of man unless such places as mines and tunnels could be made air tight nor could even they be of use to any considerable number except in the event of the poisonous state of the air being of very short duration I had thought of mines before but in a very languid way till this article and other things that I read as it were struck my brain a slap with the notion For there I said if anywhere shall I find a man I went out from that building that morning feeling like a man bowed down with age for the depths of unutterable horror into which I had had glimpses during that one night made me very feeble and my steps tottered and my brain reeled I got out into Farringdon Street and at the near Circus where four streets meet had under my furthest range of vision nothing but four fields of bodies bodies clad in a rag shop of every faded colour or half clad or not clad at all actually in many cases over lying one another as I had seen at Reading but here with a markedly more skeleton appearance for I saw the swollen looking shoulders sharp hips hollow abdomens and stiff bony limbs of people dead from famine the whole having the grotesque air of some macabre battle field of fallen marionettes Mixed with these was an extraordinary number of vehicles of all sorts so that I saw that driving among them would be impracticable whereas the street which I had taken during the night was fairly clear I thought a minute what I should do then went by a parallel back street and came out to a shop in the Strand where I hoped to find all the information which I needed about the excavations of the country The shutters were up and I did not wish to make any noise among these people though the morning was bright it being about ten o clock and it was easy to effect entrance for I saw a crow bar in a big covered furniture van near I therefore went northward till I came to the British Museum the cataloguing system of which I knew well and passed in There was no one at the library door to bid me stop and in the great round reading room not a soul except one old man with a bag of goitre hung at his neck and spectacles he lying up a book ladder near the shelves a reader to the last I got to the printed catalogues and for an hour was upstairs among the dim sacred galleries of this still place and at the sight of certain Greek and Coptic papyri charters seals had such a dream of this ancient earth my good God as even an angel s pen could not half express on paper Afterwards I went away loaded with a good hundred weight of Ordnance maps which I had stuffed into a bag found in the cloak room with three topographical books I then at an instrument maker s in Holborn got a sextant and theodolite and at a grocer s near the river put into a sack bag provisions to last me a week or two at Blackfriars Bridge wharf station I found a little sharp white steamer of a few tons which happily was driven by liquid air so that I had no troublesome fire to light and by noon I was cutting my solitary way up the Thames which flowed as before the ancient Britons were born and saw it and built mud huts there amid the primaeval forest and afterwards the Romans came and saw it and called it Tamesis or Thamesis That night as I lay asleep on the cabin cushions of my little boat under the lee of an island at Richmond I had a clear dream in which something or someone came to me and asked me a question for it said Why do you go seeking another man that you may fall upon him and kiss him or that you may fall upon him and murder him And I answered sullenly in my dream I would not murder him I do not wish to murder anyone What was essential to me was to know with certainty whether I was really alone for some instinct began to whisper me Find that out be sure be sure for without the assurance you can never be yourself I passed into the great Midland Canal and went northward leisurely advancing for I was in no hurry The weather remained very warm and great part of the country was still dressed in autumn leaves I have written I think of the terrific character of the tempests witnessed in England since my return well the calms were just as intense and novel This observation was forced upon me and I could not but be surprised There seemed no middle course now if there was a wind it was a storm if there was not a storm no leaf stirred not a roughening zephyr ran the water I was reminded of maniacs that laugh now and rave now but never smile and never sigh On the fourth afternoon I passed by Leicester and the next morning left my pleasant boat carrying maps and compass and at a small station took engine bound for Yorkshire where I loitered and idled away two foolish months sometimes travelling by steam engine sometimes by automobile sometimes by bicycle and sometimes on foot till the autumn was quite over There were two houses in London to which especially I had thought to go one in Harley Street and one in Hanover Square but when it came to the point I would not and there was a little embowered home in Yorkshire where I was born to which I thought to go but I would not confining myself for many days to the eastern half of the county One morning while passing on foot along the coast wall from Bridlington to Flambro on turning my eyes from the sea I was confronted by a thing which for a moment or two struck me with the most profound astonishment I had come to a mansion surrounded by trees three hundred yards from the cliffs and there on a path at the bottom of the domain right before me was a board marked Trespassers will be Prosecuted At once a mad desire the first which I had had to laugh to roar with laughter to send wild echoes of merriment clapping among the chalk gullies and abroad on the morning air seized upon me but I kept it under though I could not help smiling at this poor man with his little delusion that a part of the earth was his Here the cliffs are I should say seventy feet high broken by frequent slips in the upper stratum of clay and as I proceeded climbing always I encountered some rather formidable gullies in the chalk down and then up which I had to scramble till I came to a great mound or barrier stretching right across the great promontory and backed by a natural ravine this no doubt having been raised as a rampart by some of those old invading pirate peoples who had their hot life scuffle and are done now like the rest Going on I came to a bay in the cliff with a great number of boats lodged on the slopes some quite high though the declivities are steep toward the inner slopes is a lime kiln which I explored but found no one there When I came out on the other side I saw the village with an old tower at one end on a bare stretch of land and thence after an hour s rest in the kitchen of a little inn went out to the coast guard station and the lighthouse Looking across the sea eastward the light keepers here must have seen that thick cloud of convolving browns and purples perhaps mixed with small tongues of fire slowly walking the water its roof in the clouds upon them for this headland is in precisely the same longitude as London and reckoning from the hour when as recorded in the Times the cloud was seen from Dover over Calais London and Flambro must have been overtaken soon after three o clock on the Sunday afternoon the twenty fifth July At sight in open daylight of a doom so gloomy prophesied but perhaps hoped against to the last and now come the light keepers must have fled howling supposing them to have so long remained faithful to duty for here was no one and in the village very few In this lighthouse which is a circular white tower eighty feet high on the edge of the cliff is a book for visitors to sign their names and I will write something down here in black and white for the secret is between God only and me After reading a few of the names I took my pencil and I wrote my name there The reef before the Head stretches out a quarter of a mile looking bold in the dead low water that then was and showing to what extent the sea has pushed back this coast three wrecks impaled on them and a big steamer quite near waiting for the first movements of the already strewn sea to perish All along the cliff wall to the bluff crowned by Scarborough Castle northward and to the low vanishing coast of Holderness southward appeared those cracks and caves which had brought me here though there seemed no attempts at barricades however I got down a rough slope on the south side to a rude wild beach strewn with wave worn masses of chalk and never did I feel so paltry and short a thing as there with far outstretched bays of crags about me their bluffs encrusted at the base with stale old leprosies of shells and barnacles and crass algae beards and higher up the white cliff all stained and weather spoiled the rock in some parts looking quite chalky and elsewhere gleaming hard and dull like dirty marbles while in the huge withdrawals of the coast yawn darksome gullies and caverns Here in that morning s walk I saw three little hermit crabs a limpet and two ninnycocks in a pool of weeds under a bearded rock What astonished me here and indeed above and everywhere in London even and other towns was the incredible number of birds that strewed the ground at some points resembling a real rain birds of nearly every sort including tropic specimens so that I had to conclude that they too had fled before the cloud from country to country till conquered by weariness and grief and then by death By climbing over rocks thick with periwinkles and splashing through great sloppy stretches of crinkled sea weed which give a raw stench of brine I entered the first of the gullies a narrow long winding one with sides polished by the sea wash and the floor rising inwards In the dark interior I struck matches able still to hear from outside the ponderous spasmodic rush and jostle of the sea between the crags of the reef but now quite faintly Here I knew I could meet only dead men but urged by some curiosity I searched to the end wading in the middle through a three feet depth of sea weed twine but there was no one and only belemnites and fossils in the chalk I searched several to the south of the headland and then went northward past it toward another opening and place of perched boats called in the map North Landing where even now a distinct smell of fish left by the old crabbers and herring fishers was perceptible A number of coves and bays opened as I proceeded a faded green turf comes down in curves at some parts on the cliff brows like wings of a young soldier s hair parted in the middle and plastered on his brow isolated chalk masses are numerous obelisks top heavy columns bastions at one point no less than eight headlands stretched to the end of the world before me each pierced by its arch Norman or Gothic in whole or in half and here again caves in one of which I found a carpet bag stuffed with a wet pulp like bread and stuck to the rock a Turkish tarboosh also under a limestone quarry five dead asses but no man The east coast had evidently been shunned Finally in the afternoon I reached Filey very tired and there slept I went onward by train engine all along the coast to a region of iron ore alum and jet excavations round Whitby and Middlesborough By by ways near the small place of Goldsborough I got down to the shore at Kettleness and reached the middle of a bay in which is a cave called the Hob Hole with excavations all around none of great depth made by jet diggers and quarrymen In the cave lay a small herd of cattle though for what purpose put there I cannot guess and in the jet excavations I found nothing A little further south is the chief alum region as at Sandsend but as soon as I saw a works and the great gap in the ground like a crater where the lias is quarried containing only heaps of alum shale brushwood stacks and piles of cement nodules extracted from the lias I concluded that here could have been found no hiding nor did I purposely visit the others though I saw two later From round Whitby and those rough moors I went on to Darlington not far now from my home but I would not continue that way and after two days indecisive lounging started for Richmond and the lead mines about Arkengarth Dale near Reeth Here begins a region of mountain various with glens fells screes scars swards becks passes villages river heads and dales Some of the faces which I saw in it almost seemed to speak to me in a broad dialect which I knew But they were not numerous in proportion for all this country side must have had its population multiplied by at least some hundreds and the villages had rather the air of Danube Levant or Spanish villages In one named Marrick I saw that the street had become the scene either of a great battle or a great massacre and soon I was everywhere coming upon men and women English and foreign dead from violence cracked heads wounds unhung jaws broken limbs and so on Instead of going direct to the mines from Reeth that waywardness which now rules my mind as squalls an abandoned boat took me somewhat further south west to the village of Thwaite which I actually could not enter so occupied with dead was every spot on which the eye rested a hundred yards about it Not far from here I turned up on foot now a very steep stony road to the right which leads over the Buttertubs Pass into Wensleydale the day being very warm and bright with large clouds that looked like lakes of molten silver giving off grey fumes in their centre casting moody shadows over the swardy dale which below Thwaite expands showing Muker two miles off the largest village of Upper Swaledale Soon climbing I could look down upon miles of Swaledale and the hills beyond a rustic panorama of glens and grass river and cloudshadow and there was something of lightness in my step that fair day for I had left all my maps and things except one at Reeth to which I meant to return and the earth which is very good was mine The ascent was rough and also long but if I paused and looked behind I saw I saw Man s notion of a Heaven a Paradise reserved for the spirits of the good clearly arose from impressions which the earth made upon his mind for no Paradise can be fairer than this just as his notion of a Hell arose from the squalid mess into which his own foolish habits of thought and action turned this Paradise At least so it struck me then and thinking it there was a hiss in my breath as I went up into what more and more acquired the character of a mountain pass with points of almost Alpine savagery for after I had skirted the edge of a deep glen on the left the slopes changed in character heather was on the mountain sides a fretting beck sent up its noise then screes and scars and a considerable waterfall and a landscape of crags and lastly a broad and rather desolate summit palpably nearer the clouds Two days later I was at the mines and here I first saw that wide spread scene of horror with which I have since become familiar The story of six out of ten of them all is the same and short selfish owners an ousted world an easy bombardment and the destruction of all concerned before the arrival of the cloud in many cases About some of the Durham pit mouths I have been given the impression that the human race lay collected there and that the notion of hiding himself in a mine must have occurred to every man alive and sent him thither In these lead mines as in most vein mining there are more shafts than in collieries and hardly any attempt at artificial ventilation except at rises winzes and cul de sacs I found accordingly that though their depth does not exceed three hundred feet suffocation must often have anticipated the other dreaded death In nearly every shaft both up take and down take was a ladder either of the mine or of the fugitives and I was able to descend without difficulty having dressed myself in a house at the village in a check flannel shirt a pair of two buttoned trousers with circles of leather at the knees thick boots and a miner s hat having a leather socket attached to it into which fitted a straight handle from a cylindrical candlestick with this light and also a Davy lamp which I carried about with me for a good many months I lived for the most part in the deeps of the earth searching for the treasure of a life to find everywhere in English duckies and guggs Pomeranian women in gaudy stiff cloaks the Walachian the Mameluk the Khirgiz the Bonze the Imaum and almost every type of man One most brilliant Autumn day I walked by the village market cross at Barnard come at last but with a tenderness in my heart and a reluctance to where I was born for I said I would go and see my sister Ada and the other old one I leaned and loitered a long time on the bridge gazing up to the craggy height which is heavy with waving wood and crowned by the Castle tower the Tees sweeping round the mountain base smooth here and sunlit but a mile down where I wished to go but would not brawling bedraggled and lacerated like a sweet strumpet all shallow among rocks under reaches of shadow the shadow of Rokeby Woods I climbed very leisurely up the hill side having in my hand a bag with a meal and up the stair in the wall to the top I went where there is no parapet but a massiveness of wall that precludes danger and here in my miner s attire I sat three hours brooding sleepily upon the scene of lush umbrageous old wood that marks the long way the river takes from Marwood Chase up above and where the rapid Balder bickers in down to bowery Rokeby touched now with autumn the thickness of trees lessening away toward the uplands where there are far etherealized stretches of fields within hedgerows and in the sunny mirage of the farthest azure remoteness hints of lonesome moorland It was not till near three that I went down along the river then near Rokeby traversing the old meadow and ascending the old hill and there as of old was the little black square with yellow letters on the gate wall HUNT HILL HOUSE No part no house I believe of this country side was empty of strange corpses and they were in Hunt Hill too I saw three in the weedy plot to the right of the garden path where once the hawthorn and lilac tree had grown from well rollered grass and in the little bush wilderness to the left which was always a wilderness one more and in the breakfast room to the right of the hall three and in the new wooden clinker built attachment opening upon the breakfast room two half under the billiard table and in her room overlooking the porch on the first floor the long thin form of my mother on her bed with crushed in left temple and at the foot of the bed face downward on the floor black haired Ada in a night dress Of all the men and women who died they two alone had burying For I digged a hole with the stable spade under the front lilac and I wound them in the sheets foot and form and head and not without throes and qualms I bore and buried them there Some time passed after this before the long multitudinous and perplexing task of visiting the mine regions again claimed me I found myself at a place called Ingleborough which is a big table mountain with a top of fifteen to twenty acres from which the sea is visible across Lancashire to the west and in the sides of this strange hill are a number of caves which I searched during three days sleeping in a garden shed at a very rural and flower embowered village for every room in it was thronged a place marked Clapham in the chart in Clapdale which latter is a dale penetrating the slopes of the mountain and there I found by far the greatest of the caves which I saw having ascended a path from the village to a hollow between two grass slopes where there is a beck and so entering an arch to the left screened by trees into the limestone cliff The passage narrows pretty rapidly inwards and I had not proceeded two yards before I saw the clear traces of a great battle here All this region had in fact been invaded for the cave must have been famous though I did not remember it myself and for some miles round the dead were pretty frequent making the immediate approach to the cave a matter for care if the foot was to be saved from pollution It is clear that there had been an iron gate across the entrance that within this a wall had been built across shutting in I do not know how many perhaps one or two perhaps hundreds and both gate and wall had been stormed and broken down for there still were the sledges and rocks which without doubt had done it I had a lamp and at my forehead the lighted candle and I went on quickly seeing it useless now to choose my steps where there was no choice through a passage incrusted roof and sides with a scabrous petrified lichen the roof low for some ninety yards covered with down looking cones like an inverted forest of children s toy trees I then came to a round hole apparently artificial opening through a curtain of stalagmitic formation into a great cavern beyond which was quite animated and festal with flashes sparkles and diamond lustres hung in their myriads upon a movement of the eye these being produced by large numbers of snowy wet stalagmites very large and high down the centre of which ran a continuous long lane of clothes and hats and faces with hasty reluctant feet I somehow passed over them the cave all the time widening thousands of stalactites appearing on the roof of every size from virgin s breast to giant s club and now everywhere the wet drip drip as it were a populous busy bazaar of perspiring brows and hurrying feet in which the only business is to drip Where stalactite meets stalagmite there are pillars where stalactite meets stalactite in fissures long or short there are elegances flimsy draperies delicate fantasies there were also pools of water in which hung heads and feet and there were vacant spots at outlying spaces where the arched roof which continually heightened itself was reflected in the chill gleam of the floor Suddenly the roof came down the floor went up and they seemed to meet before me but looking I found a low opening through which drawing myself on the belly over slime for some yards in repulsive proximity to dead personalities I came out upon a floor of sand and pebbles under a long dry tunnel arched and narrow grim and dull without stalactites suggestive of monks and catacomb vaults and the route to the grave and here the dead were much fewer proving either that the general mob had not had time to penetrate so far inward or else that those within if they were numerous had gone out to defend or to harken to the storm of their citadel This passage led me into an open space the grandest of all loftily vaulted full of genie riches and buried treasures of light the million fold ensemble of lustres dancing schottishe with the eye as it moved or was still this place I should guess being quite half a mile from the entrance My prying lantern showed me here only nineteen dead men of various nations and at the far end two holes in the floor large enough to admit the body through which from below came up a sound of falling water Both of these holes I could see had been filled with cement concrete wisely I fancy for a current of air from somewhere seemed to be now passing through them and this would have resulted in the death of the hiders Both however of the fillings had been broken through one partially the other wholly by the ignorant I presume who thought to hide in a secret place yet beyond where they may have believed on seeing the artificial work that others were I had my ear a long time at one of these openings listening to that mysterious chant down below in a darkness most murky and dismal and afterwards spurred by the stubborn will which I had to be thorough I went back took a number of outer robes from the bodies tied them well together then one end round the nearest pillar and having put my mouth to the hole calling Anyone Anyone let myself down by the rope of garments the candle at my head I had not however descended far into those mournful shades when my right foot plunged into water and instantly the feeling of terror pierced me that all the evil things in the universe were at my leg to drag me down to Hell and I was up quicker than I went down nor did my flight cease till with a sigh of deliverance I found myself in open air After this seeing that the autumn warmth was passing away I set myself with more system to my task and within the next six months worked with steadfast will and strenuous assiduity seeking not indeed for a man in a mine but for some evidence of the possibility that a man might be alive visiting in that time Northumberland and Durham Fife and Kinross South Wales and Monmouthshire Cornwall and the Midlands the lead mines of Derbyshire of Allandale and other parts of Northumberland of Alston Moor and other parts of Cumberland of Arkendale and other parts of Yorkshire of the western part of Durham of Salop of Cornwall of the Mendip Hills of Somersetshire of Flint Cardigan and Montgomery of Lanark and Argyll of the Isle of Man of Waterford and Down I have gone down the three hundred sixty fort Grand Pipe iron ladder of the abandoned graphite mine at Barrowdale in Cumberland half way up a mountain two thousand feet high and visited where cobalt and manganese ore is mined in pockets at the Foel Hiraeddog mine near Rhyl in Flintshire and the lead and copper Newton Stewart workings in Galloway the Bristol coal fields and mines of South Staffordshire where as in Somerset Gloucester and Shropshire the veins are thin and the mining system is the long wall whereas in the North and Wales the system is the pillar and stall I have visited the open workings for iron ores of Northamptonshire and the underground stone quarries and the underground slate quarries with their alternate pillars and chambers in the Festiniog district of North Wales also the rock salt workings the tin copper and cobalt workings of Cornwall and where the minerals were brought to the surface on the backs of men and where they were brought by adit levels provided with rail roads and where as in old Cornish mines there are two ladders in the shaft moved up and down alternately see saw and by skipping from one to the other at right moments you ascended or descended and where the drawing up is by a gin or horse whinn with vertical drum the Tisbury and Chilmark quarries in Wiltshire the Spinkwell and Cliffwood quarries in Yorkshire and every tunnel and every recorded hole for something urged within me saying You must be sure first or you can never be yourself At the Farnbrook Coal field in the Red Colt Pit my inexperience nearly ended my life for though I had a minute theoretical knowledge of all British workings I was in my practical relation to them like a man who has learnt seamanship on shore At this place the dead were accumulated I think beyond precedent the dark plain around for at least three miles being as strewn as a reaped field with stacks and near the bank much more strewn than stack fields filling the only house within sight of the pit mouth the small place provided for the company s officials and even lying over the great mountain heap of wark composed of the shale and debris of the working Here I arrived on the morning of the fifteenth December to find that unlike the others there was here no rope ladder or other contrivance fixed by the fugitives in the ventilating shaft which usually is not very deep being also the pumping shaft containing a plug rod at one end of the beam engine which works the pumps but looking down the shaft I discerned a vague mass of clothes and afterwards a thing that could only be a rope ladder which a batch of the fugitives by hanging to it their united weight must have dragged down upon themselves to prevent the descent of yet others My only way of going down therefore was by the pit mouth and as this was an important place after some hesitation I decided very rashly First I provided for my coming up again by getting a great coil of half inch rope which I found in the bailiff s office probably one hundred thirty fathoms long rope at most mines being so plentiful that it almost seemed as if each fugitive had provided himself in that way This length of rope I threw over the beam of the beam engine in the bite where it sustains the rod and paid one end down the shaft till both were at the bottom in this way I could come up by tying one rope end to the rope ladder hoisting it fastening the other end below and climbing the ladder and I then set to work to light the pit mouth engine fire to effect my descent This done I started the engine and brought up the cage from the bottom the three hundred yards of wire rope winding with a quaint deliberateness round the drum reminding me of a camel s nonchalant leisurely obedience When I saw the four meeting chains of the cage roof emerge the pointed roof and two sided frame I stopped the ascent and next attached to the knock off gear a long piece of twine which I had provided carried the other end to the cage in which I had five companions lit my hat candle which was my test for choke damp and the Davy and without the least reflection pulled the string That hole was nine hundred feet deep First the cage gave a little up leap and then began to descend quite normally I thought though the candle at once went out nor had I the least fear a strong current of air indeed blew up the shaft but that happens in shafts This current however soon became too vehemently boisterous for anything I saw the lamp light struggle the dead cheeks quiver I heard the cage shoes go singing down the wire rope guides and quicker we went and quicker that facile descent of Avernus slipping lightly then raging with sparks at the shoes and guides and a hurricane in my ears and eyes and mouth When we bumped upon the dogs at the bottom I was tossed a foot upwards with the stern faced others and then lay among them in the eight foot space without consciousness It was only when I sat an hour later disgustedly reflecting on this incident that I remembered that there was always some hand working of the engine during the cage descents an engineman reversing the action by a handle at every stroke of the piston to prevent bumping However the only permanent injury was to the lamp and I found many others inside I got out into the coal hole a large black hall seventy feet square by fifteen high the floor paved with iron sheets there were some little holes round the wall dug for some purpose which I never could discover some waggons full of coal and shale standing about and all among the waggons and on them and under them bodies clothes I got a new lamp pouring in my own oil and went down a long steep ducky road very rough with numerous rollers over which ran a rope to the pit mouth for drawing up the waggons and in the sides here at regular intervals man holes within which to rescue one s self from down tearing waggons and within these man holes here and there a dead and in others every sort of food and at one place on the right a high dead heap and the air here hot at sixty four or sixty five degrees and getting hotter with the descent The ducky led me down into a standing a space with a turn table of unusual size which I made my base of operations for exploring Here was a very considerable number of punt shaped putts on carriages and also waggons such as took the new mined coal from putt to pit mouth and raying out from this open standing several avenues some ascending as guggs some descending as dipples and the dead here all arranged in groups the heads of this group pointing up this gugg of that group toward that twin way of that other down that dipple and the central space where weighing was done almost empty and the darksome silence of this deep place with all these multitudes I found extremely gravitating and hypnotic drawing me too into their great Passion of Silence in which they lay all all so fixed and veteran and at one time I fell a staring nearer perhaps to death and the empty Gulf than I knew but I said I would be strong and not sink into their habit of stillness but let them keep to their own way and follow their own fashion and I would keep to my own way and follow my own fashion nor yield to them though I was but one against many and I roused myself with a shudder and setting to work caught hold of the drum chain of a long gugg and planting my feet in the chogg holes in which rested the wheels of the putt carriages that used to come roaring down the gugg I got up stooping under a roof only three feet high till I came near the end of the ascent upon the scene of another battle for in this gugg about fifteen of the mine hands had clubbed to wall themselves in and had done it and I saw them lie there all by themselves through the broken cement with their bare feet trousers naked bodies all black visage all fierce and wild the grime still streaked with sweat furrows the candle in their rimless hats and outside their own getting mattocks and boring irons to besiege them From the bottom of this gugg I went along a very undulating twin way into which every thirty yards or so opened one of those steep putt ways which they called topples the twin ways having plates of about two one two fort gauge for the putts from the headings or workings above to come down upon full of coal and shale and all about here in twin way and topples were ends and corners and not one had been left without its walling in and only one was then intact some I fancied having been broken open by their own builders at the spur of suffocation or hunger and the one intact I broke into with a mattock it was only a thin cake of plaster but air tight and in a space not seven feet long behind it I found the very ill smelling corpse of a carting boy with guss and tugger at his feet and the pad which protected his head in pushing the putts and a great heap of loaves sardines and bottled beer against the walls and five or six mice that suddenly pitched screaming through the opening which I made greatly startling me there being of dead mice an extraordinary number in all this mine region I went back to the standing and at one point in the ground where there was a windlass and chain lowered myself down a cut a small pit sunk perpendicularly to a lower coal stratum and here almost thinking I could hear the perpetual rat tat of notice once exchanged between the putt boys below and the windlass boys above I proceeded down a dipple to another place like a standing for in this mine there were six or perhaps seven veins and there immediately I came upon the acme of the horrible drama of this Tartarus for all here was not merely crowded but at some points a packed congestion of flesh giving out a strong smell of the peach curiously mixed with the stale coal odour of the pit for here ventilation must have been very limited and a large number of these masses had been shot down by only three hands as I found for through three hermetical holes in a plaster wall built across a large gugg projected a little the muzzles of three rifles which must have glutted themselves with slaughter and when after a horror of disgust having swum as it were through a dead sea I got to the wall I peeped from a small clear space before it through a hole and made out a man two youths in their teens two women three girls and piles of cartridges and provisions the hole had no doubt been broken from within at the spur of suffocation when the poison must have entered and I conjectured that here must be the mine owner director manager or something of that sort with his family In another dipple region when I had re ascended to a higher level I nearly fainted before I could retire from the commencement of a region of after damp where there had been an explosion the bodies lying all hairless devastated and grotesque But I did not desist from searching every other quarter no momentary work for not till near six did I go up by the pumping shaft rope ladder 
6735-96163-0000	train-other-500	One day standing in that wild region of bare rock and sea called Cornwall Point whence one can see the crags and postillion wild rocks where Land s End dashes out into the sea and all the wild blue sea between
6735-96163-0001	train-other-500	and not a house in sight save the chimney of some little mill like place peeping between the rocks inland on that day I finished what I may call my official search In going away from that place walking northward
6735-96163-0002	train-other-500	I came upon a lonely house by the sea a very beautiful house made it was clear by an artist of the bungalow type with an exquisitely sea side expression
none	none	 I went to it and found its special feature a spacious loggia 
6735-96163-0003	train-other-500	or verandah sheltered by the overhanging upper story Up to the first floor the exterior is of stone in rough hewn blocks with a distinct batter while extra protection from weather is afforded by green slating above
6735-96163-0004	train-other-500	The roofs of low pitch are also covered with green slates and a feeling of strength and repose is heightened by the very long horizontal lines At one end of the loggia is a hexagonal turret
6735-96163-0005	train-other-500	opening upon the loggia containing a study or nook In front the garden slopes down to the sea surrounded by an architectural sea wall and in this place I lived three weeks It was the house of the poet Machen
6735-96163-0006	train-other-500	whose name when I saw it I remembered very well and he had married a very beautiful young girl of eighteen obviously Spanish who lay on the bed in the large bright bedroom to the right of the loggia
6735-96163-0007	train-other-500	on her left exposed breast being a baby with an india rubber comforter in its mouth both mother and child wonderfully preserved she still quite lovely white brow under low curves of black hair
6735-96163-0008	train-other-500	The poet strange to say had not died with them but sat in the sitting room behind the bedroom in a long loose silky grey jacket at his desk actually writing a poem writing I could see furiously fast
none	none	 the place all littered with the written leaves 
6735-96163-0009	train-other-500	at three o clock in the morning when as I knew the cloud overtook this end of Cornwall and stopped him and put his head to rest on the desk and the poor little wife must have got sleepy waiting for it to come perhaps sleepless for many long nights before
6735-96163-0010	train-other-500	and gone to bed he perhaps promising to follow in a minute to die with her but bent upon finishing that poem and writing feverishly on running a race with the cloud thinking no doubt just two couplets more
6735-96163-0011	train-other-500	till the thing came and put his head to rest on the desk poor carle and I do not know that I ever encountered aught so complimentary to my race as this dead poet Machen and his race with the cloud
6735-96163-0012	train-other-500	for it is clear now that the better kind of those poet men did not write to please the vague inferior tribes who might read them but to deliver themselves of the divine warmth that thronged in their bosom
6735-96163-0013	train-other-500	and if all the readers were dead still they would have written and for God to read they wrote At any rate I was so pleased with these poor people that I stayed with them three weeks sleeping under blankets on a couch in the drawing room
6735-96163-0014	train-other-500	a place full of lovely pictures and faded flowers like all the house for I would not touch the young mother to remove her And finding on Machen s desk a big note book with soft covers
6735-96163-0015	train-other-500	dappled red and yellow not yet written in I took it and a pencil and in the little turret nook wrote day after day for hours this account of what has happened nearly as far as it has now gone
6735-96163-0016	train-other-500	And I think that I may continue to write it for I find in it a strange consolation and companionship In the Severn Valley somewhere in the plain between Gloucester and Cheltenham in a rather lonely spot
6735-96163-0017	train-other-500	I at that time travelling on a tricycle motor I spied a curious erection and went to it I found it of considerable size perhaps fifty feet square and thirty high made of pressed bricks
6735-96163-0018	train-other-500	the perfectly flat roof too of brick and not one window and only one door this door which I found open was rimmed all round its slanting rims with india rubber and when closed must have been perfectly air tight
6735-96163-0019	train-other-500	Just inside I came upon fifteen English people of the dressed class except two who were evidently bricklayers six ladies and nine men and at the further end two more men
6735-96163-0020	train-other-500	who had their throats cut along one wall from end to end were provisions and I saw a chest full of mixed potassic chlorate and black oxide of manganese with an apparatus for heating it and producing oxygen
6735-96163-0021	train-other-500	a foolish thing for additional oxygen could not alter the quantity of breathed carbonic anhydride which is a direct narcotic poison Whether the two with cut throats had sacrificed themselves for the others
6735-96163-0022	train-other-500	when breathing difficulties commenced or been killed by the others was not clear When they could bear it no longer they must have finally opened the door hoping that by then after the passage of many days perhaps
6735-96163-0023	train-other-500	the outer air would be harmless and so met their death I believe that this erection must have been run up by their own hands under the direction of the two bricklayers for they could not I suppose have got workmen
6735-96163-0024	train-other-500	except on the condition of the workmen s admission on which condition they would naturally employ as few as possible In general I remarked that the rich must have been more urgent and earnest in seeking escape than the others
6735-96163-0025	train-other-500	for the poor realised only the near and visible lived in to day and cherished the always false notion that to morrow would be just like to day In an out patients waiting room for instance in the Gloucester infirmary
6735-96163-0026	train-other-500	I chanced to see an astonishing thing five bodies of poor old women in shawls come to have their ailments seen to on the day of doom
6735-96163-0027	train-other-500	and these I concluded had been unable to realise that anything would really happen to the daily old earth which they knew and had walked with assurance on for if everybody was to die they must have thought
6735-96163-0028	train-other-500	who would preach in the Cathedral on Sunday evenings so they could not have believed In an adjoining room sat an old doctor at a table the stethoscope tips still clinging in his ears
6735-96163-0029	train-other-500	a woman with bared chest before him and I thought to myself Well this old man too died doing his work In this same infirmary there was one surgical ward
none	none	 for in a listless mood I went over it where the patients had died not of the poison 
6735-96163-0030	train-other-500	nor of suffocation but of hunger
none	none	 for the doctors or someone had made the long room air tight 
6735-96163-0031	train-other-500	double boarding the windows felting the doors and then locking them outside they themselves may have perished before their precautions for the imprisoned patients were complete for I found a heap of maimed shapes
6735-96163-0032	train-other-500	mere skeletons crowded round the door within I knew very well that they had not died of the cloud poison for the pestilence of the ward was unmixed with that odour of peach which did not fail to have more or less embalming effects upon the bodies
6735-96163-0033	train-other-500	which it saturated I rushed stifling from that place and thinking it a pity and a danger that such a horror should be I at once set to work to gather combustibles to burn the building to the ground
6735-96163-0034	train-other-500	It was while I sat in an arm chair in the street the next afternoon smoking and watching the flames of this structure that something was suddenly born in me something from the lowest Hell
6735-96163-0035	train-other-500	and I smiled a smile that never yet man smiled And I said I will burn I will burn I will return to London While I was on this Eastward journey stopping for the night at the town of Swindon
6735-96163-0036	train-other-500	I had a dream for I dreamed that a little brown bald old man with a bent back whose beard ran in one thin streamlet of silver from his chin to trail along the ground said to me
6735-96163-0037	train-other-500	You think that you are alone on the earth its sole Despot well have your fling but as sure as God lives as God lives as God lives he repeated it six times
none	none	 sooner or later later or sooner 
6735-96163-0038	train-other-500	you will meet another And I started from that frightful sleep with the brow of a corpse wet with sweat I returned to London on the twenty ninth of March arriving within a hundred yards of the Northern Station
6735-96163-0039	train-other-500	one windy dark evening about eight where I alighted and walked to Euston Road then eastward along it till I came to a shop which I knew to be a jeweller s though it was too dark to see any painted words The door to my annoyance was locked
6735-96163-0040	train-other-500	like nearly all the shop doors in London I therefore went looking near the ground and into a cart for something heavy very soon saw a labourer s ponderous boots cut one from the shrivelled foot and set to beat at the glass till it came raining
none	none	 then knocked away the bottom splinters and entered 
6735-96163-0041	train-other-500	No horrors now at that clatter of broken glass no sick qualms my pulse steady my head high my step royal my eye cold and calm
6735-96163-0042	train-other-500	Eight months previously I had left London a poor burdened cowering wight I could scream with laughter now at that folly But it did not last long I returned to it the Sultan
6735-96163-0043	train-other-500	No private palace being near I was going to that great hotel in Bloomsbury but though I knew that numbers of candle sticks would be there I was not sure that I should find sufficient
6735-96163-0044	train-other-500	for I had acquired the habit within the past few months of sleeping with at least sixty lighted about me and their form pattern style age and material was of no small importance I selected ten from the broken shop
6735-96163-0045	train-other-500	eight gold and silver and two of old ecclesiastical brass and having made a bundle went out found a bicycle at the Metropolitan Station pumped it tied my bundle to the handle bar and set off riding
6735-96163-0046	train-other-500	But since I was too lazy to walk I should certainly have procured some other means of travelling for I had not gone ten jolted and creaking yards when something went snap it was a front fork and I found myself half on the ground
6735-96163-0047	train-other-500	and half across the bare knees of a Highland soldier I flew with a shower of kicks upon the foolish thing but that booted nothing
none	none	 and this was my last attempt in that way in London the streets being in an unsuitable condition All that dismal night it blew great guns and during nearly three weeks till London was no more there was a storm with hardly a lull that seemed to behowl her destruction I slept in a room on the second floor of a Bloomsbury hotel that night and waking the next day at ten ate with accursed shiverings in the cold banqueting room went out then and under drear low skies walked a long way to the West district accompanied all the time by a sound of flapping flags fluttering robes and rags and grotesquely grim glimpses of decay It was pretty cold and though I was warmly clad the base bizarrerie of the European clothes which I wore had become a perpetual offence and mockery in my eyes at the first moment therefore I set out whither I knew that I should find such clothes as a man might wear to the Turkish Embassy in Bryanston Square I found it open and all the house like most other houses almost carpeted with dead forms I had been acquainted with Redouza Pasha and cast an eye about for him amid that invasion of veiled hanums fierce looking Caucasians in skins of beasts a Sheik ul Islam in green cloak a khalifa three emirs in cashmere turbans two tziganes their gaudy brown mortality more glaringly abominable than even the Western s I could recognise no Redouza here but the stair was fairly clear and I soon came to one of those boudoirs which sweetly recall the deep buried inner seclusion and dim sanctity of the Eastern home a door encrusted with mother of pearl sculptured ceiling candles clustered in tulips and roses of opal a brazen brasero and all in disarray the silken chemise the long winter cafetan doubled with furs costly cabinets sachets of aromas babooshes stuffs of silk When after two hours I went from the house I was bathed anointed combed scented and robed I have said to myself I will ravage and riot in my Kingdoms I will rage like the Caesars and be a withering blight where I pass like Sennacherib and wallow in soft delights like Sardanapalus I will build me a palace vast as a city in which to strut and parade my Monarchy before the Heavens with stones of pure molten gold and rough frontispiece of diamond and cupola of amethyst and pillars of pearl For there were many men to the eye but there was One only really and I was he And always I knew it some faintest secret whisper which whispered me You are the Arch one the motif of the world Adam and the rest of men not much And they are gone all all as no doubt they deserved and I as was meet remain And there are wines and opiums and haschish and there are oils and spices fruits and bivalves and soft breathing Cyclades and scarlet luxurious Orients I will be restless and turbulent in my territories and again I will be languishing and fond I will say to my soul Be Full I watch my mind as in the old days I would watch a new precipitate in a test tube to see into what sediment it would settle I am very averse to trouble of any sort so that the necessity for the simplest manual operations will rouse me to indignation but if a thing will contribute largely to my ever growing voluptuousness I will undergo a considerable amount of labour to accomplish it though without steady effort being liable to side winds and whims and purposeless relaxations In the country I became very irritable at the need which confronted me of occasionally cooking some green vegetable the only item of food which it was necessary to take some trouble over for all meats and many fish some quite delicious I find already prepared in forms which will remain good probably a century after my death should I ever die In Gloucester however I found peas asparagus olives and other greens already prepared to be eaten without base cares and these I now see exist everywhere in stores so vast comparatively to the needs of a single man that they may be called infinite Everything in fact is infinite compared with my needs I take my meals therefore without more trouble than a man who had to carve his joint or chicken though even that little I sometimes find most irksome There remains the detestable degradation of lighting fires for warmth which I have occasionally to do for the fire at the hotel invariably goes out while I sleep But that is an inconvenience of this vile northern island only to which I shall soon bid eternal glad farewells During the afternoon of my second day in London I sought out a strong petrol motor in Holborn overhauled and oiled it a little and set off over Blackfriars Bridge making for Woolwich through that other more putrid London on the south river side One after the other I connected as I came upon them two drays a cab and a private carriage to my motor in line behind having cut away the withered horses and using the reins chain harness c as impromptu couplings And with this novel train I rumbled eastward Half way I happened to look at my old silver chronometer of Boreal days which I have kept carefully wound and how I can be still thrown into these sudden frantic agitations by a nothing a nothing my good God I do not know This time it was only the simple fact that the hands chanced to point to three point ten P M the precise moment at which all the clocks of London had stopped for each town has its thousand weird fore fingers pointing pointing still to the moment of doom In London it was three point ten on a Sunday afternoon I first noticed it going up the river on the face of the Big Ben of the Parliament house and I now find that they all all have this three point ten mania time keepers still but keepers of the end of Time fixedly noting for ever and ever that one moment The cloud mass of fine penetrating scoriae must have instantly stopped their works and they had fallen silent with man But in their insistence upon this particular minute I had found something so hideously solemn yet mock solemn personal and as it were addressed to me that when my own watch dared to point to the same moment I was thrown into one of those sudden paroxysmal panting turmoils of mind half rage half horror which have hardly once visited me since I left the Boreal On the morrow alas another awaited me and again on the second morrow after My train was execrably slow and not until after five did I arrive at the entrance gates of the Woolwich Royal Arsenal and seeing that it was too late to work I uncoupled the motor and leaving the others there turned back but overtaken by lassitude I procured candles stopped at the Greenwich Observatory and in that old dark pile remained for the night listening to a furious storm But a stir by eight the next morning I got back by ten to the Arsenal and proceeded to analyse that vast and multiple entity Many parts of it seemed to have been abandoned in undisciplined haste and in the Cap Factory which I first entered I found tools by which to effect entry into any desired part My first search was for time fuses of good type of which I needed two or three thousand and after a wearily long time found a great number symmetrically arranged in rows in a range of buildings called the Ordnance Store Department I then descended walked back to the wharf brought up my train and began to lower the fuses in bag fulls by ropes through a shoot letting go each rope as the fuses reached the cart However on winding one fuse I found that the mechanism would not go choked with scoriae and I had to resign myself to the task of opening and dusting every one a wretched labour in which I spent that day like a workman But about four I threw them to the devil having done two hundred odd and then hummed back in the motor to London That same evening at six I paid for the first time a visit to my old self in Harley Street It was getting dark and a bleak storm that hooted like whooping cough swept the world At once I saw that even I had been invaded for my door swung open banging a lowered catch preventing it from slamming in the passage the car lamp shewed me a young man who seemed a Jew sitting as if in sleep with dropped head a back tilted silk hat pressed down upon his head to the ears and lying on face or back or side six more one a girl with Arlesienne head dress one a negress one a Deal lifeboat s man and three of uncertain race the first room the waiting room is much more numerously occupied though there still on the table lies the volume of Punch the Gentlewoman and the book of London views in heliograph Behind this descending two steps is the study and consulting room and there as ever the revolving cover oak writing desk but on my little shabby red sofa a large lady much too big for it in shimmering brown silk round her left wrist a trousseau of massive gold trinkets her head dropped right back almost severed by an infernal gash from the throat Here were two old silver candle sticks which I lit and went upstairs in the drawing room sat my old house keeper placidly dead in a rocking chair her left hand pressing down a batch of the open piano keys among many strangers But she was very good she had locked my bedroom against intrusion and as the door stands across a corner behind a green baize curtain it had not been seen or at least not forced I did not know where the key might be but a few thumps with my back drove it open and there lay my bed intact and everything tidy This was a strange coming back to it Adam But what intensely interested me in that room was a big thing standing at the maroon and gold wall between wardrobe and dressing table that gilt frame and that man painted within it there It was myself in oils done by I forget his name now a towering celebrity he was and rather a close friend of mine at one time In a studio in saint John s Wood I remember he did it and many people said that it was quite a great work of art I suppose I was standing before it quite thirty minutes that night holding up the bits of candle lost in wonder in amused contempt at that thing there It is I certainly that I must admit There is the high curving brow really a King s brow after all it strikes me now and that vacillating look about the eyes and mouth which used to make my sister Ada say Adam is weak and luxurious Yes that is wonderfully done the eyes that dear vacillating look of mine for although it is rather a staring look yet one can almost see the dark pupils stir from side to side very well done And there is the longish face and the rather thin stuck out moustache shewing both lips which pout a bit and there is the nearly black hair and there is the rather visible paunch and there is oh good Heaven the neat pink cravat ah it must have been that the cravat that made me burst out into laughter so loud mocking and uncontrollable the moment my eye rested there Adam Jeffson I muttered reproachfully when it was over could that poor thing in the frame have been you I cannot quite state why the tendency toward Orientalism Oriental dress all the manner of an Oriental monarch has taken full possession of me but so it is for surely I am hardly any longer a Western modern mind but a primitive and Eastern one Certainly that cravat in the frame has receded a million million leagues ten thousand forgotten aeons from me Whether this is a result due to my own personality of old acquainted with Eastern notions or whether perhaps it is the natural accident to any mind wholly freed from trammels I do not know But I seem to have gone right back to the very beginnings and resemblance with man in his first simple gaudy conditions My hair as I sit here writing already hangs a black oiled string down my back my scented beard sweeps in two opening whisks to my ribs I have on the izar a pair of drawers of yomani cloth like cotton but with yellow stripes over this a soft shirt or quamis of white silk reaching to my calves over this a short vest of gold embroidered crimson the sudeyree over this a khaftan of green striped silk reaching to the ankles with wide long sleeves divided at the wrist and bound at the waist with a voluminous gaudy shawl of Cashmere for girdle over this a warm wide flowing torrent of white drapery lined with ermine On my head is the skull cap covered by a high crimson cap with deep blue tassel and on my feet is a pair of thin yellow morocco shoes covered over with thick red morocco babooshes My ankles my ten fingers my wrists are heavy with gold and silver ornaments and in my ears which with considerable pain I bored three days since are two needle splinters to prepare the holes for rings O Liberty I am free While I was going to visit my old home in Harley Street that night at the very moment when I turned from Oxford Street into Cavendish Square this thought fiercely hissed into my ears was all of a sudden seething in me If now I should lift my eyes and see a man walking yonder just yonder at the corner there turning from Harewood Place into Oxford Street what my good God should I do I without even a knife to run and plunge into his heart And I turned my eyes ogling suspicious eyes of furtive horror reluctantly lingeringly turned and I peered deeply with lowered brows across the murky winds at that same spot but no man was there Hideously frequent is this nonsense now become with me in streets of towns in deep nooks of the country the invincible assurance that if I but turn the head and glance there at a certain fixed spot I shall surely see I must see a man And glance I must glance I must though I perish and when I glance though my hairs creep and stiffen like stirring amobse yet in my eyes I know is monarch indignation against the intruder and my neck stands stiff as sovereignty itself and on my brow sits more than all the lordship of Persepolis and Iraz To what point of wantonness this arrogance of royalty may lead me I do not know I will watch and see It is written It is not good for man to be alone But good or no the arrangement of One planet One inhabitant already seems to me not merely a natural and proper but the only natural and proper condition so much so that any other arrangement has now to my mind a certain improbable wild and far fetched unreality like the Utopian schemes of dreamers and faddists That the whole world should have been made for me alone that London should have been built only in order that I might enjoy the vast heroic spectacle of its burning that all history and all civilisation should have existed only in order to accumulate for my pleasures its inventions and facilities its stores of purple and wine of spices and gold no more extraordinary does it all seem to me than to some little unreflecting Duke of my former days seemed the possessing of lands which his remote forefathers seized and slew the occupiers nor in reality is it even so extraordinary I being alone But what sometimes strikes me with some surprise is not that the present condition of the world with one sole master should seem the common place and natural condition but that it should have come to seem so common place and natural in nine months The mind of Adam Jeffson is adaptable I sat a long time thinking such things by my bed that night till finally I was disposed to sleep there But I had no considerable number of candle sticks nor was even sure of candles I remembered however that Peter Peters three doors away on the other side of the street had had four handsome silver candelabra in his drawing room each containing six stems and I said to myself I will search for candles in the kitchen and if I find any I will go and get Peter Peters candelabra and sleep here I took then the two lights which I had my good God went down to the passage then down to the basement and there had no difficulty in finding three packets of large candles the fact being I suppose that the cessation of gas lighting had compelled everyone to provide themselves in this way for there were a great many wherever I looked With these I re ascended went into a little alcove on the second floor where I had kept some drugs got a bottle of carbolic oil and for ten minutes went dashing all the corpses in the house I then left the two lighted bits of candle on the waiting room table and with the car lamp passed along the passage to the front door which was very violently banging I stepped out to find that the storm had increased to a mighty turbulence though it was dry which at once caught my clothes and whirled them into a flapping cloud about and above me also I had not crossed the street when my lamp was out I persisted however half blinded to Peters door It was locked but immediately near the pavement was a window the lower sash up into which with little trouble I lifted myself and passed My foot as I lowered it stood on a body and this made me angry and restless I hissed a curse and passed on scraping the carpet with my soles that I might hurt no one for I did not wish to hurt any one Even in the almost darkness of the room I recognised Peters furniture as I expected for the house was his on a long lease and I knew that his mother had had the intention to occupy it after his death But as I passed into the passage all was mere blank darkness and I depending upon the lamp had left the matches in the other house I groped my way to the stairs and had my foot on the first step when I was stopped by a vicious shaking of the front door which someone seemed to be at with hustlings and the most urgent poundings I stood with peering stern brows two or three minutes for I knew that if I once yielded to the flinching at my heart no mercy would be shown me in this house of tragedy and thrilling shrieks would of themselves arise and ring through its haunted chambers The rattling continued an inordinate time and so instant and imperative that it seemed as if it could not fail to force the door But though horrified I whispered to my heart that it could only be the storm which was struggling at it like the grasp of a man and after a time went on feeling my way by the broad rail in my brain somehow the thought of a dream which I had had in the Boreal of the woman Clodagh how she let drop a fluid like pomegranate seeds into water and tendered it to Peter Peters and it was a mortal purging draught but I would not stop but step by step went up though I suffered very much my brows peering at the utter darkness and my heart shocked at its own rashness I got to the first landing and as I turned to ascend the second part of the stair my left hand touched something icily cold I made some quick instinctive movement of terror and doing so my foot struck against something and I stumbled half falling over what seemed a small table there Immediately a horrible row followed for something fell to the ground and at that instant ah I heard something a voice a human voice which uttered words close to my ear the voice of Clodagh for I knew it yet not the voice of Clodagh in the flesh but her voice clogged with clay and worms and full of effort and thick tongued and in that ghastly speech of the grave I distinctly heard the words Things being as they are in the matter of the death of Peter And there it stopped dead leaving me so sick my God so sick that I could hardly snatch my robes about me to fly fly fly soft footed murmuring in pain down the steps down like a sneaking thief but quick snatching myself away then wrestling with the cruel catch of the door which she would not let me open feeling her all the time behind me watching me And when I did get out I was away up the length of the street trailing my long jubbah glancing backward panting for I thought that she might dare to follow with her daring evil will And all that night I lay on a common bench in the wind tossed and dismal Park The first thing which I did when the sun was up was to return to that place and I returned with hard and masterful brow Approaching Peters house I saw now what the darkness had hidden from me that on his balcony was someone quite alone there The balcony is a slight open work wrought iron structure connected to a small roof by three slender voluted pillars two at the ends one in the middle and at the middle one I saw someone a woman kneeling her arms clasped tight about the pillar and her face rather upward looking Never did I see aught more horrid there were the gracious curves of the woman s bust and hips still well preserved in a clinging dress of red cloth very faded now and her reddish hair floated loose in a large flimsy cloud about her but her face in that exposed position had been quite eaten away by the winds to a noseless skeleton which grinned from ear to ear with slightly dropped under jaw most horrid in contrast with the body and frame of hair I meditated upon her a long time that morning from the opposite pavement An oval locket at her throat contained I knew my likeness for eight years previously I had given it her It was Clodagh the poisoner I thought that I would go into that house and walk through it from top to bottom and sit in it and spit in it and stamp in it in spite of any one for the sun was now high I accordingly went in again and up the stairs to the spot where I had been frightened and had heard the words And here a great rage took me for I at once saw that I had been made the dupe of the malign wills that beset me and the laughing stock of Those for whom I care not a fig From a little mahogany table there I had knocked sideways to the ground in my stumble a small phonograph with a great twenty five inch japanned tin horn which the moment that I now noticed it I took and flung with a great racket down the stairs for that this it was which had addressed me I did not doubt it being indeed evident that its clock work mechanism had been stopped by the volcanic scoriae in the midst of the delivery of a record but had been started into a few fresh oscillations by the shock of the fall making it utter those thirteen words and stop I was sufficiently indignant at the moment but have since been glad for I was thereby put upon the notion of collecting a number of cylinders with records and have been touched with indescribable sensations sometimes thrilled at hearing the silence of this Eternity broken by those singing and speaking voices so life like yet most ghostly of the old dead Well the most of that same day I spent in a high chamber at Woolwich dusting out and sometimes oiling time fuses a work in which I acquired such facility in some hours that each finally occupied me no more than ninety to a hundred seconds so that by evening I had with the previous day s work close on six hundred The construction of these little things is very simple and I believe effective so that I should have no difficulty in making them myself in large numbers if it were necessary Most contain a tiny dry battery which sends a current along a bell or copper wire at the running down moment the clocks being contrived to be set for so many days hours and minutes while others ignite by striking I arranged in rows in the covered van those which I had prepared and passed the night in an inn near the Barracks I had brought candle sticks from London in the morning and arranged the furniture a settee chest of drawers basin stand table and a number of chairs in three quarter circle round the bed so getting a triple row altar of lights mixed with vases of the house containing small palms and evergreens with this I mingled a smell of ambergris from the scattered contents of some Turkish sachets which I had in the bed a bottle of sweet Chypre wine with bonbons nuts and Havannas As I lay me down I could not but reflect with a smile which I knew to be evil upon that steady strong smouldering lust within me which was urging me through all those pains at the Arsenal I who shirked every labour as unkingly So however it was and the next morning I was at it again after an early breakfast my fingers at first quite stiff with cold for it blew a keen and January gale By nine I had eight hundred twenty fuses and judging those sufficient to commence with got into the motor and took it round to a place called the East Laboratory a series of detached buildings where I knew that I should find whatever I wanted and I prepared my mind for a day s labour In this place I found incredible stores mountains of percussion caps more chambers of fuses small arm cartridges shells and all those murderous explosive mixtures a making and made with which modern savagery occupied its leisure in exterminating itself or at least savagery civilised in its top story only for civilisation was apparently from the head downwards and never once grew below the neck in all those centuries those people being certainly much more mental than cordial though I doubt if they were genuinely mental either reminding one rather of that composite image of Nebuchadnezzar head of gold breast brazen feet of clay head man like heart cannibal feet bestial like aegipeds and mermaids and puzzling undeveloped births However it is of no importance and perhaps I am not much better than the rest for I too after all am of them At any rate their lyddites melanites cordites dynamites powders jellies oils marls and civilised barbarisms and obiahs came in very well for their own destruction for by two o clock I had so worked that I had on the first cart the phalanx of fuses on the second a goodly number of kegs cartridge cases and cartridge boxes full of powder explosive cottons and gelatines and liquid nitro glycerine and earthy dynamite with some bombs two reels of cordite two pieces of tarred cloth a small iron ladle a shovel and a crow bar the cab came next containing a considerable quantity of loose coal and lastly in the private carriage lay four big cans of common oil And first in the Laboratory I connected a fuse conductor with a huge tun of blasting gelatine and I set the fuse on the ground timed for the midnight of the twelfth day thence and after that I visited the Main Factory the Carriage Department the Ordnance Store Department the Royal Artillery Barracks and the Powder Magazines in the Marshes traversing as it seemed to me miles of building and in some I laid heaps of oil saturated coal with an explosive in suitable spots on the ground floor near wood work and in some an explosive alone and all I timed for ignition at midnight of the twelfth day Hot now and black as ink I proceeded through the town stopping with perfect system at every hundredth door and I laid the faggots of a great burning and timed them all for ignition at midnight of the twelfth day Whatever door I found closed against me I drove at it with a maniac malice Shall I commit the whole dark fact to paper that deep deep secret of the human organism As I wrought I waxed wicked as a demon And with lowered neck and forward curve of the lower spine and the blasphemous strut of tragic play actors I went For here was no harmless burning which I did but the crime of arson and a most fiendish though vague malevolence and the rage to burn and raven and riot was upon me like a dog madness and all the mood of Nero and Nebuchadnezzar and from my mouth proceeded all the obscenities of the slum and of the gutter and I sent up such hisses and giggles of challenge to Heaven that day as never yet has man let out But this way lies a spinning frenzy I have taken a dead girl with wild huggings to my bosom and I have touched the corrupted lip and spat upon her face and tossed her down and crushed her teeth with my heel and jumped and jumped upon her breast like the snake stamping zebra mad mad I was desolated however that first day of the faggot laying even in the midst of my sense of omnipotence by one thing which made me give some kicks to the motor for it was only crawling so that a good part of the way I was stalking by its side and when I came to that hill near the Old Dover Road the whole thing stopped and refused to move the weight of the train being too great for my horse power traction I did not know what to do and stood there in angry impotence a full half hour for the notion of setting up an electric station with or without automatic stoking gear presented so hideous a picture of labour to me that I would not entertain it After a time however I thought that I remembered that there was a comparatively new power station in saint Paneras driven by turbines and at once I uncoupled the motor covered the drays with the tarpaulins and went driving at singing speed choosing the emptier by streets and not caring whom I crushed After some trouble I found in fact the station in an obscure by street made of two long walls and went in by a window a rage upon me to have my will quickly accomplished I ran up some stairs across two rooms into a gallery containing a switch board and in the room below saw the works all very neat looking but as I soon found very dusty I went down and fixed upon a generating set there were three that would give a decent load and then saw that the switch gear belonging to this particular generator was in order I then got some cloths and thoroughly cleaned the dust off the commutators ran next for I was in a strange fierce haste and turned the water into the turbines and away went the engine I hurried to set the lubricators running on the bearings and in a couple of minutes had adjusted the speed and the brushes of the generators and switched the current on to the line By this time however I saw that it was getting dark and feared that little could be done that day still I hurried out the station still running got into the car and was off to look for a good electric one of which there are hosts in the streets in order at least to clean up and adjust the motor that night I drove down three by streets till I turned into Euston Road but I had no sooner reached it than I pulled up with sudden jerk with a shout of astonishment That cursed street was all lighted up and gay and three shimmering electric globes not far apart illuminated every feature of a ghastly battle field of dead And there was a thing there the grinning impression of which I shall carry to my grave a thing which spelled and spelled at me and ceased and began again and ceased and spelled at me For above a shop which faced me was a flag a red flag with white letters fluttering on the gale the words Metcalfe s Stores and beneath the flag stretched right across the house was the thing which spelled letter by letter in letters of light and it spelled two words deliberately coming to the end and going back to recommence Drink ROBORAL And that was the last word of civilised Man to me Adam Jeffson its final counsel its ultimate gospel and message to me my good God Drink Roboral I was put into such a passion of rage by this blatant ribaldry which affected me like the laughter of a skeleton that I rushed from the car with the intention I believe of seeking stones to stone it but no stones were there and I had to stand impotently enduring that rape of my eyes its victoriously dogged iteration its taunting leer its Drink Roboral D R I N K R O B O R A L It was one of those electrical spelling advertisements worked by a small motor commutator driven by a works motor and I had now set it going for on some night before that Sabbath of doom the chemist must have set it to work but finding the works abandoned had not troubled to shut it down again At any rate this thing stopped my work for that day for when I went to shut down the works it was night and I drove to the place which I had made my home in sullen and weary mood for I knew that Roboral would not cure the least of all my sores The next morning I awoke in quite another frame of mind disposed to idle and let things go After rising dressing washing in cold diluted rose water and descending to the salle a manger where I had laid my morning meal the previous evening I promenaded an hour the only one of these long sombrous tufted corridors in which there were not more than two dead though behind the doors on either hand all of which I had locked I knew that they lay in plenty When I was warmed I again went down looked into my motor got three cylinders from one of a number of motors standing near lit up and drove away to Woolwich as I thought at first but instead of crossing the river by Blackfriars I went more eastward and having passed from Holborn into Cheapside which was impassable unless I crawled was about to turn when I noticed a phonograph shop into this I got by a side door suddenly seized by quite a curiosity to hear what I might hear I took a good one with microphone diaphragm and a number of record cylinders in a brass handled box and I put them into the car for there was still a very strong peach odour in this closed shop which displeased me I then proceeded southward and westward through by streets seeking some probable house into which to go from the rough cold winds when I saw the Parliament house and thither turning river ward by Westminster Hall to Palace Yard I went and with my two parcels one weighting each arm walked into this old place along a line of purple dusted busts I deposited my boxes on a table beside a massive brass thing lying there which I suppose must be what they called the Mace and I sat to hear Unfortunately the phonograph was a clock work one and when I wound it it would not go so that I got very angry at my absurdity in not bringing an electric mechanism as I could with much less trouble have put in a chemical than cleaned the clock work and this thing put me into such a rage that I nearly tore it to pieces and was half for kicking it but there was a man sitting in an old straight backed chair quite near me which they called the Speaker s Chair who was in such a pose that he had every time I glanced suddenly at him precisely the air of bending forward with interest to watch what I was doing a Mohrgrabim kind of man almost black with Jewish nose crinkled hair keffie and flowing robe probably I should say an Abyssinian Galla with him were only five or six people about the benches mostly leaning forward with rested head so that this place had quite a void sequestered mood At all events this Galla or Bedouin with his grotesque interest in my doings restrained my hands and finally by dint of peering poking dusting and adjusting in an hour s time I got the phonograph to go very well And all that morning and far into late afternoon forgetful of food and of the cold which gradually possessed me I sat there listening musing cylinder after cylinder frivolous songs orchestras voices of famous men whom I had spoken with and shaken their solid hands speaking again to me but thick tongued with hoarse effort and gurgles from out the vague void beyond the grave most strange most strange And the third cylinder that I put on ah I knew with a fearful start that voice of thunder I knew it well it was the preacher Mackay s and many many times over I heard those words of his that day originally spoken it seems when the cloud had just passed the longitude of Vienna and in all that torrent of speech not one single word of I told you so but he cries praise Him O Earth for He is He and if He slay me I will laugh raillery at His Sword and banter Him to His face for His Sword is sharp Mercy and His poisons kill my death Fear not therefore little flock of Man but take my comfort to your heart to night and my sweets to your tongue for though ye have sinned and hardened yourselves as brass and gone far far astray in these latter wildernesses yet He is infinitely greater than your sin and will lead you back Break not break not poor broken heart of Earth for from Him I run herald to thee this night with the sweet and secret message that of old He chose thee and once mixed conjugally with thee in an ancient sleep O Afflicted and He is thou and thou art He flesh of His flesh and bone of His bone and if thou perish utterly it is that He has perished utterly too for thou art He Hope therefore most and cheeriest smile at the very apsis and black nadir of Despair for He is nimble as a weasel and He twists like Proteus and His solstices and equinoxes His tropics and turning points and recurrences are innate in Being and when He falls He falls like harlequin and shuttlecocks shivering plumb to His feet and each third day lo He is risen again and His defeats are but the stepping stones and rough scaffolding from which He builds His Parthenons and from the densest basalt gush His rills and the last end of this Earth shall be no poison cloud I say to you but Carnival and Harvest home though ye have sinned poor hearts So Mackay with thick tongued metallic effort I found this brown room of the Commons house with its green benches and grilled galleries so agreeable to my mood that I went again the next morning and listened to more records till they tired me for what I had was a prurient itch to hear secret scandals and revelations of the festering heart but these cylinders gathered from a shop divulged nothing I then went out to make for Woolwich but in the car saw the poet s note book in which I had written and I took it went back and was writing an hour till I was tired of that too and judging it too late for Woolwich that day wandered about the dusty committee rooms and recesses of this considerable place In one room another foolishness suddenly seized upon me shewing how my slightest whim has become more imperious within me than all the Jaws of the Medes and Persians for in that room Committee Room No fifteen I found an apparently young policeman lying flat on his back who pleased me his helmet tilted under his head and near one white gloved hand a blue official envelope the air of that stagnant quiet room was still perceptibly peach scented and he gave not the slightest odour that I could detect though he had been corporal and stalwart his face now the colour of dark ashes in each hollow cheek a ragged hole about the size of a sixpence the flimsy vaulted eye lids well embedded in their caverns from under whose fringe of eye lash seemed whispered the word Eternity His hair seemed very long for a policeman or perhaps it had grown since death but what interested me about him was the envelope at his hand for what I asked myself was this fellow doing here with an envelope at three o clock on a Sunday afternoon This made me look closer and then I saw by a mark at the left temple that he had been shot or felled whereupon I was thrown into quite a great rage for I thought that this poor man was killed in the execution of his duty when many of his kind perhaps and many higher than he had fled their post to pray or riot So after looking at him a long time I said to him Well D forty seven you sleep very well and you did well dying so I am pleased with you and to mark my favour I decree that you shall neither rot in the common air nor burn in the common flames for by my own hand shall you be distinguished with burial And this wind so possessed me that I at once went out with the crow bar from the car I broke the window of a near iron monger s in Parliament Street got a spade and went into Westminster Abbey I soon prised up a grave slab of some famous man in the north transept and commenced to shovel but I do not know how by the time I had digged a foot the whole impulse passed from me I left off the work promising to resume it but nothing was ever done for the next day I was at Woolwich and busy enough about other matters During the next nine days I worked with a fever on me and a map of London before me There were places in that city secrets vastnesses horrors In the wine vaults at London Docks was a vat which must certainly have contained between twenty and thirty thousand gallons and with dancing heart I laid a train there the tobacco warehouse must have covered eighty acres and there I laid a fuse In a house near Regent s Park standing in a garden and shut from the street by a high wall I saw a thing and what shapes a great city hid I now first know I left no quarter unremembered taking a train no longer of four but of eight vehicles drawn by an electric motor which I re charged every morning mostly from the turbine station in saint Pancras once from a steam station with very small engine and dynamo found in the Palace Theatre which gave little trouble and once from a similar little station in a Strand hotel With these I visited West Ham and Kew Finchley and Clapham Dalston and Marylebone I exhausted London I deposited piles in the Guildhall in Holloway Gaol in the new pillared Justice hall of Newgate in the Tower in the Parliament house in saint Giles Workhouse in the Crypt and under the organ of saint Paul s in the South Kensington Museum in the Royal Agricultural Society in Whiteley s place in the Trinity House in Liverpool Street in the Office of Works in the secret recesses of the British Museum in a hundred inflammable warehouses in five hundred shops in a thousand private dwellings And I timed them all for ignition at midnight of the twenty third April By five in the afternoon of the twenty second when I left my train in Maida Vale and drove alone to the solitary house on high ground near Hampstead Heath which I had chosen the work was well finished The great morning dawned and I was early a stir for I had much to do that day I intended to make for the sea shore the next morning and had therefore to choose a good petrol motor store it and have it in a place of safety I had also to drag another vehicle after me stored with trunks of time fuses books clothes and other little things My first journey was to Woolwich whence I took all that I might ever require in the way of mechanism thence to the National Gallery where I cut from their frames the Vision of saint Helena Murillo s Boy Drinking and Christ at the Column and thence to the Embassy to bathe anoint myself and dress As I had anticipated and hoped a blustering spring gale was blowing from the north Even as I set out from Hampstead about nine A M I had been able to guess that some of my fuses had somehow anticipated the appointed hour for I saw three red hazes at various points in the air and heard the far vague booming of an occasional explosion and by eleven A M I felt sure that a large region of north eastern London must be in flames With the solemn feelings of bridegrooms and marriage mornings with a flinching a flinching heart God knows yet a heart up buoyed on thrilling joys I went about making preparations for the Gargantuan orgy of the night The house at Hampstead which no doubt still stands is of rather pleasing design in quite a stone and rural style with good breadths of wall surface two plain coped gables mullioned windows and oversailing slate verge roofs but rather spoiling it a high square three storied tower at the south east angle on the topmost floor of which I had slept the previous night There I had provided myself with a jar of pale tobacco mixed with rose leaves and opium found in a foreign house in Seymour Street also a genuine Saloniki hookah together with the best wines nuts and so on and a gold harp of the musician Krasinski stamped with his name taken from his house in Portland Street But so much did I find to do that day and so many odd things turned up which I thought that I would take with me that it was not till near six that I drove finally northward through Camden Town And now an ineffable awe possessed my soul at the solemn noise which everywhere encompassed me an ineffable awe a blissful terror Never never could I have dreamed of aught so great and potent All above my head there rushed southward with wide spread wing of haste a sparkling smoke and mixed with the immense roaring I heard mysterious hubbubs of tumblings and rumblings which I could not at all comprehend like the moving about of furniture in the houses of Titans while pervading all the air was a most weird and tearful sound as it were threnody and a wild wail of pain and dying swan songs and all lamentations and tribulations of the world Yet I was aware that at an hour so early the flames must be far from general in fact they had not well commenced As I had left a good semicircular region of houses with a radius of four hundred yards without combustibles to the south of the isolated house which I was to occupy and as the wind was so strongly from the north I simply left my two vehicles at the door of the house without fear of any injury nor did any occur I then went up to the top of the tower lit the candles and ate voraciously of the dinner which I had left ready for since the morning I had taken nothing and then with hands and heart that quivered I arranged the clothes of the low spring bed upon which to throw my frame in the morning hours Opposite the wall where lay the bed was a Gothic window pretty large with low sill hung with poppy figured muslin and looking directly south so that I could recline at ease in the red velvet easy chair and see It had evidently been a young lady s room for on the toilette were cut glass bottles a plait of brown hair powders rouge aux levres one little bronze slipper and knick knacks and I loved her and hated her though I did not see her anywhere About half past eight I sat at the window to watch all being arranged and ready at my right hand the candles extinguished in the red room for the theatre was opened was opened and the atmosphere of this earth seemed turned into Hell and Hell was in my soul Soon after midnight there was a sudden and very visible increase in the conflagration On all hands I began to see blazing structures soar with grand hurrahs on high In fives and tens in twenties and thirties all between me and the remote limit of my vision they leapt they lingered long they fell My spirit more and more felt and danced deeper mysteries of sensation sweeter thrills I sipped exquisitely I drew out enjoyment leisurely Anon when some more expansive angel of flame would arise from the Pit with steady aspiration and linger with outspread arms and burst I would lift a little from the chair leaning forward to clap as at some famous acting or I would call to them in shouts of cheer giving them the names of Woman For now I seemed to see nothing but some bellowing pandemonic universe through crimson glasses and the air was wildly hot and my eye balls like theirs that walk staring in the inner midst of burning fiery furnaces and my skin itched with a fierce and prickly itch Anon I touched the chords of the harp to the air of Wagner s Walkueren ritt Near three in the morning I reached the climax of my guilty sweets My drunken eye lids closed in a luxury of pleasure and my lips lay stretched in a smile that dribbled a sensation of dear peace of almighty power consoled me for now the whole area which through streaming tears I surveyed mustering its ten thousand thunders and brawling beyond the stars the voice of its southward rushing torment billowed to the horizon one grand Atlantic of smokeless and flushing flame and in it sported and washed themselves all the fiends of Hell with laughter shouts wild flights and holiday and I first of my race had flashed a signal to the nearer planets Those words signal to the nearer planets I wrote nearly fourteen months ago some days after the destruction of London I being then on board the old Boreal making for the coast of France for the night was dark though calm and I was afraid of running into some ship yet not sleepy so I wrote to occupy my fingers the ship lying still The book in which I wrote has been near me but no impulse to write anything has visited me till now I continue not however that I have very much to put down I had no intention of wearing out my life in lighting fires every morning to warm myself in the inhospitable island of Britain and set out to France with the view of seeking some palace in the Riviera Spain or perhaps Algiers there for the present at least to make my home I started from Calais toward the end of April taking my things along the first two days by train and then determining that I was in no hurry and a petrol motor easier took one and maintained a generally southern and somewhat eastern direction ever anew astonished at the wildness of the forest vegetation which within so short a space since the disappearance of man chokes this pleasant land even before the definite advent of summer After three weeks of very slow travelling for though I know several countries very well France with her pavered villages hilly character vines forests and primeval country manner is always new and charming to me after three weeks I came unexpectedly to a valley which had never entered my head and the moment that I saw it I said Here I will live though I had no idea what it was for the monastery which I saw did not look at all like a monastery according to my ideas but when I searched the map I discovered that it must be La Chartreuse de Vauclaire in Perigord It is my belief that this word Vauclaire is nothing else than a corruption of the Latin Vallis Clara or Bright Valley for l s and u s did interchange about in this way I remember cheval becoming chevau x in the plural like fool and fou and the rest which proves the dear laziness of French people for the l was too much trouble for them to sing and when they came to two l s they quite succumbed shying that vault or vo u te and calling it some y But at any rate this Vauclaire or Valclear was well named for here if anywhere is Paradise and if anyone knew how and where to build and brew liqueurs it was those good old monks who followed their Master with entrain in that Cana miracle and in many other things I fancy but aesthetically shirked to say to any mountain Be thou removed The general hue of the vale is a deep cerulean resembling that blue of the robes of Albertinelli s Madonnas so at least it strikes the eye on a clear forenoon of spring or summer The monastery consists of an oblong space or garth around three sides of which stand sixteen small houses with regular intervals between all identical the cells of the fathers between the oblong space and the cells come the cloisters with only one opening to the exterior in the western part of the oblong is a little square of earth under a large cypress shade within which as in a home of peace it sleeps and there straight and slanting stand little plain black crosses over graves To the west of the quadrangle is the church with the hostelry and an asphalted court with some trees and a fountain and beyond the entrance gate All this stands on a hill of gentle slope green as grass and it is backed close against a steep mountain side of which the tree trunks are conjectural for I never saw any the trees resembling rather one continuous leafy tree top run out high and far over the extent of the mountain I was there four months till something drove me away I do not know what had become of the fathers and brothers for I only found five four of whom I took in two journeys in the motor beyond the church of Saint Martial d Artenset and left them there and the fifth remained three weeks with me for I would not disturb him in his prayer He was a bearded brother of forty years or thereabouts who knelt in his cell robed and hooded in all his phantom white for in no way different from whatever is most phantom visionary and eerie must a procession of these people have seemed by gloaming or dark night This particular brother knelt I say in his small chaste room glaring upward at his Christ who hung long armed in a little recess between the side of three narrow bookshelves and a projection of the wall and under the Christ a gilt and blue Madonna the books on the three shelves few leaning different ways His right elbow rested on a square plain table at which was a wooden chair behind him in a corner the bed a bed all enclosed in dark boards a broad perpendicular board along the foot reaching the ceiling a horizontal board at the side over which he got into bed another narrower one like it at the ceiling for fringe and curtain and another perpendicular one hiding the pillow making the clean bed within a very shady and cosy little den on the wall of this den being another smaller Christ and a little picture On the perpendicular board at the foot hung two white garments and over a second chair at the bed side another all very neat and holy He was a large stern man blond as corn but with some red too in his hairy beard and appalling was the significance of those eyes that prayed and the long drawn cavity of those saffron cheeks I cannot explain to myself my deep reverence for this man but I had it certainly Many of the others it is clear had fled but not he and to the near marching cloud he opposed the Cross holding one real as the other he alone among many For Christianity was an elite religion in which all were called but few chosen differing from Mohammedanism and Buddhism which grasped and conquered all within their reach the effect of Christ rather resembling Plato s and Dante s it would seem but Mahomet s more like Homer s and Shakespeare s It was my way to plant at the portal the big carved chair from the chancel on the hot days and rest my soul refusing to think of anything drowsing and smoking for hours All down there in the plain waved gardens of delicious fruit about the prolonged silver thread of the river Isle whose course winds loitering quite near the foot of the monastery slope This slope dominates a tract of distance that is not only vast but looks immense although the horizon is bounded by a semicircle of low hills rather too stiff and uniform for perfect beauty the interval of plain being occupied by yellow ploughed lands which were never sown weedy now and crossed and recrossed by vividly green ribbons of vine with stretches of pale green lucerne orchards and the white village of Monpont near the railway all embowered the Isle drawing its mercurial streams through the village meadow which is dark with shades of oaks and to have played there a boy and used it familiarly from birth as one s own hand or foot must have been very sweet and homely after this the river divides and takes the shape of a heart and very far away are visible the grey banks of the Gironde On the semicircle of hills when there was little distance mist I saw the ruins of some seigneurial chateau for the seigneurs too knew where to build and to my left between a clump of oaks and an avenue of poplars the bell tower of the village church of Saint Martial d Artenset a very ancient type of tower I believe and common in France rather ponderous consisting of a square mass with a smaller square mass stuck on the latter having large Gothic windows and behind me the west face of the monastery church over the door being the statue of Saint Bruno Well one morning after four months I opened my eyes in my cell to the piercing consciousness that I had burned Monpont over night and so overcome was I with regret for this poor inoffensive little place that for two days hardly eating I paced between the oak and walnut pews of the nave massive stalls they are separated by grooved Corinthian pilasters wondering what was to become of me and if I was not already mad and there are some little angels with extraordinarily human Greuze like faces supporting the nerves of the apse which after a time every time I passed them seemed conscious of me and my existence there and the wood work which ornaments the length of the nave and of the choir also elaborate with carved marguerites and roses here and there took in my eyes significant forms from certain points of view and there is a partition for the nave is divided into two chapels one for the brothers and one for the fathers I conclude and in this partition a massive door which yet looks quite light and graceful carved with oak and acanthus leaves and every time I passed through I had the impression that the door was a sentient thing subconscious of me and the delicate Italian Renaissance brick vault which springs from the vast nave seemed to look upon me with a gloomy knowledge of me and of the heart within me and at about four in the afternoon of the second day after pacing the church for hours I fell down at one of the two altars near that carved door of the screen praying God to have mercy upon my soul and in the very midst of my praying I was up and away the devil in me and I got into the motor and did not come back to Vauclaire for another month and came leaving great tracts of burned desolation behind me towns and forests Bordeaux burned Lebourne burned Bergerac burned I returned to Vauclaire for it seemed now my home and there I experienced a true a deep repentance and I humbled myself before my Maker And while in this state sitting one bright day in front of the monastery gate something said to me You will never be a good man nor permanently escape Hell and Frenzy unless you have an aim in life devoting yourself heart and soul to some great work which will exact all your science your thought your ingenuity your knowledge of modern things your strength of body and will your skill of head and hand otherwise you are bound to succumb Do this therefore beginning not to morrow nor this afternoon but now for though no man will see your work there is still the Almighty God who is also something in His way and He will see how you strive and try and groan and perhaps seeing He may have mercy upon you In this way arose the idea of the Palace an idea indeed which had entered my brain before but merely as a bombastic and visionary outcome of my raving moods now however in a very different way soberly and soon concerning itself with details difficulties means limitations and every kind of practical matter of fact and every obstruction which one by one I foresaw was one by one as the days passed over borne by the vigour with which that thought rapidly becoming a mania possessed me After a week of incessant meditation I decided Yes and I said I will build a palace which shall be both a palace and a temple the first human temple worthy the King of Heaven and the only human palace worthy the King of Earth After this decision I remained at Vauclaire another week a very different man to the lounger it had seen strenuous converted humble making plans of this and of that of the detail and of the whole drawing multiplying dividing adding conic sections and the rule of three totting up the period of building which came out at a little over twelve years estimating the quantities of material weight and bulk my nights full of nightmare as to the sort deciding as to the size and structure of the crane forge and work shop and the necessarily limited weights of their component parts making a list of over twenty four hundred objects and finally up to the third week after my departure from Vauclaire skimming through the topography of nearly the whole earth before fixing upon the island of Imbros for my site I returned to England and once more to the hollow windows and strewn streets of black burned out and desolate London for its bank vaults et cetera contained the necessary complement of the gold brought from Paris and then lying in the Speranza at Dover nor had I sufficient familiarity with French industries and methods to find even with the aid of Bottins one half of the four thousand odd objects which I had now catalogued My ship was the Speranza which brought me from Havre for at Calais to which I first went I could find nothing suitable for all purposes the Speranza being an American yacht very palatially fitted three masted air driven with a carrying capacity of two thousand tons Tobin bronzed in good condition containing sixteen interacting tanks with a five block pulley arrangement amid ships that enables me to lift very considerable weights without the aid of the hoisting air engine high in the water sharp handsome containing a few tons only of sand ballast and needing when I found her only three days work at the water line and engines to make her decent and fit I threw out her dead backed her from the Outer to the Inner Basin to my train on the quai took in the twenty three hundred weight bags of gold and the half ton of amber and with this alone went to Dover thence to Canterbury by motor and thence in a long train with a store of dynamite from the Castle for blasting possible obstructions to London meaning to make Dover my depot and the London rails my thoroughfare from all parts of the country Instead of three months as I had calculated it took me nine a harrowing slavery I had to blast no less than forty three trains from the path of my loaded wagons several times blasting away the metals as well and then having to travel hundreds of yards without metals for the labour of kindling the obstructing engines to shunt them down sidings perhaps distant was a thing which I would not undertake However all s well that ends well though if I had it to go through again certainly I should not The Speranza is now lying seven miles off Cape Roca a heavy mist on the still water this being the nineteenth of June at ten in the night no wind no moon cabin full of mist and I pretty listless and disappointed wondering in my heart why I was such a fool as to take all that trouble nine long servile months my good God and now seriously thinking of throwing the whole vile thing to the devil she pretty deep in the water pregnant with the palace When the thirty three Those words when the thirty three were written by me over seventeen years since long years seventeen in number nor have I now any idea to what they refer The book in which I wrote I had lost in the cabin of the Speranza and yesterday returning to Imbros from an hour s aimless cruise discovered it there behind a chest I find now considerable difficulty in guiding the pencil and these few lines now written have quite an odd look like the handwriting of a man not very proficient in the art it is seventeen years seventeen seventeen ah And the expression of my ideas is not fluent either I have to think for the word a minute and I should not be surprised if the spelling of some of them is queer My brain has been thinking inarticulately perhaps all these years and the English words and letters as they now stand written have rather an improbable and foreign air to me as a Greek or Russian book might look to a man who has not so long been learning those languages as to forget the impossibly foreign impression received from them on the first day of tackling them Or perhaps it is only my fancy for that I have fancies I know But what to write The history of those seventeen years could not be put down my good God at least it would take me seventeen more to do it If I were to detail the building of the palace alone and how it killed me nearly and how I twice fled from it and had to return and became its bounden slave and dreamed of it and grovelled before it and prayed and raved and rolled and how I forgot to make provision on the west side for the contraction and expansion of the gold in the colder weather and the heats of summer and had to break down nine months work and how I cursed Thee how I cursed Thee and how the lake of wine evaporated faster than the conduits replenished it and the three journeys which I had to take to Constantinople for shiploads of wine and my frothing despairs till I had the thought of placing the reservoir in the platform and how I had then to break down the south side of the platform to the very bottom and of the month long nightmare of terror that I had lest the south side of the palace would undergo subsidence and how the petrol failed and of the three weeks search for petrol along the coast and how after list rubbing all the jet I found that I had forgotten the necessary rouge for polishing and how in the third year I found the fluate which I had for water proofing the pores of the platform stone nearly all leaked away in the Speranza s hold and I had to get silicate of soda at Gallipoli and how after two years observation I had to come to the conclusion that the lake was leaking and discovered that this Imbros sand was not suitable for mixing with the skin of Portland cement which covered the cement concrete and had to substitute sheet bitumen in three places and how I did all all for the sake of God thinking I will work and be a good man and cast Hell from me and when I see it stand finished it will be an Altar and a Testimony to me and I shall find peace and be well and how I have been cheated seventeen years long years of my life for there is no God and how my plasterers hair failed me and I had to use flock hessian scrym wadding wood street paving blocks and whatever I could find for filling the interspaces between the platform cross walls and of the espagnolette bolts how a number of them mysteriously disappeared as if snatched to Hell by harpies and I had to make them and how the crane chain would not reach two of the silver panel castings when they were finished and they were too heavy for me to lift and the wringing of the hands of my despair and my biting of the earth and the transport of my fury and how for a whole wild week I searched in vain for the text book which describes the ambering process and how when all was nearly over in the blasting away of the forge and crane with dynamite a long crack appeared down the gold of the east platform steps and how I would not be consoled but mourned and mourned and how in spite of all my tribulations it was sweetly interesting to watch my power slowly grow from the first feeble beginnings of the landing of materials and unloading them from the motor a hundred weight at a time till I could swing four tons see the solid metals flow enjoy the gliding sounds of the handle crank shaft and system of levers forcing inwards the mould end and the upper and lower plungers for pressing the material build at ease in a travelling cage and watch from my hut door through sleepless hours under the electric moonlight of this land the three piles of gold stones the silver panels the two foot squares of jet and be comforted and how the putty wash but it is past it is past and not to live over again that vulgar nightmare of means and ends have I taken to this writing again but to put down something else if I dare Seventeen years my good God of that delusion I could write down no sort of explanation for all those groans and griefs at which a reasoning being would not shriek with laughter I should have lived at ease in some palace of the Middle Orient and burned my cities but no I must be a good man vain thought The words of a wild madman that preaching man in England who prophesied what happened were with me where he says the defeat of Man is His defeat and I said to myself Well the last man shall not be quite a fiend just to spite That Other And I worked and groaned saying I will be a good man and burn nothing nor utter aught unseemly nor debauch myself but choke back the blasphemies that Those Others shriek through my throat and build and build with moils and groans And it was Vanity though I do love the house too I love it well for it is my home on the waste earth I had calculated to finish it in twelve years and I should undoubtedly have finished it in fourteen instead of in sixteen and seven months but one day when the south north and east platform steps were already finished it was in the July of the third year and near sunset as I left off work instead of going to the tent where my dinner lay ready I walked down to the ship most strangely in a daft mechanical sort of way without saying a word to myself an evil meaning smile of malice on my lips and at midnight I was lying off Mitylene thirty miles to the south having bid as I thought a last farewell to all those toils I was going to burn Athens I did not however but kept on my way westward round Cape Matapan intending to destroy the forests and towns of Sicily if I found there a suitable motor for travelling for I had not been at the pains to take the motor on board at Imbros otherwise I would ravage parts of southern Italy But when I came thereabouts I was confronted with an awful horror for no southern Italy was there and no Sicily was there unless a small new island probably not five miles long was Sicily and nothing else I saw save the still smoking crater of Stromboli I cruised northward searching for land and for a long time would not believe the evidence of the instruments thinking that they wilfully misled me or I stark mad But no no Italy was there till I came to the latitude of Naples it too having disappeared engulfed engulfed all that stretch From this monstrous thing I received so solemn a shock and mood of awe that the evil mind in me was quite chilled and quelled for it was and is my belief that a wide spread re arrangement of the earth s surface is being purposed and in all that drama O my God how shall I be found However I went on my way but more leisurely not daring for a long time to do anything lest I might offend anyone and in this foolish cowering mind coasted all the western coast of Spain and France during five weeks in that prolonged intensity of calm weather which now alternates with storms that transcend all thought till I came again to Calais and there for the first time landed Here I would no longer contain myself but burned and that magnificent stretch of forest that lay between Agincourt and Abbeville covering five square miles I burned and Abbeville I burned and Amiens I burned and three forests between Amiens and Paris I burned and Paris I burned burning and burning during four months leaving behind me smoking districts a long tract of ravage like some being of the Pit that blights where pass his flaming wings This of city burning has now become a habit with me more enchaining and infinitely more debased than ever was opium to the smoker or alcohol to the drunkard I count it among the prime necessaries of my life it is my brandy my bacchanal my secret sin I have burned Calcutta Pekin and San Francisco In spite of the restraining influence of this palace I have burned and burned I have burned two hundred cities and countrysides Like Leviathan disporting himself in the sea so I have rioted in this earth After an absence of six months I returned to Imbros for I was for looking again upon the work which I had done that I might mock myself for all that unkingly grovelling and when I saw it standing there as I had left it frustrate and forlorn and waiting its maker s hand some pity and instinct to build took me for something of God was in Man and I fell upon my knees and spread my arms to God and was converted promising to finish the palace with prayers that as I built so He would build my soul and save the last man from the enemy And I set to work that day to list rub the last few dalles of the jet I did not leave Imbros after that during four years except for occasional brief trips to the coast to Kilid Bahr Gallipoli Lapsaki Gamos Rodosto Erdek Erekli or even once to Constantinople and Scutari if I happened to want anything or if I was tired of work but without once doing the least harm to anything but containing my humours and fearing my Maker And full of peaceful charm were those little cruises through this Levantic world which truly is rather like a light sketch in water colours done by an angel than like the dun real earth and full of self satisfaction and pious contentment would I return to Imbros approved of my conscience for that I had surmounted temptation and lived tame and stainless I had set up the southern of the two closed lotus pillars and the platform top was already looking as lovely as heaven with its alternate two foot squares of pellucid gold and pellucid jet when I noticed one morning that the Speranza s bottom was really now too foul and the whim took me then and there to leave all and clean her as far as I could I at once went on board descended to the hold took off my sudeyrie and began to shift the ballast over to starboard so as to tilt up her port bottom to the scraper This was wearying labour and about noon I was sitting on a bag resting in the almost darkness when something seemed to whisper to me these words You dreamed last night that there is an old Chinaman alive in Pekin Horridly I started I had dreamed something of the sort but from the moment of waking till then had forgotten it and I leapt livid to my feet I cleaned no Speranza that day nor for four days did I anything but sat on the cabin house and mused my supporting palm among the hairy draperies of my chin for the thought of such a thing if it could by any possibility be true was detestable as death to me changing the colour of the sun and the whole aspect of the world and anon at the outrage of that thing my brow would flush with wrath and my eyes blaze till on the fourth afternoon I said to myself That old Chinaman in Pekin is likely to get burned to death I think or blown to the clouds So a second time on the fourth March the poor palace was left to build itself For after a short trip to Gallipoli where I got some young lime twigs in boxes of earth and some preserved limes and ginger I set out for a long voyage to the East passing through the Suez Canal and visiting Bombay where I was three weeks and then destroyed it I had the thought of going across Hindustan by engine but did not like to leave my ship to which I was very attached not sure of finding anything so suitable and good at Calcutta and moreover I was afraid to abandon my petrol motor which I had taken on board with the air windlass since I was going to uncivilised land I therefore coasted down western Hindustan All that northern shore of the Arabian Sea has at the present time an odour which it wafts far over the water resembling odours of happy vague dream lands sweet to smell in the early mornings as if the earth were nothing but a perfume and life an inhalation On that voyage however I had from beginning to end twenty seven fearful storms or if I count that one near the Carolines then twenty eight But I do not wish to write of these rages they were too inhuman and how I came alive through them against all my wildest hope Someone or Something only knows I will write down here a thing it is this my God something which I have observed a definite obstreperousness in the mood of the elements now when once roused which grows which grows continually Tempests have become very very far more wrathful the sea more truculent and unbounded in its insolence when it thunders it thunders with a venom new to me cracking as though it would split the firmament and bawling through the heaven of heavens as if roaring to devour all things in Bombay once and in China thrice I was shaken by earthquakes the second and third marked by a certain extravagance of agitation that might turn a man grey Why should this be my God I remember reading very long ago that on the American prairies which from time immemorial had been swept by great storms the storms gradually subsided when man went to reside permanently there If this be true it would seem that the mere presence of man had a certain subduing or mesmerising effect upon the native turbulence of Nature and his absence now may have removed the curb It is my belief that within fifty years from now the huge forces of the earth will be let fully loose to tumble as they will and this planet will become one of the undisputed playgrounds of Hell and the theatre of commotions stupendous as those witnessed on the face of Saturn The Earth is all on my brain on my brain O dark minded Mother with thy passionate cravings after the Infinite thy regrets and mighty griefs and comatose sleeps and sinister coming doom O Earth and I poor man though a king sole witness of thy bleak tremendous woes Upon her I brood and do not cease but brood and brood the habit if I remember right first becoming fixed and fated during that long voyage eastward for what is in store for her God only knows and I have seen in my broodings long visions of her future which if a man should see with the eye of flesh he would spread the arms and wheel and wheel through the mazes of a hiccuping giggling frenzy for the vision only is the very verge of madness If I might cease but for one hour that perpetual brooding upon her But I am her child and my mind grows and grows to her like the off shoots of the banyan tree that take root downward and she sucks and draws it as she draws my feet by gravitation and I cannot take wing from her for she is greater than I and there is no escaping her and at the last I know my soul will dash itself to ruin like erring sea fowl upon pharos lights against her wild and mighty bosom Often a whole night through I lie open eyed in the dark with bursting brain thinking of that hollow Gulf of Mexico how identical in shape and size with the protuberance of Africa just opposite and how the protuberance of the Venezuelan and Brazilian coast fits in with the in curve of Africa so that it is obvious to me it is quite obvious that they once were one and one night rushed so far apart and the wild Atlantic knew that thing and ran gladly hasting in between and how if eye of flesh had been there to see and ear to hear that cruel thundering my God my God what horror And if now they meet again so long apart but that way fury lies Yet one cannot help but think I lie awake and think for she fills my soul and absorbs it with all her moods and ways She has meanings secrets plans Strange strange for instance that similarity between the scheme of Europe and the scheme of Asia each with three southern peninsulas pointing south Spain corresponding with Arabia Italy with India the Morea and Greece divided by the Gulf of Corinth corresponding with the Malay Peninsula and Annam divided by the Gulf of Siam each with two northern peninsulas pointing south Sweden and Norway and Korea and Kamschatka each with two great islands similarly placed Britain and Ireland and the Japanese Hondo and Yezo the Old World and the New has each a peninsula pointing north Denmark and Yucatan a forefinger with long nail and a thumb pointing to the Pole What does she mean What can she mean O Ye that made her Is she herself a living being with a will and a fate as sailors said that ships were living entities And that thing that wheeled at the Pole wheels it still yonder yonder in its dark ecstasy Strange that volcanoes are all near the sea I don t know why I don t think that anyone ever knew This fact in connection with submarine explosions used to be cited in support of the chemical theory of volcanoes which supposed the infiltration of the sea into ravines containing the materials which form the fuel of eruptions but God knows if that is true The lofty ones are intermittent a century two ten of silent waiting and then their talk silenced for ever some poor district the low ones are constant in action Who could know the dark way of the world Sometimes they form a linear system consisting of several vents which extend in one direction near together like chimneys of some long foundry beneath In mountains a series of serrated peaks denotes the presence of dolomites rounded heads mean calcareous rocks and needles crystalline schists The preponderance of land in the northern hemisphere denotes the greater intensity there of the causes of elevation at a remote geologic epoch that is all that one can say about it but whence that greater intensity I have some knowledge of the earth for only ten miles down but she has eight thousand miles and whether through all that depth she is flame or fluid hard or soft I do not know I do not know Her method of forming coal geysers and hot sulphur springs and the jewels and the atols and coral reefs the metamorphic rocks of sedimentary origin like gneiss the plutonic and volcanic rocks rocks of fusion and the unstratified masses which constitute the basis of the crust and harvests the burning flame of flowers and the passage from the vegetable to the animal I do not know them but they are of her and they are like me molten in the same furnace of her fiery heart She is dark and moody sudden and ill fated and rends her young like a cannibal lioness and she is old and wise and remembers Hur of the Chaldees which Uruk built and that Temple of Bel which rose in seven pyramids to symbolise the planets and Birs i Nimrud and Haran and she bears still as a thing of yesterday old Persepolis and the tomb of Cyrus and those cloister like viharah temples of the ancient Buddhists cut from the Himalayan rock and returning from the Far East I stopped at Ismailia and so to Cairo and saw where Memphis was and stood one bright midnight before that great pyramid of Shafra and that dumb Sphynx and seated at the well of one of the rock tombs looked till tears of pity streamed down my cheeks for great is the earth and her Ages but man passeth away These tombs have pillars extremely like the two palace pillars only that these are round and mine are square for I chose it so but the same band near the top then over this the closed lotus flower then the small square plinth which separates them from the architrave only mine have no architrave the tombs consist of a little outer temple or court then comes a well and inside another chamber where I suppose the dead were a ribbon like astragal surrounding the walls which are crowned with boldly projecting cornices surmounted by an abacus And here till the pressing want of food drove me back I remained for more and more the earth over grows me wooes me assimilates me so that I ask myself this question Must I not in time cease to be a man and become a small earth precisely her copy extravagantly weird and fierce half demoniac half ferine wholly mystic morose and turbulent fitful and deranged and sad like her A whole month of that voyage from May the fifteenth to June the thirteenth I wasted at the Andaman Islands near Malay for that any old Chinaman could be alive in Pekin began after some time to seem the most quixotic notion that ever entered a human brain and these jungled islands to which I came after a shocking vast orgy one night at Calcutta when I fired not only the city but the river pleased my fancy to such an extent that at one time I intended to abide there I was at the one called in the chart Saddle Hill the smallest of them I think and seldom have I had such sensations of peace as I lay a whole burning day in a rising vale deeply shaded in palm and tropical ranknesses watching thence the Speranza at anchor for there was a little offing here at the shore whence the valley arose and I could see one of its long peaks lined with cocoanut trees and all cloud burned out of the sky except the flimsiest lawn figments and the sea as absolutely calm as a lake roughened with breezes yet making a considerable noise in its breaking on the shore as I have noticed in these sorts of places I do not know why These poor Andaman people seem to have been quite savage for I met a number of them in roaming the island nearly skeletons yet with limbs and vertebrae still in general cohering and in some cases dry skinned and mummified relics of flesh and never anywhere a sign of clothes a very singular thing considering their nearness to high old civilisations all about them They looked small and black or almost and I never found a man without finding on or near him a spear and other weapons so that they were eager folk and the wayward dark earth was in them too as she should be in her children

none	none	I passed down the Straits of Malacca and in that short distance between the Andaman Islands and the S W corner of Borneo I was thrice so mauled that at times it seemed quite out of the question that anything built by man could escape such unfettered cataclysms and I resigned myself but with bitter reproaches to perish darkly The effect of the third upon me when it was over was the unloosening afresh of all my evil passion for I said Since they mean to slay me death shall find me rebellious and for weeks I could not sight some specially happy village or umbrageous spread of woodland that I did not stop the ship and land the materials for their destruction so that nearly all those spicy lands about the north of Australia will bear the traces of my hand for many a year for more and more my voyage became dawdling and zigzaged as the merest whim directed it or the movement of the pointer on the chart and I thought of eating the lotus of surcease and nepenthe in some enchanted nook of this bowering summer where from my hut door I could see through the pearl hues of opium the sea lagoon slaver lazily upon the old coral atol and the cocoanut tree would droop like slumber and the bread fruit tree would moan in sweet and weary dream and I should watch the Speranza lie anchored in the pale atol lake year after year and wonder what she was and whence and why she dozed so deep for ever and after an age of melancholy peace and burdened bliss I should note that sun and moon had ceased revolving and hung inert opening anon a heavy lid to doze and drowse again and God would sigh Enough and nod and Being would swoon to sleep for that any old Chinaman should be alive in Pekin was a thing so fantastically maniac as to draw from me at times sudden fits of wild red laughter that left me faint During a space of four months from the eighteenth June to the twenty third October I visited the Fijis where I saw skulls still surrounded with remnants of extraordinary haloes of stiff hair women clad in girdles made of thongs fixed in a belt and in Samoa near bodies crowned with coronets of nautilus shell and traces of turmeric paint and tattooing and in one townlet a great assemblage of carcasses suggesting by their look some festival or dance so that I believe that these people were overthrown without the least fore knowledge of anything The women of the Maoris wore an abundance of green jade ornaments and I found a peculiar kind of shell trumpet one of which I have now also a tattooing chisel and a nicely carved wooden bowl The people of New Caledonia on the other hand went I should think naked confining their attention to the hair and in this resembling the Fijians for they seemed to wear an artificial hair made of the fur of some creature like a bat and also they wore wooden masks and great rings for the ear no doubt which must have fallen to the shoulders for the earth was in them all and made them wild perverse and various like herself 
7318_96168_000002_000003	train-clean-360	I went from one to the other without any system whatever searching for the ideal resting place and often thinking that I had found it but only wearying of it at the thought that there was a yet deeper and dreamier in the world 
7318_96168_000002_000004	train-clean-360	But in this search I received a check my God which chilled me to the marrow and set me flying from these places 
none	none	One evening the twenty ninth November I dined rather late at eight sitting as was my custom in calm weather cross legged on the cabin rug at the port aft corner a small semicircle of Speranza gold plate before me and near above me the red shaded lamp with green conical reservoir whose creakings never cease in the stillest mid sea and beyond the plates the array of preserved soups meat extracts meats fruit sweets wines nuts liqueurs coffee on the silver spirit tripod glasses cruet and so on which it was always my first care to select from the store room open and lay out once for all in the morning on rising I was late seven being my hour for on that day I had been engaged in the occasionally necessary but always deferred task of overhauling the ship brushing here a rope with tar there a board with paint there a crank with oil rubbing a door handle a brass fitting filling the three cabin lamps dusting mirrors and furniture dashing the great neat joinered plains of deck with bucketfulls or high in air chopping loose with its rigging the mizzen top mast which since a month was sprained at the clamps all this in cotton drawers under loose quamis bare footed my beard knotted up the sun a blaze the sea smooth and pale with the smooth pallor of strong currents the ship still enough no land in sight yet great tracts of sea weed making eastward I working from eleven A M till near seven when sudden darkness interrupted for I wished to have it all over in one obnoxious day 
7318_96168_000003_000002	train-clean-360	I was therefore very tired when I went down lit the central chain lever lamp and my own two washed and dressed in my bedroom and sat to dinner in the dining hall corner 
7318_96168_000003_000003	train-clean-360	I ate voraciously with sweat as usual pouring down my eager brow using knife or spoon in the right hand but never the Western fork licking the plates clean in the Mohammedan manner and drinking pretty freely 
none	none	Still I was tired and went upon deck where I had the threadbare blue velvet easy chair with the broken left arm before the wheel and in it sat smoking cigar after cigar from the Indian D box half asleep yet conscious The moon came up into a pretty cloudless sky and she was bright but not bright enough to out shine the enlightened flight of the ocean which that night was one continuous swamp of Jack o lantern phosphorescence a wild but faint luminosity mingled with stars and flashes of brilliance the whole trooping unanimously eastward as if in haste with elfin momentous purpose a boundless congregation in the sweep of a strong oceanic current I could hear it in my slumbrous lassitude struggling and gurgling at the tied rudder and making wet sloppy noises under the sheer of the poop and I was aware that the Speranza was gliding along pretty fast drawn into that procession probably at the rate of four to six knots but I did not care knowing very well that no land was within two hundred miles of my bows for I was in longitude one hundred seventy three deg in the latitude of Fiji and the Society Islands between those two and after a time the cigar drooped and dropped from my mouth and sleep overcame me and I slept there in the lap of the Infinite So that something preserves me Something Someone and for what If I had slept in the cabin I must most certainly have perished for lying there on the poop I dreamed a dream which once I had dreamed on the ice far far yonder in the forgotten hyperborean North that I was in an Arabian paradise a Garden of Peaches and I had a very long vision of it for I walked among the trees and picked the fruit and pressed the blossoms to my nostrils with breathless inhalations of love till a horrible sickness woke me and when I opened my eyes the night was black the moon gone down everything wet with dew the sky arrayed with most glorious stars like a thronged bazaar of tiaraed rajahs and begums with spangled trains and all the air fragrant with that mortal scent and high and wide uplifted before me stretching from the northern to the southern limit a row of eight or nine inflamed smokes as from the chimneys of some Cyclopean foundry a work all night most solemn most great and dreadful in the solemn night eight or nine I should say or it might be seven or it might be ten for I did not count them and from those craters puffed up gusts of encrimsoned material here a gust and there a gust with tinselled fumes that convolved upon themselves and sparks and flashes all veiled in a garish haze of light for the foundry worked though languidly and upon a rocky land four miles ahead which no chart had ever marked the Speranza drove straight with the current of the phosphorus sea 
7318_96168_000005_000000	train-clean-360	As I rose I fell flat and what I did thereafter I did in a state of existence whose acts to the waking mind appear unreal as dream 
7318_96168_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I must at once I think have been conscious that here was the cause of the destruction of mankind that it still surrounded its own neighbourhood with poisonous fumes and that I was approaching it 
7318_96168_000005_000002	train-clean-360	I must have somehow crawled or dragged myself forward 
7318_96168_000005_000003	train-clean-360	There is an impression on my mind that it was a purple land of pure porphyry there is some faint memory or dream of hearing a long drawn booming of waves upon its crags I do not know whence I have them 
7318_96168_000005_000004	train-clean-360	I think that I remember retching with desperate jerks of the travailing intestines also that I was on my face as I moved the regulator in the engine room but any recollection of going down the stairs or of coming up again I have not 
7318_96168_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Happily the wheel was tied the rudder hard to port and as the ship moved she must therefore have turned and I must have been back to untie the wheel in good time for when my senses came I was lying there my head against the under gimbal one foot on a spoke of the wheel no land in sight and morning breaking 
none	none	This made me so sick that for either two or three days I lay without eating in the chair near the wheel only rarely waking to sufficient sense to see to it that she was making westward from that place and on the morning when I finally roused myself I did not know whether it was the second or the third morning so that my calendar so scrupulously kept may be a day out for to this day I have never been at the pains to ascertain whether I am here writing now on the fifth or the sixth of June Well on the fourth or the fifth evening after this just as the sun was sinking beyond the rim of the sea I happened to look where he hung motionless on the starboard bow and there I saw a clean cut black green spot against his red a most unusual sight here and now a ship a poor thing as it turned out when I got near her without any sign of mast heavily water logged some relics of old rigging hanging over even her bowsprit apparently broken in the middle though I could not see it and she nothing more than a hirsute green mass of old weeds and sea things from bowsprit tip to poop and from bulwarks to water line stout as a hedgehog only awaiting there the next high sea to founder It being near my dinner hour and night s rest I stopped the Speranza some fifteen yards from her and commenced to pace my spacious poop as usual before eating and as I paced I would glance at her wondering at her destiny and who were the human men that had lived on her their Christian names and family names their age and thought and way of life and beards till the desire arose within me to go to her and see and I threw off my outer garments uncovered and unroped the cedar cutter the only boat except the air pinnace left to me intact and got her down by the mizzen five block pulley system But it was a ridiculous nonsense for having paddled to her I was thrown into paroxysms of rage by repeated failures to scale her bulwarks low as they were my hands indeed could reach but I found no hold upon the slimy mass and three rope ends which I caught were also untenably slippery so that I jerked always back into the boat my clothes a mass of filth and the only thought in my blazing brain a twenty pound charge of guncotton of which I had plenty to blow her to uttermost Hell I had to return to the Speranza get a half inch rope then back to the other for I would not be baulked in such a way though now the dark was come only slightly tempered by a half moon and I getting hungry and from minute to minute more fiendishly ferocious 
7318_96168_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Finally by dint of throwing I got the rope loop round a mast stump drew myself up and made fast the boat my left hand cut by some cursed shell and all for what

none	none	She was a ship of probably fifteen hundred tons three masted and a sailer I got aft for I had on thick outer babooshes and saw that only four of the companion steps remained by a small leap however I could descend into that desolation where the stale sea stench seemed concentrated into a very essence of rankness 
7318_96168_000008_000008	train-clean-360	Here I experienced a singular ghostly awe and timorousness lest she should sink with me or something but striking matches I saw an ordinary cabin with some fungoids skulls bones and rags but not one cohering skeleton 
7318_96168_000008_000009	train-clean-360	In the second starboard berth was a small table and on the floor a thick round ink pot whose continual rolling on its side made me look down and there I saw a flat square book with black covers which curved half open of itself for it had been wet and stained 
none	none	This I took and went back to the Speranza for that ship was nothing but an emptiness and a stench of the crude elements of life nearly assimilated now to the rank deep to which she was wedded and soon to be absorbed into its nature and being to become a sea in little as I in time my God shall be nothing but an earth in little During dinner and after I read the book with some difficulty for it was pen written in French and discoloured and it turned out to be the journal of someone a passenger and voyager I imagine who called himself Albert Tissu and the ship the Marie Meyer There was nothing remarkable in the narrative that I could see common place descriptions of South Sea scenes records of weather cargoes and the like till I came to the last written page and that was remarkable enough It was dated the thirteenth of April strange thing my good God incredibly strange that same day twenty long years ago when I reached the Pole and the writing on that page was quite different from the neat look of the rest proving immoderate excitement wildest haste and he heads it Cinq Heures I suppose in the evening for he does not say and he writes Monstrous event phenomenon without likeness the witnesses of which must for ever live immortalised in the annals of the universe an event which will make even Mama Henri and Juliette admit that I was justified in undertaking this most eventful voyage Talking with Captain Tombarel on the poop when a sudden exclamation from him Mon Dieu His visage whitens 
7318_96168_000009_000004	train-clean-360	I follow the direction of his gaze to eastward 
none	none	I behold eight kilometres perhaps away ten monstrous waterspouts reaching up up high enough all apparently in one straight line with intervals of nine hundred metres very regularly placed They do not wander dance nor waver as waterspouts do nor are they at all lily shaped like waterspouts but ten hewn pillars of water with uniform diameter from top to bottom only a little twisted here and there and as I divine fifty metres in girth Five ten stupendous minutes we look Captain Tombarel mechanically repeating and repeating under his breath Mon Dieu Mon Dieu the whole crew now on the poop I agitated but collected watch in hand And suddenly all is blotted out the pillars of water doubtless still there can no more be seen for the ocean all about them is steaming hissing higher than the pillars a dense white vapour vast in extent whose venomous sibilation we at this distance can quite distinctly hear

would have no more to do for all here it used to be said lies a great sunken continent and I thought it would be rising and shewing itself to my eyes and driving me stark mad for the earth is full of these contortions sudden monstrous grimaces and apparitions which are like the face of Medusa affrighting a man into spinning stone and nothing could be more appallingly insecure than living on a planet I did not stop till I had got so far northward as the Philippine Islands where I was two weeks exuberant odorous places but so hilly and rude that at one place I abandoned all attempt at travelling in the motor and left it in a valley by a broad shallow noisy river full of mossy stones for I said Here I will live and be at peace and then I had a fright for during three days I could not re discover the river and the motor and I was in the greatest despair thinking When shall I find my way out of these jungles and vastnesses For I was where no paths were and had lost myself in deeps where the lure of the earth is too strong and rank for a single man since in such places I suppose a man would rapidly be transformed into a tree or a snake or a tiger At last however I found the place to my great joy but I would not shew that I was glad and to hide it fell upon a front wheel of the car with some kicks I could not make out who the people were that lived here for the relics of some seemed quite black like New Zealand races and I could still detect the traces of tattooing while others suggested Mongolian types and some looked like pigmies and some like whites But I cannot detail the two years incidents of that voyage for it is past and like a dream and not to write of that of all that have I taken this pencil in hand after seventeen long long years Singular my reluctance to put it on paper I will write rather of the voyage to China and how I landed the motor on the wharf at Tientsin and went up the river through a maize and rice land most charming in spite of intense cold I thick with clothes as an Arctic traveller and of the three dreadful earthquakes within two weeks and how the only map which I had of the city gave no indication of the whereabouts of its military depositories and I had to seek for them and of the three days effort to enter them for every gate was solid and closed and how I burned it but had to observe its flames without deep pleasure from beyond the walls to the south the whole place being one cursed plain yet how at one moment I cried aloud with wild banterings and glad laughters of Tophet to that old Chinaman still alive within it and how I coasted and saw the hairy Ainus man and woman hairy alike and how lying one midnight awake in my cabin the Speranza being in a still glassy water under a cliff overhung by drooping trees it was the harbour of Chemulpo to me lying awake came the thought Suppose now you should hear a step walking to and fro leisurely on the poop above you just suppose and the night of horrors which I had for I could not help supposing and at one time really thought that I heard it and how the sweat rolled and poured from my brow and how I went to Nagasaki and burned it and how I crossed over the great Pacific deep to San Francisco for I knew that Chinamen had been there too and one of them might be alive and how one calm day the fifteenth or the sixteenth April I sitting by the wheel in the mid Pacific suddenly saw a great white hole that ran and wheeled and wheeled and ran in the sea coming toward me and I was aware of the hot breath of a reeling wind and then of the hot wind itself which deep groaned the sound of the letter V humming like a billion spinning tops and the Speranza was on her side sea pouring over her port bulwarks and myself in the corner between deck and taffrail drowning fast but unable to stir but all was soon past and the white hole in the sea and the hot spinning top of wind ran wheeling beyond to the southern horizon and the Speranza righted herself so that it was clear that someone wished to destroy me for that a typhoon of such vehemence ever blew before I cannot think and how I came to San Francisco and how I burned it and had my sweets for it was mine and how I thought to pass over the great trans continental railway to New York but would not fearing to leave the Speranza lest all the ships in the harbour there should be wrecked or rusted and buried under sea weed and turned unto the sea and how I went back my mind all given up now to musings upon the earth and her ways and a thought in my soul that I would return to those deep places of the Filipinas and become an autochthone a tree or a snake or a man with snake limbs like the old autochthones but I would not for Heaven was in man too Earth and Heaven and how as I steamed round west again another winter come and I now in a mood of dismal despondencies on the very brink of the inane abyss and smiling idiotcy I saw in the island of Java the great temple of Boro Budor and like a tornado or volcanic event my soul was changed for my recent studies in the architecture of the human race recurred to me with interest and three nights I slept in the temple examining it by day It is vast with that look of solid massiveness which above all characterises the Japanese and Chinese building my measurement of its width being five hundred twenty nine feet and it rises terrace like in six stories to a height of about one hundred twenty or one hundred thirty feet here Buddhist and Brahmin forms are combined into a most richly developed whole with a voluptuousness of tracery that is simply intoxicating each of the five off sets being divided up into an innumerable series of external niches containing each a statue of the sitting Boodh all surmounted by a number of cupolas and the whole crowned by a magnificent dagop and when I saw this I had the impulse to return to my home after so long wandering and to finish the temple of temples and the palace of palaces and I said I will return and build it as a testimony to God Save for a time near Cairo I did not once stop on that homeward voyage but turned into the little harbour at Imbros at a tranquil sunset on the seventh of March as I reckon and I moored the Speranza to the ring in the little quay and I raised the battered motor from the hold with the middle air engine battered by the typhoon in the mid Pacific which had broken it from the rope fastenings and tumbled it head over heels to port and I went through the windowless village street and up through the plantains and cypresses which I knew and the Nile mimosas and mulberries and Trebizond palms and pines and acacias and fig trees till the thicket stopped me and I had to alight for in those two years the path had finally disappeared and on on foot I made my way till I came to the board bridge and leant there and looked at the rill and thence climbed the steep path in the sward toward that rolling table land where I had built with many a groan and half way up I saw the tip of the crane arm then the blazing top of the south pillar then the shed roof then the platform a blinking blotch of glory to the watery eyes under the setting sun But the tent and nearly all that it contained was gone For four days I would do nothing simply lying and watching shirking a load so huge but on the fifth morning I languidly began something and I had not worked an hour when a fever took me to finish it to finish it and it lasted upon me with only three brief intervals nearly seven years nor would the end have been so long in coming but for the unexpected difficulty of getting the four flat roofs water tight for I had to take down half the east one Finally I made them of gold slabs one and a quarter inch thick smooth on both sides on each beam double gutters being fixed along each side of the top flange to catch any leakage at the joints which are filled with slaters cement The slabs are clamped to the top flanges by steel clips having bolts set with plaster of Paris in holes drilled in the slabs These clips are one one two in by three seventeen in and are seventeen in apart The roofs are slightly pitched to the front edges where they drain into gold plated copper gutters on plated wrought iron brackets with one side flashed up over the blocks which raise the slabs from the beam tops to clear the joint gutters But now I babble again of that base servitude which I would forget but cannot for every measurement bolt ring is in my brain like a burden but it is past it is past and it was vanity Six months ago to day it was finished six months more protracted desolate burdened than all those sixteen years in which I built I wonder what a man another man some Shah or Tsar of that far off past would say now of me if eye could rest upon me With what awe would he certainly shrink before the wild majesty of these eyes and though I am not lunatic for I am not I am not how would he fly me with the exclamation There is the very lunacy of Pride For there would seem to him it must be so in myself in all about me something extravagantly royal touched with terror My body has fattened and my girth now fills out to a portly roundness its broad Babylonish girdle of crimson cloth minutely gold embroidered and hung with silver copper and gold coins of the Orient my beard still black sweeps in two divergent sheaves to my hips flustered by every wind as I walk through this palace the amber and silver floor reflects in its depths my low necked short armed robe of purple blue and scarlet a glow with luminous stones I am ten times crowned Lord and Emperor I sit a hundred times enthroned in confirmed obese old Majesty Challenge me who will challenge me who dare Among those myriad worlds upon which I nightly pore I may have my Peers and Compeers and Fellow denizens but here I am Sole Earth acknowledges my ancient sway and hereditary sceptre for though she draws me not yet not yet am I hers but she is mine It seems to me not less than a million million aeons since other beings more or less resembling me walked impudently in the open sunlight on this planet which is rightly mine I can indeed no longer picture to myself nor even credit that such a state of things so fantastic so far fetched so infinitely droll could have existed though at bottom I suppose I know that it must have been really so Up to ten years ago in fact I used frequently to dream that there were others I would see them walk in the streets like ghosts and be troubled and start awake but never now could such a thing I think occur to me in sleep for the wildness of the circumstance would certainly strike my consciousness and immediately I should know that the dream was a dream For now at least I am sole I am lord The golden walls of this palace which I have built look down enamoured of their reflection into a lake of the choicest purplest wine Not that I made it of wine because wine is rare nor the walls of gold because gold is rare that would have been too childish but because I would match for beauty a human work with the works of those Others and because it happens by some persistent freak of the earth that precisely things most rare and costly are generally the most beautiful The vision of glorious loveliness which is this palace now risen before my eyes cannot be described by pen and paper though there may be words in the lexicons of language which if I sought for them with inspired wit for sixteen years as I have built for sixteen years might as vividly express my thought on paper as the stones of gold so grouped and built express it to the eye but failing such labours and skill I suppose I could not give if there were another man and I tried to give the faintest conception of its celestial charm It is a structure positively as clear as the sun and as fair as the moon the sole great human work in the making of which no restraining thought of cost has played a part one of its steps alone being of more cost than all the temples mosques and besestins the palaces pagodas and cathedrals built between the ages of the Nimrods and the Napoleons The house itself is very small only forty fort long by thirty five broad by twenty seven high yet the structure as a whole is sufficiently enormous high uplifted the rest of the bulk being occupied by the platform on which the house stands each side of this measuring at its base four hundred eighty fort its height from top to bottom one hundred thirty fort and its top forty eight fort square the elevation of the steps being just nearly thirty degrees and the top reached from each of the four points of the compass by one hundred eighty three low long steps very massively overlaid with smooth molten gold not forming a continuous flight but broken into threes and fives sixes and nines with landings between the series these from the top looking like a great terraced parterre of gold It is thus an Assyrian palace in scheme only that the platform has steps on all sides instead of on one The platform top from its edge to the golden walls of the house is a mosaic consisting of squares of the glassiest clarified gold and squares of the glassiest jet corner to corner each square two fort wide Around the edge of the platform on top run forty eight square plain gold pilasters twelve on each side two fort high tapering upwards and topped by a knob of solid gold pierced with a hole through which passes a lax inch and a half silver chain hung with little silver balls which strike together in the breeze The mansion consists of an outer court facing east toward the sea and the house proper which encloses an inner court The outer court is a hollow oblong thirty two fort wide by eight fort long the summit of its three walls being battlemented they are eighteen one two fort in height or eight one two fort lower than the house around their gold sides on inside and outside three fort from the top runs a plain flat band of silver one fort wide projecting two three in and at the gate which is a plain Egyptian entrance facing eastwards two one two fort narrower at top than at bottom stand the two great square pillars of massive plain gold tapering upwards forty five fort high with their capital of band closed lotus and thin plinth in the outer court immediately opposite the gate is an oblong well twelve fort by three fort reproducing in little the shape of the court its sides which are gold lined tapering downward to near the bottom of the platform where a conduit of one eight in diameter automatically replenishes the ascertained mean evaporation of the lake during the year the well containing one hundred five thousand three hundred sixty litres when nearly full and the lake occupying a circle round the platform of nine hundred eighty fort diameter with a depth of three one two fort Round the well run pilasters connected by silver chains with little balls and it communicates by a one eight in conduit with a pool of wine let into the inner court this being fed from eight tall and narrow golden tanks tapering upwards which surround it each containing a different red wine sufficient on the whole to last for all purposes during my lifetime The ground of the outer court is also a mosaic of jet and gold but thenceforth the jet squares give place throughout to squares of silver and the gold squares to squares of clear amber clear as solidified oil The entrance is by an Egyptian doorway seven fort high with folding doors of gold plated cedar opening inwards surrounded by a very large projecting coping of plain silver three one two fort wide severe simplicity of line throughout enormously multiplying the effect of richness of material The interior resembles I believe rather a Homeric than an Assyrian or Egyptian house except for the galleries which are purely Babylonish and Old Hebrew The inner court with its wine pool and tanks is a small oblong of eight fort by nine fort upon which open four silver latticed window oblongs in the same proportion and two doors before and behind oblongs in the same proportion Round this run the eight walls of the house proper the inner ten fort from the outer each parallel two forming a single long corridor like chamber except the front east two which are divided into three apartments in each side of the house are six panels of massive plain silver half an inch thinner in their central space where are affixed paintings twenty two or else twenty one taken at the burning of Paris from a place called The Louvre and two or else three from a place in England so that the panels have the look of frames and are surrounded by oval garlands of the palest amethyst topaz sapphire and turquoise which I could find each garland being of only one kind of stone a mere oval ring two feet wide at the sides and narrowing to an inch at the top and bottom without designs The galleries are five separate recesses in the outer walls under the roofs two in the east facade and one in the north south and west hung with pavilions of purple blue rose and white silk on rings and rods of gold with gold pilasters and banisters each entered by four steps from the roof to which lead north and south two spiral stairs of cedar On the east roof stands the kiosk under which is the little lunar telescope and from that height and from the galleries I can watch under the bright moonlight of this climate which is very like lime light the for ever silent blue hills of Macedonia and where the islands of Samothraki Lemnos Tenedos slumber like purplish fairies on the Aegean Sea for usually I sleep during the day and keep a night long vigil often at midnight descending to bathe my coloured baths in the lake and to disport myself in that strange intoxication of nostrils eyes and pores dreaming long wide eyed dreams at the bottom to return dazed and weak and drunken Or again twice within these last void and idle six months I have suddenly run bawling out from this temple of luxury tearing off my gaudy rags to hide in a hut by the shore smitten for one intense moment with realisation of the past of this earth and moaning alone alone all alone alone alone alone alone For events precisely resembling eruptions take place in my brain and one spangled midnight ah how spangled I may kneel on the roof with streaming uplifted face with outspread arms and awe struck heart adoring the Eternal the next I may strut like a cock wanton as sin lusting to burn a city to wallow in filth and like the Babylonian maniac calling myself the equal of Heaven But it was not to write of this of all this Of the furnishing of the palace I have written nothing But why I hesitate to admit to myself what I know is not clear If They speak to me I may surely write of Them for I do not fear Them but am Their peer Of the island I have written nothing its size climate form vegetation There are two winds a north and a south wind the north is cool and the south is warm and the south blows during the winter months so that sometimes on Christmas day it is quite hot and the north which is cool blows from May to September so that the summer is hardly ever oppressive and the climate was made for a king The mangal stove in the south hall I have never once lit The length I should say is nineteen miles the breadth ten or thereabouts and the highest mountains should reach a height of some two thousand fort though I have not been all over it It is very densely wooded in most parts and I have seen large growths of wheat and barley obviously degenerate now with currants figs valonia tobacco vines in rank abundance and two marble quarries From the palace which lies on a sunny plateau of beautifully sloping swards dotted with the circular shadows thrown by fifteen huge cedars and seven planes I can see on all sides an edge of forest with the gleam of a lake to the north and in the hollow to the east the rivulet with its little bridge and a few clumps and beds of flowers I can also spy right through It shall be written now I have this day heard within me the contention of the Voices I thought that they were done with me That all all all was ended I have not heard them for twenty years But to day distinctly breaking in with brawling impassioned suddenness upon my consciousness I heard This late far niente and vacuous inaction here have been undermining my spirit this inert brooding upon the earth this empty life and bursting brain Immediately after eating at noon to day I said to myself I have been duped by the palace for I have wasted myself in building hoping for peace and there is no peace Therefore now I shall fly from it to another sweeter work not of building but of destroying not of Heaven but of Hell not of self denial but of reddest orgy Constantinople beware I tossed the chair aside and with a stamp was on my feet and as I stood again again I heard the startlingly sudden wrangle the fierce vulgar outbreak and voluble controversy till my consciousness could not hear its ears and one urged Go go and the other Not there where you like but not there for your life I did not for I could not go I was so overcome I fell upon the couch shivering These Voices or impulses plainly as I felt them of old quarrel within me now with an openness new to them Lately influenced by my long scientific habit of thought I have occasionally wondered whether what I used to call the two Voices were not in reality two strong instinctive movements such as most men may have felt though with less force But to day doubt is past doubt is past nor unless I be very mad can I ever doubt again I have been thinking thinking of my life there is a something which I cannot understand There was a man whom I met once in that dark backward and abysm of time when I must have been very young I fancy at some college or school in England and his name now is far enough beyond scope of my memory lost in the vast limbo of past things But he used to talk continually about certain Black and White Powers and of their strife for this world He was a short man with a Roman nose and lived in fear of growing a paunch His forehead a top in profile was more prominent than the nose end he parted his hair in the middle and had the theory that the male form was more beautiful than the female I forget what his name was the dim clear obscure being Very profound was the effect of his words upon me though I think I used to make a point of slighting them This man always declared that the Black would carry off the victory in the end and so he has so he has But assuming the existence of this Black and this White being and supposing it to be a fact that my reaching the Pole had any connection with the destruction of my race according to the notions of that extraordinary Scotch parson then it must have been the power of the Black which carried me in spite of all obstacles to the Pole So far I can understand But after I had reached the Pole what further use had either White or Black for me Which was it White or Black that preserved my life through my long return on the ice and why It could not have been the Black For I readily divine that from the moment when I touched the Pole the only desire of the Black which had previously preserved must have been to destroy me with the rest It must have been the White then that led me back retarding me long so that I should not enter the poison cloud and then openly presenting me the Boreal to bring me home to Europe But his motive And the significance of these recommencing wrangles after such a silence This I do not understand Curse Them curse Them with their mad tangles I care nothing for Them Are there any White Idiots and Black Idiots at all Or are these Voices that I hear nothing but the cries of my own strained nerves and I all mad and morbid morbid and mad mad my good God This inertia here is not good for me This stalking about the palace and long thinkings about Earth and Heaven Black and White White and Black and things beyond the stars My brain is like bursting through the walls of my poor head To morrow then to Constantinople Descending to go to the ship I had almost reached the middle of the east platform steps when my foot slipped on the smooth gold and the fall though I was not walking carelessly had I swear all the violence of a fall caused by a push I struck my head and as I rolled downward swooned When I came to myself I was lying on the very bottom step which is thinly washed by the wine waves another roll and I suppose I must have drowned I sat there an hour lost in amazement then crossed the causeway came down to the Speransa with the motor went through her spent the day in work slept on her worked again to day till four at both ship and time fuses I with only seven hundred fuses left and in Stamboul alone must be eight thousand houses without counting Galata Tophana Kassim pacha Scutari and the rest started out at five point thirty and am now at eleven P M lying motionless two miles off the north coast of the island of Marmora with moonlight gloating on the water a faint north breeze and the little pale land looking immensely stretched out solemn and great as if that were the world and there were nothing else and the tiny island at its end immense and the Speranza vast and I only little To morrow at eleven A M I will moor the Speranza in the Golden Horn at the spot where there is that low damp nook of the bagnio behind the naval magazines and that hill where the palace of the Capitan Pacha is I found that great tangle of ships in the Golden Horn wonderfully preserved many with hardly any moss growths This must be due I suppose to the little Ali Bey and Kezat Hanah which flow into the Horn at the top and made no doubt a constant current Ah I remember the place long ago I lived here some months or it may be years It is the fairest of cities and the greatest I believe that London in England was larger but no city surely ever seemed so large But it is flimsy and will burn like tinder The houses are made of light timber with interstices filled by earth and bricks and some of them look ruinous already with their lovely faded tints of green and gold and red and blue and yellow like the hues of withered flowers for it is a city of paints and trees and all in the little winding streets as I write are volatile almond blossoms mixed with maple blossoms white with purple Even the most splendid of the Sultan s palaces are built in this combustible way for I believe that they had a notion that stone building was presumptuous though I have seen some very thick stone houses in Galata This place I remember lived in a constant state of sensation on account of nightly flares up and I have come across several tracts already devastated by fires The ministers of state used to attend them and if the fire would not go out the Sultan himself was obliged to be there in order to encourage the firemen Now it will burn still better But I have been here six weeks and still no burning for the place seems to plead with me it is so ravishing so that I do not know why I did not live here and spare my toils during those sixteen nightmare years for two whole weeks the impulse to burn was quieted and since then there has been an irritating whisper at my ear which said It is not really like the great King that you are this burning but like a foolish child or a savage who liked to see fireworks or at least if you must burn do not burn poor Constantinople which is so charming and so very old with its balsamic perfumes and the blossomy trees of white and light purple peeping over the walls of the cloistered painted houses and all those lichened tombs those granite menhirs and regions of ancient marble tombs between the quarters Greek tombs Byzantine Jew Mussulman tombs with their strange and sacred inscriptions overwaved by their cypresses and vast plane trees And for weeks I would do nothing but roamed about with two minds in me under the tropic brilliance of the sky by day and the vast dreamy nights of this place that are like nights seen through azure tinted glasses and in each of them is not one night but the thousand and one long crowded nights of glamour and fancy for I would sit on the immense esplanade of the Seraskierat or the mighty grey stones of the porch of the mosque of Sultan Mehmed fatih dominating from its great steps all old Stamboul and watch the moon for hours and hours so passionately bright she soared through clear and cloud till I would be smitten with doubt of my own identity for whether I were she or the earth or myself or some other thing or man I did not know all being so silent alike and all except myself so vast the Seraskierat and the Suleimanieh and Stamboul and the Marmora Sea and the earth and those argent fields of the moon all large alike compared with me and measure and space were lost and I with them These proud Turks died stolidly many of them In streets of Kassim pacha in crowded Taxim on the heights of Pera and under the long Moorish arcades of Sultan Selim I have seen the open air barber s razor with his bones and with him the half shaved skull of the faithful and the long two hours narghile with traces of burnt tembaki and haschish still in the bowl Ashes now are they all and dry yellow bone but in the houses of Phanar and noisy old Galata and in the Jew quarter of Pri pacha the black shoe and head dress of the Greek is still distinguishable from the Hebrew blue It was a mixed ritual of colours here in boot and hat yellow for Mussulman red boots black calpac for Armenian for the Effendi a white turban for the Greek a black The Tartar skull shines from under a high taper calpac the Nizain djid s from a melon shaped head piece the Imam s and Dervish s from a grey conical felt and there is here and there a Frank in European rags I have seen the towering turban of the Bashi bazouk and his long sword and some softas in the domes on the great wall of Stamboul and the beggar and the street merchant with large tray of water melons sweetmeats raisins sherbet and the bear shewer and the Barbary organ and the night watchman who evermore cried Fire with his long lantern two pistols dirk and wooden javelin Strange how all that old life has come back to my fancy now pretty vividly and for the first time though I have been here several times lately I have gone out to those plains beyond the walls with their view of rather barren mountain peaks the city looking nothing but minarets shooting through black cypress tops and I seemed to see the wild muezzin at some summit crying the midday prayer Mohammed Resoul Allah the wild man and from that great avenue of cypresses which traverses the cemetery of Scutari the walled city of Stamboul lay spread entire up to Phanar and Eyoub in their cypress woods before me the whole embowered now in trees all that complexity of ways and dark alleys with overhanging balconies of old Byzantine houses beneath which a rider had to stoop the head where old Turks would lose their way in mazes of the picturesque and on the shaded Bosphorus coast to Foundoucli and beyond some peeping yali snow white palace or old Armenian cot and the Seraglio by the sea a town within a town and southward the Sea of Marmora blue and white and vast and fresh as a sea just born rejoicing at its birth and at the jovial sun all brisk alert to the shadowy islands afar and as I looked I suddenly said aloud a wild mad thing my God a wild and maniac thing a shrieking maniac thing for Hell to laugh at for something said with my tongue This city is not quite dead Three nights I slept in Stamboul itself at the palace of some sanjak bey or emir or rather dozed with one slumbrous eye that would open to watch my visitors Sinbad and Ali Baba and old Haroun to see how they slumbered and dozed for it was in the small luxurious chamber where the bey received those speechless all night visits of the Turks long rosy hours of perfumed romance and drunkenness of the fancy and visionary languor sinking toward morning into the yet deeper peace of dreamless sleep and there still were the white yatags for the guests to sit cross legged on for the waking dream and to fall upon for the final swoon and the copper brazier still scenting of essence of rose and the cushions rugs hangings the monsters on the wall the haschish chibouques narghiles hookahs and drugged pale cigarettes and a secret looking lattice beyond the door painted with trees and birds and the air narcotic and grey with the pastilles which I had burned and the scented smokes which I had smoked and I all drugged and mumbling my left eye suspicious of Ali there and Sinbad and old Haroun who dozed And when I had slept and rose to wash in a room near the overhanging latticed balcony of the facade before me to the north lay old Galata in sunshine and that steep large street mounting to Pera once full at every night fall of divans on which grave dervishes smoked narghiles and there was no space for passage for all was divans lounges almond trees heaven high hum chibouques in forests the dervish and the innumerable porter the horse hirer with his horse from Tophana and arsenal men from Kassim and traders from Galata and artillery workmen from Tophana and on the other side of the house the south end a covered bridge led across a street which consisted mostly of two immense blind walls into a great tangled wilderness of flowers which was the harem garden where I passed some hours and here I might have remained many days many weeks perhaps but that dozing one fore day with those fancied others it was as if there occurred a laugh somewhere and a thing said But this city is not quite dead waking me from deeps of peace to startled wakefulness And I thought to myself If it be not quite dead it will be soon and with some suddenness And the next morning I was at the Arsenal It is long since I have so deeply enjoyed even to the marrow It may be the White who has the guardianship of my life but assuredly it is the Black who reigns in my soul Grandly did old Stamboul Galata Tophana Kassim right out beyond the walls to Phanar and Eyoub blaze and burn The whole place except one little region of Galata was like so much tinder and in the five hours between eight P M and one A M all was over I saw the tops of those vast masses of cemetery cypresses round the tombs of the Osmanlis outside the walls and those in the cemetery of Kassim and those round the sacred mosque of Eyoub shrivel away instantaneously like flimsy hair caught by a flame I saw the Genoese tower of Galata go heading obliquely on an upward curve like Sir Roger de Coverley and wild rockets and burst high high with a report in pairs and threes and fours I saw the blue cupolas of the twelve or fourteen great mosques give in and subside or soar and rain and the great minarets nod the head and topple and I saw the flames reach out and out across the empty breadth of the Etmeidan three hundred yards to the six minarets of the Mosque of Achmet wrapping the red Egyptian granite obelisk in the centre and across the breadth of the Serai Meidani it reached to the buildings of the Seraglio and the Sublime Porte and across those vague barren stretches that lie between the houses and the great wall and across the seventy or eighty great arcaded bazaars all enwrapping it reached and the spirit of fire grew upon me for the Golden Horn itself was a tongue of fire crowded west of the galley harbour with exploding battleships Turkish frigates corvettes brigs and east with tens of thousands of feluccas caiques gondolas and merchantmen aflame On my left burned all Scutari and between six and eight in the evening I had sent out thirty seven vessels under low horse powers of air with trains and fuses laid for eleven P M to light with their wandering fires the Sea of Marmora By midnight I was encompassed in one great furnace and fiery gulf all the sea and sky inflamed and earth a flare Not far from me to the left I saw the vast Tophana barracks of the Cannoniers and the Artillery works after long reluctance and delay take wing together and three minutes later down by the water the barrack of the Bombardiers and the Military School together grandly grandly and then to the right in the valley of Kassim the Arsenal these occupying the sky like smoky suns and shedding a glaring day over many a mile of sea and land I saw the two lines of ruddier flaring where the barge bridge and the raft bridge over the Golden Horn made haste to burn and all that vastness burned with haste quicker and quicker to fervour to fury to unanimous rabies and when its red roaring stormed the infinite and the might of its glowing heart was Gravitation Being Sensation and I its compliant wife then my head nodded and with crooked lips I sighed as it were my last sigh and tumbled weak and drunken upon my face O wild Providence Unfathomable madness of Heaven that ever I should write what now I write I will not write it The hissing of it It is only a crazy dream a tearing out of the hair by the roots to scatter upon the raving storms of Saturn My hand will not write it In God s name During four nights after the burning I slept in a house French as I saw by the books c probably the Ambassador s for it has very large gardens and a beautiful view over the sea situated on the rapid east declivity of Pera it is one of the few large houses which for my safety I had left standing round the minaret whence I had watched this minaret being at the top of the old Mussulman quarter on the heights of Taxim between Pera proper and Foundoucli At the bottom both at the quay of Foundoucli and at that of Tophana I had left under shelter two caiques for double safety one a Sultan s gilt craft with gold spur at the prow and one a boat of those zaptias that used to patrol the Golden Horn as water police by one or other of these I meant to reach the Speranza she being then safely anchored some distance up the Bosphorus coast So on the fifth morning I set out for the Tophana quay but a light rain had fallen over night and this had re excited the thin grey smoke resembling quenched steam which as from some reeking province of Abaddon still trickled upward over many a square mile of blackened tract though of flame I could see no sign I had not accordingly advanced far over every sort of debris when I found my eyes watering my throat choked and my way almost blocked by roughness whereupon I said I will turn back cross the region of tombs and barren waste behind Pera descend the hill get the zaptia boat at the Foundoucli quay and so reach the Speranza Accordingly I made my way out of the region of smoke passed beyond the limits of smouldering ruin and tomb and soon entered a rich woodland somewhat scorched at first but soon green and flourishing as the jungle This cooled and soothed me and being in no hurry to reach the ship I was led on and on in a somewhat north western direction I fancy Somewhere hereabouts I thought was the place they called The Sweet Waters and I went on with the vague notion of coming upon them thinking to pass the day till afternoon in the forest Here nature in only twenty years has returned to an exuberant savagery and all was now the wildest vegetation dark dells rills wimpling through deep brown shade of sensitive mimosa large pendulous fuchsia palm cypress mulberry jonquil narcissus daffodil rhododendron acacia fig Once I stumbled upon a cemetery of old gilt tombs absolutely overgrown and lost and thrice caught glimpses of little trellised yalis choked in boscage With slow and listless foot I went munching an almond or an olive though I could swear that olives were not formerly indigenous to any soil so northern yet here they are now pretty plentiful though elementary so that modifications whose end I cannot see are certainly proceeding in everything some of the cypresses which I met that day being immense beyond anything I ever heard of and the thought I remember was in my head that if a twig or leaf should change into a bird or a fish with wings and fly before my eyes what then should I do and I would eye a branch suspiciously anon After a long time I penetrated into a very sombre grove The day outside the wood was brilliant and hot and very still the leaves and flowers here all motionless I seemed as it were to hear the vacant silence of the world and my foot treading on a twig produced the report of pistols I presently reached a glade in a thicket about eight yards across that had a scent of lime and orange where the just sufficient twilight enabled me to see some old bones three skulls and the edge of a tam tam peeping from a tuft of wild corn with corn flowers and here and there some golden champac and all about a profusion of musk roses I had stopped why I do not recollect perhaps thinking that if I was not getting to the Sweet Waters I should seriously set about finding my way out And as I stood looking about me I remember that some cruising insect trawled near my ear its lonely drone Suddenly God knows I started I started I imagined I dreamed that I saw a pressure in a bed of moss and violets recently made And while I stood gloating upon that impossible thing I imagined I dreamed the lunacy of it that I heard a laugh the laugh my good God of a human soul Or it seemed half a laugh and half a sob and it passed from me in one fleeting instant Laughs and sobs and idiot hallucinations I had often heard before feet walking sounds behind me and even as I had heard them I had known that they were nothing But brief as was this impression it was yet so thrillingly real that my poor heart received as it were the very shock of death and I fell backward into a mass of moss supported on the right palm while the left pressed my working bosom and there toiling to catch my breath I lay still all my soul focussed into my ears But now I could hear no sound save only the vast and audible hum of the silence of the universe There was however the foot print If my eye and ear should so conspire against me that I thought was hard Still I lay still in that same pose without a stir sick and dry mouthed infirm and languishing with dying breaths but keen keen and malign I would wait I said to myself I would be artful as snakes though so woefully sick and invalid I would make no sound After some minutes I became conscious that my eyes were leering leering in one fixed direction and instantly the mere fact that I had a sense of direction proved to me that I must in truth have heard something I strove I managed to raise myself and as I stood upright feebly swaying there not the terrors of death alone were in my breast but the authority of the monarch was on my brow I moved I found the strength Slow step by slow step with daintiest noiselessness I moved to a thread of moss that from the glade passed into the thicket and along its winding way I stepped in the direction of the sound Now my ears caught the purling noise of a brooklet and following the moss path I was led into a mass of bush only two or three feet higher than my head Through this prowling like a stealthy cat I wheedled my painful way emerged upon a strip of open long grass and now was faced three yards before me by a wall of acacia trees prickly pear and pichulas between which and a forest beyond I spied a gleam of running water On hands and knees I crept toward the acacia thicket entered it a little and leaning far forward peered And there at once ten yards to my right I saw Singular to say my agitation instead of intensifying to the point of apoplexy and death now at the actual sight subsided to something very like calmness With malign and sullen eye askance I stood and steadily I watched her there She was on her knees her palms lightly touching the ground supporting her At the edge of the streamlet she knelt and she was looking with a species of startled shy astonishment at the reflexion of her face in the limpid brown water And I with sullen eye askance regarded her a good ten minutes space I believe that her momentary laugh and sob which I had heard was the result of surprise at seeing her own image and I firmly believe from the expression of her face that this was the first time that she had seen it Never I thought as I stood moodily gazing had I seen on the earth a creature so fair though analysing now at leisure I can quite conclude that there was nothing at all remarkable about her good looks Her hair somewhat lighter than auburn and frizzy was a real garment to her nakedness covering her below the hips some strings of it falling too into the water her eyes a dark blue were wide in a most silly expression of bewilderment Even as I eyed and eyed her she slowly rose and at once I saw in all her manner an air of unfamiliarity with the world as of one wholly at a loss what to do Her pupils did not seem accustomed to light and I could swear that that was the first day in which she had seen a tree or a stream Her age appeared eighteen or twenty I guessed that she was of Circassian blood or at least origin Her skin was whitey brown or old ivory white She stood up motionless at a loss She took a lock of her hair and drew it through her lips There was some look in her eyes which I could plainly see now somehow indicating wild hunger though the wood was full of food After letting go her hair she stood again feckless and imbecile with sideward hung head very pitiable to see I think now though no faintest pity touched me then It was clear that she did not at all know what to make of the look of things Finally she sat on a moss bank reached and took a musk rose on her palm and looked hopelessly at it One minute after my first actual sight of her my extravagance of agitation I say died down to something like calm The earth was mine by old right I felt that and this creature a mere slave upon whom without heat or haste I might perform my will and for some time I stood coolly enough considering what that will should be I had at my girdle the little cangiar with silver handle encrusted with coral and curved blade six inches long damascened in gold and sharp as a razor the blackest and the basest of all the devils of the Pit was whispering in my breast with calm persistence Kill kill and eat Why I should have killed her I do not know That question I now ask myself It must be true true that it is not good for man to be alone There was a religious sect in the Past which called itself Socialist and with these must have been the truth man being at his best and highest when most social and at his worst and lowest when isolated for the Earth gets hold of all isolation and draws it and makes it fierce base and materialistic like sultans aristocracies and the like but Heaven is where two or three are gathered together It may be so I do not know nor care But I know that after twenty years of solitude on a planet the human soul is more enamoured of solitude than of life shrinking like a tender nerve from the rough intrusion of Another into the secret realm of Self and hence perhaps the bitterness with which solitary castes Brahmins patricians aristocracies always resisted any attempt to invade their slowly acquired domain of privileges Also it may be true it may it may that after twenty years of solitary selfishness a man becomes without suspecting it not at all noticing the slow stages a real and true beast a horrible hideous beast mad prowling like that King of Babylon his nails like birds claws and his hair like eagles feathers with instincts all inflamed and fierce delighting in darkness and crime for their own sake I do not know nor care but I know that as I drew the cangiar the basest and the slyest of all the devils was whispering me tongue in cheek Kill kill and be merry With excruciating slowness like a crawling glacier tender as a nerve of the touching leaves I moved I stole obliquely toward her through the wall of bush the knife behind my back Once only there was a restraint a check I felt myself held back I had to stop for one of the ends of my divided beard had caught in a limb of prickly pear I set to disentangling it and it was I believe at the moment of succeeding that I first noticed the state of the sky a strip of which I could see across the rivulet a minute or so before it had been pretty clear but now was busy with hurrying clouds It was a sinister muttering of thunder which had made me glance upward When my eyes returned to the sitting figure she was looking foolishly about the sky with an expression which almost proved that she had never before heard that sound of thunder or at least had no idea what it could bode My fixed regard lost not one of her movements while inch by inch not breathing careful as the poise of a balance I crawled And suddenly with a rush I was out in the open running her down She leapt perhaps two perhaps three paces she fled then stock still she stood within some four yards of me with panting nostrils with enquiring face I saw it all in one instant and in one instant all was over I had not checked the impetus of my run at her stoppage and I was on the point of reaching her with uplifted knife when I was suddenly checked and smitten by a stupendous violence a flash of blinding light attracted by the steel which I held struck tingling through my frame and at the same time the most passionate crash of thunder that ever shocked a poor human ear felled me to the ground The cangiar snatched from my hand fell near the girl s foot I did not entirely lose consciousness though surely the Powers no longer hide themselves from me and their close contact is too intolerably rough and vigorous for a poor mortal man During I should think three or four minutes I lay so astounded under that bullying cry of wrath that I could not move a finger When at last I did sit up the girl was standing near me with a sort of smile holding out to me the cangiar in a pouring rain I took it from her and my doddering fingers dropped it into the stream Pour pour came the rain raining as it can in this place not long but a deluge while it lasts dripping in thick liquidity like a profuse sweat through the forest I seeking to get back by the way I had come flying but with difficulty and slowness and a feeling in me that I was being tracked And so it proved for when I struck into more open space nearly opposite the west walls but now on the north side of the Golden Horn where there is a flat grassy ground somewhere between the valley of Kassim and Charkoi with horror I saw that protegee of Heaven or of someone not ten yards behind following me like a mechanical figure it being now near three in the afternoon and the rain drenching me through and I tired and hungry and from all the ruins of Constantinople not one whiff of smoke ascending I trudged on wearily till I came to the quay of Foundoucli and the zaptia boat and there she was with me still her hair nothing but a thin drowned string down her back Not only can she not speak to me in any language that I know but she can speak in no language it is my firm belief that she has never spoken She never saw a boat or water or the world till now I could swear it She came into the boat with me and sat astern clinging for dear life to the gunwale by her finger nails and I paddled the eight hundred yards to the Speranza and she came up to the deck after me When she saw the open water the boat the yalis on the coast and then the ship astonishment was imprinted on her face But she appears to know little fear She smiled like a child and on the ship touched this and that as if each were a living thing It was only here and there that one could see the ivory brown colour of her skin the rest was covered with dirt like old bottles long lying in cellars By the time we reached the Speranza the rain suddenly stopped I went down to my cabin to change my clothes and had to shut the door in her face to keep her out When I opened it she was there and she followed me to the windlass when I went to set the anchor engine going I intended I suppose to take her to Imbros where she might live in one of the broken down houses of the village But when the anchor was not yet half up I stopped the engine and let the chain run again For I said No I will be alone I am not a child I knew that she was hungry by the look in her eyes but I cared nothing for that I was hungry too and that was all I cared about I would not let her be there with me another instant I got down into the boat and when she followed I rowed her back all the way past Foundoucli and the Tophana quay to where one turns into the Golden Horn by saint Sophia around the mouth of the Horn being a vast semicircle of charred wreckage carried out by the river currents I went up the steps on the Galata side before one comes to where the barge bridge was When she had followed me on to the embankment I walked up one of those rising streets very encumbered now with stone debris and ashes but still marked by some standing black wall fragments it being now not far from night but the air as clear and washed as the translucency of a great purple diamond with the rain and the afterglow of the sun and all the west aflame When I was about a hundred yards up in this old mixed quarter of Greeks Turks Jews Italians Albanians and noise and cafedjis and wine bibbing having turned two corners I suddenly gathered my skirts spun round and as fast as I could was off at a heavy trot back to the quay She was after me but being taken by surprise I suppose was distanced a little at first However by the time I could scurry myself down into the boat she was so near that she only saved herself from the water by a balancing stoppage at the brink as I pushed off I then set out to get back to the ship muttering You can have Turkey if you like and I will keep the rest of the world I rowed sea ward my face toward her but steadily averted for I would not look her way to see what she was doing However as I turned the point of the quay where the open sea washes quite rough and loud to go northward and disappear from her I heard a babbling cry the first sound which she had uttered I did look then and she was still quite near me for the silly maniac had been running along the embankment following me Little fool I cried out across the water what are you after now And oh my good God shall I ever forget that strangeness that wild strangeness of my own voice addressing on this earth another human soul There she stood whimpering like an abandoned dog after me I turned the boat rowed came to the first steps landed and struck her two stinging slaps one on each cheek While she cowered surprised no doubt I took her by the hand led her back to the boat landed on the Stamboul side and set off still leading her my object being to find some sort of possible edifice near by not hopelessly burned in which to leave her for in all Galata there was plainly none and Pera I thought was too far to walk to But it would have been better if I had gone to Pera for we had to walk quite three miles from Seraglio Point all along the city battlements to the Seven towers she picking her bare footed way after me through the great Sahara of charred stuff and night now well arrived and the moon a drift in the heaven making the desolate lonesomeness of the ruins tenfold desolate so that my heart smote me then with bitterness and remorse and I had a vision of myself that night which I will not put down on paper At last however pretty late in the evening I spied a large mansion with green lattice work facade and shaknisier and terrace roof which had been hidden from me by the arcades of a bazaar a vast open space at about the centre of Stamboul one of the largest of the bazaars I should think in the middle of which stood the mansion probably the home of pasha or vizier for it had a very distinguished look in that place It seemed very little hurt though the vegetation that had apparently choked the great open space was singed to a black fluff among which lay thousands of calcined bones of man horse ass and camel for all was distinct in the bright yet so pensive and forlorn moonlight which was that Eastern moonlight of pure astral mystery which illumines Persepolis and Babylon and ruined cities of the old Anakim The house I knew would contain divans yatags cushions foods wines sherbets henna saffron mastic raki haschish costumes and a hundred luxuries still good There was an outer wall but the foliage over it had been singed away and the gate all charred It gave way at a push from my palm The girl was close behind me I next threw open a little green lattice door in the facade under the shaknisier and entered Here it was dark and the moment that she too was within I slipped out quickly slammed the door in her face and hooked it upon her by a little hook over the latch I now walked some yards beyond the court then stopped listening for her expected cry but all was still five minutes ten I waited but no sound I then continued my morose and melancholy way hollow with hunger intending to start that night for Imbros But this time I had hardly advanced twenty steps when I heard a frail and strangled cry apparently in mid air behind me and glancing saw the creature lying at the gateway a white thing in black stubble ashes She had evidently jumped well outward from a small casement of lattice on a level with the little shaknisier grating through which once peeped bright eyes thirty feet aloft I hardly believe that she was conscious of any danger in jumping for all the laws of life are new to her and having sought and found the opening she may have merely come with blind instinctiveness after me taking the first way open to her I walked back pulled at her arm and found that she could not stand Her face was screwed with silent pain she did not moan Her left foot I could see was bleeding and by the wounded ankle I took her and dragged her so through the ashes across the narrow court and tossed her like a little dog with all my force within the door cursing her Now I would not go back the long way to the ship but struck a match and went lighting up girandoles cressets candelabra into a confusion of lights among great numbers of pale tinted pillars rose and azure with verd antique olive and Portoro marble and serpentine The mansion was large I having to traverse quite a desert of embroidered brocade hangings slender columns and Broussa silks till I saw a stair case doorway behind a Smyrna portiere went up and wandered some time in a house of gilt barred windows with very little furniture but palatial spaces solitary huge pieces of faience of inestimable age and arms my footfalls quite stifled in the Persian carpeting I passed through a covered in hanging gallery with one window grating overlooking an inner court and by this entered the harem which declared itself by a greater luxury bric a bracerie and profusion of manner Here descending a short curved stair behind a portiere I came into a marble paved sort of larder in which was an old negress in blue dress her hair still adhering and an infinite supply of sweetmeats French preserved foods sherbets wines and so on I put a number of things into a pannier went up again found some of those exquisite pale cigarettes which drunken in the hollow of an emerald also a jewelled two yard long chibouque and tembaki and with all descended by another stair and laid them on the steps of a little raised kiosk of green marble in a corner of the court went up again and brought down a still snowy yatag to sleep on and there by the kiosk step ate and passed the night smoking for several hours in a state of languor In the centre of the court is a square marble well looking white through a rankness of wild vine acacias in flower weeds jasmines and roses which overgrew it as well as the kiosk and the whole court climbing even the four square arcade of Moorish arches round the open space under one of which I had deposited a long lantern of crimson silk for here no breath of the fire had come About two in morning I fell to sleep a deeper peace of shadow now reigning where so long the melancholy silver of the moon had lingered About eight in the morning I rose and made my way to the front intending that that should be my last night in this ruined place for all the night sleeping and waking the thing which had happened filled my brain growing from one depth of incredibility to a deeper so that at last I arrived at a sort of certainty that it could be nothing but a drunken dream but as I opened my eyes afresh the deep cutting realisation of that impossibility smote like a pang of lightning stroke through my being and I said I will go again to the far Orient and forget and I started out from the court not knowing what had become of her during the night till having reached the outer chamber with a wild start I saw her lying there at the door in the very spot where I had flung her asleep sideways head on arm Softly softly I stept over her got out and went running at a cautious clandestine trot The morning was in high fete most fresh and pure and to breathe was to be young and to see such a sunlight lighten even upon ruin so vast was to be blithe After running two hundred yards to one of the great broken bazaar portals I looked back to see if I was followed but all that space was desolately empty I then walked on past the arch on which a green oblong once inscribed as usual with some text in gilt hieroglyphs is still discernible and emerging saw the great panorama of destruction a few vast standing walls with hollow Oriental windows framing deep sky beyond and here and there a pillar or half minaret and down within the walls of the old Seraglio still some leafless branchless trunks and in Eyoub and Phanar leafless forests and on the northern horizon Pera with the steep upper half of the Iani Chircha street still there and on the height the European houses and all between blackness stones a rolling landscape of ravine like the hilly pack ice of the North if its snow were ink and to the right Scutari black laid low with its vast region of tombs and rare stumps of its forests and the blithe blue sea with the widening semicircle of floating debris looking like brown foul scum at some points congested before the bridgeless Golden Horn for I stood pretty high in the centre of Stamboul somewhere in the region of the Suleimanieh or of Sultan Selim as I judged with immense purviews into abstract distances and mirage And to me it seemed too vast too lonesome and after advancing a few hundred yards beyond the bazaar I turned again I found the girl still asleep at the house door and stirring her with my foot woke her She leapt up with a start of surprise and a remarkable sinuous agility and gazed an astounded moment at me till separating reality from dream and habit she realised me but immediately subsided to the floor again being in evident pain I pulled her up and made her limp after me through several halls to the inner court and the well where I set her upon the weedy margin took her foot in my lap examined it drew water washed it and bandaged it with a strip torn from my caftan hem now and again speaking gruffly to her so that she might no more follow me After this I had breakfast by the kiosk steps and when I was finished put a mass of truffled foie gras on a plate brushed through the thicket to the well and gave it her She took it but looked foolish not eating I then with my forefinger put a little into her mouth whereupon she set hungrily to eat it all I also gave her some ginger bread a handful of bonbons some Krishnu wine and some anisette I then started out afresh gruffly bidding her stay there and left her sitting on the well her hair falling down the opening she peering after me through the bushes But I had not half reached the ogival bazaar portal when looking anxiously back I saw that she was limping after me So that this creature tracks me in the manner of a nutshell following about in the wake of a ship I turned back with her to the house for it was necessary that I should plan some further method of eluding her That was five days ago and here I have stayed for the house and court are sufficiently agreeable and form a museum of real objets d art It is settled however that to morrow I return to Imbros It seems certain that she never wore saw nor knew of clothes I have dressed her first sousing her thoroughly with sponge and soap in luke warm rose water in the silver cistern of the harem bath which is a circular marbled apartment with a fountain and the complicated ceilings of these houses and frescoes and gilt texts of the Koran on the walls and pale rose silk hangings On the divan I had heaped a number of selected garments and having shewed her how to towel herself I made her step into a pair of the trousers called shintiyan made of yellow striped white silk this by a running string I tied loosely round the upper part of her hips then drawing up the bottoms to her knees tied them there so that their voluminous baggy folds overhanging still to the ankles have rather the look of a skirt over this I put upon her a blue striped chiffon chemise or quamis reaching a little below the hips I then put on a short jacket or vest of scarlet satin thickly embroidered in gold and precious stones reaching somewhat below the waist and pretty tight fitting and making her lie on the couch I put upon her little feet little yellow baboosh slippers then anklets on her fingers rings round her neck a necklace of sequins finally dyeing her nails which I cut with henna There remained her head but with this I would have nothing to do only pointing to the tarboosh which I had brought to a square kerchief to some corals and to the fresco of a woman on the wall which if she chose she might copy Lastly I pierced her ears with the silver needles which they used here and after two hours of it left her About an hour afterwards I saw her in the arcade round the court and to my great surprise she had a perfect plait down her back and over her head and brows a green silk feredjeh or hood precisely as in the picture Here is a question the answer to which would be interesting to me Whether or not for twenty years or say rather twenty centuries twenty eternal aeons I have been stark mad a raving maniac and whether or not I am now suddenly sane sitting here writing in my right mind my whole mood and tone changed or rapidly changing And whether such change can be due to the presence of only one other being in the world with me This singular being Where she has lived and how is a problem to which not the faintest solution is conceivable She had I say never seen clothes for when I began to dress her her perplexity was unbounded also during her twenty years she has never seen almonds figs nuts liqueurs chocolate conserves vegetables sugar oil honey sweetmeats orange sherbet mastic salt raki tobacco and many such things for she showed perplexity at all these hesitation to eat them but she has known and tasted white wine I could see that Here then is a mystery I have not gone to Imbros but remained here some days longer observing her I have allowed her to sit in a corner at meal time not far from where I eat and I have given her food She is wonderfully clever I continually find that after an incredibly short time she has most completely adapted herself to this or that Already she wears her outfit as coquettishly as though born to clothes Without at all seeming observant for on the contrary she gives an impression of great flightiness she watches me I am convinced with pretty exact observation She knows precisely when I am speaking roughly bidding her go bidding her come tired of her tolerant of her scorning her cursing her If I wish her to the devil she quickly divines it by my face and will disappear Yesterday I noticed something queer about her and soon discovered that she had been staining her lids with black kohol like the hanums so that having found a box she must have guessed its use from the pictures Wonderfully clever imitative as a mirror Two mornings ago I found an old mother of pearl kittur and sitting under the arcade touched the strings playing a simple air I could just see her behind one of the arch pillars on the opposite side and she was listening with apparent eagerness and I fancied panting Well returning from a walk beyond the Phanar walls in the afternoon I heard the same air coming out from the house for she was repeating it pretty faultlessly by ear Also during the forenoon of the previous day I came upon her for footsteps make no sound in this house in the pacha s visitors hall and what was she doing copying the poses of three dancing girls frescoed there So that she would seem to have a character as light as a butterfly s and is afraid of nothing Now I know I had observed that at the beginning of every meal she seemed to have something on her mind going toward the door hesitating as if to see whether I would follow and then returning At length yesterday after sitting to eat she jumped up and to my infinite surprise said her first word said it with a most quaint experimental effort of the tongue as a fledgling trying the air the word Come That morning meeting her in the court I had told her to repeat some words after me but she had made no attempt as if shy to break the long silence of her life and now I felt some sort of foolish pleasure in hearing her utter that word often no doubt heard from me and after hurriedly eating I went with her saying to myself She must be about to shew me the food to which she is accustomed and perhaps that will solve her origin And so it has proved I have now discovered that to the moment when she saw me she had tasted only her mother s milk dates and that white wine of Ismidt which the Koran permits As it was getting dark I lit and took with me the big red silk lantern and we set out she leading and walking confoundedly fast slackening when I swore at her and getting fast again and she walks with a certain levity flightiness and liberated furore very hard to describe as though space were a luxury to be revelled in By what instinctive cleverness or native vigour of memory she found her way I cannot tell but she led me such a walk that night miles miles till I became furious darkness having soon fallen with only a faint moon obscured by cloud and a drizzle which haunted the air she without light climbing and picking her thinly slippered steps over mounds of debris and loosely strewn masonry with unfailing agility I occasionally splashing a foot with horror into one of those little ponds which always marked the Stamboul streets When I was nearer her I would see her peer across and upward toward Pera as if that were a remembered land mark and would note the perpetual aspen oscillations of the long coral drops in her ears and the nimble ply of her limbs wondering with a groan if Pera was our goal Our goal was even beyond Pera When we came to the Golden Horn she pointed to my caique which lay at the Old Seraglio steps and over the water we went she lying quite at ease now with her face at the level of the water in the centre of the crescent shape as familiarly as a hanum of old engaged in some escapade through the crowded Babel of Galata and that north side of the Horn Through Galata we passed I already cursing the journey and following the line of the coast and the great steep thoroughfare of Pera we came at last almost in the country to a great wall and the entrance to an immense terraced garden whose limits were invisible many of the trees and avenues being still intact I knew it at once I had lain a special fuse train in the great palace at the top of the terraces it was the royal palace Yildiz Up and up we went through the grounds a few unburned old bodies in rags of uniform still discernible here and there as the lantern swung past them a musician in sky blue a fantassin and officer of the guard in scarlet forming a cross with domestics of the palace in red and orange The palace itself was quite in ruins together with all its surrounding barracks mosque and seraglio and as we reached the top of the grounds presented a picture very like those which I have seen of the ruins of Persepolis only that here the columns both standing and fallen were innumerable and all more or less blackened and through doorless doors we passed down immensely wide short flights of steps and up them and over strewed courtyards by tottering fragments of arcades all roofless and tracts of charcoal between interrupted avenues of pillars I following expectant and she very eager now Finally down a flight of twelve or fourteen rather steep and narrow steps very dislocated we went to a level which I thought must be the floor of the palace vaults for at the bottom of the steps we stood on a large plain floor of plaster which bore the marks of the flames and over this the girl ran a few steps pointed with excited recognition to a hole in it ran further and disappeared down the hole When I followed and lowered the lantern a little I saw that the drop down was about eight feet made less than six feet by a heap of stone rubbish below the falling of which had caused the hole and it was by standing on this rubbish heap I knew at once that she must have been enabled to climb out into the world I dropped down and found myself in a low flat roofed cellar with a floor of black earth very fusty and damp but so very vast in extent that even in the day time I suppose I could not have discerned its boundaries I fancy indeed that it extends beneath the whole palace and its environs an enormous stretch of space with the lantern I could only see a very limited portion of its area She still led me eagerly on and I presently came upon a whole region of flat boxes each about two feet square and nine inches high made of very thin laths packed to the roof and about a hundred and fifty feet from these I saw where she pointed another region of bottles fat bellied bottles in chemises of wicker work stretching away into gloom and total darkness The boxes of which a great number lay broken open as they can be by merely pulling with the fingers at a pliant crack contain dates and the bottles of which many thousands lay empty contain I saw old Ismidtwine Some fifty or sixty casks covered with mildew some old pieces of furniture and a great cube of rotting curling parchments showed that this cellar had been more or less loosely used for the occasional storage of superfluous stores and knick knacks It was also more or less loosely used as a domestic prison For in the lane between the region of boxes and the region of bottles near the former there lay on the ground the skeleton of a woman the details of whose costume were still appreciable with thin brass gyves on her wrists and when I had examined her well I knew the whole history of the creature standing silent by my side She is the daughter of the Sultan as I assumed when I had once determined that the skeleton is both the skeleton of her mother and the skeleton of the Sultana That the skeleton was her mother is clear for the cloud occurred just twenty one years since and the dead woman was of course at that moment in the prison which must have been air tight and with her the girl but since the girl is quite certainly not much more than twenty she looks younger she must at that time have been either unborn or a young babe but a babe would hardly be imprisoned with another than its own mother I am rather inclined to think that the girl was unborn at the moment of the cloud and was born in the cellar That the mother was the Sultana is clear from her fragments of dress and the symbolic character of her every ornament crescent earrings heron feather and the blue campaca enamelled in a bracelet This poor woman I have thought may have been the victim of some unbounded fit of imperial passion incurred by some domestic crime real or imagined which may have been pardoned in a day had not death overtaken her master and the world There are four steep stone steps at about the centre of the cellar leading up to a locked iron trap door apparently the only opening into this great hole and this trap door must have been so nearly air tight as to bar the intrusion of the poison in anything like deadly quantity But how rare how strange the coincidence of chances here For if the trap door was absolutely air tight I cannot think that the supply of oxygen in the cellar large as it was would have been sufficient to last the girl twenty years to say nothing of what her mother used up before death for I imagine that the woman must have continued to live some time in her dungeon sufficiently long at least to teach her child to procure its food of dates and wine so that the door must have been only just sufficiently hermetic to bar the poison yet admit some oxygen or else the place may have been absolutely air tight at the time of the cloud and some crack which I have not seen opened to admit oxygen after the poison was dispersed in any case the all but infinite rarity of the chance Thinking these things I climbed out and we walked to Pera where I slept in a great white stone house in five or six acres of garden overlooking the cemetery of Kassim having pointed out to the girl another house in which to sleep This girl what a history After existing twenty years in a sunless world hardly three acres wide she one day suddenly saw the only sky which she knew collapse at one point a hole appeared into yet a world beyond It was I who had come and kindled Constantinople and set her free Ah I see something now I see it was for this that I was preserved I to be a sort of new fangled Adam and this little creature to be my Eve That is it The White does not admit defeat he would recommence the Race again At the last the eleventh hour in spite of all he would turn defeat into victory and outwit that Other However if this be so and I seem to see it quite clearly then in that White scheme is a singular flaw at one point it is obvious that elaborate Forethought fails for I have a free will and I refuse I refuse Certainly in this matter I am on the side of the Black and since it depends absolutely upon me this time Black wins No more men on the earth after me ye Powers To you the question may be nothing more than a gambling excitement as to the final outcome of your aerial squabble but to the poor men who had to bear the wrongs Inquisitions rack rents Waterloos unspeakable horrors it was hard earnest you know Oh the wretchedness the deep deep pain of that bungling ant hill happily wiped out my God My sweetheart Clodagh she was not an ideal being There was a man called Judas who betrayed the gentle Founder of the Christian Faith and there was some Roman king named Galba a horrid dog and there was a French devil Gilles de Raiz and the rest were all much the same much the same Oh no it was not a good race that small infantry which called itself Man and here falling on my knees before God and Satan as I write I swear I swear Never through me shall it spring and fester again I cannot realise her Not at all at all at all If she is out of my sight and hearing ten minutes I fall to doubting her reality If I lose her for half a day all the old feelings resembling certainties come back that I have only been dreaming that this appearance cannot be an actual objective fact of life since the impossible is impossible Seventeen long years seventeen long years of madness To morrow I start for Imbros and whether this girl chooses to follow me or whether she stays behind I will see her from the moment I land no more She must rise very early I who am now regularly on the palace roof at dawn sometimes from between the pavilion curtains of the galleries or from the steps of the telescope kiosk may spy her far down below a dainty microscopic figure generally running about the sward or gazing up in wonder at the palace from the lake edge It is now three months since she came with me to Imbros I left her the first night in that pale yellow house with the two green jalousies facing the beach where there was everything that she would need but I knew that like all the houses there now it leaked profusely and the next day I went down to the curving stair cut through the rock at the back and south of the village climbed and half a mile beyond found that park and villa with gables which I had noted from the sea The villa is almost intact very strongly built of purplish marble though small and very like a Western house with shingles and three gables so that I think it must have been the yali of some Englishman for it contains a number of English books though the only body I saw there was what looked like an Aararat Kurd with spiral string wound down his turban yellow ankle pantaloons and flung red shoulder cloak and all in the heavily wooded park and all about the low rock steps up the hill profusions of man dragora and from the rock steps to the house a narrow long avenue of acacias mossy underfoot that mingle overhead the house standing about four yards from the edge of the perpendicular sea cliff whence one can see the Speranzas main top mast and broken mizzen mast head in her quiet haven After examining the place I went down again to the village and her house but she was not there and two hours long I paced about among the weeds of these amateur little alleys and flat roofed windowless houses though some have terrace roofs and a rare aperture whose once raw yellows greens and blues look now like sunset tints when the last flush is gone and they fade dun When at last she came running with open mouth I took her up the rock steps and into the house and there she has lived one of the gable tips I now find that overlooking the sea being just visible from the north east corner of the palace roof two miles from it That night again when I was leaving her she made an attempt to follow me But I was resolved to end it then and cutting a sassafras whip I cut her deep three times till she ran crying So then what is my fate henceforth to think always from sun to moon and from moon to sun of one only thing and that thing an object for the microscope to become a sneaking Paul Pry to spy upon the silly movements of one little sparrow like some fatuous motiveless gossip of old his occupation to peep his one faculty to scent his honey and his achievement to unearth the infinitely unimportant I would kill her first I am convinced that she is no stay at home but roams continually over the island for thrice wandering myself I have come upon her The first time she was running with flushed face intent upon striking down a butterfly with a twig held in the left hand for both hands she uses with dexterity It was at about nine in the morning in her park near the bottom where there are high grass growths and ferny luxuriance between the close tree trunks and shadow and the broken wall of an old funeral kiosk sunk aslant under moss creepers and wild flowers behind which I peeped hidden and wet with dew She has had the assurance to modify the dress I put upon her and was herself a butterfly for instead of the shintiyan she had on a zouave hardly reaching to the waist of saffron satin no feredje but a scarlet fez with violet tassel and baggy pantaloons of azure silk down her back the long auburn plait quite neat but all her front hair loose and wanton the fez cocked backward while I caught glimpses of her fugitive heels lifting out of the dropping slipper sole She is pretty clever but not clever enough for that butterfly escaped and in one instant I saw her change into weary and sad for on this earth is nothing more fickle than that Proteus face which resembles a landscape swept with cloud shadows on a bright day Fast beat my heart that morning owing to the consciousness that while I saw I was unseen yet might be seen Another noontide three weeks afterwards I came upon her a good way up yonder to the west of the palace sleeping on her arm in an alley between overgrown old trellises where rioting wild vine buried her in gloom but I had not been peeping through the bushes a minute when she started up and looked wildly about her quick consciousness I imagine detecting a presence though I think that I managed to get away unseen She keeps her face very dirty all about her mouth was dry stained with a polychrome of grape murs and other coloured juices like slobbering gamins of old I could also see that her nose and cheeks are now sprinkled with little freckles Four days since I saw her a third time and then found that the primitive instinct to represent the world in pictures has been working in her for she was drawing It was down in the middle one of the three east and west village streets for thither I had strolled toward evening and coming out upon the street from between an old wall and a house saw her quite near I pulled up short and peered She was lying on her face all among grasses a piece of yellow board before her and in her fingers a chalk splinter and very intently she drew her tongue tip travelling along her short upper lip from side to side regularly as a pendulum her fez tipped far back and the left foot swinging upward from the knee She had drawn her yali at the top and now as I could see by peering well forward was drawing underneath the palace from memory for where she lay it is all hidden yet the palace it was for there were the waving lines meant for the steps the two slanting pillars the slanting battlements of the outer court and before the portal with turban reaching above the roof and my two whisks of beard sweeping below the knees myself Something spurred me and I could not resist shouting a sudden Hi whereupon she scrambled like a spring bok to her feet I pointing to the drawing smiling This creature has a way of mincing her pressed lips while she shakes the head intensely cooing a fond laugh and so she did then You are a clever little wretch you know said I she cocking her eye trying to divine my meaning with vague smile Oh yes a clever little wretch I went on in a gruff voice clever as a serpent no doubt for in the first case it was the Black who used the serpent but now it is the White But it will not do you know Do you know what you are to me you You are my Eve a little fool a little piebald frog like you But it will not do at all at all A nice race it would be with you for mother and me for father wouldn t it half criminal like the father half idiot like the mother just like the last in short They used to say in fact that the offspring of a brother and sister was always weak headed and from such a wedlock certainly came the human race so no wonder it was what it was and so it would have to be again now Well no unless we have the children and cut their throats at birth and you would not like that at all I know and on the whole it would not work for the White would be striking a poor man dead with His lightning if I attempted that No then the modern Adam is some eight to twenty thousand years wiser than the first you see less instinctive more rational The first disobeyed by commission I shall disobey by omission only his disobedience was a sin mine is a heroism I have not been a particularly ideal sort of beast so far you know but in me Adam Jeffson I swear it the human race shall at last attain a true nobility the nobility of self extinction I shall turn out trumps I shall prove myself stronger than Tendency World Genius Providence Currents of Fate White Power Black Power or whatever is the name for it No more Clodaghs Lucrezia Borgias Semiramises Pompadours Irish Landlords Hundred Years Wars you see She kept her left eye obliquely cocked like a little fool wondering no doubt what I was saying And talking of Clodagh I went on I shall call you that henceforth to keep me reminded So that is your name not Eve but Clodagh who was a Poisoner you see She poisoned a poor man who trusted her and that is your name now not Eve but Clodagh to remind me you most dangerous little speckled viper And in order that I may no more see your foolish little pretty face I decree that for the future you wear a yashmak to cover up your lips which I can see were meant to be seductive though dirty and you can leave the blue eyes and the little white skinned freckled nose uncovered if you like they being commonplace enough Meantime if you care to see how to draw a palace I will show you Before I stretched my hand she was presenting the board so that she had guessed something of my meaning But some hard tone in my talk had wounded her for she presented it looking very glum her under lip pushing a little obliquely out very pathetically I must say as always when she is just ready to cry In a few strokes I drew the palace and herself standing at the portal between the pillars and now great was her satisfaction for she pointed to the sketched figure and to herself interrogatively and when I nodded yes she went cooing her fond murmurous laugh with pressed and mincing lips and it is clear that in spite of my beatings she is in no way afraid of me Before I could move away I felt some rain drops and down in some seconds rushed a shower I looked saw that the sky was rapidly darkening and ran into the nearest of the little cubical houses leaving her glancing sideways upward with the quaintest artlessness of interest in the downpour for she is not yet quite familiarised with the operations of nature and seems to regard them with a certain amiable inquisitive seriousness as though they were living beings comrades as good as herself She presently joined me but even then stretched her hand out to feel the drops Now there came a thunder clap the wind was rising and rain spattering about me for the panes of these houses made I believe of paper saturated in almond oil have long disappeared and rains penetrating by roof and rare window splash the bones of men I gathered up my skirts to run toward other shelter but she was before me saying in her strange experimental voice that word of hers Come She ran in advance and I with the outer robe over my head followed urging flinching way against the whipped rain wash She took the way by the stone horse pond through an alley to the left between two blind walls then down a steep path through wood to the rock steps and up we ran and along the hill to her yali which is a mile nearer the village than the palace though by the time we pelted into its dry shelter we were wet to the skin Sudden darkness had come but she quickly found some matches lit one looking at it with a certain meditative air and applied it to a candle and to a bronze Western lamp on the table which I had taught her to oil and light Near a Western fire place was a Turkish mangal like one which she had seen me light to warm bath waters in Constantinople and when I pointed to it she ran to the kitchen returned with some chopped wood and very cleverly lit it And there for several hours I sat that night reading the first time for many years it was a book by the poet Milton found in a glazed book case on the other side of the fire place and most strange most novel I found those august words about warring angels that night while the storm raved for this man had evidently taken no end of pains with his book and done it gallantly well too making the thing hum and I could not conceive why he should have been at that trouble unless it were for the same reason that I built the palace because some spark bites a man and he would be like but that is all vanity and delusion Well there is a rage in the storms of late years which really transcends bounds I do not remember if I have noted it in these sheets before but I never could have conceived a turbulence so huge Hour after hour I sat there that night smoking a chibouque reading and listening to the batteries and lamentations of that haunted air shrinking from it fearing even for the Speranza by her quay in the sequestered harbour and for the palace pillars But what astonished me was that girl for after sitting on the ottoman to my left some time she fell sideways asleep not the least fear about her though I should have thought that nervousness at such a turmoil would be so natural to her and whence she has this light confidence in the world into which she has so abruptly come I do not know for it is as though someone inspired her with the mood of nonchalance saying Be of good cheer and care not a pin about anything for God is God I heard the ocean swing hoarse like heavy ordnance against the cliffs below where they meet the outer surface of the southern of the two claws of land that form the harbour and the thought came into my mind If now I taught her to speak to read I could sometimes make her read a book to me The winds seemed wilfully struggling for the house to snatch and wing it away into the drear Eternities of the night and I could not but heave the sigh Alas for us two poor waifs and castaways of our race little bits of flotsam and seaweed hair cast up here a moment ah me on this shore of the Ages soon to be dragged back O turgid Eternity into thy abysmal gorge and upon what strand who shall say shall she next be flung and I divided then perhaps by all the stretch of the trillion distanced astral gulf And such a pity and a wringing of the heart seemed in things that a tear fell from my eyes that ominous midnight She started up at a gust of more appalling volume rubbing her eyes with dishevelled hair it must have been about midnight listening a minute with that demure droll interest of hers to the noise of the elements and then smiled to me rose then left the room and presently returned with a pomegranate and some almonds on a plate also some delicious old sweet wine in a Samian cruche and an old silver cup gilt inside standing in a zarf These she placed on the table near me I murmuring Hospitality She looked at the book which I read as I ate with lowered left eye lid seeking to guess its use I suppose Most things she understands at once but this must have baffled her for to see one looking fixedly at a thing and not know what one is looking at it for must be very disconcerting I held it up before her saying Shall I teach you to read it If I did how would you repay me you Clodagh She cocked her eyes seeking to comprehend God knows at that moment I pitied the poor dumb waif alone in all the whole round earth with me The candle flame moved by the wind like a slow painting brush flickered upon her face though every cranny was closed Perhaps then I said I will teach you You are a pitiable little derelict of your race you know and two hours every day I will let you come to the palace and I will teach you But be sure be careful If there be danger I will kill you assuredly without fail And let me begin with a lesson now say after me White I took her hand and got her to understand that I wanted her to repeat after me White said I Hwhite said she Power said I Pow wer said she White Power said I Hwhite Pow wer said she Shall not said I Sall not said she White Power shall not said I Hwhite Pow wer sall not said she Prevail said I Fffail said she pronouncing the v with a long fluttering f sound Pre vail said I Pe vvvail said she White Power shall not prevail said I Hwhite Pow wer sall not fffail said she A thunder which roared as she said it seemed to me to go laughing through the universe and a minute I looked upon her face with positive shrinking fear till starting up I thrust her with violence from my path and dashed forth to re seek the palace and my bed Such was the ingratitude and fatality which my first attempt four nights since to teach her met with It remains to be seen whether my pity for her dumbness or some servile tendency toward fellowship in myself will result in any further lesson Certainly I think not for though I have given my word the most solemnly pledged word may be broken Surely surely her presence in the world with me for I suppose it is that has wrought some profound changes in my mood for gone now apparently are those turbulent hours when stalking like a peacock I flaunted my monarchy in the face of the Eternal Powers with hissed blasphemies or else dribbled shaking my body in a lewd dance or was off to fire some vast city and revel in redness and the chucklings of Hell or rolled in the drunkenness of drugs It was mere frenzy I see it now it was not good not good And it rather looks as if it were past or almost I have clipped my beard and hair removed the earrings and thought of modifying my attire I will just watch to see whether she comes loitering down there about the gate of the lake Her progress is like It is nine months since I have written on these sheets those words Her progress is like being the beginning of some narrative in which something interrupted me and since then I have had no impulse to write But I was thinking just now of the curious tricks and uncertainties of my memory and seeing the sheets will record it here I have lately been trying to recall the name of a sister of mine some perfectly simple name I know and the name of my old home in England and they have completely passed out of my cognizance though she was my only sister and we grew up closely together some quite simple name I forget it now Yet I can t say that my memory is bad there are things quite unexpected unimportant things which come up in my mind with considerable clearness For instance I remember to have met in Paris I think long before the poison cloud a little Brazilian boy of the colour of weak coffee and milk of whom she now constantly reminds me He wore his hair short like a convict s so that one could spy the fish white flesh beneath and delighted to play solitary about the stairs of the hotel dressed up in the white balloon dress of a Pierrot I have the impression now that he must have had very large ears Clever as a flea he was knowing five or six languages as it were by nature without having any suspicion that that was at all extraordinary She has that same light unconscious and nonchalant cleverness and easy way of life It is little more than a year since I began to teach her and already she can speak English with a quite considerable vocabulary and perfect correctness except that she does not pronounce the letter r she has also read or rather devoured a good many books and can write draw and play the harp And all she does without effort rather with the flighty naturalness with which a bird takes to the wing What made me teach her to read was this One afternoon fourteen months or so ago I from the roof kiosk saw her down at the lake rim a book in hand and as she had seen me looking steadily at books so she was looking steadily at it with pathetic sideward head so that I burst into laughter for I saw her clearly through the glass and whether she is the simplest little fool or the craftiest serpent that ever breathed I am not yet sure If I thought that she has the least design upon my honour it would be ill for her I went to Gallipoli for two days in the month of May and brought back a very pretty little caique a perfect slender crescent of the colour of the moon though I had two days labour in cutting through bush thicket for the passage of the motor in bringing it up to the lake It has pleased me to see her lie among the silk cushions of the middle while I paddling taught her her first words and sentences between the hours of eight and ten in the evening though later they became ten A M to noon when the reading began we sitting on the palace steps before the portal her mouth invariably well covered with the yashmak the lesson book being a large lettered old Bible found at her yali Why she must needs wear the yashmak she has never once asked and how much she divines knows or intends I have no idea continually questioning myself as to whether she is all simplicity or all cunning That she is conscious of some profound difference in our organisation I cannot doubt for that I have a long beard and she none at all is among the most patent of facts I have thought that a certain Western ness a growing modernity of tone may be the result as far as I am concerned of her presence with me I do not know There is the gleam of a lake end just visible in the north forest from the palace top and in it a good number of fish like carp tench roach et cetera so in May I searched for a tackle shop in the Gallipoli Fatmeh bazaar and got four twelve foot rods with reels silk line quill floats a few yards of silk worm gut with a packet of No seven and eight hooks and split shot for sinkers and since red worms maggots and gentles are common on the island I felt sure of a great many more fish than the number I wanted which was none at all However for the mere amusement I fished several times lying at my length in a patch of long grass over waved by an enormous cedar where the bank is steep and the water deep And one mid afternoon she was suddenly there with me questioned me with her eyes and when I consented stayed and presently I said I would teach her bottom angling and sent her flying up to the palace for another rod and tackle That day she did nothing for after teaching her to thread the worm and put the gentles on the smaller hooks I sent her to hunt for worms to chop up for ground baiting the pitch for the next afternoon and when this was done it was dinner time and I sent her home for by then I was giving the reading lessons in the morning The next day I found her at the bank taught her to take the sounding for adjusting the float and she lay down not far from me holding the rod So I said to her Well this is better than living in a dark cellar twenty years with nothing to do but walk up and down sleep and consume dates and Ismidt wine Yes says she Twenty years said I How did you bear it I was not closs says she Did you never suspect that there was a world outside that cellar said I Never says she or lather yes but I did not suppose that it was this world but another where he lived He who He who spoke with me Who was that Oh a bite she screamed gladly I saw her float bob under and started up rushed to her and taught her how to strike and play it though it turned out when landed to be nothing but a tiny barbel but she was in ecstasies holding it on her palm murmuring her fond coo She re baited and we lay again I said But what a life no exit no light no prospect no hope Plenty of hope says she Good Heavens hope of what I knew vely well that something was lipening over the cellar or under or alound it and would come to pass at a certain fixed hour and that I should see it and feel it and it would be vely nice Ah well you had to wait for it at any rate Didn t those twenty years seem long No at least sometimes not often I was always so occupied Occupied in doing what In eating or dlinking or lunning or talking Talking to your self Not myself To whom then To the one who told me when I was hungly and put the dates to satisfy my hunger I see Don t wriggle about in that way or you will never catch any fish The maxim of angling is Study to be quiet O another bite she called and this time all alone very agilely landed a good sized bream But do you mean that you were never sad said I when she was re settled Sometimes I would sit and cly says she I did not know why But if that was sadness I was never miserlable never never And if I clied it did not last long and I would soon fall to sleep for he would lock me in his lap and kiss me and wipe all my tears away He who Why what a question he who told me when I was hungly and of the thing that was lipening outside the cellar which would be so nice I see I see But in all that dingy place and thick gloom were you never at all afraid Aflaid I of what Of the unknown I do not understand you How could I be aflaid The known was the very opposite of tellible it was merely hunger and dates thirst and wine the desire to lun and space to lun in the desire to sleep and sleep there was nothing tellible in that and the unknown was even less tellible than the known for it was the nice thing that was lipening outside the cellar I do not understand Ah yes said I you are a clever little being but your continual fluttering about is fatal to all angling Isn t it in your nature to keep still a minute And with regard now to your habits in the cellar Another she cried with happy laugh and landed a young chub And that afternoon she caught seven and I none Another day I took her from the pitch to one of the kitchens in the village with some of the fish till then always thrown away and taught her cooking for the only cooking implement in the palace is the silver alcohol lamp for coffee and chocolate We both scrubbed the utensils and boil and fry I taught her and the making of a sauce from vinegar bottled olives and the tinned American butter from the Speranza and the boiling of rice mixed with flour for ground baiting our pitch And she at first astonished was soon all deft housewifeliness breathless officiousness and behind my back of her own intuitiveness grated some dry almonds found there and with them sprinkled the fried tench And we ate them sitting on the floor together the first new food I suppose tasted by me for twenty one years nor did I find it disagreeable The next day she came up to the palace reading a book which turned out to be a cookery book in English found at her yali and a week later she appeared out of hours presenting me a yellow earthenware dish containing a mess of gorgeous colours a boiled fish under red peppers bits of saffron a greenish sauce and almonds but I turned her away and would have none of her or her dish About a mile up to the west of the palace is a very old ruin in the deepest forest I think of a mosque though only three truncated internal pillars under ivy and the weedy floor with the courtyard and portal steps remain before it being a long avenue of cedars gently descending from the steps the path between the trees choked with long grass and wild rye reaching to my middle Here I saw one day a large disc of old brass bossed in the middle which may have been either a shield or part of an ancient cymbal with concentric rings graven round it from centre to circumference The next day I brought some nails a hammer a saw and a box of paints from the Speranza and I painted the rings in different colours cut down a slim lime trunk nailed the thin disc along its top and planted it well before the steps for I said I would make a bull s eye and do rifle and revolver practice before it from the avenue And this the next evening I was doing at four hundred feet startling the island it seemed with that unusual noise when up she came peering with enquiring face at which I was very angry because my arm long unused was firing wide but I was too proud to say anything and let her look and soon she understood laughing every time I made a considerable miss till at last I turned upon her saying If you think it so easy you may try She had been wanting to try for she came eagerly to the offer and after I had opened and showed her the mechanism the cartridges and how to shoot I put into her hands one of the Speranza Colt s She took her bottom lip between her teeth shut her left eye vaulted out the revolver like an old shot to the level of her intense right eye and sent a ball through the geometrical centre of the boss However it was a fluke shot for I had the satisfaction of seeing her miss every one of the other five except the last which hit the black That however was three weeks since and now my hitting record is forty per cent and hers ninety six most extraordinary so that it is clear that this creature is the protegee of someone and favouritism is in the world 
6895_96175_000000_000000	train-clean-360	Her book of books is the Old Testament 
none	none	Sometimes at noon or afternoon I may look abroad from the roof or galleries and see a remote figure sitting on the sward under the shade of plane or black cypress and I always know that the book she cons there is the Bible like an old Rabbi She has a passion for stories and there finds a store 
6895_96175_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Three nights since when it was pretty late and the moon very splendid I saw her passing homewards close to the lake and shouted down to her meaning to say Good night but she thought that I had called her and came and sitting out on the top step we talked for hours she without the yashmak 
6895_96175_000002_000000	train-clean-360	We fell to talking about the Bible 
none	none	And says she What did Cain to Abel
6895_96175_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 He knocked him over I replied liking sometimes to use such idioms with the double object of teaching and perplexing her 
6895_96175_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Over what says she 
none	none	Over his heels said I
6895_96175_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not complehend 
6895_96175_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 He killed him then 
none	none	That I know 
6895_96175_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But how did Abel feel when he was killed 
none	none	What is it to be killed
6895_96175_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said I you have seen bones all around you and the bones of your mother and you can feel the bones in your fingers 
none	none	Your fingers will become mere bone after you are dead as die you must Those bones which you see around you are of course the bones of the men of whom we often speak and the same thing happened to them which happens to a fish or a butterfly when you catch them and they lie all still
6895_96175_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 And the men and the butterfly feel the same after they are dead 
none	none	Precisely the same They lie in a deep drowse and dream a nonsense dream That is not dleadful I thought that it was much more dleadful I should not mind dying
6895_96175_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah so much the better for it is possible that you may have to die a great deal sooner than you think 
none	none	I should not mind Why were men so vely aflaid to die
6895_96175_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Because they were all such shocking cowards 
6895_96175_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh not all 
6895_96175_000016_000001	train-clean-360	not all 
none	none	not all This girl I know not with what motive has now definitely set herself up against me as the defender of the dead race 
6895_96175_000017_000001	train-clean-360	With every chance she is at it 
6895_96175_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Nearly all said I tell me one who was not afraid 
6895_96175_000041_000001	train-clean-360	tell me 
none	none	one who was not afraid
6895_96175_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 There was Isaac says she when Ablaham laid him on the wood to kill him he did not jump up and lun to hide 
none	none	Isaac was a great exception said I in the Bible and such books you understand you read of only the best sorts of people but there were millions and millions of others especially about the time of the poison cloud on a very much lower level putrid wretches covetous false murderous mean selfish debased hideous diseased making the earth a very charnel of festering vices and crimes 
6895_96175_000021_000000	train-clean-360	This for several minutes she did not answer sitting with her back half toward me cracking almonds continually striking one step with the ball of her outstretched foot 
6895_96175_000021_000001	train-clean-360	In the clarid gold of the platform I saw her fez and corals reflected as an elongated blotch of florid red 
6895_96175_000021_000002	train-clean-360	She turned and drank some wine from the great gold Jarvan goblet which I had brought from the temple of Boro Budor her head quite covered in by it Then the little hairs at her lip corners still wet says she 
none	none	Vices and climes climes and vices 
6895_96175_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Always the same 
none	none	What were these climes and vices
6895_96175_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Robberies of a hundred sorts murders of ten hundred 
none	none	But what made them do them
6895_96175_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Their evil nature their base souls 
none	none	But you are one of them I am another yet you and I live here together and we do no vices and climes 
6895_96175_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Her astounding shrewdness 
6895_96175_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Right into the inmost heart of a matter does her simple wit seem to pierce 
none	none	No I said we do no vices and crimes because we lack motive There is no danger that we should hate each other for we have plenty to eat and drink dates wines and thousands of things Our danger is rather the other way But they hated and schemed because they were very numerous and there arose a question among them of dates and wine Was there not then enough land to grow dates and wine for all There was yes much more than enough I fancy But some got hold of a vast lot of it and as the rest felt the pinch of scarcity there arose naturally a pretty state of things including the vices and crimes
6895_96175_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah but then says she it was not to their bad souls that the vices and climes were due but only to this question of land 
none	none	It is certain that if there had been no such question there would have been no vices and climes because you and I who are just like them do no vices and climes here where there is no such question 
6895_96175_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The clear limelight of her intelligence 
6895_96175_000032_000001	train-clean-360	She wriggled on her seat in her effort of argument 
6895_96175_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not going to argue the matter I said 
none	none	There was that question of dates and wine you see 
6895_96175_000033_000002	train-clean-360	And there always must be on an earth where millions of men with varying degrees of cunning reside 
none	none	Oh not at all necessalily she cries with conviction not at all at all since there are much more dates and wine than are enough for all If there should spling up more men now having the whole wisdom science and expelience of the past at their hand and they made an allangement among themselves that the first man who tlied to take more than he could work for should be killed and sent to dleam a nonsense dleam the question could never again alise It arose before it would arise again But no I can guess clearly how it alose before it alose thlough the sheer carelessness of the first men The land was at first so vely vely much more than enough for all that the men did not take the tlouble to make an allangement among themselves and afterwards the habit of carelessness was confirmed till at last the vely oliginal carelessness must have got to have the look of an allangement and so the stleam which began in a little long ended in a big long the long glowing more and more fixed and fatal as the stleam lolled further flom the source 
6895_96175_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I see it clearly can t you 
6895_96175_000036_000003	train-clean-360	But now if some more men would spling they would be taught 
none	none	Ah but no more men will spling you see
6895_96175_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 There is no telling 
6895_96175_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I sometimes feel as if they must and shall 
none	none	The tlees blossom the thunder lolls the air makes me lun and leap the glound is full of lichness and I hear the voice of the Lord God walking all among the tlees of the folests As she said this I saw her under lip push out and tremble as when she is near to crying and her eyes moisten but a moment after she looked at me full and smiled so mobile is her face and as she looked it suddenly struck me what a noble temple of a brow the creature has almost pointed at the uplifted summit and widening down like a bell curved Gothic arch draped in strings of frizzy hair which anon she shakes backward with her head
6895_96175_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Clodagh I said after some minutes do you know why I called you Clodagh 
none	none	No Tell me
6895_96175_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Because once long ago before the poison cloud I had a lover called Clodagh and she was a

6895_96175_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Well by their faces 
6895_96175_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 But there must have been many faces all alike 
6895_96175_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Not all alike 
none	none	Each was different from the rest
6895_96175_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Still it must have been vely clever to tell 
none	none	I can hardly conceive any face except yours and mine Ah because you are a little goose you see
6895_96175_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 What was a goose like 
6895_96175_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 It was a thing like a butterfly only larger and it kept its toes always spread out with a skin stretched between

6895_96175_000051_000001	train-clean-360	How caplicious 
6895_96175_000051_000002	train-clean-360	And am I like that but what were you saying that your lover Clodagh was 
none	none	She was a Poisoner Then why call me Clodagh since I am not a poisoner I call you so to remind me lest you lest you should become my lover too I am your lover already for I love you
6895_96175_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 What girl 
none	none	Do I not love you who are mine
6895_96175_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Come come don t be a little maniac I went 
none	none	Clodagh was a poisoner
6895_96175_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Why did she poison 
6895_96175_000059_000001	train-clean-360	Had she not enough dates and wine 
6895_96175_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 She had yes but she wanted more more more the silly idiot 
none	none	So that the vices and climes were not confined to those that lacked things but were done by the others too
6895_96175_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 By the others chiefly 
none	none	Then I see how it was
6895_96175_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 How was it 
none	none	The others had got spoiled 
6895_96175_000065_000001	train-clean-360	The vices and climes must have begun with those who lacked things and then the others always seeing vices and climes alound them began to do them too as when one rotten olive is in a bottle the whole mass soon becomes collupted but originally they were not rotten but only became so 
6895_96175_000065_000002	train-clean-360	And all though a little carelessness at the first 
none	none	I am sure that if more men could spling now But I told you didn t I that no more men will spring 
6895_96175_000066_000001	train-clean-360	You understand Clodagh that originally the earth produced men by a long process beginning with a very low type of creature and continually developing it until at last a man stood up 
none	none	But that can never happen again for the earth is old old and has lost her producing vigour now So talk no more of men splinging and of things which you do not understand 
6895_96175_000066_000003	train-clean-360	Instead go inside stop I will tell you a secret to day in the wood I picked some musk roses and wound them into a wreath meaning to give them you for your head when you came to morrow and it is inside on the pearl tripod in the second room to the left go therefore and put it on and bring the harp and play to me my dear 
6895_96175_000067_000000	train-clean-360	She ran quick with a little cry and coming again sat crowned incarnadine in the blushing depths of the gold 
none	none	Nor did I send her home to her lonely yali till the pale and languished moon weary of all night beatitudes sank down soft couched in quilts of curdling opals to the Hesperian realms of her rest So sometimes we speak together she and I she and I That ever I should write such a thing I am driven out from Imbros I was walking up in a wood yesterday to the west it was a calm clear evening about seven the sun having just set I had the book in which I have written so far in my hand for I had thought of making a sketch of an old windmill to the north west to show her Twenty minutes before she had been with me for I had chanced to meet her and she had come but kept darting on ahead after peeping fruit gathering armfuls of amaranth nenuphar and red berried asphodel till weary of my life I had called to her Go away out of my sight and she with suddenly pushed under lip had walked off Well I was continuing my stroll when I seemed to feel some quaking of the ground and before one could count twenty it was as if the island was bent upon wracking itself to pieces My first thought was of her and in great scare I went running calling in the direction which she had gone staggering as on the deck of some labouring ship falling picking myself up running again The air was quite full of uproar and the land waving like the sea and as I went plunging not knowing whither I saw to my right some three or four acres of forest droop and sink into a gulf which opened to receive them Up I flung my arms crying out Good God save the girl and a minute later rushed out to my surprise into open space on a hill side On the lower ground I could see the palace and beyond it a small space of white sea which had the awful appearance of being higher than the land Down the hill side I staggered driven by the impulse to fly somewhither but about half way down was startled afresh by a shrill pattering like musical hail and the next moment saw the entire palace rush with the jangling clatter of a thousand bells into the heaving lake Some seconds after this the earthquake having lasted fully ten minutes began to lull and soon ceased I found her an hour later standing among the ruins of her little yali Well what a thing Probably every building on the island has been destroyed the palace platform all cracked leans half sunken askew into the lake like a huge stranded ark while of the palace itself no trace remains except a mound of gold stones emerging above the lake to the south Gone gone sixteen years of vanity and vexation But from a practical point of view what is a worst calamity of all is that the Speranza now lies high and dry in the village for she was bodily picked up from the quay by the tidal wave and driven bow foremost into a street not half her width and there now lies looking huge enough in the little village wedged for ever smashed in at the nip like a frail match box a most astonishing spectacle her bows forty feet up the street ten feet above the ground at the stem rudder resting on the inner edge of the quay foremast tilted forward the other two masts all right and that bottom which has passed through seas so far buried in every sort of green and brown seaweed the old Speranza Her steps were there and by a slight leap I could catch them underneath and go up hand over hand till I got foothold this I did at ten the same night when the sea water had mostly drained back from the land leaving everything very swampy however she there with me and soon following me upon the ship I found most things cracked into tiny fragments twisted disfigured out of likeness the house walls themselves displaced a little at the nip the bow of the cedar skiff smashed in to her middle against the aft starboard corner of the galley and were it not for the fact that the air pinnace had not broken from her heavy ropings and one of the compasses still whole I do not know what I should have done for the four old water logged boats in the cove have utterly disappeared I made her sleep on the cabin floor amid the debris of berth and everything and I myself slept high up in the wood to the west I am writing now lying in the long grass the morning after the sun rising though I cannot see him My plan for to day is to cut three or four logs with the saw lay them on the ground by the ship lower the pinnace upon them so get her gradually down into the water and by evening bid a long farewell to Imbros which drives me out in this way Still I look forward with pleasure to our hour s run to the Mainland when I shall teach her to steer by the compass and manipulate liquid air as I have taught her to dress to talk to cook to write to think to live For she is my creation this creature as it were a rib from my side But what is the design of this expulsion And what was it that she called it last night this new going out flom Halan Haran I believe being the place from which Abraham went out when called by God We apparently felt only the tail of the earthquake at Imbros for it has ravaged Turkey And we two poor helpless creatures put down here in the theatre of all these infinite violences it is too bad too bad For the rages of Nature at present are perfectly astonishing and what it may come to I do not know When we came to the Macedonian coast in good moonlight we sailed along it and up the Dardanelles looking out for village yali or any habitation where we might put up but everything has apparently been wrecked We saw Kilid Bahr Chanak Kaleh Gallipoli Lapsaki in ruins at the last place I landed leaving her in the boat and walked a little way but soon went back with the news that there was not even a bazaar arch left standing whole in most parts even the line of the streets being obliterated for the place had fallen like a house of dice and had then been shaken up and jumbled Finally we slept in a forest on the other side of the strait beyond Gallipoli taking our few provisions and having to wade at some points through morass a foot deep before we reached dry woodland Here the next morning I sat alone for we had slept separated by at least half a mile thinking out the question of whither I should go my choice would have been to remain either in the region where I was or to go Eastward but the region where I was offered no dwelling that I could see and to go any distance Eastward I needed a ship Of ships I had seen during the night only wrecks nor did I know where to find one in all these latitudes I was thus like her Ablaham urged Westward In order then to go Westward I first went a little further Eastward once more entered the Golden Horn and once more mounted the scorched Seraglio steps Here what the wickedness of man had spared the wickedness of Nature had destroyed and the few houses which I had left standing round the upper part of Pera I now saw low as the rest also the house near the Suleimanieh where we had lived our first days to which I went as to a home I found without a pillar standing and that night she slept under the half roof of a little funeral kiosk in the scorched cypress wood of Eyoub and I a mile away at the edge of the forest where first I saw her The next morning having met as agreed at the site of the Prophet s mosque we traversed together the valley and cemetery of Kassim by the quagmires up to Pera all the landscape having to me a rather twisted unfamiliar aspect We had determined to spend the morning in searching for supplies among the earthquake ruins of Pera and as I had decided to collect sufficient in one day to save us further pains for some time we passed a good many hours in this task I confining myself to the great white house in the park overlooking Kassim where I had once slept losing myself in the huge obliquities of its floors roofs and wall fragments she going to the old Mussulman quarter of Djianghir near on the heights of Taxim where were many shops and thence round the brow of the hill to the great French Embassy house overlooking Foundoucli and the sea both of us having large Persian carpet bags and all in the air of that wilderness of ruin that morning a sweet strong permanent odour of maple blossom We met toward evening she quivering under such a load that I would not let her carry it but abandoned my day s labour which was lighter and took hers which was quite enough we went back Westward seeking all the while some shelter from the saturating night dews of this place and nothing could we find till we came again quite late to her broken funeral kiosk at the entrance to the immense cemetery avenue of Eyoub There without a word I left her among the shattered catafalques for I was weary but having gone some distance turned back thinking that I might take some more raisins from the bag and after getting them said to her shaking her little hand where she sat under the roof shadow on a stone Good night Clodagh She did not answer promptly and her answer to my surprise was a protest against her name for a rather sulky yet gentle voice came from the darkness saying I am not a Poisoner Well said I all right tell me whatever you like that I should call you and henceforth I will call you that Call me Eve says she Well no said I not Eve anything but that for my name is Adam and if I called you Eve that would be simply absurd and we do not want to be ridiculous in each other s eyes But I will call you anything else that you like Call me Leda says she And why Leda said I Because Leda sounds something like Clodagh says she and you are al leady in the habit of calling me Clodagh and I saw the name Leda in a book and liked it but Clodagh is most hollible most bitterly hollible Well then said I Leda it shall be and I shan t forget for I like it too and it suits you and you ought to have a name beginning with an L Good night my dear sleep well and dream dream And to you too my God give dleams of peace and pleasantness says she and I went And it was only when I had lain myself upon leaves for my bed my head on my caftan a rill for my lullaby and two stars which alone I could see out of the heavenful for my watch lights and only when my eyes were already closed toward slumber that a sudden strong thought pierced and woke me for I remembered that Leda was the name of a Greek woman who had borne twins In fact I should not be surprised if this Greek word Leda is the same word etymologically as the Hebrew Eve for I have heard of v s and b s and d s interchanging about in this way and if Di meaning God or Light and Bi meaning Life and Io v e and Iho v ah and Go d meaning much the same are all one that would be nothing astonishing to me as wi d ow and veu v e are one and where it says truly the Light is Good tob b on this is as if it said truly the Di is Di Such at any rate is the fatality that attends me even in the smallest things for this Western Eve or Greek Leda had twins 
8394-96177-0000	train-other-500	Well the next morning we crossed by the ruins of old Greek Phanar across the triple Stamboul wall which still showed its deep ivied portal and made our way not without climbing along the Golden Horn to the foot of the Old Seraglio where I soon found signs of the railway
8394-96177-0001	train-other-500	And that minute commenced our journey across Turkey Bulgaria Servia Bosnia Croatia to Trieste occupying no day or two as in old times but four months a long drawn nightmare
8394-96177-0002	train-other-500	though a nightmare of rich happiness if one may say so leaving on the memory a vague vast impression of monstrous ravines ever succeeding profundities heights and greatnesses jungles strange as some moon struck poet s fantasy
8394-96177-0003	train-other-500	everlasting glooms and a sound of mighty unseen rivers cataracts and slow cumbered rills whose bulrushes never see the sun with largesse everywhere secrecies profusions the unimaginable the unspeakable
8394-96177-0004	train-other-500	a savagery most lush and fierce and gaudy and vales of Arcadie and remote mountain peaks and tarns shy as old buried treasure
none	none	 and glaciers and we two human folk pretty small and drowned and lost in all that amplitude 
8394-96177-0005	train-other-500	yet moving always through it We followed the lines that first day till we came to a steam train and I found the engine fairly good and everything necessary to move it at my hand
8394-96177-0006	train-other-500	but the metals in such a condition of twisted broken vaulted and buried confusion due to the earthquake that having run some hundreds of yards to examine them I saw that nothing could be done in that way
8394-96177-0007	train-other-500	At first this threw me into a condition like despair for what we were to do I did not know but after persevering on foot for four days along the deep rusted track which is of that large gauge type peculiar to Eastern Europe
8394-96177-0008	train-other-500	I began to see that there were considerable sound stretches and took heart I had with me land charts and compass but nothing for taking altitude observations for the Speranza instruments except one compass had all been broken up by her shock
none	none	 However on getting to the town of Silivri about thirty miles from our start 
8394-96177-0009	train-other-500	I saw in the ruins of a half standing bazaar shop a number of brass objects and there found several good sextants quadrants and theodolites Two mornings later we came upon an engine in mid country with coals in it and a stream near
8394-96177-0010	train-other-500	I had a goat skin of almond oil in the bag and found the machinery serviceable after an hour s careful inspection having examined the boiler with a candle through the manhole and removed the autoclaves of the heaters All was red with rust
8394-96177-0011	train-other-500	and the shaft of the connecting rod in particular seemed so frail that at one moment I was very dubious I decided however and except for a slight leakage at the tubulure which led the steam to the valve chest all went very well
8394-96177-0012	train-other-500	at a pressure never exceeding three and a half atmospheres we travelled nearly a hundred and twenty miles before being stopped by a head to head block on the line when we had to abandon our engine we then continued another seven miles a foot
8394-96177-0013	train-other-500	I all the time mourning my motor which I had had to leave at Imbros and hoping at every townlet to find a whole one but in vain It was wonderful to see the villages and towns going back to the earth
8394-96177-0014	train-other-500	already invaded by vegetation and hardly any longer breaking the continuity of pure Nature the town now as much the country as the country and that which is not Man becoming all in all with a certain furore of vigour
8394-96177-0015	train-other-500	A whole day in the southern gorges of the Balkan Mountains the slow train went tearing its way through many a mile of bind weed tendrils a continuous curtain flaming with large flowers
8394-96177-0016	train-other-500	but sombre as the falling shades of night rather resembling jungles of Ceylon and the Filipinas and she that day lying in the single car behind where I had made her a little yatag bed from Tatar Bazardjik continually played the kittur
8394-96177-0017	train-other-500	barely touching the strings and crooning low low in her rich contralto eternally the same air over and over again crooning crooning some melancholy tune of her own dreaming
none	none	 just audible to me through the slow travailing monotony of the engine till I was drunken with so sweet a woe 
8394-96177-0018	train-other-500	my God a woe that was sweet as life and a dolour that lulled like nepenthe and a grief that soothed like kisses so sweet so sweet that all that world of wood and gloom lost locality and realness for me
8394-96177-0019	train-other-500	and became nothing but a charmed and pensive Heaven for her to moan and lullaby in and from between my fingers streamed plenteous tears that day
none	none	 and all that I could keep on mourning was O Leda O Leda O Leda 
8394-96177-0020	train-other-500	till my heart was near to break The feed pump eccentric shaft of this engine which was very poor and flaky suddenly gave out about five in the afternoon and I had to stop in a hurry
8394-96177-0021	train-other-500	and that sweet invisible mechanism which had crooned and crooned about my ears in the air and followed me whithersoever I went stopped too Down she jumped calling out Well I had a plesentiment that something would happen and I am so glad for I was tired
none	none	 Seeing that nothing could be done with the feed water pump I got down took the bag and parting before us the continuous screen 
8394-96177-0022	train-other-500	we went pioneering to the left between a rock cleft stepping over large stones that looked black with moss growths no sky but hundreds of feet of impenetrable leafage overhead and everywhere the dew dabbled profusion of dim ferneries
8394-96177-0023	train-other-500	dishevelled maidenhairs mixed with a large leaved mimosa wild vine white briony and a smell of cedar
none	none	 and a soft rushing of perpetual waters that charmed the gloaming 
8394-96177-0024	train-other-500	The way led slightly upwards three hundred feet and presently after some windings and the climbing of five huge steps almost regular yet obviously natural the gorge opened in a roundish space fifty feet across with far overhanging edges
8394-96177-0025	train-other-500	seven hundred feet high and there behind a curtain which fell from above its tendrils defined and straight like a Japanese bead hanging we spread the store of foods I opening the wines fruits vegetables and meats
8394-96177-0026	train-other-500	she arranging them in order with the gold plate and lighting both the spirit lamp and the lantern for here it was quite dark Near us behind the curtain of tendrils was a small green cave in the rock and at its mouth a pool two yards wide
8394-96177-0027	train-other-500	a black and limpid water that leisurely wheeled discharging a little rivulet from the cave and in it I saw three owl eyed fish a finger long loiter and spur themselves and gaze Leda who cannot be still in tongue or limb
none	none	 chattered in her glib baby manner as we ate 
8394-96177-0028	train-other-500	and then after smoking a cigarette said that she would go and lun and went and left me darkling for she is the sun and the moon and the host of the stars
none	none	 I occupying myself that night in making a calendar at the end of this book in which I have written 
8394-96177-0029	train-other-500	for my almanack and many things that I prized were lost with the palace making a calendar counting the days in my head but counting them across my thoughts of her She came again to tell me good night and then went down to the train to sleep
8394-96177-0030	train-other-500	and I put out the lantern and stooped within the cave and made my simple couch beside the little rivulet and slept But a fitful sleep and soon again I woke
8394-96177-0031	train-other-500	and a long time I lay so gradually becoming conscious of a slow dripping at one spot in the cave for at a minute s interval it darkly splashed regularly very deliberately and it seemed to grow always louder and sadder
8394-96177-0032	train-other-500	and the splash at first was Leesha but it became Leda to my ears and it sobbed her name and I pitied myself so sad was I And when I could no longer bear the anguished melancholy of its spasm and its sobbing I arose and went softly
8394-96177-0033	train-other-500	softly lest she should hear in that sounding silence of the hushed and darksome night going more slow more soft as I went nearer a sob in my throat my feet leading me to her till I touched the carriage
8394-96177-0034	train-other-500	And against it a long time I leant my clammy brow a sob aching in my poor throat and she all mixed up in my head with the suspended hushed night and with the elfin things in the air that made the silence so musically a sound to the vacant ear drum
8394-96177-0035	train-other-500	and with the dripping splash in the cave And softly I turned the door handle and heard her breathe in Asleep her head near me and I touched her hair with my lips and close to her ear I said for I heard her breathe as if in sleep
none	none	 Little Leda I have come to you for I could not help it 
8394-96177-0036	train-other-500	Leda and oh my heart is full of the love of you for you are mine and I am yours and to live with you till we die and after we are dead to be near you still Leda with my broken heart near your heart little Leda
8394-96177-0037	train-other-500	I must have sobbed I think for as I spoke close at her ears with passionately dying eyes of love I was startled by an irregularity in her breathing and with cautious hurry I shut the door and quite back to the cave I stole in haste
none	none	 And the next morning when we met I thought but am not now sure that she smiled singularly 
8394-96177-0038	train-other-500	I thought so She may she may have heard But I cannot tell Twice I was obliged to abandon engines on account of forest tree obstructions right across the line which do what I might I could not move
8394-96177-0039	train-other-500	and these were the two bitterest incidents of the pilgrimage and at least thirty times I changed from engine to engine when other trains blocked As for the extent of the earthquake it is pretty certain that it was universal over the Peninsula and at many points exhibited extreme violence
8394-96177-0040	train-other-500	for up to the time that we entered upon Servian territory we occasionally came upon stretches of the lines so dislocated that it was impossible to proceed upon them and during the whole course I never saw one intact house or castle four times
8394-96177-0041	train-other-500	where the way was of a nature to permit of it I left the imbedded metals and made the engine travel the ground till I came upon other metals
none	none	 when I always succeeded in driving it upon them 
8394-96177-0042	train-other-500	It was all very leisurely for not everywhere nor every day could I get a nautical observation and having at all times to go at low pressures for fear of tube and boiler weakness crawling through tunnels and stopping when total darkness came on we did not go fast
8394-96177-0043	train-other-500	nor much cared to Once moreover for three days and once for four we were overtaken by hurricanes of such vast inclemency that no thought of travelling entered our heads
8394-96177-0044	train-other-500	our only care being to hide our poor cowering bodies as deeply and darkly as possible Once I passed through a city Adrianople doubly devastated once by the hellish arson of my own hand and once by the earthquake
none	none	 and I made haste to leave that place behind me Finally 
8394-96177-0045	train-other-500	three months and twenty seven days from the date of the earthquake having traversed only nine hundred odd English miles I let go in the Venice lagoon in the early morning of the tenth September the lateen sail and stone anchor of a Maltese speronare
none	none	 which I had found and partially cleaned at Trieste 
8394-96177-0046	train-other-500	and thence I passed up the Canalazzo in a gondola For I said to Leda
none	none	 In Venice will I pitch my Patriarch tent But to will and to do are not the same thing and still further Westward was I driven For the stagnant upper canals of this place are now mere miasmas of pestilence and within two days I was rolling with fever in the Old Procurazie Palace 
8394-96177-0047	train-other-500	she standing in pale wonderment at my bed side sickness quite a novel thing to her and indeed this was my first serious illness since my twentieth year or thereabouts when I had over worked my brain and went a voyage to Constantinople
8394-96177-0048	train-other-500	I could not move from bed for some weeks but happily did not lose my senses and she brought me the whole pharmacopoeia from the shops from which to choose my medicines
none	none	 I guessed the cause of this illness though not a sign of it came near her 
8394-96177-0049	train-other-500	and as soon as my trembling knees could bear me I again set out always Westward enjoying now a certain luxury in travelling compared with that Turkish difficulty for here were no twisted metals more and better engines
8394-96177-0050	train-other-500	in the cities as many good petrol motors as I chose and Nature markedly less savage I do not know why I did not stop at Verona or Brescia or some other neighbourhood of the Italian lakes since I was fond of water but I had I think
none	none	 the thought in my head to return to Vauclaire in France where I had lived and there live 
8394-96177-0051	train-other-500	for I thought that she might like those old monks At all events we did not remain long in any place till we came to Turin where we spent nine days she in the house opposite mine and after that at her own suggestion
none	none	 went on still passing by train into the valley of the Isere 
8394-96177-0052	train-other-500	and then into that of the Western Rhone till we came to the old town of Geneva among some very great mountains peaked with snow the town seated at the head of a long lake which the earth has made in the shape of the crescent moon
8394-96177-0053	train-other-500	and like the moon it is a thing of much beauty and many moods suggesting a creature under the spell of charms and magics However with this idea of Vauclaire still in my head
none	none	 we left Geneva in the motor which had brought us at four in the afternoon of the seventeenth May 
8394-96177-0054	train-other-500	I intending to reach the town called Bourg that night about eight and there sleep
none	none	 so to go on to Lyons the next morning by train 
8394-96177-0055	train-other-500	and so by the Bordeaux route make Vauclaire But by some chance for which I cannot to this hour account unless the rain was the cause I missed the chart road which should have been fairly level and found myself on mountain tracks
8394-96177-0056	train-other-500	unconscious of my whereabouts while darkness fell and a windless downpour that had a certain sullen venom in its superabundance drenched us I stopped several times looking about for chateau chalet or village but none did I see
none	none	 though I twice came upon railway lines and not till midnight did we run down a rather steep pass upon the shore of a lake which from its apparent vastness in the moonless obscurity I could only suppose to be the Lake of Geneva once again About two hundred yards to the left we saw through the rain a large pile 
8394-96177-0057	train-other-500	apparently risen straight out of the lake looking ghostly livid for it was of white stone not high but an old thing of complicated white little turrets roofed with dark red candle extinguishers and oddities of Gothic nooks window slits and outline
8394-96177-0058	train-other-500	very like a fanciful picture Round to this we went drowned as rats
none	none	 Leda sighing and bedraggled and found a narrow spit of low land projecting into the lake where we left the car walked forward with the bag crossed a small wooden drawbridge and came upon a rocky island with a number of thick foliaged trees about the castle 
8394-96177-0059	train-other-500	We quickly found a small open portal and went throughout the place quite gay at the shelter everywhere lighting candles which we found in iron sconces in the rather queer apartments
8394-96177-0060	train-other-500	so that as the castle is far seen from the shores of the lake it would have appeared to one looking thence a place suddenly possessed and haunted We found beds and slept
none	none	 and the next day it turned out to be the antique Castle of Chillon 
8394-96177-0061	train-other-500	where we remained five long and happy months till again again Fate overtook us The morning after our coming we had breakfast our last meal together
8394-96177-0062	train-other-500	on the first floor in a pentagonal room approached from a lower level by three little steps In it is a ponderous oak table pierced with a multitude of worm eaten tunnels also three mighty high backed chairs
8394-96177-0063	train-other-500	an old oak desk covered still with papers arras on the walls and three dark religious oil paintings and a grandfathers clock
none	none	 it is at about the middle of the chateau and contains two small but deep three faced oriels 
8394-96177-0064	train-other-500	in each face four compartments with white stone shafts between these looking south upon shrubs and the rocky edge of the island then upon the deep blue lake then upon another tiny island containing four trees in a jungle of flowers
8394-96177-0065	train-other-500	then upon the shore of the lake interrupted by the mouths of a river which turned out to be the Rhone then upon a white town on the slopes which turned out to be Villeneuve then upon the great mountains back of Bouveret and saint Gingolph
none	none	 all having the surprised air of a resurrection just completed 
8394-96177-0066	train-other-500	everything new washed in dyes of azure ultramarine indigo snow emerald that fresh morning so that one had to call it the best and holiest place in the world
8394-96177-0067	train-other-500	These five old room walls and oak floor and two oriels became specially mine though it was really common ground to us both and there I would do many little things
8394-96177-0068	train-other-500	The papers on the desk told that it had been the bureau of one R E Gaud Grand Bailli whose residence the place no doubt had been She asked me while eating that morning to stay here
none	none	 and I said that I would see though with misgiving so together we went all about the house and finding it unexpectedly spacious I consented to stop 
8394-96177-0069	train-other-500	At both ends are suites mostly small rooms infinitely quaint and cosy
none	none	 furnished with heavy Henri Quatre 
8394-96177-0070	train-other-500	furniture and bed draperies and there are separate and as it were secret spiral stairs for exit to each so we decided that she should have the suite overlooking the length of the lake the mouths of the Rhone
none	none	 Bouveret and Villeneuve 
8394-96177-0071	train-other-500	and I should have that overlooking the spit of land behind and the little drawbridge shore cliffs and elmwood which comes down to the shore
none	none	 giving at one point a glimpse of the diminutive hamlet of Chillon and that decided I took her hand in mine and I said 
8394-96177-0072	train-other-500	Well then here we stay both under the same roof for the first time
none	none	 Leda I will not explain why to you but it is dangerous so much so that it may mean the death of one or other of us deadly deadly 
8394-96177-0073	train-other-500	dangerous my poor girl You do not understand but that is the fact believe me for I know it very well and I would not tell you false Well then you will easily comprehend that this being so you must never on any account come near my part of the house
8394-96177-0074	train-other-500	nor will I come near yours Lately we have been very much together but then we have been active full of purpose and occupation here we shall be nothing of the kind I can see You do not understand at all but things are so
8394-96177-0075	train-other-500	We must live perfectly separate lives then You are nothing to me really nor I to you only we live on the same earth which is nothing at all a mere chance Your own food clothes and everything that you want you will procure for yourself
8394-96177-0076	train-other-500	it is perfectly easy the shores are crowded with mansions castles towns and villages and I will do the same for myself The motor down there I set apart for your private use if I want another I will get one and to day I will set about looking you up a boat
8394-96177-0077	train-other-500	and fishing tackle and cut a cross on the bow of yours so that you may know yours and never use mine All this is very necessary you cannot dream how much but I know how much Do not run any risks in climbing
8394-96177-0078	train-other-500	now or with the motor or in the boat little Leda I saw her under lip push and I turned away in haste for I did not care whether she cried or not In that long voyage and in my illness at Venice she had become too near and dear to me
8394-96177-0079	train-other-500	my tender love my dear darling soul and I said in my heart I will be a decent being I will turn out trumps Under this castle is a sort of dungeon not narrow nor very dark in which are seven stout dark grey pillars
8394-96177-0080	train-other-500	and an eighth half built into the wall and one of them which has an iron ring as well as the ground around it is all worn away by some prisoner or prisoners once chained there and in the pillar the word Byron engraved
none	none	 This made me remember that a poet of that name had written something about this place 
8394-96177-0081	train-other-500	and two days afterwards I actually came upon three volumes of the poet in a room containing a great number of books many of them English near the Grand Bailli s bureau and in one I read the poem
none	none	 which is called The Prisoner of Chillon 
8394-96177-0082	train-other-500	I found it very affecting and the description good only I saw no seven rings and where he speaks of the pale and livid light he should speak rather of the dun and brownish gloom for the word light disconcerts the fancy
none	none	 and of either pallor or blue there is there no sign 
8394-96177-0083	train-other-500	However I was so struck by the horror of man s cruelty to man as depicted in this poem that I determined that she should see it went up straight to her rooms with the book and she being away ferreted among her things to see what she was doing finding all very neat
8394-96177-0084	train-other-500	except in one room where were a number of prints called La Mode and debris of snipped cloth and medley When after two hours she came in and I suddenly presented myself Oh she let slip and then fell to cooing her laugh
8394-96177-0085	train-other-500	and I took her down through a big room stacked with every kind of rifle with revolvers cartridges powder swords bayonets evidently some official or cantonal magazine
none	none	 and then showed her the worn stone in the dungeon 
8394-96177-0086	train-other-500	the ring the narrow deep slits in the wall and I told the tale of cruelty while the splashing of the lake upon the rock outside was heard with a strange and tragic sound and her mobile face was all one sorrow
none	none	 How cruel they must have been cries she with tremulous lip her face at the same time reddened with indignation 
8394-96177-0087	train-other-500	They were mere beastly monsters said I it is nothing surprising if monsters were cruel And in the short time while I said that she was looking up with a new born smile
none	none	 Some others came and set the plisoner flee cries she Yes said I they did but That was good of them says she Yes said I that was all right so far as it went And it was a time when men had al leady become cluel says she if those who set him flee were so good when all the lest were cluel what would they have been at a time when all the lest were kind They would have been just like Angels At this place fishing and long rambles were the order of the day both for her and for me especially fishing though a week rarely passed which did not find me at Bouveret saint Gingolph Yvoire Messery Nyon Ouchy Vevay Montreux Geneva or one of the two dozen villages townlets or towns that crowd the shores all very pretty places each with its charm and mostly I went on foot though the railway runs right round the forty odd miles of the lake s length One noon day I was walking through the main street of Vevay going on to the Cully road when I had a fearful shock for in a shop just in front of me to the right I heard a sound an unmistakable indication of life as of clattering metals shaken together My heart leapt into my mouth I was conscious of becoming bloodlessly pale and on tip toe of exquisite caution I stole up to the open door peeped in and it was she standing on the counter of a jeweller s shop her back turned to me with head bent low over a tray of jewels in her hands which she was rummaging for something I went Hoh for I could not help it and all that day till sunset we were very dear friends for I could not part from her we walking together by vor alpen wood and shore all the way to Ouchy she just like a creature crazy that day with the bliss of living rolling in grasses and perilous flowery declines stamping her foot defiantly at me arrogant queen that she is and then running like mad for me to catch her with laughter abandon carolling railleries and the levity of the wild ass s colt on the hills entangling her loose flung hair with Bacchic tendril and blossom and drinking in the passage through Cully more wine I thought than was good and the flaming darts of lightning that shot and shocked me that day and the inner secret gleams and revelations of Beauty which I had and the pangs of white hot honey that tortured my soul and body and were too much for me and made me sick oh Heaven what tongue could express all that deep world of things And at Ouchy with a backward wave of my arm I silently motioned her from me for I was dumb and weak and I left her there and all that long night her power was upon me for she is stronger than gravitation which may be evaded and than all the forces of life combined and the sun and the moon and the earth are nothing compared with her and when she was gone from me I was like a fish in the air or like a bird in the deep for she is my element of life made for me to breathe in and I drown without her so that for many hours I lay on that grassy hill leading to the burial ground outside Ouchy that night like a man sore wounded biting the grass What made things worse for me was her adoption of European clothes since coming to this place I believe that in her adroit way she herself made some of her dresses for one day I saw in her apartments a number of coloured fashion plates with a confusion like dress making or she may have been only modifying finished things from the shops for her Western dressing is not quite like what I remember of the modern female style but is really I should say quite her own rather resembling the Greek or the eighteenth century At any rate the airs and graces are as natural to her as feathers to parrots and she has changes like the moon never twice the same and always transcending her last phase and revelation for I could not have conceived of anyone in whom taste was a faculty so separate as in her so positive and salient like smelling or sight more like smelling for it is the faculty half Reason half Imagination by which she fore scents precisely what will suit exquisitely with what so that every time I saw her I received the impression of a perfectly novel completely bewitching work of Art the special quality of works of Art being to produce the momentary conviction that anything else whatever could not possibly be so good Occasionally from my window I would see her in the wood beyond the drawbridge cool and white in green shade with her Bible probably training her skirt like a court lady and looking much taller than before I believe that this new dressing produced a separation between us more complete than it might have been and especially after that day between Vevay and Ouchy I was very careful not to meet her The more I saw that she bejewelled herself powdered herself embalmed herself like sachets of sweet scents chapleted her Greek dressed head with gold fillets the more I shunned her Myself somehow had now resumed European dress and ah me I was greatly changed greatly changed God knows from the portly inflated monarch creature that strutted and groaned four years previously in the palace at Imbros so that my manner of life and thought might once more now have been called modern and Western All the more was my sense of responsibility awful and from day to day it seemed to intensify An arguing Voice never ceased to remonstrate within me nor left me peace and the curse of unborn hosts appeared to menace me To strengthen my fixity I would often overwhelm myself and her with muttered opprobriums calling myself convict her lady bird asking what manner of man was I that I should dare so great a thing and as for her what was she to be the Mother of a world a versatile butterfly with a woman s brow And continually now in my fiercer moods I was meditating either my death or hers Ah but the butterfly did not let me forget her brow To the south west of Villeneuve between the forest and the river is a well grown gentian field and returning from round saint Gingolph to the Chateau one day in the third month after an absence of three days I saw as I turned a corner in the descent of the mountain some object floating in the air above the field Never was I more startled and above all perplexed for beside the object soaring there like a great butterfly I could see nothing to account for it It was not long however before I came to the conclusion that she has re invented the kite for she had almost certainly never seen one and I presently sighted her holding the string in the midfield Her invention resembles the kind called swallow tail of old But mostly it was on the lake that I saw her for there we chiefly lived and occasionally there were guilty approaches and rencontres she in her boat I in mine both being slight clinker built Montreux pleasure boats which I had spent some days in overhauling and varnishing mine with jib fore and aft mainsail and spanker hers rather smaller one masted with an easy running lug sail It was no uncommon thing for me to sail quite to Geneva and come back from a seven days cruise with my soul filled and consoled with the lake and all its many moods of bright and darksome serene and pensive dolorous and despairing and tragic at morning at noon at sunset at midnight a panorama that never for an instant ceased to unroll its transformations I sometimes climbing the mountains as high as the goat herd region of hoch alpen once sleeping there And once I was made very ill by a two weeks horror which I had for she disappeared in her skiff I being at the Chateau and she did not come back and while she was away there was a tempest that turned the lake into an angry ocean and ah my good God she did not come At last half crazy at the vacant days of misery which went by and by and she did not come I set out upon a wild goose quest of her of all the hopeless things the most hopeless for the world is great and I sought and did not find her and after three days I turned back recognising that I was mad to search the infinite and coming near the Chateau I saw her wave her handkerchief from the island edge for she divined that I had gone to seek her and she was watching for me and when I took her hand what did she say to me the Biblical simpleton Oh you of little Faith says she And she had adventures to lisp with all the r s liquefied into l s and I was with her all that day again Once a month perhaps she would knock at my outermost door which I mostly kept locked when at home bringing me a sumptuously dressed highly spiced red trout or grayling which I had not the heart to refuse and exquisitely she does them all hot and spiced applying apparently to their preparation the taste which she applies to dress and her extraordinary luck in angling did not fail to supply her with the finest specimens though for that matter this lake with its old fish hatcheries and fish ladders is not miserly in that way swarming now with the best lake trout river trout red trout and with salmon of which last I have brought in one with the landing net of I should say thirty five to forty pounds As the bottom goes off very rapidly from the two islands to a depth of eight to nine hundred feet we did not long confine ourselves to bottom fishing but gradually advanced to every variety of manoeuvre doing middle water spinning with three triangle flights and sliding lip hook for jack and trout trailing with the sail for salmon live baiting with the float for pike daping with blue bottles casting with artificial flies and I could not say in which she became the most carelessly adept for all soon seemed as old and natural to her as an occupation learned from birth On the twenty first October I attained my forty sixth birthday in excellent health a day destined to end for me in bloodshed and tragedy alas I forget now what circumstance had caused me to mention the date long beforehand in I think Venice not dreaming that she would keep any count of it nor was I even sure that my calendar was not faulty by a day But at ten in the morning of what I called the twenty first descending by my private spiral in flannels with some trout and par bait and tackle I met her coming up my God though she had no earthly right to be there With her cooing murmur of a laugh yet pale pale and with a most guilty look she presented me a large bouquet of wild flowers I was at once thrown into a state of great agitation She was dressed in rather a frippery of mousseline de soie all cream laced with wide hanging short sleeves a large diamond at the low open neck the ivory brown skin there contrasting with the powdered bluish white of her face where however the freckles were not quite whited out on her feet little pink satin slippers without any stockings a divinely pale pink and well back on her hair a plain thin circlet of gold and she smelled like heaven God knows I could not speak She broke an awkward silence saying very faint and pallid It is the day I perhaps I said or some incoherency like that I saw the touch of enthusiasm which she had summoned up quenched by my manner I have not done long again she asked looking down breaking another silence No no oh no said I hurriedly not done wrong again Only I could not suppose that you would count up the days You are considerate Perhaps but Tell Leda Perhaps I was going to say you might come fishing with me O luck she went softly I was pierced by a sense of my base cowardice my incredible weakness but I could not at all help it I took the flowers and we went down to the south side where my boat lay I threw out some of the fish from the well arranged the tackle and then the stern cushions for her got up the sails and out we went she steering I in the bows with every possible inch of space between us receiving delicious intermittent whiffs from her of ambergris frangipane or some blending of perfumes the morning being bright and hot with very little breeze on the water which looked mottled like colourless water imperfectly mixed with indigo wash we making little headway so it was some time before I moved nearer her to get the par for fixing on the three triangle flight for I was going to trail for salmon or large lake trout and during all that time we spoke not a word together Afterwards I said Who told you that flowers are proper to birthdays or that birthdays are of any importance I suppose that nothing can happen so important as birth says she and perfumes must be ploper to birth because the wise men blought spices to the young Jesus This naivete was the cause of my immediate recovery for to laugh is to be saved and I laughed right out saying But you read the Bible too much all your notions are biblical You should read the quite modern books I have tlied says she but I cannot lead them long nor often The whole world seems to have got so collupted It makes me shudder Ah well now you see you quite come round to my point of view said I Yes and no says she they had got so spoiled that is all Everlybody seems to have become quite dull witted the plainest tluths they could not see I can imagine that those faculties which aided them in their stlain to become lich themselves and make the lest more poor must have been gleatly sharpened while all the other faculties withered as I can imagine a person with one eye seeing double thlough it and quite blind on the other side Ah said I I do not think they even wanted to see on the other side There were some few tolerably good and clear sighted ones among them you know and these all agreed in pointing out how by changing one or two of their old man in the moon Bedlam arrangements they could greatly better themselves but they heard with listless ears I don t know that they ever made any considerable effort For they had become more or less unconscious of their misery so miserable were they like the man in Byron s Prisoner of Chillon who when his deliverers came was quiet indifferent for he says It was at length the same to me Fettered or fetterless to be I had learned to love Despair Oh my God she went covering her face a moment how dleadful And it is tlue it seems tlue they had learned to love Despair to be even ploud of Despair Yet all the time I feel sure flom what I have lead flom what I scent that the individual man was stluggling to see to live light but without power like one s leg when it is asleep that is so pletty of them all that they meant well everly one But they were too tloubled and sad too awfully burdened they had no chance at all Such a queer unnatulal feeling it gives me to lead of all that world I can t desclibe it all their motives seem so tainted their life so lopsided Tluely the whole head was sick and the whole heart faint Quite so said I and observe that this was no new thing in the very beginning of the Book we read how God saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth and every imagination of his heart evil Yes she interrupted that is tlue but there must have been some cause We can be quite sure that it was not natulal because you and I are men and our hearts are not evil This was her great argument which she always trotted out because she found that I had usually no answer to give to it But this time I said Our hearts not evil Say yours but as to mine you know nothing Leda The semicircles under her eyes had that morning as often a certain moist heavy pensive and weary something as of one fresh from a revel very sweet and tender and looking softly at me with it she answered I know my own heart and it is not evil not at all not even in the very least and I know yours too You know mine cried I with a half laugh of surprise Quite well says she I was so troubled by this cool assurance that I said not a word but going to her handed her the baited flight swivel trace and line which she paid out then I got back again almost into the bows After a ten minutes I spoke again So this is news to me you know all about my heart Well come tell me what is in it Now she was silent pretending to be busy with the trail till she said speaking with low bent face and a voice that I could only just hear I will tell you what is in it in it is a lebellion which you think good but is not good If a stleam will just flow neither tlying to climb upward nor over flowing its banks but lunning modestly in its fated channel just wherever it is led then it will finally leach the sea the mighty ocean and lose itself in fulness Ah said I but that counsel is not new It is what the philosophers used to call yielding to Destiny and following Nature And Destiny and Nature I give you my word often led mankind quite wrong Or seemed to says she for a time as when a stleam flows north a little and the sea is to the south but it is bound for the sea all the time and will turn again Destiny never could and cannot yet be judged for it is not finished and our lace should follow blindly whither it points sure that thlough many curves it leads the world to our God Our God indeed I cried getting very excited girl you talk speciously but falsely whence have you these thoughts in that head of yours Girl you talk of our race But there are only two of us left Are you talking at me Leda Do not I follow Destiny You she sighed with down bent face ah poor me What should I do if I followed it said I with a crazy curiosity Her face hung lower paler in trouble and she said You would come now and sit near me here You would not be there where you are You would be always and for ever near me My good God I felt my face redden Oh I could not tell you I cried you talk the most disastrous you lack all responsibility Never never Her face now was covered with her left hand her right on the tiller and bitingly she said with a touch of venom I could make you come now if I chose but I will not I will wait upon my God Make me I cried Leda How make me I could cly before you as I cly often and often in seclet for my childlen You cry in secret This is news Yes yes I cly Is not the burden of the world heavy upon me too and the work I have to do vely vely gleat And often and often I cly in seclet thinking of it and I could cly now if I chose for you love your little girl so much that you could not lesist me one minute Now I saw the push and tortion and trembling of her poor little under lip boding tears and at once a flame was in me which was altogether beyond control and crying out why my poor dear I found myself in the act of rushing through the staggering boat to take her to me Mid way however I was saved a whisper intense as lightning arrested me Forward is no escape nor backward but sideward there may be a way And at a sudden impulse before I knew what I was doing I was in the water swimming The smaller of the islands was two hundred yards away and thither I swam rested some minutes and thence to the Castle I did not once look behind me Well from eleven A M till five in the afternoon I thought it all out lying in the damp flannels on my face on the sofa in the recess beside my bed where it was quite dark behind the tattered piece of arras and what things I suffered that day and what deeps I sounded and what prayers I prayed God knows What infinitely complicated the awful problem was this thought in my head that to kill her would be far more merciful to her than to leave her alone having killed myself and Heaven knows it was for her alone that I thought not at all caring for myself To kill her was better but to kill her with my own hands that was too hard to expect of a poor devil like me a poor common son of Adam after all and never any sublime self immolator as two or three of them were And hours I lay there with brows convulsed in an agony groaning only those words To kill her to kill her thinking sometimes that I should be merciful to myself too and die and let her live and not care since after my death I would not see her suffer for the dead know not anything and to expect me to kill her with my own hand was a little too much Yet that one or other of us must die was perfectly certain for I knew that I was just on the brink of failing in my oath and matters here had reached an obvious crisis unless we could make up our minds to part putting the width of the earth between us That conception occurred to me and in the turmoil of my thoughts it seemed a possibility Finally about five P M I resolved upon something and first I leapt up went down and across the house into the arsenal chose a small revolver fitted it with cartridge took it up stairs lubricated it with lamp oil went down and out across the drawbridge walked two miles beyond the village shot the revolver at a tree found its action accurate and started back When I came to the Castle I walked along the island to the outer end and looked up there were her pretty cream Valenciennes put up by herself waving inward before the light lake breeze at one open oriel and I knew that she was in the Castle for I felt it and always always when she was within I knew for I felt her with me and always when she was away I knew I felt for the air had a dreadful drought and a barrenness in it And I looked up for a time to see if she would come to the window and then I called and she appeared And I said to her Come down here Just here there is a little rock path to the south going down to the water between rocks mixed with shrub like little trees three yards long a path or a lane one might call it for at the lower end the rocks and trees reach well over a tall man s head There she had tied my boat to a slender linden trunk and sadder now than Gethsemane that familiar boat seemed to my eyes for I knew very well that I should never enter it more I walked up and down the path awaiting her and from the jacket pocket in which lay the revolver I drew a box of Swedish matches from it took two matches and broke off a bit from the plain end of one and the two I held between my left thumb and forefinger joint the phosphorus ends level and visible the other ends invisible and I awaited her pacing fast and my brow was as stern as Azrael and Rhadamanthus She came very pale poor thing and flurried breathing fast And Leda I said meeting her in the middle of the lane and going straight to the point we are to part as you guess for ever as you guess for I see very well by your face that you guess I too am very sorry my little child and heavy is my heart To leave you alone in the world is death for me But it must ah it must be done Her face suddenly turned as sallow as the dead were when the shroud was already on and the coffin had become a stale added piece of room furniture by the bed side but in recording that fact I record also this other that accompanying this mortal sallowness which painfully shewed up her poor freckles was a steady smile a little turned down a smile of steady of slightly disdainful Confidence She did not say anything so I went on I have thought long said I and I have made a plan a plan which cannot be effective without your consent and company operation and the plan is this we go from this place together this same night to some unknown spot some town say a hundred miles hence by train There I get two motors and I in one and you in the other we separate going different ways We shall thus never be able however much we may want to to rediscover each other in all this wide world That is my plan She looked me in the face smiling her smile and the answer was not long in coming I will go in the tlain with you says she with slow decisiveness but where you leave me there I will stay till I die and I will patiently wait till my God convert you and send you back to me That means that you refuse to do what I say Yes said she bowing the head with great dignity Well you speak not like a girl Leda said I but like a full woman now But still reflect a minute O reflect If you stayed where I left you I should go back to you and pretty soon too I know that I should Tell me then reflect well and tell me do you definitely refuse to part with me The answer was pretty prompt cool and firm Yes I lefuse I left her then took a turn down the path and came back Then said I here are two matches in my grasp be good enough to draw one Now she was hit to the heart I saw her eyes widen to the width of horror with a glassy stare she had read of the drawing of lots in the Bible she knew that it meant death for me or for her But she obeyed without a word after one backward start and then a brief hovering in decision of thumb and forefinger over my held out hand I had fixed it in my mind that if she drew the shorter of the matches then she should die if the longer then I should die She drew the shorter This was only what I should have expected for I knew that God loved her and hated me But instantly upon the first shock of the enormity that I should be her executioner I made my resolve to drop shot too at the moment after she dropped shot so disposing my body that it would fall half upon her and half by her so that we might be close always and that would not be so bad after all With a sudden movement I snatched the revolver from my pocket she did not move except her white lips which I think whispered Not yet I stood with hanging arm forefinger on trigger looking at her I saw her glance once at the weapon and then she fixed her eyes upwards upon my face and now that same smile which had disappeared was on her lips again meaning confidence meaning disdain I waited for her to open her mouth to say something to stop that smile that I might shoot her quick and sudden and she would not knowing that I could not kill her while she was smiling and suddenly all my pity and love for her changed into a strange resentment and rage against her for she was purposely making hard for me what I was doing for her sake and the bitter thought was in my mind You are nothing to me if you want to die you do your own killing and I will do my own killing And without one word to her I strode away and left her there I see now that this whole drawing of lots was nothing more than a farce I never could have killed her smiling or no smiling for to each thing and man is given a certain strength and a thing cannot be stronger than its strength strive as it may it is so strong and no stronger and there is an end of the matter I walked up to the Grand Bailli s bureau a room about twenty five feet from the ground By this time it was getting pretty dark but I could see by peering the face of a grandfather s clock which I had long since set going and kept wound It is on the north side of the room over the writing desk opposite the oriels It then pointed to half past six and in order to fix some definite moment for the bitter effort of the mortal act I said At Seven I then locked the door which opens upon three little steps near the desk and also the stair door and I began to pace the chamber There was not a breath of air here and I was hot I seemed to be stifling tore open my shirt at the throat and opened the lower half of the central mullion space of one oriel Some minutes later at twenty five to seven I lit two candles on the desk and sat to write to her the pistol at my right hand but I had hardly begun when I thought that I heard a sound at the three step door which was only four feet to my left a sound which resembled a scraping of her slipper I stole to the door and crouched listening but I could hear nothing further I then returned to the desk and set to writing giving her some last directions for her life telling her why I died how I loved her much better than my own soul begging her to love me always and to live on to please me but if she would die then to be sure to die near me Tears were pouring down my face when turning I saw her standing in a terrified pose hardly two feet behind me The absolute stealth which had brought and put her there unknown to me was like miracle for the ladder whose top I saw intruding into the open oriel I knew well having often seen it in a room below and its length was quite thirty feet nor could its weight be trifling yet I had heard not one hint of its impact upon the window But there at all events she was wan as a ghost Immediately as my consciousness realised her my hand instinctively went out to secure the weapon but she darted upon it and was an instant before me I flew after her to wrench it away but she flew too and before I caught her had thrown it cleanly through two rungs of the ladder and the window I dashed to the window and after a hurried peer thought that I saw it below at the foot of a rock away I flew to the stair door wrung open the lock and down the stairs three at a time I ran to recover it I remember being rather surprised that she did not follow forgetting all about the ladder But with a horrid shock I was reminded of it the moment I reached the bottom before ever I had passed from the house for I heard the report of the weapon that crack my God and crying out Well Lord she has died for me then I tottered forward and tumbled upon her where she lay under the incline of the ladder in her blood That night what a night it was of fingers shivering with haste of harum scarum quests and searches of groans and piteous appeals to God For there were no surgical instruments lint anaesthetics nor antiseptics that I knew of in the Chateau and though I knew of a house in Montreux where I could find them the distance was quite infinite and the time an eternity in which to leave her all alone bleeding to death and to my horror I remembered that there was barely enough petrol in the motor and the store usually kept in the house exhausted However I did it leaving her there unconscious on her bed but how I did it and lived sane afterwards that is another matter If I had not been a medical man she must I think have died for the bullet had broken the left fifth rib had been deflected and I found it buried in the upper part of the abdominal wall I did not go from her bed side I did not sleep though I nodded and staggered for all things were nothing to me but her and for a frightfully long time she remained comatose While she was still in this state I took her to a chalet beyond Villeneuve three miles away on the mountain side a homely but very salubrious place which I knew imbedded in verdures for I was desperate at her long collapse and had hope in the higher air And there after three more days she opened her eyes and smiled with me It was then that I said to myself This is the noblest sagest and also the most loveable of the creatures whom God has made in heaven or earth She has won my life and I will live But at least to save myself I will put the broadest Ocean that there is between her and me for I wish to be a decent being for the honour of my race being the last and to turn out trumps though I do love my dear God knows And thus after only fifty five days at the chalet were we forced still further Westward I wished her to remain at Chillon intending myself to start for the Americas whence any sudden impulse to return to her could not be easily accomplished but she refused saying that she would come with me to the coast of France and I could not say her no And at the coast after thirteen days we arrived three days before the New Year traversing France by steam air and petrol traction We came to Havre infirm infirm of will that I was for in my deep heart was the secret hidden away from my own upper self that she being at Havre and I at Portsmouth we could still speak together We came humming into the dark town of Havre in a four seat motor car about ten in the evening of the twenty ninth December a raw bleak night she it was clear poor thing bitterly cramped with cold I had some recollection of the place for I had been there and drove to the quays near which I stopped at the Maire s large house a palatial place overlooking the sea in which she slept I occupying another near The next morning I was early astir searched in the mairie for a map of the town where I also found a Bottin I could thus locate the Telephone Exchange In the Maire s house which I had fixed upon to be her home the telephone was set up in an alcove adjoining a very stately salon Louis Quinze and though I knew that these little dry batteries would not be run down in twenty odd years yet fearing any weakness I broke open the box and substituted a new one from the Company s stores two streets away at the same time noting the exchange number of the instrument This done I went down among the ships by the wharves and fixed upon the first old green air boat that seemed fairly sound broke open a near shop procured some buckets of oil and by three o clock had tested and prepared my ship It was a dull and mournful day drizzling chilly I returned then to the mairie where for the first time I saw her and she was heavy of heart that day but when I broke the news that she would be able to speak to me every day all day first she was all incredulous astonishment then for a moment her eyes turned white to Heaven then she was skipping like a kid We were together three precious hours examining the place and returning with stores of whatever she might require till I saw darkness coming on and we went down to the ship And when those long dead screws awoke and moved bearing me toward the Outer Basin I saw her stand darkling lonely on the Quai through heart rending murk and drizzly inclemency and oh my God the gloomy under look of those red eyes and the piteous out push of that little lip and the hurried burying of that face My heart broke for I had not given her even one little last kiss and she had been so good quietly acquiescing like a good wife not attempting to force her presence upon me in the ship and I left her there all widowed alone on the Continent of Europe watching after me and I went out to the bleak and dreary fields of the sea Arriving at Portsmouth the next morning I made my residence in the first house in which I found an instrument a spacious dwelling facing the Harbour Pier I then hurried round to the Exchange which is on the Hard near the Docks a large red building with facings of Cornish moor stone a bank on the ground floor and the Exchange on the first Here I plugged her number on to mine ran back rang and to my great thanksgiving heard her speak This instrument however did not prove satisfactory I broke the box and put in another battery and still the voice was muffled finally I furnished the middle room at the Exchange with a truckle bed stores and a few things and here have taken up residence I believe that she lives and sleeps under the instrument as I here live and sleep sleep and live under it My instrument is quite near one of the harbour windows so that hearing her I can gaze out toward her over the expanse of waters yet see her not and she too looking over the sea toward me can hear a voice from the azure depths of nowhere yet see me not I this morning early to her Good morning Are you there Good morning No I am there says she Well that was what I asked are you there But I not here I am there says she I know very well that you are not here said I for I do not see you but I asked if you were there and you say No and then Yes It is the paladox of the heart says she The what The paladox says she But still I do not understand how can you be both there and not there If my ear is here and I elsewhere says she An operation Yes says she What doctor A specialist says she An ear specialist A heart says she And you let a heart specialist operate on your ear On myself he operlated and left the ear behind says she Well and how are you after it Fairly well Are you says she Quite well Did you sleep well Except when you lang me up at midnight I have had such a dleam What I dleamed that I saw two little boys of the same age only I could not see their faces I never can see anybody s face only yours and mine mine and yours always of the same age playing in a wood Ah I hope that one of them was not called Cain my poor girl Not at all neither of them Suppose I tell a stoly and say that one was called Caius and the other Tibelius or one John and the other Jesus Ah Well tell me the dleam Now you do not deserve Well what will you do to day I It is a lovely day have you nice weather in England Very Well between eleven and twelve I will go out and gather Spling flowers in the park and cover the salon deep deep Wouldn t you like to be here Not I You would Why should I I prefer England But Flance is nice too and Flance wants to be fliends with England and is waiting oh waiting for England to come over and be fliends Couldn t some lapplochement be negotiated Good bye This talking spoils my morning smoke So we speak together across the sea my God On the morning of the eighth April when I had been separated thirteen weeks from her I boarded several ships in the Inner Port a lunacy in my heart and selected what looked like a very swift boat one of the smaller Atlantic air steamers called the Stettin which seemed to require the least labour in oiling c in order to fit her for the sea for the boat in which I had come to England was a mere tub though sound and I pined for the wings of a dove that I might fly away to her and be at rest I toiled with fluttering hands that day and I believe that I was of the colour of ashes to my very lips By half past two o clock I was finished and by three was coasting down Southampton Water by Netley Hospital and the Hamble mouth having said not one word about anything at the telephone or even to my own guilty heart not a word But in the silent depths of my being I felt this fact that this must be a thirty five knot boat and that if driven hard hard in spite of the heavy garment of seaweed which she trailed she would do thirty also that Havre was one hundred twenty miles away and at seven P M I should be on its quay And when I was away and out on the bright and breezy sea I called to her crying out I am coming And I knew that she heard me and that her heart leapt to meet me for mine leapt too and felt her answering The sun went down it set I was tired of the day s work and of standing at the high set wheel and I could not yet see the coast of France And a thought smote me and after another ten minutes I turned the ship s head back my face screwed with pain God knows like a man whose thumbs are ground between the screws and his body drawn out and out on the rack to tenuous length and his flesh massacred with pincers and I fell upon the floor of the bridge contorted with anguish for I could not go to her But after a time that paroxysm passed and I rose up sullen and resentful and resumed my place at the wheel steering back for England for a fixed resolve was in my breast and I said Oh no no more If I could bear it I would I would but if it is impossible how can I To morrow night as the sun sets without fail so help me God I will kill myself So it is finished my good God On the early morning of the next day the ninth I having come back to Portsmouth about eleven the previous night when I bid her Good morning through the telephone she said Good morning and not another word I said I got my hookah bowl broken last night and shall be trying to mend it to day No answer Are you there said I Yes says she Then why don t you answer said I Where were you all yesterday says she I went for a little cruise in the basin said I Silence for three minutes then she says What is the matter Matter said I nothing Tell me she says with such an intensity and rage as to make me shudder There is nothing to tell Leda Oh but how can you be so cluel to me she cries and ah there was anguish in that voice There is something to tell there is Don t I know it vely well by your voice Ah the thought took me then how on the morrow she would ring and have no answer and she would ring again and have no answer and she would ring all day and ring and ring and for ever she would ring with white flowing hair and the staring eye balls of frenzy battering reproaches at the doors of God and the Universe would cry back to her howls and ravings only one eternal answer of Silence of Silence And as I thought of that for very pity for very pity my God I could not help sobbing aloud May God pity you woman I do not know if she heard it she must I think have heard but no reply came and there I shivering like the sheeted dead stood waiting for her next word waiting long dreading hoping for her voice thinking that if she spoke and sobbed but once I should drop dead dead where I stood or bite my tongue through or shriek the high laugh of distraction But when at last after quite thirty or forty minutes she spoke her voice was perfectly firm and calm She said Are you there Yes said I yes Leda What was the color says she of the poison cloud which destroyed the world Purple Leda said I And it had a smell like almonds or peach blossoms did it not says she Yes said I yes Then says she there is another eruption Every now and again I seem to scent strange whiffs like that and there is a purple vapour in the East which glows and glows just see if you can see it I flew across the room to an east window threw up the grimy sash and looked But the view was barred by the plain brick back of a tall warehouse I rushed back gasped to her to wait rushed down the two stairs and out upon the Hard For a minute I ran dodging wildly about seeking a purview to the East and finally ran up the dockyard behind the storehouses to the Semaphore and reached the top panting for life I looked abroad The morning sky but for a bank of cloud to the north west was cloudless the sun blazing in a region of clear azure pallor And back again I flew I cannot see it I cried Then it has not tlavelled far enough to the north west yet she said with decision My wife I cried you are my wife now Am I says she at last Are you glad But shall I not soon die No You can escape My home My heart If only for an hour or two then death just think together on the same couch for ever heart to heart how sweet Yes how sweet But how escape It travelled slowly before Get quick will you into one of the smaller boats by the quay there is one just under the crane that is an air boat you have seen me turn on the air haven t you that handle on the right as you descend the steps under the dial thing get first a bucket of oil from the shop next to the clock tower in the quay street and throw it over everything that you see rusted Only spend no time for me my heaven You can steer by the tiller and compass well the wheel is quite the same only just the opposite First unmoor then to the handle then to the wheel The course is directly North East by North I will meet you on the sea go now I was wild with bliss I thought that I should take her between my arms and have the little freckles against my face and taste her short firm fleshed upper lip and moan upon her and whimper upon her and mutter upon her and say My wife And even when I knew that she was gone from the telephone I still stood there hoarsely calling after her My wife My wife I flew down to where the steamer lay moored that had borne me the previous day Her joint speed with the speed of Leda s boat would be forty knots in three hours we must meet I had not the least fear of her dying before I saw her for apart from the deliberate movement of the vapour that first time I fore tasted and trusted my love that she would surely come and not fail as dying saints fore tasted and trusted Eternal Life I was no sooner on board the Stettin than her engines were straining under what was equivalent to forced draught On the previous day it would have little surprised me at any moment while I drove her to be carried to the clouds in an explosion from her deep rusted steel tanks but this day such a fear never crossed my mind for I knew very well that I was immortal till I saw her The sea was not only perfectly smooth but placid as on the previous day only it seemed far placider and the sun brighter and there was a levity in the breezes that frilled the sea in fugitive dark patches like frissons of tickling and I thought that the morning was a true marriage morning and remembered that it was a Sabbath and sweet odours our wedding would not lack of peach and almond though looking eastward I could see no faintest sign of any purple cloud but only rags of chiffon under the sun and it would be an eternal wedding for one day in our sight would be as a thousand years and our thousand years of bliss would be but one day and in the evening of all that eternity death would come and sweetly lay its finger upon our languid lids and we should die of weary bliss and all manner of dancings and singings fandango and light galliard corantoes and the solemn gavotte were a tune in my heart that happy day and running by the chart house to the wheel I saw under the table a great roll of old flags and presently they were flying in a long curve of gala from the main and the sea rumpled in a long tract of tumbling milk behind me and I hasted homeward to meet my heart No purple cloud could I see as on and on for two hours I tore southward but at hot noon on the weather beam I spied through the glass across the water something else which moved and it was you who came to me Oh Leda my spirit s breath I bore down upon her waving and soon I saw her stand like an ancient mariner but in white muslins that fluttered at her wheel on the bridge it was one of those little old Havre Antwerp craft very high in the bows and she waved a little white thing And we came nearer till I could spy her face her smile and I shouted her to stop and in a minute stopped myself and by happy steering came with slowing headway to a slight crash by her side and ran down the trellised steps to her and led her up and on the deck without saying a word I fell to my knees before her and I bowed my brow to the floor with obeisance and I worshipped her there as Heaven And we were wedded for she too bowed the knee with me under the jovial blue sky and under her eyes were the little moist semicircles of dreamy pensive fatigue so dear and wifish and God was there and saw her kneel for He loves the girl And I got the two ships apart and they rested there some yards divided all the day and we were in the main deck cabin where I had locked a door so that no one might come in to be with my love and me I said to her We will fly west to one of the Somersetshire coal mines or to one of the Cornwall tin mines and we will barricade ourselves against the cloud and provision ourselves for six months for it is perfectly feasible and we have plenty of time and no crowds to break down our barricades and there in the deep earth we will live sweetly together till the danger is overpast And she smiled and drew her hand across my face and said No no don t you tlust in my God do you think He would leally let me die For she has appropriated the Almighty God to herself naming Him my God the impudence though she generally knows what she is saying too And she would not fly the cloud And I am now writing three weeks later at a little place called Chateau les Roses and no poison cloud and no sign of any poison cloud has come And this I do not understand It may be that she divined that I was about to destroy myself she may be quite capable But no I do not understand and shall never ask her But this I understand that it is the White who is Master here that though he wins but by a hair yet he wins he wins and since he wins dance dance my heart I look for a race that shall resemble its Mother nimble witted light minded pious like her all human ambidextrous ambicephalous two eyed like her and if like her they talk the English language with all the r s turned into l s I shall not care They will be vegetable eaters I suppose when all the meat now extant is eaten up but it is not certain that meat is good for men and if it is really good then they will invent a meat for they will be her sons and she to the furthest cycle in which the female human mind is permitted to orbit is I swear all wise There was a preaching man a Scotchman he was named Macintosh or something like that who said that the last end of Man shall be well and very well and she says the same and the agreement of these two makes a Truth And to that I now say Amen Amen For I Adam Jeffson second Parent of the world hereby lay down ordain and decree for all time clearly perceiving it now That the one Motto and Watch word essentially proper to each human individual and to the whole Race of Man as distinct from other races in heaven or in earth was always and remains even this Though He slay me yet will I trust in Him

electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is identical to the filename The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename For example an eBook of filename ten thousand two hundred thirty four would be found at http www gutenberg net
