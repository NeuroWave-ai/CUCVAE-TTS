Capac at the lake Titicaca a man in cream colors at the water side in the city of saint Louis His cheek was fair his chin downy his hair flaxen his hat a white fur one with a long fleecy nap He had neither trunk valise carpet bag nor parcel No porter followed him He was unaccompanied by friends From the shrugged shoulders titters whispers wonderings of the crowd it was plain that he was in the extremest sense of the word a stranger In the same moment with his advent he stepped aboard the favorite steamer Fidele on the point of starting for New Orleans Stared at but unsaluted with the air of one neither courting nor shunning regard but evenly pursuing the path of duty lead it through solitudes or cities he held on his way along the lower deck until he chanced to come to a placard nigh the captain s office offering a reward for the capture of a mysterious impostor supposed to have recently arrived from the East quite an original genius in his vocation as would appear though wherein his originality consisted was not clearly given but what purported to be a careful description of his person followed As if it had been a theatre bill crowds were gathered about the announcement and among them certain chevaliers whose eyes it was plain were on the capitals or at least earnestly seeking sight of them from behind intervening coats but as for their fingers they were enveloped in some myth though during a chance interval one of these chevaliers somewhat showed his hand in purchasing from another chevalier ex officio a peddler of money belts one of his popular safe guards while another peddler who was still another versatile chevalier hawked in the thick of the throng the lives of Measan the bandit of Ohio Murrel the pirate of the Mississippi and the brothers Harpe the Thugs of the Green River country in Kentucky creatures with others of the sort one and all exterminated at the time and for the most part like the hunted generations of wolves in the same regions leaving comparatively few successors which would seem cause for unalloyed gratulation and is such to all except those who think that in new countries where the wolves are killed off the foxes increase Pausing at this spot the stranger so far succeeded in threading his way as at last to plant himself just beside the placard when producing a small slate and tracing some words upon if he held it up before him on a level with the placard so that they who read the one might read the other The words were these Charity thinketh no evil As in gaining his place some little perseverance not to say persistence of a mildly inoffensive sort had been unavoidable it was not with the best relish that the crowd regarded his apparent intrusion and upon a more attentive survey perceiving no badge of authority about him but rather something quite the contrary he being of an aspect so singularly innocent an aspect too which they took to be somehow inappropriate to the time and place and inclining to the notion that his writing was of much the same sort in short taking him for some strange kind of simpleton harmless enough would he keep to himself but not wholly unobnoxious as an intruder they made no scruple to jostle him aside while one less kind than the rest or more of a wag by an unobserved stroke dexterously flattened down his fleecy hat upon his head Without readjusting it the stranger quietly turned and writing anew upon the slate again held it up Charity suffereth long and is kind Illy pleased with his pertinacity as they thought it the crowd a second time thrust him aside and not without epithets and some buffets all of which were unresented But as if at last despairing of so difficult an adventure wherein one apparently a non resistant sought to impose his presence upon fighting characters the stranger now moved slowly away yet not before altering his writing to this Charity endureth all things Shield like bearing his slate before him amid stares and jeers he moved slowly up and down at his turning points again changing his inscription to Charity believeth all things and then Charity never faileth The word charity as originally traced remained throughout uneffaced not unlike the left hand numeral of a printed date otherwise left for convenience in blank To some observers the singularity if not lunacy of the stranger was heightened by his muteness and perhaps also by the contrast to his proceedings afforded in the actions quite in the wonted and sensible order of things of the barber of the boat whose quarters under a smoking saloon and over against a bar room was next door but two to the captain s office As if the long wide covered deck hereabouts built up on both sides with shop like windowed spaces were some Constantinople arcade or bazaar where more than one trade is plied this river barber aproned and slippered but rather crusty looking for the moment it may be from being newly out of bed was throwing open his premises for the day and suitably arranging the exterior With business like dispatch having rattled down his shutters and at a palm tree angle set out in the iron fixture his little ornamental pole and this without overmuch tenderness for the elbows and toes of the crowd he concluded his operations by bidding people stand still more aside when jumping on a stool he hung over his door on the customary nail a gaudy sort of illuminated pasteboard sign skillfully executed by himself gilt with the likeness of a razor elbowed in readiness to shave and also for the public benefit with two words not unfrequently seen ashore gracing other shops besides barbers NO TRUST An inscription which though in a sense not less intrusive than the contrasted ones of the stranger did not as it seemed provoke any corresponding derision or surprise much less indignation and still less to all appearances did it gain for the inscriber the repute of being a simpleton Meanwhile he with the slate continued moving slowly up and down not without causing some stares to change into jeers and some jeers into pushes and some pushes into punches when suddenly in one of his turns he was hailed from behind by two porters carrying a large trunk but as the summons though loud was without effect they accidentally or otherwise swung their burden against him nearly overthrowing him when by a quick start a peculiar inarticulate moan and a pathetic telegraphing of his fingers he involuntarily betrayed that he was not alone dumb but also deaf Presently as if not wholly unaffected by his reception thus far he went forward seating himself in a retired spot on the forecastle nigh the foot of a ladder there leading to a deck above up and down which ladder some of the boatmen in discharge of their duties were occasionally going From his betaking himself to this humble quarter it was evident that as a deck passenger the stranger simple though he seemed was not entirely ignorant of his place though his taking a deck passage might have been partly for convenience as from his having no luggage it was probable that his destination was one of the small wayside landings within a few hours sail But though he might not have a long way to go yet he seemed already to have come from a very long distance Though neither soiled nor slovenly his cream colored suit had a tossed look almost linty as if traveling night and day from some far country beyond the prairies he had long been without the solace of a bed His aspect was at once gentle and jaded and from the moment of seating himself increasing in tired abstraction and dreaminess Gradually overtaken by slumber his flaxen head drooped his whole lamb like figure relaxed and half reclining against the ladder s foot lay motionless as some sugar snow in March which softly stealing down over night with its white placidity startles the brown farmer peering out from his threshold at daybreak CHAPTER II SHOWING THAT MANY MEN HAVE MANY MINDS Odd fish Poor fellow Who can he be Casper Hauser Bless my soul Uncommon countenance Green prophet from Utah Humbug Singular innocence Means something Spirit rapper Moon calf Piteous Trying to enlist interest Beware of him Fast asleep here and doubtless pick pockets on board Kind of daylight Endymion Escaped convict worn out with dodging Jacob dreaming at Luz Such the epitaphic comments conflictingly spoken or thought of a miscellaneous company who assembled on the overlooking cross wise balcony at the forward end of the upper deck near by had not witnessed preceding occurrences Meantime like some enchanted man in his grave happily oblivious of all gossip whether chiseled or chatted the deaf and dumb stranger still tranquilly slept while now the boat started on her voyage The great ship canal of Ving King Ching in the Flowery Kingdom seems the Mississippi in parts where amply flowing between low vine tangled banks flat as tow paths it bears the huge toppling steamers bedizened and lacquered within like imperial junks Pierced along its great white bulk with two tiers of small embrasure like windows well above the waterline the Fiddle though might at distance have been taken by strangers for some whitewashed fort on a floating isle Merchants on change seem the passengers that buzz on her decks while from quarters unseen comes a murmur as of bees in the comb Fine promenades domed saloons long galleries sunny balconies confidential passages bridal chambers state rooms plenty as pigeon holes and out of the way retreats like secret drawers in an escritoire present like facilities for publicity or privacy Auctioneer or coiner with equal ease might somewhere here drive his trade Though her voyage of twelve hundred miles extends from apple to orange from clime to clime yet like any small ferry boat to right and left at every landing the huge Fidele still receives additional passengers in exchange for those that disembark so that though always full of strangers she continually in some degree adds to or replaces them with strangers still more strange like Rio Janeiro fountain fed from the Cocovarde mountains which is ever overflowing with strange waters but never with the same strange particles in every part Though hitherto as has been seen the man in cream colors had by no means passed unobserved yet by stealing into retirement and there going asleep and continuing so he seemed to have courted oblivion a boon not often withheld from so humble an applicant as he Those staring crowds on the shore were now left far behind seen dimly clustering like swallows on eaves while the passengers attention was soon drawn away to the rapidly shooting high bluffs and shot towers on the Missouri shore or the bluff looking Missourians and towering Kentuckians among the throngs on the decks By and by two or three random stoppages having been made and the last transient memory of the slumberer vanished and he himself not unlikely waked up and landed ere now the crowd as is usual began in all parts to break up from a concourse into various clusters or squads which in some cases disintegrated again into quartettes trios and couples or even solitaires involuntarily submitting to that natural law which ordains dissolution equally to the mass as in time to the member As among Chaucer s Canterbury pilgrims or those oriental ones crossing the Red Sea towards Mecca in the festival month there was no lack of variety Natives of all sorts and foreigners men of business and men of pleasure parlor men and backwoodsmen farm hunters and fame hunters heiress hunters gold hunters buffalo hunters bee hunters happiness hunters truth hunters and still keener hunters after all these hunters Fine ladies in slippers and moccasined squaws Northern speculators and Eastern philosophers English Irish German Scotch Danes Santa Fe traders in striped blankets and Broadway bucks in cravats of cloth of gold fine looking Kentucky boatmen and Japanese looking Mississippi cotton planters Quakers in full drab and United States soldiers in full regimentals slaves black mulatto quadroon modish young Spanish Creoles and old fashioned French Jews Mormons and Papists Dives and Lazarus jesters and mourners teetotalers and convivialists deacons and blacklegs hard shell Baptists and clay eaters grinning negroes and Sioux chiefs solemn as high priests In short a piebald parliament an Anacharsis Cloots congress of all kinds of that multiform pilgrim species man As pine beech birch ash hackmatack hemlock spruce bass wood maple interweave their foliage in the natural wood so these mortals blended their varieties of visage and garb A Tartar like picturesqueness a sort of pagan abandonment and assurance Here reigned the dashing and all fusing spirit of the West whose type is the Mississippi itself which uniting the streams of the most distant and opposite zones pours them along helter skelter in one cosmopolitan and confident tide CHAPTER III IN WHICH A VARIETY OF CHARACTERS APPEAR In the forward part of the boat not the least attractive object for a time was a grotesque negro cripple in tow cloth attire and an old coal sifter of a tamborine in his hand who owing to something wrong about his legs was in effect cut down to the stature of a Newfoundland dog his knotted black fleece and good natured honest black face rubbing against the upper part of people s thighs as he made shift to shuffle about making music such as it was and raising a smile even from the gravest It was curious to see him out of his very deformity indigence and houselessness so cheerily endured raising mirth in some of that crowd whose own purses hearths hearts all their possessions sound limbs included could not make gay What is your name old boy said a purple faced drover putting his large purple hand on the cripple s bushy wool as if it were the curled forehead of a black steer Der Black Guinea dey calls me sar And who is your master Guinea Oh sar I am der dog widout massa A free dog eh Well on your account I m sorry for that Guinea Dogs without masters fare hard So dey do sar so dey do But you see sar dese here legs What ge mman want to own dese here legs But where do you live All long shore sar dough now I se going to see brodder at der landing but chiefly I libs in dey city saint Louis ah Where do you sleep there of nights On der floor of der good baker s oven sar In an oven whose pray What baker I should like to know bakes such black bread in his oven alongside of his nice white rolls too Who is that too charitable baker pray Dar he be with a broad grin lifting his tambourine high over his head The sun is the baker eh Yes sar in der city dat good baker warms der stones for dis ole darkie when he sleeps out on der pabements o nights But that must be in the summer only old boy How about winter when the cold Cossacks come clattering and jingling How about winter old boy Den dis poor old darkie shakes werry bad I tell you sar Oh sar oh don t speak ob der winter he added with a reminiscent shiver shuffling off into the thickest of the crowd like a half frozen black sheep nudging itself a cozy berth in the heart of the white flock Thus far not very many pennies had been given him and used at last to his strange looks the less polite passengers of those in that part of the boat began to get their fill of him as a curious object when suddenly the negro more than revived their first interest by an expedient which whether by chance or design was a singular temptation at once to diversion and charity though even more than his crippled limbs it put him on a canine footing In short as in appearance he seemed a dog so now in a merry way like a dog he began to be treated Still shuffling among the crowd now and then he would pause throwing back his head and opening his mouth like an elephant for tossed apples at a menagerie when making a space before him people would have a bout at a strange sort of pitch penny game the cripple s mouth being at once target and purse and he hailing each expertly caught copper with a cracked bravura from his tambourine To be the subject of alms giving is trying and to feel in duty bound to appear cheerfully grateful under the trial must be still more so but whatever his secret emotions he swallowed them while still retaining each copper this side the oesophagus And nearly always he grinned and only once or twice did he wince which was when certain coins tossed by more playful almoners came inconveniently nigh to his teeth an accident whose unwelcomeness was not unedged by the circumstance that the pennies thus thrown proved buttons While this game of charity was yet at its height a limping gimlet eyed sour faced person it may be some discharged custom house officer who suddenly stripped of convenient means of support had concluded to be avenged on government and humanity by making himself miserable for life either by hating or suspecting everything and everybody this shallow unfortunate after sundry sorry observations of the negro began to croak out something about his deformity being a sham got up for financial purposes which immediately threw a damp upon the frolic benignities of the pitch penny players But that these suspicions came from one who himself on a wooden leg went halt this did not appear to strike anybody present That cripples above all men should be companionable or at least refrain from picking a fellow limper to pieces in short should have a little sympathy in common misfortune seemed not to occur to the company Meantime the negro s countenance before marked with even more than patient good nature drooped into a heavy hearted expression full of the most painful distress So far abased beneath its proper physical level that Newfoundland dog face turned in passively hopeless appeal as if instinct told it that the right or the wrong might not have overmuch to do with whatever wayward mood superior intelligences might yield to But instinct though knowing is yet a teacher set below reason which itself says in the grave words of Lysander in the comedy after Puck has made a sage of him with his spell The will of man is by his reason swayed So that suddenly change as people may in their dispositions it is not always waywardness but improved judgment which as in Lysander s case or the present operates with them Yes they began to scrutinize the negro curiously enough when emboldened by this evidence of the efficacy of his words the wooden legged man hobbled up to the negro and with the air of a beadle would to prove his alleged imposture on the spot have stripped him and then driven him away but was prevented by the crowd s clamor now taking part with the poor fellow against one who had just before turned nearly all minds the other way So he with the wooden leg was forced to retire when the rest finding themselves left sole judges in the case could not resist the opportunity of acting the part not because it is a human weakness to take pleasure in sitting in judgment upon one in a box as surely this unfortunate negro now was but that it strangely sharpens human perceptions when instead of standing by and having their fellow feelings touched by the sight of an alleged culprit severely handled by some one justiciary a crowd suddenly come to be all justiciaries in the same case themselves as in Arkansas once a man proved guilty by law of murder but whose condemnation was deemed unjust by the people so that they rescued him to try him themselves whereupon they as it turned out found him even guiltier than the court had done and forthwith proceeded to execution so that the gallows presented the truly warning spectacle of a man hanged by his friends But not to such extremities or anything like them did the present crowd come they for the time being content with putting the negro fairly and discreetly to the question among other things asking him had he any documentary proof any plain paper about him attesting that his case was not a spurious one No no dis poor ole darkie haint none o dem waloable papers he wailed But is there not some one who can speak a good word for you here said a person newly arrived from another part of the boat a young Episcopal clergyman in a long straight bodied black coat small in stature but manly with a clear face and blue eye innocence tenderness and good sense triumvirate in his air Oh yes oh yes ge mmen he eagerly answered as if his memory before suddenly frozen up by cold charity as suddenly thawed back into fluidity at the first kindly word Oh yes oh yes dar is aboard here a werry nice good ge mman wid a weed and a ge mman in a gray coat and white tie what knows all about me and a ge mman wid a big book too and a yarb doctor and a ge mman in a yaller west and a ge mman wid a brass plate and a ge mman in a wiolet robe and a ge mman as is a sodjer and ever so many good kind honest ge mmen more aboard what knows me and will speak for me God bress em yes and what knows me as well as dis poor old darkie knows hisself God bress him Oh find em find em he earnestly added and let em come quick and show you all ge mmen dat dis poor ole darkie is werry well wordy of all you kind ge mmen s kind confidence But how are we to find all these people in this great crowd was the question of a bystander umbrella in hand a middle aged person a country merchant apparently whose natural good feeling had been made at least cautious by the unnatural ill feeling of the discharged custom house officer Where are we to find them half rebukefully echoed the young Episcopal clergymen I will go find one to begin with he quickly added and with kind haste suiting the action to the word away he went Wild goose chase croaked he with the wooden leg now again drawing nigh Don t believe there s a soul of them aboard Did ever beggar have such heaps of fine friends He can walk fast enough when he tries a good deal faster than I but he can lie yet faster He s some white operator betwisted and painted up for a decoy He and his friends are all humbugs Have you no charity friend here in self subdued tones singularly contrasted with his unsubdued person said a Methodist minister advancing a tall muscular martial looking man a Tennessean by birth who in the Mexican war had been volunteer chaplain to a volunteer rifle regiment Charity is one thing and truth is another rejoined he with the wooden leg he s a rascal I say But why not friend put as charitable a construction as one can upon the poor fellow said the soldierlike Methodist with increased difficulty maintaining a pacific demeanor towards one whose own asperity seemed so little to entitle him to it he looks honest don t he Looks are one thing and facts are another snapped out the other perversely and as to your constructions what construction can you put upon a rascal but that a rascal he is Be not such a Canada thistle urged the Methodist with something less of patience than before Charity man charity To where it belongs with your charity to heaven with it again snapped out the other diabolically here on earth true charity dotes and false charity plots Who betrays a fool with a kiss the charitable fool has the charity to believe is in love with him and the charitable knave on the stand gives charitable testimony for his comrade in the box Surely friend returned the noble Methodist with much ado restraining his still waxing indignation surely to say the least you forget yourself Apply it home he continued with exterior calmness tremulous with inkept emotion Suppose now I should exercise no charity in judging your own character by the words which have fallen from you what sort of vile pitiless man do you think I would take you for No doubt with a grin some such pitiless man as has lost his piety in much the same way that the jockey loses his honesty And how is that friend still conscientiously holding back the old Adam in him as if it were a mastiff he had by the neck Never you mind how it is with a sneer but all horses aint virtuous no more than all men kind and come close to and much dealt with some things are catching When you find me a virtuous jockey I will find you a benevolent wise man Some insinuation there More fool you that are puzzled by it Reprobate cried the other his indignation now at last almost boiling over godless reprobate if charity did not restrain me I could call you by names you deserve Could you indeed with an insolent sneer Yea and teach you charity on the spot cried the goaded Methodist suddenly catching this exasperating opponent by his shabby coat collar and shaking him till his timber toe clattered on the deck like a nine pin You took me for a non combatant did you thought seedy coward that you are that you could abuse a Christian with impunity You find your mistake with another hearty shake Well said and better done church militant cried a voice The white cravat against the world cried another Bravo bravo chorused many voices with like enthusiasm taking sides with the resolute champion You fools cried he with the wooden leg writhing himself loose and inflamedly turning upon the throng you flock of fools under this captain of fools in this ship of fools With which exclamations followed by idle threats against his admonisher this condign victim to justice hobbled away as disdaining to hold further argument with such a rabble But his scorn was more than repaid by the hisses that chased him in which the brave Methodist satisfied with the rebuke already administered was to omit still better reasons too magnanimous to join All he said was pointing towards the departing recusant There he shambles off on his one lone leg emblematic of his one sided view of humanity But trust your painted decoy retorted the other from a distance pointing back to the black cripple and I have my revenge But we aint agoing to trust him shouted back a voice So much the better he jeered back Look you he added coming to a dead halt where he was look you I have been called a Canada thistle Very good And a seedy one still better And the seedy Canada thistle has been pretty well shaken among ye best of all Dare say some seed has been shaken out and won t it spring though And when it does spring do you cut down the young thistles and won t they spring the more It s encouraging and coaxing em Now when with my thistles your farms shall be well stocked why then you may abandon em What does all that mean now asked the country merchant staring Nothing the foiled wolf s parting howl said the Methodist Spleen much spleen which is the rickety child of his evil heart of unbelief it has made him mad I suspect him for one naturally reprobate Oh friends raising his arms as in the pulpit oh beloved how are we admonished by the melancholy spectacle of this raver Let us profit by the lesson and is it not this that if next to mistrusting Providence there be aught that man should pray against it is against mistrusting his fellow man I have been in mad houses full of tragic mopers and seen there the end of suspicion the cynic in the moody madness muttering in the corner for years a barren fixture there head lopped over gnawing his own lip vulture of himself while by fits and starts from the corner opposite came the grimace of the idiot at him What an example whispered one Might deter Timon was the response Oh oh good ge mmen have you no confidence in dis poor ole darkie now wailed the returning negro who during the late scene had stumped apart in alarm Confidence in you echoed he who had whispered with abruptly changed air turning short round that remains to be seen I tell you what it is Ebony in similarly changed tones said he who had responded to the whisperer yonder churl pointing toward the wooden leg in the distance is no doubt a churlish fellow enough and I would not wish to be like him but that is no reason why you may not be some sort of black Jeremy Diddler No confidence in dis poor ole darkie den Before giving you our confidence said a third we will wait the report of the kind gentleman who went in search of one of your friends who was to speak for you Very likely in that case said a fourth we shall wait here till Christmas Shouldn t wonder did we not see that kind gentleman again After seeking awhile in vain he will conclude he has been made a fool of and so not return to us for pure shame Fact is I begin to feel a little qualmish about the darkie myself Something queer about this darkie depend upon it Once more the negro wailed and turning in despair from the last speaker imploringly caught the Methodist by the skirt of his coat But a change had come over that before impassioned intercessor With an irresolute and troubled air he mutely eyed the suppliant against whom somehow by what seemed instinctive influences the distrusts first set on foot were now generally reviving and if anything with added severity No confidence in dis poor ole darkie yet again wailed the negro letting go the coat skirts and turning appealingly all round him Yes my poor fellow I have confidence in you now exclaimed the country merchant before named whom the negro s appeal coming so piteously on the heel of pitilessness seemed at last humanely to have decided in his favor And here here is some proof of my trust with which tucking his umbrella under his arm and diving down his hand into his pocket he fished forth a purse and accidentally along with it his business card which unobserved dropped to the deck Here here my poor fellow he continued extending a half dollar Not more grateful for the coin than the kindness the cripple s face glowed like a polished copper saucepan and shuffling a pace nigher with one upstretched hand he received the alms while as unconsciously his one advanced leather stump covered the card Done in despite of the general sentiment the good deed of the merchant was not perhaps without its unwelcome return from the crowd since that good deed seemed somehow to convey to them a sort of reproach Still again and more pertinaciously than ever the cry arose against the negro and still again he wailed forth his lament and appeal among other things repeating that the friends of whom already he had partially run off the list would freely speak for him would anybody go find them Why don t you go find em yourself demanded a gruff boatman How can I go find em myself Dis poor ole game legged darkie s friends must come to him Oh whar whar is dat good friend of dis darkie s dat good man wid de weed At this point a steward ringing a bell came along summoning all persons who had not got their tickets to step to the captain s office an announcement which speedily thinned the throng about the black cripple who himself soon forlornly stumped out of sight probably on much the same errand as the rest CHAPTER IV RENEWAL OF OLD ACQUAINTANCE How do you do mister Roberts Eh Don t you know me No certainly The crowd about the captain s office having in good time melted away the above encounter took place in one of the side balconies astern between a man in mourning clean and respectable but none of the glossiest a long weed on his hat and the country merchant before mentioned whom with the familiarity of an old acquaintance the former had accosted Is it possible my dear sir resumed he with the weed that you do not recall my countenance why yours I recall distinctly as if but half an hour instead of half an age had passed since I saw you Don t you recall me now Look harder In my conscience truly I protest honestly bewildered bless my soul sir I don t know you really really But stay stay he hurriedly added not without gratification glancing up at the crape on the stranger s hat stay yes seems to me though I have not the pleasure of personally knowing you yet I am pretty sure I have at least heard of you and recently too quite recently A poor negro aboard here referred to you among others for a character I think Oh the cripple Poor fellow I know him well They found me I have said all I could for him I think I abated their distrust Would I could have been of more substantial service And apropos sir he added now that it strikes me allow me to ask whether the circumstance of one man however humble referring for a character to another man however afflicted does not argue more or less of moral worth in the latter The good merchant looked puzzled Still you don t recall my countenance Still does truth compel me to say that I cannot despite my best efforts was the reluctantly candid reply Can I be so changed Look at me Or is it I who am mistaken Are you not sir Henry Roberts forwarding merchant of Wheeling Pennsylvania Pray now if you use the advertisement of business cards and happen to have one with you just look at it and see whether you are not the man I take you for Why a bit chafed perhaps I hope I know myself And yet self knowledge is thought by some not so easy Who knows my dear sir but for a time you may have taken yourself for somebody else Stranger things have happened The good merchant stared To come to particulars my dear sir I met you now some six years back at Brade Brothers company s office I think I was traveling for a Philadelphia house The senior Brade introduced us you remember some business chat followed then you forced me home with you to a family tea and a family time we had Have you forgotten about the urn and what I said about Werter s Charlotte and the bread and butter and that capital story you told of the large loaf A hundred times since I have laughed over it At least you must recall my name Ringman John Ringman Large loaf Invited you to tea Ringman Ringman Ring Ring Ah sir sadly smiling don t ring the changes that way I see you have a faithless memory mister Roberts But trust in the faithfulness of mine Well to tell the truth in some things my memory aint of the very best was the honest rejoinder But still he perplexedly added still I Oh sir suffice it that it is as I say Doubt not that we are all well acquainted But but I don t like this going dead against my own memory I But didn t you admit my dear sir that in some things this memory of yours is a little faithless Now those who have faithless memories should they not have some little confidence in the less faithless memories of others But of this friendly chat and tea I have not the slightest I see I see quite erased from the tablet Pray sir with a sudden illumination about six years back did it happen to you to receive any injury on the head Surprising effects have arisen from such a cause Not alone unconsciousness as to events for a greater or less time immediately subsequent to the injury but likewise strange to add oblivion entire and incurable as to events embracing a longer or shorter period immediately preceding it that is when the mind at the time was perfectly sensible of them and fully competent also to register them in the memory and did in fact so do but all in vain for all was afterwards bruised out by the injury After the first start the merchant listened with what appeared more than ordinary interest The other proceeded In my boyhood I was kicked by a horse and lay insensible for a long time Upon recovering what a blank No faintest trace in regard to how I had come near the horse or what horse it was or where it was or that it was a horse at all that had brought me to that pass For the knowledge of those particulars I am indebted solely to my friends in whose statements I need not say I place implicit reliance since particulars of some sort there must have been and why should they deceive me You see sir the mind is ductile very much so but images ductilely received into it need a certain time to harden and bake in their impressions otherwise such a casualty as I speak of will in an instant obliterate them as though they had never been We are but clay sir potter s clay as the good book says clay feeble and too yielding clay But I will not philosophize Tell me was it your misfortune to receive any concussion upon the brain about the period I speak of If so I will with pleasure supply the void in your memory by more minutely rehearsing the circumstances of our acquaintance The growing interest betrayed by the merchant had not relaxed as the other proceeded After some hesitation indeed something more than hesitation he confessed that though he had never received any injury of the sort named yet about the time in question he had in fact been taken with a brain fever losing his mind completely for a considerable interval He was continuing when the stranger with much animation exclaimed There now you see I was not wholly mistaken That brain fever accounts for it all Nay but Pardon me mister Roberts respectfully interrupting him but time is short and I have something private and particular to say to you Allow me mister Roberts good man could but acquiesce and the two having silently walked to a less public spot the manner of the man with the weed suddenly assumed a seriousness almost painful What might be called a writhing expression stole over him He seemed struggling with some disastrous necessity inkept He made one or two attempts to speak but words seemed to choke him His companion stood in humane surprise wondering what was to come At length with an effort mastering his feelings in a tolerably composed tone he spoke If I remember you are a mason mister Roberts Yes yes Averting himself a moment as to recover from a return of agitation the stranger grasped the other s hand and would you not loan a brother a shilling if he needed it The merchant started apparently almost as if to retreat Ah mister Roberts I trust you are not one of those business men who make a business of never having to do with unfortunates For God s sake don t leave me I have something on my heart on my heart Under deplorable circumstances thrown among strangers utter strangers I want a friend in whom I may confide Yours mister Roberts is almost the first known face I ve seen for many weeks It was so sudden an outburst the interview offered such a contrast to the scene around that the merchant though not used to be very indiscreet yet being not entirely inhumane remained not entirely unmoved The other still tremulous resumed I need not say sir how it cuts me to the soul to follow up a social salutation with such words as have just been mine I know that I jeopardize your good opinion But I can t help it necessity knows no law and heeds no risk Sir we are masons one more step aside I will tell you my story In a low half suppressed tone he began it Judging from his auditor s expression it seemed to be a tale of singular interest involving calamities against which no integrity no forethought no energy no genius no piety could guard At every disclosure the hearer s commiseration increased No sentimental pity As the story went on he drew from his wallet a bank note but after a while at some still more unhappy revelation changed it for another probably of a somewhat larger amount which when the story was concluded with an air studiously disclamatory of alms giving he put into the stranger s hands who on his side with an air studiously disclamatory of alms taking put it into his pocket Assistance being received the stranger s manner assumed a kind and degree of decorum which under the circumstances seemed almost coldness After some words not over ardent and yet not exactly inappropriate he took leave making a bow which had one knows not what of a certain chastened independence about it as if misery however burdensome could not break down self respect nor gratitude however deep humiliate a gentleman He was hardly yet out of sight when he paused as if thinking then with hastened steps returning to the merchant I am just reminded that the president who is also transfer agent of the Black Rapids Coal Company happens to be on board here and having been subpoenaed as witness in a stock case on the docket in Kentucky has his transfer book with him A month since in a panic contrived by artful alarmists some credulous stock holders sold out but to frustrate the aim of the alarmists the Company previously advised of their scheme so managed it as to get into its own hands those sacrificed shares resolved that since a spurious panic must be the panic makers should be no gainers by it The Company I hear is now ready but not anxious to redispose of those shares and having obtained them at their depressed value will now sell them at par though prior to the panic they were held at a handsome figure above That the readiness of the Company to do this is not generally known is shown by the fact that the stock still stands on the transfer book in the Company s name offering to one in funds a rare chance for investment For the panic subsiding more and more every day it will daily be seen how it originated confidence will be more than restored there will be a reaction from the stock s descent its rise will be higher than from no fall the holders trusting themselves to fear no second fate Having listened at first with curiosity at last with interest the merchant replied to the effect that some time since through friends concerned with it he had heard of the company and heard well of it but was ignorant that there had latterly been fluctuations He added that he was no speculator that hitherto he had avoided having to do with stocks of any sort but in the present case he really felt something like being tempted Pray in conclusion do you think that upon a pinch anything could be transacted on board here with the transfer agent Are you acquainted with him Not personally I but happened to hear that he was a passenger For the rest though it might be somewhat informal the gentleman might not object to doing a little business on board Along the Mississippi you know business is not so ceremonious as at the East True returned the merchant and looked down a moment in thought then raising his head quickly said in a tone not so benign as his wonted one This would seem a rare chance indeed why upon first hearing it did you not snatch at it I mean for yourself I would it had been possible Not without some emotion was this said and not without some embarrassment was the reply Ah yes I had forgotten Upon this the stranger regarded him with mild gravity not a little disconcerting the more so as there was in it what seemed the aspect not alone of the superior but as it were the rebuker which sort of bearing in a beneficiary towards his benefactor looked strangely enough none the less that somehow it sat not altogether unbecomingly upon the beneficiary being free from anything like the appearance of assumption and mixed with a kind of painful conscientiousness as though nothing but a proper sense of what he owed to himself swayed him At length he spoke To reproach a penniless man with remissness in not availing himself of an opportunity for pecuniary investment but no no it was forgetfulness and this charity will impute to some lingering effect of that unfortunate brain fever which as to occurrences dating yet further back disturbed mister Roberts s memory still more seriously As to that said the merchant rallying I am not Pardon me but you must admit that just now an unpleasant distrust however vague was yours Ah shallow as it is yet how subtle a thing is suspicion which at times can invade the humanest of hearts and wisest of heads But enough My object sir in calling your attention to this stock is by way of acknowledgment of your goodness I but seek to be grateful if my information leads to nothing you must remember the motive He bowed and finally retired leaving mister Roberts not wholly without self reproach for having momentarily indulged injurious thoughts against one who it was evident was possessed of a self respect which forbade his indulging them himself CHAPTER V THE MAN WITH THE WEED MAKES IT AN EVEN QUESTION WHETHER HE BE A GREAT SAGE OR A GREAT SIMPLETON Well there is sorrow in the world but goodness too and goodness that is not greenness either no more than sorrow is Dear good man Poor beating heart It was the man with the weed not very long after quitting the merchant murmuring to himself with his hand to his side like one with the heart disease Meditation over kindness received seemed to have softened him something too it may be beyond what might perhaps have been looked for from one whose unwonted self respect in the hour of need and in the act of being aided might have appeared to some not wholly unlike pride out of place and pride in any place is seldom very feeling But the truth perhaps is that those who are least touched with that vice besides being not unsusceptible to goodness are sometimes the ones whom a ruling sense of propriety makes appear cold if not thankless under a favor For at such a time to be full of warm earnest words and heart felt protestations is to create a scene and well bred people dislike few things more than that which would seem to look as if the world did not relish earnestness but not so because the world being earnest itself likes an earnest scene and an earnest man very well but only in their place the stage See what sad work they make of it who ignorant of this flame out in Irish enthusiasm and with Irish sincerity to a benefactor who if a man of sense and respectability as well as kindliness can but be more or less annoyed by it and if of a nervously fastidious nature as some are may be led to think almost as much less favorably of the beneficiary paining him by his gratitude as if he had been guilty of its contrary instead only of an indiscretion But beneficiaries who know better though they may feel as much if not more neither inflict such pain nor are inclined to run any risk of so doing And these being wise are the majority By which one sees how inconsiderate those persons are who from the absence of its officious manifestations in the world complain that there is not much gratitude extant when the truth is that there is as much of it as there is of modesty but both being for the most part votarists of the shade for the most part keep out of sight What started this was to account if necessary for the changed air of the man with the weed who throwing off in private the cold garb of decorum and so giving warmly loose to his genuine heart seemed almost transformed into another being This subdued air of softness too was toned with melancholy melancholy unreserved a thing which however at variance with propriety still the more attested his earnestness for one knows not how it is but it sometimes happens that where earnestness is there also is melancholy At the time he was leaning over the rail at the boat s side in his pensiveness unmindful of another pensive figure near a young gentleman with a swan neck wearing a lady like open shirt collar thrown back and tied with a black ribbon From a square tableted broach curiously engraved with Greek characters he seemed a collegian not improbably a sophomore on his travels possibly his first A small book bound in Roman vellum was in his hand Overhearing his murmuring neighbor the youth regarded him with some surprise not to say interest But singularly for a collegian being apparently of a retiring nature he did not speak when the other still more increased his diffidence by changing from soliloquy to colloquy in a manner strangely mixed of familiarity and pathos Ah who is this You did not hear me my young friend did you Why you too look sad My melancholy is not catching Sir sir stammered the other Pray now with a sort of sociable sorrowfulness slowly sliding along the rail Pray now my young friend what volume have you there Give me leave gently drawing it from him Tacitus Then opening it at random read In general a black and shameful period lies before me Dear young sir touching his arm alarmedly don t read this book It is poison moral poison Even were there truth in Tacitus such truth would have the operation of falsity and so still be poison moral poison Too well I know this Tacitus In my college days he came near souring me into cynicism Yes I began to turn down my collar and go about with a disdainfully joyless expression Sir sir I I Trust me Now young friend perhaps you think that Tacitus like me is only melancholy but he s more he s ugly A vast difference young sir between the melancholy view and the ugly The one may show the world still beautiful not so the other The one may be compatible with benevolence the other not The one may deepen insight the other shallows it Drop Tacitus Phrenologically my young friend you would seem to have a well developed head and large but cribbed within the ugly view the Tacitus view your large brain like your large ox in the contracted field will but starve the more And don t dream as some of you students may that by taking this same ugly view the deeper meanings of the deeper books will so alone become revealed to you Drop Tacitus His subtlety is falsity To him in his double refined anatomy of human nature is well applied the Scripture saying There is a subtle man and the same is deceived Drop Tacitus Come now let me throw the book overboard Sir I I Not a word I know just what is in your mind and that is just what I am speaking to Yes learn from me that though the sorrows of the world are great its wickedness that is its ugliness is small Much cause to pity man little to distrust him I myself have known adversity and know it still But for that do I turn cynic No no it is small beer that sours To my fellow creatures I owe alleviations So whatever I may have undergone it but deepens my confidence in my kind Now then winningly this book will you let me drown it for you Really sir I I see I see But of course you read Tacitus in order to aid you in understanding human nature as if truth was ever got at by libel My young friend if to know human nature is your object drop Tacitus and go north to the cemeteries of Auburn and Greenwood Upon my word I I Nay I foresee all that But you carry Tacitus that shallow Tacitus What do I carry See producing a pocket volume Akenside his Pleasures of Imagination One of these days you will know it Whatever our lot we should read serene and cheery books fitted to inspire love and trust But Tacitus I have long been of opinion that these classics are the bane of colleges for not to hint of the immorality of Ovid Horace Anacreon and the rest and the dangerous theology of Eschylus and others where will one find views so injurious to human nature as in Thucydides Juvenal Lucian but more particularly Tacitus When I consider that ever since the revival of learning these classics have been the favorites of successive generations of students and studious men I tremble to think of that mass of unsuspected heresy on every vital topic which for centuries must have simmered unsurmised in the heart of Christendom But Tacitus he is the most extraordinary example of a heretic not one iota of confidence in his kind What a mockery that such an one should be reputed wise and Thucydides be esteemed the statesman s manual But Tacitus I hate Tacitus not though I trust with the hate that sins but a righteous hate Without confidence himself Tacitus destroys it in all his readers Destroys confidence paternal confidence of which God knows that there is in this world none to spare For comparatively inexperienced as you are my dear young friend did you never observe how little very little confidence there is I mean between man and man more particularly between stranger and stranger In a sad world it is the saddest fact Confidence I have sometimes almost thought that confidence is fled that confidence is the New Astrea emigrated vanished gone Then softly sliding nearer with the softest air quivering down and looking up could you now my dear young sir under such circumstances by way of experiment simply have confidence in me From the outset the sophomore as has been seen had struggled with an ever increasing embarrassment arising perhaps from such strange remarks coming from a stranger such persistent and prolonged remarks too In vain had he more than once sought to break the spell by venturing a deprecatory or leave taking word In vain Somehow the stranger fascinated him Little wonder then that when the appeal came he could hardly speak but as before intimated being apparently of a retiring nature abruptly retired from the spot leaving the chagrined stranger to wander away in the opposite direction CHAPTER VI AT THE OUTSET OF WHICH CERTAIN PASSENGERS PROVE DEAF TO THE CALL OF CHARITY You pish Why will the captain suffer these begging fellows on board These pettish words were breathed by a well to do gentleman in a ruby colored velvet vest and with a ruby colored cheek a ruby headed cane in his hand to a man in a gray coat and white tie who shortly after the interview last described had accosted him for contributions to a Widow and Orphan Asylum recently founded among the Seminoles Upon a cursory view this last person might have seemed like the man with the weed one of the less unrefined children of misfortune but on a closer observation his countenance revealed little of sorrow though much of sanctity With added words of touchy disgust the well to do gentleman hurried away But though repulsed and rudely the man in gray did not reproach for a time patiently remaining in the chilly loneliness to which he had been left his countenance however not without token of latent though chastened reliance At length an old gentleman somewhat bulky drew nigh and from him also a contribution was sought Look you coming to a dead halt and scowling upon him Look you swelling his bulk out before him like a swaying balloon look you you on others behalf ask for money you a fellow with a face as long as my arm Hark ye now there is such a thing as gravity and in condemned felons it may be genuine but of long faces there are three sorts that of grief s drudge that of the lantern jawed man and that of the impostor You know best which yours is Heaven give you more charity sir And you less hypocrisy sir With which words the hard hearted old gentleman marched off While the other still stood forlorn the young clergyman before introduced passing that way catching a chance sight of him seemed suddenly struck by some recollection and after a moment s pause hurried up with Your pardon but shortly since I was all over looking for you For me as marveling that one of so little account should be sought for Yes for you do you know anything about the negro apparently a cripple aboard here Is he or is he not what he seems to be Ah poor Guinea have you too been distrusted you upon whom nature has placarded the evidence of your claims Then you do really know him and he is quite worthy It relieves me to hear it much relieves me Come let us go find him and see what can be done Another instance that confidence may come too late I am sorry to say that at the last landing I myself just happening to catch sight of him on the gangway plank assisted the cripple ashore No time to talk only to help He may not have told you but he has a brother in that vicinity Really I regret his going without my seeing him again regret it more perhaps than you can readily think You see shortly after leaving saint Louis he was on the forecastle and there with many others I saw him and put trust in him so much so that to convince those who did not I at his entreaty went in search of you you being one of several individuals he mentioned and whose personal appearance he more or less described individuals who he said would willingly speak for him But after diligent search not finding you and catching no glimpse of any of the others he had enumerated doubts were at last suggested but doubts indirectly originating as I can but think from prior distrust unfeelingly proclaimed by another Still certain it is I began to suspect Ha ha ha A sort of laugh more like a groan than a laugh and yet somehow it seemed intended for a laugh Both turned and the young clergyman started at seeing the wooden legged man close behind him morosely grave as a criminal judge with a mustard plaster on his back In the present case the mustard plaster might have been the memory of certain recent biting rebuffs and mortifications Wouldn t think it was I who laughed would you But who was it you laughed at or rather tried to laugh at demanded the young clergyman flushing me Neither you nor any one within a thousand miles of you But perhaps you don t believe it If he were of a suspicious temper he might not interposed the man in gray calmly it is one of the imbecilities of the suspicious person to fancy that every stranger however absent minded he sees so much as smiling or gesturing to himself in any odd sort of way is secretly making him his butt In some moods the movements of an entire street as the suspicious man walks down it will seem an express pantomimic jeer at him In short the suspicious man kicks himself with his own foot Whoever can do that ten to one he saves other folks sole leather said the wooden legged man with a crusty attempt at humor But with augmented grin and squirm turning directly upon the young clergyman you still think it was you I was laughing at just now To prove your mistake I will tell you what I was laughing at a story I happened to call to mind just then Whereupon in his porcupine way and with sarcastic details unpleasant to repeat he related a story which might perhaps in a good natured version be rendered as follows A certain Frenchman of New Orleans an old man less slender in purse than limb happening to attend the theatre one evening was so charmed with the character of a faithful wife as there represented to the life that nothing would do but he must marry upon it So marry he did a beautiful girl from Tennessee who had first attracted his attention by her liberal mould and was subsequently recommended to him through her kin for her equally liberal education and disposition Though large the praise proved not too much For ere long rumor more than corroborated it by whispering that the lady was liberal to a fault But though various circumstances which by most Benedicts would have been deemed all but conclusive were duly recited to the old Frenchman by his friends yet such was his confidence that not a syllable would he credit till chancing one night to return unexpectedly from a journey upon entering his apartment a stranger burst from the alcove Begar cried he now I begin to suspec His story told the wooden legged man threw back his head and gave vent to a long gasping rasping sort of taunting cry intolerable as that of a high pressure engine jeering off steam and that done with apparent satisfaction hobbled away Who is that scoffer said the man in gray not without warmth Who is he who even were truth on his tongue his way of speaking it would make truth almost offensive as falsehood Who is he He who I mentioned to you as having boasted his suspicion of the negro replied the young clergyman recovering from disturbance in short the person to whom I ascribe the origin of my own distrust he maintained that Guinea was some white scoundrel betwisted and painted up for a decoy Yes these were his very words I think Impossible he could not be so wrong headed Pray will you call him back and let me ask him if he were really in earnest The other complied and at length after no few surly objections prevailed upon the one legged individual to return for a moment Upon which the man in gray thus addressed him This reverend gentleman tells me sir that a certain cripple a poor negro is by you considered an ingenious impostor Now I am not unaware that there are some persons in this world who unable to give better proof of being wise take a strange delight in showing what they think they have sagaciously read in mankind by uncharitable suspicions of them I hope you are not one of these In short would you tell me now whether you were not merely joking in the notion you threw out about the negro Would you be so kind No I won t be so kind I ll be so cruel As you please about that Well he s just what I said he was A white masquerading as a black Exactly The man in gray glanced at the young clergyman a moment then quietly whispered to him I thought you represented your friend here as a very distrustful sort of person but he appears endued with a singular credulity Tell me sir do you really think that a white could look the negro so For one I should call it pretty good acting Not much better than any other man acts How Does all the world act Am I for instance an actor Is my reverend friend here too a performer Yes don t you both perform acts To do is to act so all doers are actors You trifle I ask again if a white how could he look the negro so Never saw the negro minstrels I suppose Yes but they are apt to overdo the ebony exemplifying the old saying not more just than charitable that the devil is never so black as he is painted But his limbs if not a cripple how could he twist his limbs so How do other hypocritical beggars twist theirs Easy enough to see how they are hoisted up The sham is evident then To the discerning eye with a horrible screw of his gimlet one Well where is Guinea said the man in gray where is he Let us at once find him and refute beyond cavil this injurious hypothesis Do so cried the one eyed man I m just in the humor now for having him found and leaving the streaks of these fingers on his paint as the lion leaves the streaks of his nails on a Caffre They wouldn t let me touch him before Yes find him I ll make wool fly and him after You forget here said the young clergyman to the man in gray that yourself helped poor Guinea ashore So I did so I did how unfortunate But look now to the other I think that without personal proof I can convince you of your mistake For I put it to you is it reasonable to suppose that a man with brains sufficient to act such a part as you say would take all that trouble and run all that hazard for the mere sake of those few paltry coppers which I hear was all he got for his pains if pains they were That puts the case irrefutably said the young clergyman with a challenging glance towards the one legged man You two green horns Money you think is the sole motive to pains and hazard deception and deviltry in this world How much money did the devil make by gulling Eve Whereupon he hobbled off again with a repetition of his intolerable jeer The man in gray stood silently eying his retreat a while and then turning to his companion said A bad man a dangerous man a man to be put down in any Christian community And this was he who was the means of begetting your distrust Ah we should shut our ears to distrust and keep them open only for its opposite You advance a principle which if I had acted upon it this morning I should have spared myself what I now feel That but one man and he with one leg should have such ill power given him his one sour word leavening into congenial sourness as to my knowledge it did the dispositions before sweet enough of a numerous company But as I hinted with me at the time his ill words went for nothing the same as now only afterwards they had effect and I confess this puzzles me It should not With humane minds the spirit of distrust works something as certain potions do it is a spirit which may enter such minds and yet for a time longer or shorter lie in them quiescent but only the more deplorable its ultimate activity An uncomfortable solution for since that baneful man did but just now anew drop on me his bane how shall I be sure that my present exemption from its effects will be lasting You cannot be sure but you can strive against it How By strangling the least symptom of distrust of any sort which hereafter upon whatever provocation may arise in you I will do so Then added as in soliloquy Indeed indeed I was to blame in standing passive under such influences as that one legged man s My conscience upbraids me The poor negro You see him occasionally perhaps No not often though in a few days as it happens my engagements will call me to the neighborhood of his present retreat and no doubt honest Guinea who is a grateful soul will come to see me there Then you have been his benefactor His benefactor I did not say that I have known him Take this mite Hand it to Guinea when you see him say it comes from one who has full belief in his honesty and is sincerely sorry for having indulged however transiently in a contrary thought I accept the trust And by the way since you are of this truly charitable nature you will not turn away an appeal in behalf of the Seminole Widow and Orphan Asylum I have not heard of that charity But recently founded After a pause the clergyman was irresolutely putting his hand in his pocket when caught by something in his companion s expression he eyed him inquisitively almost uneasily Ah well smiled the other wanly if that subtle bane we were speaking of but just now is so soon beginning to work in vain my appeal to you Good by Nay not untouched you do me injustice instead of indulging present suspicions I had rather make amends for previous ones Here is something for your asylum Not much but every drop helps Of course you have papers Of course producing a memorandum book and pencil Let me take down name and amount We publish these names And now let me give you a little history of our asylum and the providential way in which it was started CHAPTER VII A GENTLEMAN WITH GOLD SLEEVE BUTTONS At an interesting point of the narration and at the moment when with much curiosity indeed urgency the narrator was being particularly questioned upon that point he was as it happened altogether diverted both from it and his story by just then catching sight of a gentleman who had been standing in sight from the beginning but until now as it seemed without being observed by him Pardon me said he rising but yonder is one who I know will contribute and largely Don t take it amiss if I quit you Go duty before all things was the conscientious reply The stranger was a man of more than winsome aspect There he stood apart and in repose and yet by his mere look lured the man in gray from his story much as by its graciousness of bearing some full leaved elm alone in a meadow lures the noon sickleman to throw down his sheaves and come and apply for the alms of its shade But considering that goodness is no such rare thing among men the world familiarly know the noun a common one in every language it was curious that what so signalized the stranger and made him look like a kind of foreigner among the crowd as to some it make him appear more or less unreal in this portraiture was but the expression of so prevalent a quality Such goodness seemed his allied with such fortune that so far as his own personal experience could have gone scarcely could he have known ill physical or moral and as for knowing or suspecting the latter in any serious degree supposing such degree of it to be by observation or philosophy for that probably his nature by its opposition imperfectly qualified or from it wholly exempted For the rest he might have been five and fifty perhaps sixty but tall rosy between plump and portly with a primy palmy air and for the time and place not to hint of his years dressed with a strangely festive finish and elegance The inner side of his coat skirts was of white satin which might have looked especially inappropriate had it not seemed less a bit of mere tailoring than something of an emblem as it were an involuntary emblem let us say that what seemed so good about him was not all outside no the fine covering had a still finer lining Upon one hand he wore a white kid glove but the other hand which was ungloved looked hardly less white Now as the Fidele like most steamboats was upon deck a little soot streaked here and there especially about the railings it was marvel how under such circumstances these hands retained their spotlessness But if you watched them a while you noticed that they avoided touching anything you noticed in short that a certain negro body servant whose hands nature had dyed black perhaps with the same purpose that millers wear white this negro servant s hands did most of his master s handling for him having to do with dirt on his account but not to his prejudices But if with the same undefiledness of consequences to himself a gentleman could also sin by deputy how shocking would that be But it is not permitted to be and even if it were no judicious moralist would make proclamation of it This gentleman therefore there is reason to affirm was one who like the Hebrew governor knew how to keep his hands clean and who never in his life happened to be run suddenly against by hurrying house painter or sweep in a word one whose very good luck it was to be a very good man Not that he looked as if he were a kind of Wilberforce at all that superior merit probably was not his nothing in his manner bespoke him righteous but only good and though to be good is much below being righteous and though there is a difference between the two yet not it is to be hoped so incompatible as that a righteous man can not be a good man though conversely in the pulpit it has been with much cogency urged that a merely good man that is one good merely by his nature is so far from there by being righteous that nothing short of a total change and conversion can make him so which is something which no honest mind well read in the history of righteousness will care to deny nevertheless since saint Paul himself agreeing in a sense with the pulpit distinction though not altogether in the pulpit deduction and also pretty plainly intimating which of the two qualities in question enjoys his apostolic preference I say since saint Paul has so meaningly said that scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die therefore when we repeat of this gentleman that he was only a good man whatever else by severe censors may be objected to him it is still to be hoped that his goodness will not at least be considered criminal in him At all events no man not even a righteous man would think it quite right to commit this gentleman to prison for the crime extraordinary as he might deem it more especially as until everything could be known there would be some chance that the gentleman might after all be quite as innocent of it as he himself It was pleasant to mark the good man s reception of the salute of the righteous man that is the man in gray his inferior apparently not more in the social scale than in stature Like the benign elm again the good man seemed to wave the canopy of his goodness over that suitor not in conceited condescension but with that even amenity of true majesty which can be kind to any one without stooping to it To the plea in behalf of the Seminole widows and orphans the gentleman after a question or two duly answered responded by producing an ample pocket book in the good old capacious style of fine green French morocco and workmanship bound with silk of the same color not to omit bills crisp with newness fresh from the bank no muckworms grime upon them Lucre those bills might be but as yet having been kept unspotted from the world not of the filthy sort Placing now three of those virgin bills in the applicant s hands he hoped that the smallness of the contribution would be pardoned to tell the truth and this at last accounted for his toilet he was bound but a short run down the river to attend in a festive grove the afternoon wedding of his niece so did not carry much money with him The other was about expressing his thanks when the gentleman in his pleasant way checked him the gratitude was on the other side To him he said charity was in one sense not an effort but a luxury against too great indulgence in which his steward a humorist had sometimes admonished him In some general talk which followed relative to organized modes of doing good the gentleman expressed his regrets that so many benevolent societies as there were here and there isolated in the land should not act in concert by coming together in the way that already in each society the individuals composing it had done which would result he thought in like advantages upon a larger scale Indeed such a confederation might perhaps be attended with as happy results as politically attended that of the states Upon his hitherto moderate enough companion this suggestion had an effect illustrative in a sort of that notion of Socrates that the soul is a harmony for as the sound of a flute in any particular key will it is said audibly affect the corresponding chord of any harp in good tune within hearing just so now did some string in him respond and with animation Which animation by the way might seem more or less out of character in the man in gray considering his unsprightly manner when first introduced had he not already in certain after colloquies given proof in some degree of the fact that with certain natures a soberly continent air at times so far from arguing emptiness of stuff is good proof it is there and plenty of it because unwasted and may be used the more effectively too when opportunity offers What now follows on the part of the man in gray will still further exemplify perhaps somewhat strikingly the truth or what appears to be such of this remark Sir said he eagerly I am before you A project not dissimilar to yours was by me thrown out at the World s Fair in London World s Fair You there Pray how was that First let me Nay but first tell me what took you to the Fair I went to exhibit an invalid s easy chair I had invented Then you have not always been in the charity business Is it not charity to ease human suffering I am and always have been as I always will be I trust in the charity business as you call it but charity is not like a pin one to make the head and the other the point charity is a work to which a good workman may be competent in all its branches I invented my Protean easy chair in odd intervals stolen from meals and sleep You call it the Protean easy chair pray describe it My Protean easy chair is a chair so all over bejointed behinged and bepadded everyway so elastic springy and docile to the airiest touch that in some one of its endlessly changeable accommodations of back seat footboard and arms the most restless body the body most racked nay I had almost added the most tormented conscience must somehow and somewhere find rest Believing that I owed it to suffering humanity to make known such a chair to the utmost I scraped together my little means and off to the World s Fair with it You did right But your scheme how did you come to hit upon that I was going to tell you After seeing my invention duly catalogued and placed I gave myself up to pondering the scene about me As I dwelt upon that shining pageant of arts and moving concourse of nations and reflected that here was the pride of the world glorying in a glass house a sense of the fragility of worldly grandeur profoundly impressed me And I said to myself I will see if this occasion of vanity cannot supply a hint toward a better profit than was designed Let some world wide good to the world wide cause be now done In short inspired by the scene on the fourth day I issued at the World s Fair my prospectus of the World s Charity Quite a thought But pray explain it The World s Charity is to be a society whose members shall comprise deputies from every charity and mission extant the one object of the society to be the methodization of the world s benevolence to which end the present system of voluntary and promiscuous contribution to be done away and the Society to be empowered by the various governments to levy annually one grand benevolence tax upon all mankind as in Augustus Caesar s time the whole world to come up to be taxed a tax which for the scheme of it should be something like the income tax in England a tax also as before hinted to be a consolidation tax of all possible benevolence taxes as in America here the state tax and the county tax and the town tax and the poll tax are by the assessors rolled into one This tax according to my tables calculated with care would result in the yearly raising of a fund little short of eight hundred millions this fund to be annually applied to such objects and in such modes as the various charities and missions in general congress represented might decree whereby in fourteen years as I estimate there would have been devoted to good works the sum of eleven thousand two hundred millions which would warrant the dissolution of the society as that fund judiciously expended not a pauper or heathen could remain the round world over Eleven thousand two hundred millions And all by passing round a hat as it were Yes I am no Fourier the projector of an impossible scheme but a philanthropist and a financier setting forth a philanthropy and a finance which are practicable Practicable Yes Eleven thousand two hundred millions it will frighten none but a retail philanthropist What is it but eight hundred millions for each of fourteen years Now eight hundred millions what is that to average it but one little dollar a head for the population of the planet And who will refuse what Turk or Dyak even his own little dollar for sweet charity s sake Eight hundred millions More than that sum is yearly expended by mankind not only in vanities but miseries Consider that bloody spendthrift War And are mankind so stupid so wicked that upon the demonstration of these things they will not amending their ways devote their superfluities to blessing the world instead of cursing it Eight hundred millions They have not to make it it is theirs already they have but to direct it from ill to good And to this scarce a self denial is demanded Actually they would not in the mass be one farthing the poorer for it as certainly would they be all the better and happier Don t you see But admit as you must that mankind is not mad and my project is practicable For what creature but a madman would not rather do good than ill when it is plain that good or ill it must return upon himself Your sort of reasoning said the good gentleman adjusting his gold sleeve buttons seems all reasonable enough but with mankind it wont do Then mankind are not reasoning beings if reason wont do with them That is not to the purpose By the way from the manner in which you alluded to the world s census it would appear that according to your world wide scheme the pauper not less than the nabob is to contribute to the relief of pauperism and the heathen not less than the Christian to the conversion of heathenism How is that Why that pardon me is quibbling Now no philanthropist likes to be opposed with quibbling Well I won t quibble any more But after all if I understand your project there is little specially new in it further than the magnifying of means now in operation Magnifying and energizing For one thing missions I would thoroughly reform Missions I would quicken with the Wall street spirit The Wall street spirit Yes for if confessedly certain spiritual ends are to be gained but through the auxiliary agency of worldly means then to the surer gaining of such spiritual ends the example of worldly policy in worldly projects should not by spiritual projectors be slighted In brief the conversion of the heathen so far at least as depending on human effort would by the world s charity be let out on contract So much by bid for converting India so much for Borneo so much for Africa Competition allowed stimulus would be given There would be no lethargy of monopoly We should have no mission house or tract house of which slanderers could with any plausibility say that it had degenerated in its clerkships into a sort of custom house But the main point is the Archimedean money power that would be brought to bear You mean the eight hundred million power Yes You see this doing good to the world by driblets amounts to just nothing I am for doing good to the world with a will I am for doing good to the world once for all and having done with it Do but think my dear sir of the eddies and maelstroms of pagans in China People here have no conception of it Of a frosty morning in Hong Kong pauper pagans are found dead in the streets like so many nipped peas in a bin of peas To be an immortal being in China is no more distinction than to be a snow flake in a snow squall What are a score or two of missionaries to such a people A pinch of snuff to the kraken I am for sending ten thousand missionaries in a body and converting the Chinese en masse within six months of the debarkation The thing is then done and turn to something else I fear you are too enthusiastic A philanthropist is necessarily an enthusiast for without enthusiasm what was ever achieved but commonplace But again consider the poor in London To that mob of misery what is a joint here and a loaf there I am for voting to them twenty thousand bullocks and one hundred thousand barrels of flour to begin with They are then comforted and no more hunger for one while among the poor of London And so all round Sharing the character of your general project these things I take it are rather examples of wonders that were to be wished than wonders that will happen And is the age of wonders passed Is the world too old Is it barren Think of Sarah Then I am Abraham reviling the angel with a smile But still as to your design at large there seems a certain audacity But if to the audacity of the design there be brought a commensurate circumspectness of execution how then Why do you really believe that your world s charity will ever go into operation I have confidence that it will But may you not be over confident For a Christian to talk so But think of the obstacles Obstacles I have confidence to remove obstacles though mountains Yes confidence in the world s charity to that degree that as no better person offers to supply the place I have nominated myself provisional treasurer and will be happy to receive subscriptions for the present to be devoted to striking off a million more of my prospectuses The talk went on the man in gray revealed a spirit of benevolence which mindful of the millennial promise had gone abroad over all the countries of the globe much as the diligent spirit of the husbandman stirred by forethought of the coming seed time leads him in March reveries at his fireside over every field of his farm The master chord of the man in gray had been touched and it seemed as if it would never cease vibrating A not unsilvery tongue too was his with gestures that were a Pentecost of added ones and persuasiveness before which granite hearts might crumble into gravel Strange therefore how his auditor so singularly good hearted as he seemed remained proof to such eloquence though not as it turned out to such pleadings For after listening a while longer with pleasant incredulity presently as the boat touched his place of destination the gentleman with a look half humor half pity put another bank note into his hands charitable to the last if only to the dreams of enthusiasm CHAPTER VIII A CHARITABLE LADY If a drunkard in a sober fit is the dullest of mortals an enthusiast in a reason fit is not the most lively And this without prejudice to his greatly improved understanding for if his elation was the height of his madness his despondency is but the extreme of his sanity Something thus now to all appearance with the man in gray Society his stimulus loneliness was his lethargy Loneliness like the sea breeze blowing off from a thousand leagues of blankness he did not find as veteran solitaires do if anything too bracing In short left to himself with none to charm forth his latent lymphatic he insensibly resumes his original air a quiescent one blended of sad humility and demureness Ere long he goes laggingly into the ladies saloon as in spiritless quest of somebody but after some disappointed glances about him seats himself upon a sofa with an air of melancholy exhaustion and depression At the sofa s further end sits a plump and pleasant person whose aspect seems to hint that if she have any weak point it must be anything rather than her excellent heart From her twilight dress neither dawn nor dark apparently she is a widow just breaking the chrysalis of her mourning A small gilt testament is in her hand which she has just been reading Half relinquished she holds the book in reverie her finger inserted at the xiii of first Corinthians to which chapter possibly her attention might have recently been turned by witnessing the scene of the monitory mute and his slate The sacred page no longer meets her eye but as at evening when for a time the western hills shine on though the sun be set her thoughtful face retains its tenderness though the teacher is forgotten Meantime the expression of the stranger is such as ere long to attract her glance But no responsive one Presently in her somewhat inquisitive survey her volume drops It is restored No encroaching politeness in the act but kindness unadorned The eyes of the lady sparkle Evidently she is not now unprepossessed Soon bending over in a low sad tone full of deference the stranger breathes Madam pardon my freedom but there is something in that face which strangely draws me May I ask are you a sister of the Church Why really you In concern for her embarrassment he hastens to relieve it but without seeming so to do It is very solitary for a brother here eying the showy ladies brocaded in the background I find none to mingle souls with It may be wrong I know it is but I cannot force myself to be easy with the people of the world I prefer the company however silent of a brother or sister in good standing By the way madam may I ask if you have confidence Really sir why sir really I Could you put confidence in me for instance Really sir as much I mean as one may wisely put in a a stranger an entire stranger I had almost said rejoined the lady hardly yet at ease in her affability drawing aside a little in body while at the same time her heart might have been drawn as far the other way A natural struggle between charity and prudence Entire stranger with a sigh Ah who would be a stranger In vain I wander no one will have confidence in me You interest me said the good lady in mild surprise Can I any way befriend you No one can befriend me who has not confidence But I I have at least to that degree I mean that Nay nay you have none none at all Pardon I see it No confidence Fool fond fool that I am to seek it You are unjust sir rejoins the good lady with heightened interest but it may be that something untoward in your experiences has unduly biased you Not that I would cast reflections Believe me I yes yes I may say that that That you have confidence Prove it Let me have twenty dollars Twenty dollars There I told you madam you had no confidence The lady was in an extraordinary way touched She sat in a sort of restless torment knowing not which way to turn She began twenty different sentences and left off at the first syllable of each At last in desperation she hurried out Tell me sir for what you want the twenty dollars And did I not then glancing at her half mourning for the widow and the fatherless I am traveling agent of the Widow and Orphan Asylum recently founded among the Seminoles And why did you not tell me your object before As not a little relieved Poor souls Indians too those cruelly used Indians Here here how could I hesitate I am so sorry it is no more Grieve not for that madam rising and folding up the bank notes This is an inconsiderable sum I admit but taking out his pencil and book though I here but register the amount there is another register where is set down the motive Good bye you have confidence Yea you can say to me as the apostle said to the Corinthians I rejoice that I have confidence in you in all things CHAPTER IX TWO BUSINESS MEN TRANSACT A LITTLE BUSINESS Pray sir have you seen a gentleman with a weed hereabouts rather a saddish gentleman Strange where he can have gone to I was talking with him not twenty minutes since By a brisk ruddy cheeked man in a tasseled traveling cap carrying under his arm a ledger like volume the above words were addressed to the collegian before introduced suddenly accosted by the rail to which not long after his retreat as in a previous chapter recounted he had returned and there remained Have you seen him sir Rallied from his apparent diffidence by the genial jauntiness of the stranger the youth answered with unwonted promptitude Yes a person with a weed was here not very long ago Saddish Yes and a little cracked too I should say It was he Misfortune I fear has disturbed his brain Now quick which way did he go Why just in the direction from which you came the gangway yonder Did he Then the man in the gray coat whom I just met said right he must have gone ashore How unlucky He stood vexedly twitching at his cap tassel which fell over by his whisker and continued Well I am very sorry In fact I had something for him here Then drawing nearer you see he applied to me for relief no I do him injustice not that but he began to intimate you understand Well being very busy just then I declined quite rudely too in a cold morose unfeeling way I fear At all events not three minutes afterwards I felt self reproach with a kind of prompting very peremptory to deliver over into that unfortunate man s hands a ten dollar bill You smile Yes it may be superstition but I can t help it I have my weak side thank God Then again he rapidly went on we have been so very prosperous lately in our affairs by we I mean the Black Rapids Coal Company that really out of my abundance associative and individual it is but fair that a charitable investment or two should be made don t you think so Sir said the collegian without the least embarrassment do I understand that you are officially connected with the Black Rapids Coal Company Yes I happen to be president and transfer agent You are Yes but what is it to you You don t want to invest Why do you sell the stock Some might be bought perhaps but why do you ask you don t want to invest But supposing I did with cool self collectedness could you do up the thing for me and here Bless my soul gazing at him in amaze really you are quite a business man Positively I feel afraid of you Oh no need of that You could sell me some of that stock then I don t know I don t know To be sure there are a few shares under peculiar circumstances bought in by the Company but it would hardly be the thing to convert this boat into the Company s office I think you had better defer investing So with an indifferent air you have seen the unfortunate man I spoke of Let the unfortunate man go his ways What is that large book you have with you My transfer book I am subpoenaed with it to court Black Rapids Coal Company obliquely reading the gilt inscription on the back I have heard much of it Pray do you happen to have with you any statement of the condition of your company A statement has lately been printed Pardon me but I am naturally inquisitive Have you a copy with you I tell you again I do not think that it would be suitable to convert this boat into the Company s office That unfortunate man did you relieve him at all Let the unfortunate man relieve himself Hand me the statement Well you are such a business man I can hardly deny you Here handing a small printed pamphlet The youth turned it over sagely I hate a suspicious man said the other observing him but I must say I like to see a cautious one I can gratify you there languidly returning the pamphlet for as I said before I am naturally inquisitive I am also circumspect No appearances can deceive me Your statement he added tells a very fine story but pray was not your stock a little heavy awhile ago downward tendency Sort of low spirits among holders on the subject of that stock Yes there was a depression But how came it who devised it The bears sir The depression of our stock was solely owing to the growling the hypocritical growling of the bears How hypocritical Why the most monstrous of all hypocrites are these bears hypocrites by inversion hypocrites in the simulation of things dark instead of bright souls that thrive less upon depression than the fiction of depression professors of the wicked art of manufacturing depressions spurious Jeremiahs sham Heraclituses who the lugubrious day done return like sham Lazaruses among the beggars to make merry over the gains got by their pretended sore heads scoundrelly bears You are warm against these bears If I am it is less from the remembrance of their stratagems as to our stock than from the persuasion that these same destroyers of confidence and gloomy philosophers of the stock market though false in themselves are yet true types of most destroyers of confidence and gloomy philosophers the world over Fellows who whether in stocks politics bread stuffs morals metaphysics religion be it what it may trump up their black panics in the naturally quiet brightness solely with a view to some sort of covert advantage That corpse of calamity which the gloomy philosopher parades is but his Good Enough Morgan I rather like that knowingly drawled the youth I fancy these gloomy souls as little as the next one Sitting on my sofa after a champagne dinner smoking my plantation cigar if a gloomy fellow come to me what a bore You tell him it s all stuff don t you I tell him it ain t natural I say to him you are happy enough and you know it and everybody else is as happy as you and you know that too and we shall all be happy after we are no more and you know that too but no still you must have your sulk And do you know whence this sort of fellow gets his sulk not from life for he s often too much of a recluse or else too young to have seen anything of it No he gets it from some of those old plays he sees on the stage or some of those old books he finds up in garrets Ten to one he has lugged home from auction a musty old Seneca and sets about stuffing himself with that stale old hay and thereupon thinks it looks wise and antique to be a croaker thinks it s taking a stand way above his kind Just so assented the youth I ve lived some and seen a good many such ravens at second hand By the way strange how that man with the weed you were inquiring for seemed to take me for some soft sentimentalist only because I kept quiet and thought because I had a copy of Tacitus with me that I was reading him for his gloom instead of his gossip But I let him talk And indeed by my manner humored him You shouldn t have done that now Unfortunate man you must have made quite a fool of him His own fault if I did But I like prosperous fellows comfortable fellows fellows that talk comfortably and prosperously like you Such fellows are generally honest And I say now I happen to have a superfluity in my pocket and I ll just Act the part of a brother to that unfortunate man Let the unfortunate man be his own brother What are you dragging him in for all the time One would think you didn t care to register any transfers or dispose of any stock mind running on something else I say I will invest Stay stay here come some uproarious fellows this way this way And with off handed politeness the man with the book escorted his companion into a private little haven removed from the brawling swells without Business transacted the two came forth and walked the deck Now tell me sir said he with the book how comes it that a young gentleman like you a sedate student at the first appearance should dabble in stocks and that sort of thing There are certain sophomorean errors in the world drawled the sophomore deliberately adjusting his shirt collar not the least of which is the popular notion touching the nature of the modern scholar and the nature of the modern scholastic sedateness So it seems so it seems Really this is quite a new leaf in my experience Experience sir originally observed the sophomore is the only teacher Hence am I your pupil for it s only when experience speaks that I can endure to listen to speculation My speculations sir dryly drawing himself up have been chiefly governed by the maxim of Lord Bacon I speculate in those philosophies which come home to my business and bosom pray do you know of any other good stocks You wouldn t like to be concerned in the New Jerusalem would you New Jerusalem Yes the new and thriving city so called in northern Minnesota It was originally founded by certain fugitive Mormons Hence the name It stands on the Mississippi Here here is the map producing a roll There there you see are the public buildings here the landing there the park yonder the botanic gardens and this this little dot here is a perpetual fountain you understand You observe there are twenty asterisks Those are for the lyceums They have lignum vitae rostrums And are all these buildings now standing All standing bona fide These marginal squares here are they the water lots Water lots in the city of New Jerusalem All terra firma you don t seem to care about investing though Hardly think I should read my title clear as the law students say yawned the collegian Prudent you are prudent Don t know that you are wholly out either At any rate I would rather have one of your shares of coal stock than two of this other Still considering that the first settlement was by two fugitives who had swum over naked from the opposite shore it s a surprising place It is bona fide But dear me I must go Oh if by possibility you should come across that unfortunate man In that case with drawling impatience I will send for the steward and have him and his misfortunes consigned overboard Ha ha now were some gloomy philosopher here some theological bear forever taking occasion to growl down the stock of human nature with ulterior views d ye see to a fat benefice in the gift of the worshipers of Ariamius he would pronounce that the sign of a hardening heart and a softening brain Yes that would be his sinister construction But it s nothing more than the oddity of a genial humor genial but dry Confess it Good bye CHAPTER X IN THE CABIN Stools settees sofas divans ottomans occupying them are clusters of men old and young wise and simple in their hands are cards spotted with diamonds spades clubs hearts the favorite games are whist cribbage and brag Lounging in arm chairs or sauntering among the marble topped tables amused with the scene are the comparatively few who instead of having hands in the games for the most part keep their hands in their pockets These may be the philosophes But here and there with a curious expression one is reading a small sort of handbill of anonymous poetry rather wordily entitled ODE ON THE INTIMATIONS OF DISTRUST IN MAN UNWILLINGLY INFERRED FROM REPEATED REPULSES IN DISINTERESTED ENDEAVORS TO PROCURE HIS CONFIDENCE On the floor are many copies looking as if fluttered down from a balloon The way they came there was this A somewhat elderly person in the quaker dress had quietly passed through the cabin and much in the manner of those railway book peddlers who precede their proffers of sale by a distribution of puffs direct or indirect of the volumes to follow had without speaking handed about the odes which for the most part after a cursory glance had been disrespectfully tossed aside as no doubt the moonstruck production of some wandering rhapsodist In due time book under arm in trips the ruddy man with the traveling cap who lightly moving to and fro looks animatedly about him with a yearning sort of gratulatory affinity and longing expressive of the very soul of sociality as much as to say Oh boys would that I were personally acquainted with each mother s son of you since what a sweet world to make sweet acquaintance in is ours my brothers yea and what dear happy dogs are we all And just as if he had really warbled it forth he makes fraternally up to one lounging stranger or another exchanging with him some pleasant remark Pray what have you there he asked of one newly accosted a little dried up man who looked as if he never dined A little ode rather queer too was the reply of the same sort you see strewn on the floor here I did not observe them Let me see picking one up and looking it over Well now this is pretty plaintive especially the opening Alas for man he hath small sense Of genial trust and confidence If it be so alas for him indeed Runs off very smoothly sir Beautiful pathos But do you think the sentiment just As to that said the little dried up man I think it a kind of queer thing altogether and yet I am almost ashamed to add it really has set me to thinking yes and to feeling Just now somehow I feel as it were trustful and genial I don t know that ever I felt so much so before I am naturally numb in my sensibilities but this ode in its way works on my numbness not unlike a sermon which by lamenting over my lying dead in trespasses and sins thereby stirs me up to be all alive in well doing Glad to hear it and hope you will do well as the doctors say But who snowed the odes about here I cannot say I have not been here long Wasn t an angel was it Come you say you feel genial let us do as the rest and have cards Thank you I never play cards A bottle of wine Thank you I never drink wine Cigars Thank you I never smoke cigars Tell stories To speak truly I hardly think I know one worth telling Seems to me then this geniality you say you feel waked in you is as water power in a land without mills Come you had better take a genial hand at the cards To begin we will play for as small a sum as you please just enough to make it interesting Indeed you must excuse me Somehow I distrust cards What distrust cards Genial cards Then for once I join with our sad Philomel here Alas for man he hath small sense Of genial trust and confidence Good bye Sauntering and chatting here and there again he with the book at length seems fatigued looks round for a seat and spying a partly vacant settee drawn up against the side drops down there soon like his chance neighbor who happens to be the good merchant becoming not a little interested in the scene more immediately before him a party at whist two cream faced giddy unpolished youths the one in a red cravat the other in a green opposed to two bland grave handsome self possessed men of middle age decorously dressed in a sort of professional black and apparently doctors of some eminence in the civil law By and by after a preliminary scanning of the new comer next him the good merchant sideways leaning over whispers behind a crumpled copy of the Ode which he holds Sir I don t like the looks of those two do you Hardly was the whispered reply those colored cravats are not in the best taste at least not to mine but my taste is no rule for all You mistake I mean the other two and I don t refer to dress but countenance I confess I am not familiar with such gentry any further than reading about them in the papers but those two are are sharpers aint they Far be from us the captious and fault finding spirit my dear sir Indeed sir I would not find fault I am little given that way but certainly to say the least these two youths can hardly be adepts while the opposed couple may be even more You would not hint that the colored cravats would be so bungling as to lose and the dark cravats so dextrous as to cheat Sour imaginations my dear sir Dismiss them To little purpose have you read the Ode you have there Years and experience I trust have not sophisticated you A fresh and liberal construction would teach us to regard those four players indeed this whole cabin full of players as playing at games in which every player plays fair and not a player but shall win Now you hardly mean that because games in which all may win such games remain as yet in this world uninvented I think Come come luxuriously laying himself back and casting a free glance upon the players fares all paid digestion sound care toil penury grief unknown lounging on this sofa with waistband relaxed why not be cheerfully resigned to one s fate nor peevishly pick holes in the blessed fate of the world Upon this the good merchant after staring long and hard and then rubbing his forehead fell into meditation at first uneasy but at last composed and in the end once more addressed his companion Well I see it s good to out with one s private thoughts now and then Somehow I don t know why a certain misty suspiciousness seems inseparable from most of one s private notions about some men and some things but once out with these misty notions and their mere contact with other men s soon dissipates or at least modifies them You think I have done you good then may be I have But don t thank me don t thank me If by words casually delivered in the social hour I do any good to right or left it is but involuntary influence locust tree sweetening the herbage under it no merit at all mere wholesome accident of a wholesome nature Don t you see Another stare from the good merchant and both were silent again Finding his book hitherto resting on his lap rather irksome there the owner now places it edgewise on the settee between himself and neighbor in so doing chancing to expose the lettering on the back Black Rapids Coal Company which the good merchant scrupulously honorable had much ado to avoid reading so directly would it have fallen under his eye had he not conscientiously averted it On a sudden as if just reminded of something the stranger starts up and moves away in his haste leaving his book which the merchant observing without delay takes it up and hurrying after civilly returns it in which act he could not avoid catching sight by an involuntary glance of part of the lettering Thank you thank you my good sir said the other receiving the volume and was resuming his retreat when the merchant spoke Excuse me but are you not in some way connected with the the Coal Company I have heard of There is more than one Coal Company that may be heard of my good sir smiled the other pausing with an expression of painful impatience disinterestedly mastered But you are connected with one in particular The Black Rapids are you not How did you find that out Well sir I have heard rather tempting information of your Company Who is your informant pray somewhat coldly A a person by the name of Ringman Don t know him But doubtless there are plenty who know our Company whom our Company does not know in the same way that one may know an individual yet be unknown to him Known this Ringman long Old friend I suppose But pardon I must leave you Stay sir that that stock Stock Yes it s a little irregular perhaps but Dear me you don t think of doing any business with me do you In my official capacity I have not been authenticated to you This transfer book now holding it up so as to bring the lettering in sight how do you know that it may not be a bogus one And I being personally a stranger to you how can you have confidence in me Because knowingly smiled the good merchant if you were other than I have confidence that you are hardly would you challenge distrust that way But you have not examined my book What need to if already I believe that it is what it is lettered to be But you had better It might suggest doubts Doubts may be it might suggest but not knowledge for how by examining the book should I think I knew any more than I now think I do since if it be the true book I think it so already and since if it be otherwise then I have never seen the true one and don t know what that ought to look like Your logic I will not criticize but your confidence I admire and earnestly too jocose as was the method I took to draw it out Enough we will go to yonder table and if there be any business which either in my private or official capacity I can help you do pray command me CHAPTER XI ONLY A PAGE OR SO The transaction concluded the two still remained seated falling into familiar conversation by degrees verging into that confidential sort of sympathetic silence 
1492-55449-0000	train-other-500	the last refinement and luxury of unaffected good feeling A kind of social superstition to suppose that to be truly friendly one must be saying friendly words all the time any more than be doing friendly deeds continually
1492-55449-0001	train-other-500	True friendliness like true religion being in a sort independent of works At length the good merchant whose eyes were pensively resting upon the gay tables in the distance
1492-55449-0002	train-other-500	broke the spell by saying that from the spectacle before them one would little divine what other quarters of the boat might reveal He cited the case accidentally encountered but an hour or two previous of a shrunken old miser clad in
1492-55449-0003	train-other-500	shrunken old moleskin stretched out an invalid on a bare plank in the emigrants quarters eagerly clinging to life and lucre though the one was gasping for outlet and about the other he was in torment lest death or
1492-55449-0004	train-other-500	some other unprincipled cut purse should be the means of his losing it by like feeble tenure holding lungs and pouch and yet knowing and desiring nothing beyond them for his mind never raised above mould was now
1492-55449-0005	train-other-500	all but mouldered away To such a degree indeed that he had no trust in anything not even in his parchment bonds which the better to preserve from the tooth of time he had packed down and sealed up like brandy peaches in a tin case of spirits
none	none	 The worthy man proceeded at some length with these dispiriting particulars Nor would his cheery companion wholly deny that there might be a point of view from which such a case of extreme want of confidence might to the humane mind present features not altogether welcome as wine and olives after dinner Still he was not without compensatory considerations and upon the whole took his companion to task for evincing what in a good natured round about way 
1492-55449-0006	train-other-500	he hinted to be a somewhat jaundiced sentimentality Nature he added in Shakespeare s words had meal and bran and rightly regarded the bran in its way was not to be condemned
1492-55449-0007	train-other-500	The other was not disposed to question the justice of Shakespeare s thought but would hardly admit the propriety of the application in this instance much less of the comment So after some further temperate discussion of the pitiable miser
1492-55449-0008	train-other-500	finding that they could not entirely harmonize the merchant cited another case that of the negro cripple But his companion suggested whether the alleged hardships of that alleged unfortunate might not exist more in the pity of the observer
1492-55449-0009	train-other-500	than the experience of the observed He knew nothing about the cripple nor had seen him but ventured to surmise that could one but get at the real state of his heart he would be found about as happy as most men if not
1492-55449-0010	train-other-500	in fact full as happy as the speaker himself He added that negroes were by nature a singularly cheerful race no one ever heard of a native born African Zimmermann or Torquemada that even from religion they dismissed all gloom
1492-55449-0011	train-other-500	in their hilarious rituals they danced so to speak and as it were cut pigeon wings It was improbable therefore that a negro however reduced to his stumps by fortune could be ever thrown off the legs of a laughing philosophy
1492-55449-0012	train-other-500	Foiled again the good merchant would not desist but ventured still a third case that of the man with the weed whose story as narrated by himself and confirmed and filled out by the testimony of a certain man in a gray coat
1492-55449-0013	train-other-500	whom the merchant had afterwards met he now proceeded to give and that without holding back those particulars disclosed by the second informant but which delicacy had prevented the unfortunate man himself from touching upon
none	none	 But as the good merchant could perhaps do better justice to the man than the story we shall venture to tell it in other words than his though not to any other effect CHAPTER XII STORY OF THE UNFORTUNATE MAN 
1492-55449-0015	train-other-500	FROM WHICH MAY BE GATHERED WHETHER OR NO HE HAS BEEN JUSTLY SO ENTITLED It appeared that the unfortunate man had had for a wife one of those natures anomalously vicious
1492-55449-0016	train-other-500	which would almost tempt a metaphysical lover of our species to doubt whether the human form be in all cases conclusive evidence of humanity whether sometimes it may not be a kind of unpledged and indifferent tabernacle and whether

1492-55449-0017	train-other-500	an unaccountable one considering that he himself was so good a man that he who hates vice hates humanity it should not in self defense be held for a reasonable maxim that none but the good are human
1492-55449-0018	train-other-500	Goneril was young in person lithe and straight too straight indeed for a woman a complexion naturally rosy and which would have been charmingly so but for a certain hardness and bakedness
1492-55449-0019	train-other-500	like that of the glazed colors on stone ware Her hair was of a deep rich chestnut but worn in close short curls all round her head Her Indian figure was not without its impairing effect on her bust
none	none	 while her mouth would have been pretty but for a trace of moustache 
1492-55449-0020	train-other-500	Upon the whole aided by the resources of the toilet her appearance at distance was such that some might have thought her if anything rather beautiful though of a style of beauty rather peculiar and cactus like
none	none	 It was happy for Goneril that her more striking peculiarities were less of the person than of temper and taste One hardly knows how to reveal that 
1492-55449-0021	train-other-500	while having a natural antipathy to such things as the breast of chicken or custard or peach or grape Goneril could yet in private make a satisfactory lunch on hard crackers and brawn of ham She liked lemons
1492-55449-0022	train-other-500	and the only kind of candy she loved were little dried sticks of blue clay secretly carried in her pocket Withal she had hard steady health like a squaw s with as firm a spirit and resolution
1492-55449-0023	train-other-500	Some other points about her were likewise such as pertain to the women of savage life Lithe though she was she loved supineness but upon occasion could endure like a stoic She was taciturn too
1492-55449-0024	train-other-500	From early morning till about three o clock in the afternoon she would seldom speak it taking that time to thaw her by all accounts into but talking terms with humanity During the interval she did little but look
1492-55449-0025	train-other-500	and keep looking out of her large metallic eyes which her enemies called cold as a cuttle fish s but which by her were esteemed gazelle like for Goneril was not without vanity
1492-55449-0026	train-other-500	Those who thought they best knew her often wondered what happiness such a being could take in life not considering the happiness which is to be had by some natures in the very easy way of simply causing pain to those around them
1492-55449-0027	train-other-500	Those who suffered from Goneril s strange nature might with one of those hyberboles to which the resentful incline have pronounced her some kind of toad but her worst slanderers could never with any show of justice
1492-55449-0028	train-other-500	have accused her of being a toady In a large sense she possessed the virtue of independence of mind Goneril held it flattery to hint praise even of the absent and even if merited
none	none	 but honesty to fling people s imputed faults into their faces This was thought malice but it certainly was not passion 
1492-55449-0029	train-other-500	Passion is human Like an icicle dagger Goneril at once stabbed and froze so at least they said and when she saw frankness and innocence tyrannized into sad nervousness under her spell
1492-55449-0030	train-other-500	according to the same authority inly she chewed her blue clay and you could mark that she chuckled
none	none	 These peculiarities were strange and unpleasing 
1492-55449-0031	train-other-500	but another was alleged one really incomprehensible In company she had a strange way of touching as by accident the arm or hand of comely young men and seemed to reap a secret delight from it
1492-55449-0032	train-other-500	but whether from the humane satisfaction of having given the evil touch as it is called or whether it was something else in her not equally wonderful but quite as deplorable remained an enigma
1492-55449-0033	train-other-500	Needless to say what distress was the unfortunate man s when engaged in conversation with company he would suddenly perceive his Goneril bestowing her mysterious touches
1492-55449-0034	train-other-500	especially in such cases where the strangeness of the thing seemed to strike upon the touched person notwithstanding good breeding forbade his proposing the mystery on the spot as a subject of discussion for the company
1492-55449-0035	train-other-500	In these cases too the unfortunate man could never endure so much as to look upon the touched young gentleman afterwards fearful of the mortification of meeting in his countenance some kind of more or less quizzingly knowing expression
1492-55449-0036	train-other-500	He would shudderingly shun the young gentleman So that here to the husband Goneril s touch had the dread operation of the heathen taboo Now Goneril brooked no chiding
1492-55449-0037	train-other-500	So at favorable times he in a wary manner and not indelicately would venture in private interviews gently to make distant allusions to this questionable propensity She divined him
1492-55449-0038	train-other-500	But in her cold loveless way said it was witless to be telling one s dreams especially foolish ones but if the unfortunate man liked connubially to rejoice his soul with such chimeras much connubial joy might they give him
none	none	 All this was sad 
1492-55449-0039	train-other-500	a touching case but all might perhaps have been borne by the unfortunate man conscientiously mindful of his vow for better or for worse to love and cherish his dear Goneril so long as kind heaven might spare her to him
1492-55449-0040	train-other-500	but when after all that had happened the devil of jealousy entered her a calm clayey cakey devil for none other could possess her and the object of that deranged jealousy her own child
1492-55449-0041	train-other-500	a little girl of seven her father s consolation and pet when he saw Goneril artfully torment the little innocent and then play the maternal hypocrite with it the unfortunate man s patient long suffering gave way
1492-55449-0042	train-other-500	Knowing that she would neither confess nor amend and might possibly become even worse than she was he thought it but duty as a father to withdraw the child from her but
1492-55449-0043	train-other-500	loving it as he did he could not do so without accompanying it into domestic exile himself Which hard though it was he did Whereupon the whole female neighborhood who till now had
none	none	 little enough admired dame Goneril 
1492-55449-0044	train-other-500	broke out in indignation against a husband who without assigning a cause could deliberately abandon the wife of his bosom and sharpen the sting to her too by depriving her of the solace of retaining her offspring
1492-55449-0045	train-other-500	To all this self respect with Christian charity towards Goneril long kept the unfortunate man dumb And well had it been had he continued so for when driven to desperation he hinted something of the truth of the case
1492-55449-0046	train-other-500	not a soul would credit it while for Goneril she pronounced all he said to be a malicious invention Ere long at the suggestion of some woman s rights women the injured wife began a suit
1492-55449-0047	train-other-500	and thanks to able counsel and accommodating testimony succeeded in such a way as not only to recover custody of the child but to get such a settlement awarded upon a separation as to make penniless the unfortunate man so he averred
1492-55449-0048	train-other-500	besides through the legal sympathy she enlisted effecting a judicial blasting of his private reputation What made it yet more lamentable was that the unfortunate man thinking that before the court his wisest plan as well as the most
1492-55449-0049	train-other-500	Christian besides being as he deemed not at variance with the truth of the matter would be to put forth the plea of the mental derangement of Goneril which done he could with less of mortification to himself and odium to her
1492-55449-0050	train-other-500	reveal in self defense those eccentricities which had led to his retirement from the joys of wedlock had much ado in the end to prevent this charge of derangement from fatally recoiling upon himself especially when
1492-55449-0051	train-other-500	among other things he alleged her mysterious teachings In vain did his counsel striving to make out the derangement to be where in fact if anywhere it was urge that to hold otherwise to hold that such a being as Goneril was sane
1492-55449-0052	train-other-500	this was constructively a libel upon womankind Libel be it And all ended by the unfortunate man s subsequently getting wind of Goneril s intention to procure him to be permanently committed for a lunatic
1492-55449-0053	train-other-500	Upon which he fled and was now an innocent outcast wandering forlorn in the great valley of the Mississippi with a weed on his hat for the loss of his Goneril for he had lately seen by the papers that she was dead
1492-55449-0054	train-other-500	and thought it but proper to comply with the prescribed form of mourning in such cases For some days past he had been trying to get money enough to return to his child and was but now started with inadequate funds
none	none	 Now all of this from the beginning the good merchant could not but consider rather hard for the unfortunate man CHAPTER XIII THE MAN WITH THE TRAVELING CAP EVINCES MUCH HUMANITY AND IN A WAY WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SHOW HIM TO BE ONE OF THE MOST LOGICAL OF OPTIMISTS Years ago a grave American savant being in London observed at an evening party there a certain coxcombical fellow as he thought an absurd ribbon in his lapel and full of smart persiflage whisking about to the admiration of as many as were disposed to admire Great was the savan s disdain but chancing ere long to find himself in a corner with the jackanapes got into conversation with him when he was somewhat ill prepared for the good sense of the jackanapes but was altogether thrown aback upon subsequently being whispered by a friend that the jackanapes was almost as great a savan as himself being no less a personage than Sir Humphrey Davy The above anecdote is given just here by way of an anticipative reminder to such readers as from the kind of jaunty levity or what may have passed for such hitherto for the most part appearing in the man with the traveling cap may have been tempted into a more or less hasty estimate of him that such readers when they find the same person as they presently will capable of philosophic and humanitarian discourse no mere casual sentence or two as heretofore at times but solidly sustained throughout an almost entire sitting that they may not like the American savan be thereupon betrayed into any surprise incompatible with their own good opinion of their previous penetration The merchant s narration being ended the other would not deny but that it did in some degree affect him He hoped he was not without proper feeling for the unfortunate man But he begged to know in what spirit he bore his alleged calamities Did he despond or have confidence The merchant did not perhaps take the exact import of the last member of the question but answered that if whether the unfortunate man was becomingly resigned under his affliction or no was the point he could say for him that resigned he was and to an exemplary degree for not only so far as known did he refrain from any one sided reflections upon human goodness and human justice but there was observable in him an air of chastened reliance and at times tempered cheerfulness Upon which the other observed that since the unfortunate man s alleged experience could not be deemed very conciliatory towards a view of human nature better than human nature was it largely redounded to his fair mindedness as well as piety that under the alleged dissuasives apparently so from philanthropy he had not in a moment of excitement been warped over to the ranks of the misanthropes He doubted not also that with such a man his experience would in the end act by a complete and beneficent inversion and so far from shaking his confidence in his kind confirm it and rivet it Which would the more surely be the case did he the unfortunate man at last become satisfied as sooner or later he probably would be that in the distraction of his mind his Goneril had not in all respects had fair play At all events the description of the lady charity could not but regard as more or less exaggerated and so far unjust The truth probably was that she was a wife with some blemishes mixed with some beauties But when the blemishes were displayed her husband no adept in the female nature had tried to use reason with her instead of something far more persuasive Hence his failure to convince and convert The act of withdrawing from her seemed under the circumstances abrupt In brief there were probably small faults on both sides more than balanced by large virtues and one should not be hasty in judging When the merchant strange to say opposed views so calm and impartial and again with some warmth deplored the case of the unfortunate man his companion not without seriousness checked him saying that this would never do that though but in the most exceptional case to admit the existence of unmerited misery more particularly if alleged to have been brought about by unhindered arts of the wicked such an admission was to say the least not prudent since with some it might unfavorably bias their most important persuasions Not that those persuasions were legitimately servile to such influences Because since the common occurrences of life could never in the nature of things steadily look one way and tell one story as flags in the trade wind hence if the conviction of a Providence for instance were in any way made dependent upon such variabilities as everyday events the degree of that conviction would in thinking minds be subject to fluctuations akin to those of the stock exchange during a long and uncertain war Here he glanced aside at his transfer book and after a moment s pause continued It was of the essence of a right conviction of the divine nature as with a right conviction of the human that based less on experience than intuition it rose above the zones of weather When now the merchant with all his heart coincided with this as being a sensible as well as religious person he could not but do his companion expressed satisfaction that in an age of some distrust on such subjects he could yet meet with one who shared with him almost to the full so sound and sublime a confidence Still he was far from the illiberality of denying that philosophy duly bounded was not permissible Only he deemed it at least desirable that when such a case as that alleged of the unfortunate man was made the subject of philosophic discussion it should be so philosophized upon as not to afford handles to those unblessed with the true light For but to grant that there was so much as a mystery about such a case might by those persons be held for a tacit surrender of the question And as for the apparent license temporarily permitted sometimes to the bad over the good as was by implication alleged with regard to Goneril and the unfortunate man it might be injudicious there to lay too much polemic stress upon the doctrine of future retribution as the vindication of present impunity For though indeed to the right minded that doctrine was true and of sufficient solace yet with the perverse the polemic mention of it might but provoke the shallow though mischievous conceit that such a doctrine was but tantamount to the one which should affirm that Providence was not now but was going to be In short with all sorts of cavilers it was best both for them and everybody that whoever had the true light should stick behind the secure Malakoff of confidence nor be tempted forth to hazardous skirmishes on the open ground of reason Therefore he deemed it unadvisable in the good man even in the privacy of his own mind or in communion with a congenial one to indulge in too much latitude of philosophizing or indeed of compassionating since this might beget an indiscreet habit of thinking and feeling which might unexpectedly betray him upon unsuitable occasions Indeed whether in private or public there was nothing which a good man was more bound to guard himself against than on some topics the emotional unreserve of his natural heart for that the natural heart in certain points was not what it might be men had been authoritatively admonished But he thought he might be getting dry The merchant in his good nature thought otherwise and said that he would be glad to refresh himself with such fruit all day It was sitting under a ripe pulpit and better such a seat than under a ripe peach tree The other was pleased to find that he had not as he feared been prosing but would rather not be considered in the formal light of a preacher he preferred being still received in that of the equal and genial companion To which end throwing still more of sociability into his manner he again reverted to the unfortunate man Take the very worst view of that case admit that his Goneril was indeed a Goneril how fortunate to be at last rid of this Goneril both by nature and by law If he were acquainted with the unfortunate man instead of condoling with him he would congratulate him Great good fortune had this unfortunate man Lucky dog he dared say after all To which the merchant replied that he earnestly hoped it might be so and at any rate he tried his best to comfort himself with the persuasion that if the unfortunate man was not happy in this world he would at least be so in another His companion made no question of the unfortunate man s happiness in both worlds and presently calling for some champagne invited the merchant to partake upon the playful plea that whatever notions other than felicitous ones he might associate with the unfortunate man a little champagne would readily bubble away At intervals they slowly quaffed several glasses in silence and thoughtfulness At last the merchant s expressive face flushed his eye moistly beamed his lips trembled with an imaginative and feminine sensibility Without sending a single fume to his head the wine seemed to shoot to his heart and begin soothsaying there Ah he cried pushing his glass from him Ah wine is good and confidence is good but can wine or confidence percolate down through all the stony strata of hard considerations and drop warmly and ruddily into the cold cave of truth Truth will not be comforted Led by dear charity lured by sweet hope fond fancy essays this feat but in vain mere dreams and ideals they explode in your hand leaving naught but the scorching behind Why why why in amaze at the burst bless me if In vino veritas be a true saying then for all the fine confidence you professed with me just now distrust deep distrust underlies it and ten thousand strong like the Irish Rebellion breaks out in you now That wine good wine should do it Upon my soul half seriously half humorously securing the bottle you shall drink no more of it Wine was meant to gladden the heart not grieve it to heighten confidence not depress it Sobered shamed all but confounded by this raillery the most telling rebuke under such circumstances the merchant stared about him and then with altered mien stammeringly confessed that he was almost as much surprised as his companion at what had escaped him He did not understand it was quite at a loss to account for such a rhapsody popping out of him unbidden It could hardly be the champagne he felt his brain unaffected in fact if anything the wine had acted upon it something like white of egg in coffee clarifying and brightening Brightening brightening it may be but less like the white of egg in coffee than like stove lustre on a stove black brightening seriously I repent calling for the champagne To a temperament like yours champagne is not to be recommended Pray my dear sir do you feel quite yourself again Confidence restored I hope so I think I may say it is so But we have had a long talk and I think I must retire now So saying the merchant rose and making his adieus left the table with the air of one mortified at having been tempted by his own honest goodness accidentally stimulated into making mad disclosures to himself as to another of the queer unaccountable caprices of his natural heart CHAPTER XIV WORTH THE CONSIDERATION OF THOSE TO WHOM IT MAY PROVE WORTH CONSIDERING As the last chapter was begun with a reminder looking forwards so the present must consist of one glancing backwards To some it may raise a degree of surprise that one so full of confidence as the merchant has throughout shown himself up to the moment of his late sudden impulsiveness should in that instance have betrayed such a depth of discontent He may be thought inconsistent and even so he is But for this is the author to be blamed True it may be urged that there is nothing a writer of fiction should more carefully see to as there is nothing a sensible reader will more carefully look for than that in the depiction of any character its consistency should be preserved But this though at first blush seeming reasonable enough may upon a closer view prove not so much so For how does it couple with another requirement equally insisted upon perhaps that while to all fiction is allowed some play of invention yet fiction based on fact should never be contradictory to it and is it not a fact that in real life a consistent character is a rara avis Which being so the distaste of readers to the contrary sort in books can hardly arise from any sense of their untrueness It may rather be from perplexity as to understanding them But if the acutest sage be often at his wits ends to understand living character shall those who are not sages expect to run and read character in those mere phantoms which flit along a page like shadows along a wall That fiction where every character can by reason of its consistency be comprehended at a glance either exhibits but sections of character making them appear for wholes or else is very untrue to reality while on the other hand that author who draws a character even though to common view incongruous in its parts as the flying squirrel and at different periods as much at variance with itself as the butterfly is with the caterpillar into which it changes may yet in so doing be not false but faithful to facts If reason be judge no writer has produced such inconsistent characters as nature herself has It must call for no small sagacity in a reader unerringly to discriminate in a novel between the inconsistencies of conception and those of life as elsewhere Experience is the only guide here but as no one man can be coextensive with what is it may be unwise in every ease to rest upon it When the duck billed beaver of Australia was first brought stuffed to England the naturalists appealing to their classifications maintained that there was in reality no such creature the bill in the specimen must needs be in some way artificially stuck on But let nature to the perplexity of the naturalists produce her duck billed beavers as she may lesser authors some may hold have no business to be perplexing readers with duck billed characters Always they should represent human nature not in obscurity but transparency which indeed is the practice with most novelists and is perhaps in certain cases someway felt to be a kind of honor rendered by them to their kind But whether it involve honor or otherwise might be mooted considering that if these waters of human nature can be so readily seen through it may be either that they are very pure or very shallow Upon the whole it might rather be thought that he who in view of its inconsistencies says of human nature the same that in view of its contrasts is said of the divine nature that it is past finding out thereby evinces a better appreciation of it than he who by always representing it in a clear light leaves it to be inferred that he clearly knows all about it But though there is a prejudice against inconsistent characters in books yet the prejudice bears the other way when what seemed at first their inconsistency afterwards by the skill of the writer turns out to be their good keeping The great masters excel in nothing so much as in this very particular They challenge astonishment at the tangled web of some character and then raise admiration still greater at their satisfactory unraveling of it in this way throwing open sometimes to the understanding even of school misses the last complications of that spirit which is affirmed by its Creator to be fearfully and wonderfully made At least something like this is claimed for certain psychological novelists nor will the claim be here disputed Yet as touching this point it may prove suggestive that all those sallies of ingenuity having for their end the revelation of human nature on fixed principles have by the best judges been excluded with contempt from the ranks of the sciences palmistry physiognomy phrenology psychology Likewise the fact that in all ages such conflicting views have by the most eminent minds been taken of mankind would as with other topics seem some presumption of a pretty general and pretty thorough ignorance of it Which may appear the less improbable if it be considered that after poring over the best novels professing to portray human nature the studious youth will still run risk of being too often at fault upon actually entering the world whereas had he been furnished with a true delineation it ought to fare with him something as with a stranger entering map in hand Boston town the streets may be very crooked he may often pause but thanks to his true map he does not hopelessly lose his way Nor to this comparison can it be an adequate objection that the twistings of the town are always the same and those of human nature subject to variation The grand points of human nature are the same to day they were a thousand years ago The only variability in them is in expression not in feature But as in spite of seeming discouragement some mathematicians are yet in hopes of hitting upon an exact method of determining the longitude the more earnest psychologists may in the face of previous failures still cherish expectations with regard to some mode of infallibly discovering the heart of man But enough has been said by way of apology for whatever may have seemed amiss or obscure in the character of the merchant so nothing remains but to turn to our comedy or rather to pass from the comedy of thought to that of action CHAPTER XV AN OLD MISER UPON SUITABLE REPRESENTATIONS IS PREVAILED UPON TO VENTURE AN INVESTMENT The merchant having withdrawn the other remained seated alone for a time with the air of one who after having conversed with some excellent man carefully ponders what fell from him however intellectually inferior it may be that none of the profit may be lost happy if from any honest word he has heard he can derive some hint which besides confirming him in the theory of virtue may likewise serve for a finger post to virtuous action Ere long his eye brightened as if some such hint was now caught He rises book in hand quits the cabin and enters upon a sort of corridor narrow and dim a by way to a retreat less ornate and cheery than the former in short the emigrants quarters but which owing to the present trip being a down river one will doubtless be found comparatively tenantless Owing to obstructions against the side windows the whole place is dim and dusky very much so for the most part yet by starts haggardly lit here and there by narrow capricious sky lights in the cornices But there would seem no special need for light the place being designed more to pass the night in than the day in brief a pine barrens dormitory of knotty pine bunks without bedding As with the nests in the geometrical towns of the associate penguin and pelican these bunks were disposed with Philadelphian regularity but like the cradle of the oriole they were pendulous and moreover were so to speak three story cradles the description of one of which will suffice for all Four ropes secured to the ceiling passed downwards through auger holes bored in the corners of three rough planks which at equal distances rested on knots vertically tied in the ropes the lowermost plank but an inch or two from the floor the whole affair resembling on a large scale rope book shelves only instead of hanging firmly against a wall they swayed to and fro at the least suggestion of motion but were more especially lively upon the provocation of a green emigrant sprawling into one and trying to lay himself out there when the cradling would be such as almost to toss him back whence he came In consequence one less inexperienced essaying repose on the uppermost shelf was liable to serious disturbance should a raw beginner select a shelf beneath Sometimes a throng of poor emigrants coming at night in a sudden rain to occupy these oriole nests would through ignorance of their peculiarity bring about such a rocking uproar of carpentry joining to it such an uproar of exclamations that it seemed as if some luckless ship with all its crew was being dashed to pieces among the rocks They were beds devised by some sardonic foe of poor travelers to deprive them of that tranquility which should precede as well as accompany slumber Procrustean beds on whose hard grain humble worth and honesty writhed still invoking repose while but torment responded Ah did any one make such a bunk for himself instead of having it made for him it might be just but how cruel to say You must lie on it But purgatory as the place would appear the stranger advances into it and like Orpheus in his gay descent to Tartarus lightly hums to himself an opera snatch Suddenly there is a rustling then a creaking one of the cradles swings out from a murky nook a sort of wasted penguin flipper is supplicatingly put forth while a wail like that of Dives is heard Water water It was the miser of whom the merchant had spoken Swift as a sister of charity the stranger hovers over him My poor poor sir what can I do for you Ugh ugh water Darting out he procures a glass returns and holding it to the sufferer s lips supports his head while he drinks And did they let you lie here my poor sir racked with this parching thirst The miser a lean old man whose flesh seemed salted cod fish dry as combustibles head like one whittled by an idiot out of a knot flat bony mouth nipped between buzzard nose and chin expression flitting between hunks and imbecile now one now the other he made no response His eyes were closed his cheek lay upon an old white moleskin coat rolled under his head like a wizened apple upon a grimy snow bank Revived at last he inclined towards his ministrant and in a voice disastrous with a cough said I am old and miserable a poor beggar not worth a shoestring how can I repay you By giving me your confidence Confidence he squeaked with changed manner while the pallet swung little left at my age but take the stale remains and welcome Such as it is though you give it Very good Now give me a hundred dollars Upon this the miser was all panic His hands groped towards his waist then suddenly flew upward beneath his moleskin pillow and there lay clutching something out of sight Meantime to himself he incoherently mumbled Confidence Cant gammon Confidence hum bubble Confidence fetch gouge Hundred dollars hundred devils Half spent he lay mute awhile then feebly raising himself in a voice for the moment made strong by the sarcasm said A hundred dollars rather high price to put upon confidence But don t you see I am a poor old rat here dying in the wainscot You have served me but wretch that I am I can but cough you my thanks ugh ugh ugh This time his cough was so violent that its convulsions were imparted to the plank which swung him about like a stone in a sling preparatory to its being hurled Ugh ugh ugh What a shocking cough I wish my friend the herb doctor was here now a box of his Omni Balsamic Reinvigorator would do you good Ugh ugh ugh I ve a good mind to go find him He s aboard somewhere I saw his long snuff colored surtout Trust me his medicines are the best in the world Ugh ugh ugh Oh how sorry I am No doubt of it squeaked the other again but go get your charity out on deck There parade the pursy peacocks they don t cough down here in desertion and darkness like poor old me Look how scaly a pauper I am clove with this churchyard cough Ugh ugh ugh Again how sorry I feel not only for your cough but your poverty Such a rare chance made unavailable Did you have but the sum named how I could invest it for you Treble profits But confidence I fear that even had you the precious cash you would not have the more precious confidence I speak of Ugh ugh ugh flightily raising himself What s that How how Then you don t want the money for yourself My dear dear sir how could you impute to me such preposterous self seeking To solicit out of hand for my private behoof an hundred dollars from a perfect stranger I am not mad my dear sir How how still more bewildered do you then go about the world gratis seeking to invest people s money for them My humble profession sir I live not for myself but the world will not have confidence in me and yet confidence in me were great gain But but in a kind of vertigo what do do you do do with people s money Ugh ugh How is the gain made To tell that would ruin me That known every one would be going into the business and it would be overdone A secret a mystery all I have to do with you is to receive your confidence and all you have to do with me is in due time to receive it back thrice paid in trebling profits What what imbecility in the ascendant once more but the vouchers the vouchers suddenly hunkish again Honesty s best voucher is honesty s face Can t see yours though peering through the obscurity From this last alternating flicker of rationality the miser fell back sputtering into his previous gibberish but it took now an arithmetical turn Eyes closed he lay muttering to himself One hundred one hundred two hundred two hundred three hundred three hundred He opened his eyes feebly stared and still more feebly said It s a little dim here ain t it Ugh ugh But as well as my poor old eyes can see you look honest I am glad to hear that If if now I should put trying to raise himself but vainly excitement having all but exhausted him if if now I should put put No ifs Downright confidence or none So help me heaven I will have no half confidences He said it with an indifferent and superior air and seemed moving to go Don t don t leave me friend bear with me age can t help some distrust it can t friend it can t Ugh ugh ugh Oh I am so old and miserable I ought to have a guardian Tell me if If No more Stay how soon ugh ugh would my money be trebled How soon friend You won t confide Good bye Stay stay falling back now like an infant I confide I confide help friend my distrust From an old buckskin pouch tremulously dragged forth ten hoarded eagles tarnished into the appearance of ten old horn buttons were taken and half eagerly half reluctantly offered I know not whether I should accept this slack confidence said the other coldly receiving the gold but an eleventh hour confidence a sick bed confidence a distempered death bed confidence after all Give me the healthy confidence of healthy men with their healthy wits about them But let that pass All right Good bye Nay back back receipt my receipt Ugh ugh ugh Who are you What have I done Where go you My gold my gold Ugh ugh ugh But unluckily for this final flicker of reason the stranger was now beyond ear shot nor was any one else within hearing of so feeble a call CHAPTER XVI A SICK MAN AFTER SOME IMPATIENCE IS INDUCED TO BECOME A PATIENT The sky slides into blue the bluffs into bloom the rapid Mississippi expands runs sparkling and gurgling all over in eddies one magnified wake of a seventy four The sun comes out a golden huzzar from his tent flashing his helm on the world All things warmed in the landscape leap Speeds the daedal boat as a dream But withdrawn in a corner wrapped about in a shawl sits an unparticipating man visited but not warmed by the sun a plant whose hour seems over while buds are blowing and seeds are astir On a stool at his left sits a stranger in a snuff colored surtout the collar thrown back his hand waving in persuasive gesture his eye beaming with hope But not easily may hope be awakened in one long tranced into hopelessness by a chronic complaint To some remark the sick man by word or look seemed to have just made an impatiently querulous answer when with a deprecatory air the other resumed Nay think not I seek to cry up my treatment by crying down that of others And yet when one is confident he has truth on his side and that is not on the other it is no very easy thing to be charitable not that temper is the bar but conscience for charity would beget toleration you know which is a kind of implied permitting and in effect a kind of countenancing and that which is countenanced is so far furthered But should untruth be furthered Still while for the world s good I refuse to further the cause of these mineral doctors I would fain regard them not as willful wrong doers but good Samaritans erring And is this I put it to you sir is this the view of an arrogant rival and pretender His physical power all dribbled and gone the sick man replied not by voice or by gesture but with feeble dumb show of his face seemed to be saying Pray leave me who was ever cured by talk But the other as if not unused to make allowances for such despondency proceeded and kindly yet firmly You tell me that by advice of an eminent physiologist in Louisville you took tincture of iron For what To restore your lost energy And how Why in healthy subjects iron is naturally found in the blood and iron in the bar is strong ergo iron is the source of animal invigoration But you being deficient in vigor it follows that the cause is deficiency of iron Iron then must be put into you and so your tincture Now as to the theory here I am mute But in modesty assuming its truth and then as a plain man viewing that theory in practice I would respectfully question your eminent physiologist Sir I would say though by natural processes lifeless natures taken as nutriment become vitalized yet is a lifeless nature under any circumstances capable of a living transmission with all its qualities as a lifeless nature unchanged If sir nothing can be incorporated with the living body but by assimilation and if that implies the conversion of one thing to a different thing as in a lamp oil is assimilated into flame is it in this view likely that by banqueting on fat Calvin Edson will fatten That is will what is fat on the board prove fat on the bones If it will then sir what is iron in the vial will prove iron in the vein Seems that conclusion too confident But the sick man again turned his dumb show look as much as to say Pray leave me Why with painful words hint the vanity of that which the pains of this body have too painfully proved But the other as if unobservant of that querulous look went on But this notion that science can play farmer to the flesh making there what living soil it pleases seems not so strange as that other conceit that science is now a days so expert that in consumptive cases as yours it can by prescription of the inhalation of certain vapors achieve the sublimest act of omnipotence breathing into all but lifeless dust the breath of life For did you not tell me my poor sir that by order of the great chemist in Baltimore for three weeks you were never driven out without a respirator and for a given time of every day sat bolstered up in a sort of gasometer inspiring vapors generated by the burning of drugs as if this concocted atmosphere of man were an antidote to the poison of God s natural air Oh who can wonder at that old reproach against science that it is atheistical And here is my prime reason for opposing these chemical practitioners who have sought out so many inventions For what do their inventions indicate unless it be that kind and degree of pride in human skill which seems scarce compatible with reverential dependence upon the power above Try to rid my mind of it as I may yet still these chemical practitioners with their tinctures and fumes and braziers and occult incantations seem to me like Pharaoh s vain sorcerers trying to beat down the will of heaven Day and night in all charity I intercede for them that heaven may not in its own language be provoked to anger with their inventions may not take vengeance of their inventions A thousand pities that you should ever have been in the hands of these Egyptians But again came nothing but the dumb show look as much as to say Pray leave me quacks and indignation against quacks both are vain But once more the other went on How different we herb doctors who claim nothing invent nothing but staff in hand in glades and upon hillsides go about in nature humbly seeking her cures True Indian doctors though not learned in names we are not unfamiliar with essences successors of Solomon the Wise who knew all vegetables from the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop on the wall Yes Solomon was the first of herb doctors Nor were the virtues of herbs unhonored by yet older ages Is it not writ that on a moonlight night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old AEson Ah would you but have confidence you should be the new AEson and I your Medea A few vials of my Omni Balsamic Reinvigorator would I am certain give you some strength Upon this indignation and abhorrence seemed to work by their excess the effect promised of the balsam Roused from that long apathy of impotence the cadaverous man started and in a voice that was as the sound of obstructed air gurgling through a maze of broken honey combs cried Begone You are all alike The name of doctor the dream of helper condemns you For years I have been but a gallipot for you experimentizers to rinse your experiments into and now in this livid skin partake of the nature of my contents Begone I hate ye I were inhuman could I take affront at a want of confidence born of too bitter an experience of betrayers Yet permit one who is not without feeling Begone Just in that voice talked to me not six months ago the German doctor at the water cure from which I now return six months and sixty pangs nigher my grave The water cure Oh fatal delusion of the well meaning Preisnitz Sir trust me Begone Nay an invalid should not always have his own way Ah sir reflect how untimely this distrust in one like you How weak you are and weakness is it not the time for confidence Yes when through weakness everything bids despair then is the time to get strength by confidence Relenting in his air the sick man cast upon him a long glance of beseeching as if saying With confidence must come hope and how can hope be The herb doctor took a sealed paper box from his surtout pocket and holding it towards him said solemnly Turn not away This may be the last time of health s asking Work upon yourself invoke confidence though from ashes rouse it for your life rouse it and invoke it I say The other trembled was silent and then a little commanding himself asked the ingredients of the medicine Herbs What herbs And the nature of them And the reason for giving them It cannot be made known Then I will none of you Sedately observant of the juiceless joyless form before him the herb doctor was mute a moment then said I give up How You are sick and a philosopher No no not the last But to demand the ingredient with the reason for giving is the mark of a philosopher just as the consequence is the penalty of a fool A sick philosopher is incurable Why Because he has no confidence How does that make him incurable Because either he spurns his powder or if he take it it proves a blank cartridge though the same given to a rustic in like extremity would act like a charm I am no materialist but the mind so acts upon the body that if the one have no confidence neither has the other Again the sick man appeared not unmoved He seemed to be thinking what in candid truth could be said to all this At length You talk of confidence How comes it that when brought low himself the herb doctor who was most confident to prescribe in other cases proves least confident to prescribe in his own having small confidence in himself for himself But he has confidence in the brother he calls in And that he does so is no reproach to him since he knows that when the body is prostrated the mind is not erect Yes in this hour the herb doctor does distrust himself but not his art The sick man s knowledge did not warrant him to gainsay this But he seemed not grieved at it glad to be confuted in a way tending towards his wish Then you give me hope his sunken eye turned up Hope is proportioned to confidence How much confidence you give me so much hope do I give you For this lifting the box if all depended upon this I should rest It is nature s own Nature Why do you start I know not with a sort of shudder but I have heard of a book entitled Nature in Disease A title I cannot approve it is suspiciously scientific Nature in Disease As if nature divine nature were aught but health as if through nature disease is decreed But did I not before hint of the tendency of science that forbidden tree Sir if despondency is yours from recalling that title dismiss it Trust me nature is health for health is good and nature cannot work ill As little can she work error Get nature and you get well Now I repeat this medicine is nature s own Again the sick man could not according to his light conscientiously disprove what was said Neither as before did he seem over anxious to do so the less as in his sensitiveness it seemed to him that hardly could he offer so to do without something like the appearance of a kind of implied irreligion nor in his heart was he ungrateful that since a spirit opposite to that pervaded all the herb doctor s hopeful words therefore for hopefulness he the sick man had not alone medical warrant but also doctrinal Then you do really think hectically that if I take this medicine mechanically reaching out for it I shall regain my health I will not encourage false hopes relinquishing to him the box I will be frank with you Though frankness is not always the weakness of the mineral practitioner yet the herb doctor must be frank or nothing Now then sir in your case a radical cure such a cure understand as should make you robust such a cure sir I do not and cannot promise Oh you need not only restore me the power of being something else to others than a burdensome care and to myself a droning grief Only cure me of this misery of weakness only make me so that I can walk about in the sun and not draw the flies to me as lured by the coming of decay Only do that but that You ask not much you are wise not in vain have you suffered That little you ask I think can be granted But remember not in a day nor a week nor perhaps a month but sooner or later I say not exactly when for I am neither prophet nor charlatan Still if according to the directions in your box there you take my medicine steadily without assigning an especial day near or remote to discontinue it then may you calmly look for some eventual result of good But again I say you must have confidence Feverishly he replied that he now trusted he had and hourly should pray for its increase When suddenly relapsing into one of those strange caprices peculiar to some invalids he added But to one like me it is so hard so hard The most confident hopes so often have failed me and as often have I vowed never no never to trust them again Oh feebly wringing his hands you do not know you do not know I know this that never did a right confidence come to naught But time is short you hold your cure to retain or reject I retain with a clinch and now how much As much as you can evoke from your heart and heaven How the price of this medicine I thought it was confidence you meant how much confidence you should have The medicine that is half a dollar a vial Your box holds six The money was paid Now sir said the herb doctor my business calls me away and it may so be that I shall never see you again if then He paused for the sick man s countenance fell blank Forgive me cried the other forgive that imprudent phrase never see you again Though I solely intended it with reference to myself yet I had forgotten what your sensitiveness might be I repeat then that it may be that we shall not soon have a second interview so that hereafter should another of my boxes be needed you may not be able to replace it except by purchase at the shops and in so doing you may run more or less risk of taking some not salutary mixture For such is the popularity of the Omni Balsamic Reinvigorator thriving not by the credulity of the simple but the trust of the wise that certain contrivers have not been idle though I would not indeed hastily affirm of them that they are aware of the sad consequences to the public Homicides and murderers some call those contrivers but I do not for murder if such a crime be possible comes from the heart and these men s motives come from the purse Were they not in poverty I think they would hardly do what they do Still the public interests forbid that I should let their needy device for a living succeed In short I have adopted precautions Take the wrapper from any of my vials and hold it to the light you will see water marked in capitals the word confidence which is the countersign of the medicine as I wish it was of the world The wrapper bears that mark or else the medicine is counterfeit But if still any lurking doubt should remain pray enclose the wrapper to this address handing a card and by return mail I will answer At first the sick man listened with the air of vivid interest but gradually while the other was still talking another strange caprice came over him and he presented the aspect of the most calamitous dejection How now said the herb doctor You told me to have confidence said that confidence was indispensable and here you preach to me distrust Ah truth will out I told you you must have confidence unquestioning confidence I meant confidence in the genuine medicine and the genuine me But in your absence buying vials purporting to be yours it seems I cannot have unquestioning confidence Prove all the vials trust those which are true But to doubt to suspect to prove to have all this wearing work to be doing continually how opposed to confidence It is evil From evil comes good Distrust is a stage to confidence How has it proved in our interview But your voice is husky I have let you talk too much You hold your cure I will leave you But stay when I hear that health is yours I will not like some I know vainly make boasts but giving glory where all glory is due say with the devout herb doctor Japus in Virgil when in the unseen but efficacious presence of Venus he with simples healed the wound of AEneas This is no mortal work no cure of mine Nor art s effect but done by power divine CHAPTER XVII TOWARDS THE END OF WHICH THE HERB DOCTOR PROVES HIMSELF A FORGIVER OF INJURIES In a kind of ante cabin a number of respectable looking people male and female way passengers recently come on board are listlessly sitting in a mutually shy sort of silence Holding up a small square bottle ovally labeled with the engraving of a countenance full of soft pity as that of the Romish painted Madonna the herb doctor passes slowly among them benignly urbane turning this way and that saying Ladies and gentlemen I hold in my hand here the Samaritan Pain Dissuader thrice blessed discovery of that disinterested friend of humanity whose portrait you see Pure vegetable extract Warranted to remove the acutest pain within less than ten minutes Five hundred dollars to be forfeited on failure Especially efficacious in heart disease and tic douloureux Observe the expression of this pledged friend of humanity Price only fifty cents In vain After the first idle stare his auditors in pretty good health it seemed instead of encouraging his politeness appeared if anything impatient of it and perhaps only diffidence or some small regard for his feelings prevented them from telling him so But insensible to their coldness or charitably overlooking it he more wooingly than ever resumed May I venture upon a small supposition Have I your kind leave ladies and gentlemen To which modest appeal no one had the kindness to answer a syllable Well said he resignedly silence is at least not denial and may be consent My supposition is this possibly some lady here present has a dear friend at home a bed ridden sufferer from spinal complaint If so what gift more appropriate to that sufferer than this tasteful little bottle of Pain Dissuader Again he glanced about him but met much the same reception as before Those faces alien alike to sympathy or surprise seemed patiently to say We are travelers and as such must expect to meet and quietly put up with many antic fools and more antic quacks Ladies and gentlemen deferentially fixing his eyes upon their now self complacent faces ladies and gentlemen might I by your kind leave venture upon one other small supposition It is this that there is scarce a sufferer this noonday writhing on his bed but in his hour he sat satisfactorily healthy and happy that the Samaritan Pain Dissuader is the one only balm for that to which each living creature who knows may be a draughted victim present or prospective In short Oh Happiness on my right hand and oh Security on my left can ye wisely adore a Providence and not think it wisdom to provide Provide Uplifting the bottle What immediate effect if any this appeal might have had is uncertain For just then the boat touched at a houseless landing scooped as by a land slide out of sombre forests back through which led a road the sole one which from its narrowness and its being walled up with story on story of dusk matted foliage presented the vista of some cavernous old gorge in a city like haunted Cock Lane in London Issuing from that road and crossing that landing there stooped his shaggy form in the door way and entered the ante cabin with a step so burdensome that shot seemed in his pockets a kind of invalid Titan in homespun his beard blackly pendant like the Carolina moss and dank with cypress dew his countenance tawny and shadowy as an iron ore country in a clouded day In one hand he carried a heavy walking stick of swamp oak with the other led a puny girl walking in moccasins not improbably his child but evidently of alien maternity perhaps Creole or even Camanche Her eye would have been large for a woman and was inky as the pools of falls among mountain pines An Indian blanket orange hued and fringed with lead tassel work appeared that morning to have shielded the child from heavy showers Her limbs were tremulous she seemed a little Cassandra in nervousness No sooner was the pair spied by the herb doctor than with a cheerful air both arms extended like a host s he advanced and taking the child s reluctant hand said trippingly On your travels ah my little May Queen Glad to see you What pretty moccasins Nice to dance in Then with a half caper sang Hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle The cow jumped over the moon Come chirrup chirrup my little robin Which playful welcome drew no responsive playfulness from the child nor appeared to gladden or conciliate the father but rather if anything to dash the dead weight of his heavy hearted expression with a smile hypochondriacally scornful Sobering down now the herb doctor addressed the stranger in a manly business like way a transition which though it might seem a little abrupt did not appear constrained and indeed served to show that his recent levity was less the habit of a frivolous nature than the frolic condescension of a kindly heart Excuse me said he but if I err not I was speaking to you the other day on a Kentucky boat wasn t it Never to me was the reply the voice deep and lonesome enough to have come from the bottom of an abandoned coal shaft Ah But am I again mistaken his eye falling on the swamp oak stick or don t you go a little lame sir Never was lame in my life Indeed I fancied I had perceived not a limp but a hitch a slight hitch some experience in these things divined some hidden cause of the hitch buried bullet may be some dragoons in the Mexican war discharged with such you know Hard fate he sighed little pity for it for who sees it have you dropped anything Why there is no telling but the stranger was bowed over and might have seemed bowing for the purpose of picking up something were it not that as arrested in the imperfect posture he for the moment so remained slanting his tall stature like a mainmast yielding to the gale or Adam to the thunder The little child pulled him With a kind of a surge he righted himself for an instant looked toward the herb doctor but either from emotion or aversion or both together withdrew his eyes saying nothing Presently still stooping he seated himself drawing his child between his knees his massy hands tremulous and still averting his face while up into the compassionate one of the herb doctor the child turned a fixed melancholy glance of repugnance The herb doctor stood observant a moment then said Surely you have pain strong pain somewhere in strong frames pain is strongest Try now my specific holding it up Do but look at the expression of this friend of humanity Trust me certain cure for any pain in the world Won t you look No choked the other Very good Merry time to you little May Queen And so as if he would intrude his cure upon no one moved pleasantly off again crying his wares nor now at last without result A new comer not from the shore but another part of the boat a sickly young man after some questions purchased a bottle Upon this others of the company began a little to wake up as it were the scales of indifference or prejudice fell from their eyes now at last they seemed to have an inkling that here was something not undesirable which might be had for the buying But while ten times more briskly bland than ever the herb doctor was driving his benevolent trade accompanying each sale with added praises of the thing traded all at once the dusk giant seated at some distance unexpectedly raised his voice with What was that you last said The question was put distinctly yet resonantly as when a great clock bell stunning admonisher strikes one and the stroke though single comes bedded in the belfry clamor All proceedings were suspended Hands held forth for the specific were withdrawn while every eye turned towards the direction whence the question came But no way abashed the herb doctor elevating his voice with even more than wonted self possession replied I was saying what since you wish it I cheerfully repeat that the Samaritan Pain Dissuader which I here hold in my hand will either cure or ease any pain you please within ten minutes after its application Does it produce insensibility By no means Not the least of its merits is that it is not an opiate It kills pain without killing feeling You lie Some pains cannot be eased but by producing insensibility and cannot be cured but by producing death Beyond this the dusk giant said nothing neither for impairing the other s market did there appear much need to After eying the rude speaker a moment with an expression of mingled admiration and consternation the company silently exchanged glances of mutual sympathy under unwelcome conviction Those who had purchased looked sheepish or ashamed and a cynical looking little man with a thin flaggy beard and a countenance ever wearing the rudiments of a grin seated alone in a corner commanding a good view of the scene held a rusty hat before his face But again the herb doctor without noticing the retort overbearing though it was began his panegyrics anew and in a tone more assured than before going so far now as to say that his specific was sometimes almost as effective in cases of mental suffering as in cases of physical or rather to be more precise in cases when through sympathy the two sorts of pain cooeperated into a climax of both in such cases he said the specific had done very well He cited an example Only three bottles faithfully taken cured a Louisiana widow for three weeks sleepless in a darkened chamber of neuralgic sorrow for the loss of husband and child swept off in one night by the last epidemic For the truth of this a printed voucher was produced duly signed While he was reading it aloud a sudden side blow all but felled him It was the giant who with a countenance lividly epileptic with hypochondriac mania exclaimed Profane fiddler on heart strings Snake More he would have added but convulsed could not so without another word taking up the child who had followed him went with a rocking pace out of the cabin Regardless of decency and lost to humanity exclaimed the herb doctor with much ado recovering himself Then after a pause during which he examined his bruise not omitting to apply externally a little of his specific and with some success as it would seem plained to himself No no I won t seek redress innocence is my redress But turning upon them all if that man s wrathful blow provokes me to no wrath should his evil distrust arouse you to distrust I do devoutly hope proudly raising voice and arm for the honor of humanity hope that despite this coward assault the Samaritan Pain Dissuader stands unshaken in the confidence of all who hear me But injured as he was and patient under it too somehow his case excited as little compassion as his oratory now did enthusiasm Still pathetic to the last he continued his appeals notwithstanding the frigid regard of the company till suddenly interrupting himself as if in reply to a quick summons from without he said hurriedly I come I come and so with every token of precipitate dispatch out of the cabin the herb doctor went CHAPTER XVIII INQUEST INTO THE TRUE CHARACTER OF THE HERB DOCTOR Sha n t see that fellow again in a hurry remarked an auburn haired gentleman to his neighbor with a hook nose Never knew an operator so completely unmasked But do you think it the fair thing to unmask an operator that way Fair It is right Supposing that at high change on the Paris Bourse Asmodeus should lounge in distributing hand bills revealing the true thoughts and designs of all the operators present would that be the fair thing in Asmodeus Or as Hamlet says were it to consider the thing too curiously We won t go into that But since you admit the fellow to be a knave I don t admit it Or if I did I take it back Shouldn t wonder if after all he is no knave at all or but little of one What can you prove against him I can prove that he makes dupes Many held in honor do the same and many not wholly knaves do it too How about that last He is not wholly at heart a knave I fancy among whose dupes is himself Did you not see our quack friend apply to himself his own quackery A fanatic quack essentially a fool though effectively a knave Bending over and looking down between his knees on the floor the auburn haired gentleman meditatively scribbled there awhile with his cane then glancing up said I can t conceive how you in anyway can hold him a fool How he talked so glib so pat so well A smart fool always talks well takes a smart fool to be tonguey In much the same strain the discussion continued the hook nosed gentleman talking at large and excellently with a view of demonstrating that a smart fool always talks just so Ere long he talked to such purpose as almost to convince Presently back came the person of whom the auburn haired gentleman had predicted that he would not return Conspicuous in the door way he stood saying in a clear voice Is the agent of the Seminole Widow and Orphan Asylum within here No one replied Is there within here any agent or any member of any charitable institution whatever No one seemed competent to answer or no one thought it worth while to If there be within here any such person I have in my hand two dollars for him Some interest was manifested I was called away so hurriedly I forgot this part of my duty With the proprietor of the Samaritan Pain Dissuader it is a rule to devote on the spot to some benevolent purpose the half of the proceeds of sales Eight bottles were disposed of among this company Hence four half dollars remain to charity Who as steward takes the money One or two pair of feet moved upon the floor as with a sort of itching but nobody rose Does diffidence prevail over duty If I say there be any gentleman or any lady either here present who is in any connection with any charitable institution whatever let him or her come forward He or she happening to have at hand no certificate of such connection makes no difference Not of a suspicious temper thank God I shall have confidence in whoever offers to take the money A demure looking woman in a dress rather tawdry and rumpled here drew her veil well down and rose but marking every eye upon her thought it advisable upon the whole to sit down again Is it to be believed that in this Christian company there is no one charitable person I mean no one connected with any charity Well then is there no object of charity here Upon this an unhappy looking woman in a sort of mourning neat but sadly worn hid her face behind a meagre bundle and was heard to sob Meantime as not seeing or hearing her the herb doctor again spoke and this time not unpathetically Are there none here who feel in need of help and who in accepting such help would feel that they in their time have given or done more than may ever be given or done to them Man or woman is there none such here The sobs of the woman were more audible though she strove to repress them While nearly every one s attention was bent upon her a man of the appearance of a day laborer with a white bandage across his face concealing the side of the nose and who for coolness sake had been sitting in his red flannel shirt sleeves his coat thrown across one shoulder the darned cuffs drooping behind this man shufflingly rose and with a pace that seemed the lingering memento of the lock step of convicts went up for a duly qualified claimant Poor wounded huzzar sighed the herb doctor and dropping the money into the man s clam shell of a hand turned and departed The recipient of the alms was about moving after when the auburn haired gentleman staid him Don t be frightened you but I want to see those coins Yes yes good silver good silver There take them again and while you are about it go bandage the rest of yourself behind something D ye hear Consider yourself wholly the scar of a nose and be off with yourself Being of a forgiving nature or else from emotion not daring to trust his voice the man silently but not without some precipitancy withdrew Strange said the auburn haired gentleman returning to his friend the money was good money Aye and where your fine knavery now Knavery to devote the half of one s receipts to charity He s a fool I say again Others might call him an original genius Yes being original in his folly Genius His genius is a cracked pate and as this age goes not much originality about that May he not be knave fool and genius altogether I beg pardon here said a third person with a gossiping expression who had been listening but you are somewhat puzzled by this man and well you may be Do you know anything about him asked the hooked nosed gentleman No but I suspect him for something Suspicion We want knowledge Well suspect first and know next True knowledge comes but by suspicion or revelation That s my maxim And yet said the auburn haired gentleman since a wise man will keep even some certainties to himself much more some suspicions at least he will at all events so do till they ripen into knowledge Do you hear that about the wise man said the hook nosed gentleman turning upon the new comer Now what is it you suspect of this fellow I shrewdly suspect him was the eager response for one of those Jesuit emissaries prowling all over our country The better to accomplish their secret designs they assume at times I am told the most singular masques sometimes in appearance the absurdest This though indeed for some reason causing a droll smile upon the face of the hook nosed gentleman added a third angle to the discussion which now became a sort of triangular duel and ended at last with but a triangular result CHAPTER XIX A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE Mexico Molino del Rey Resaca de la Palma Resaca de la Tomba Leaving his reputation to take care of itself since as is not seldom the case he knew nothing of its being in debate the herb doctor wandering towards the forward part of the boat had there espied a singular character in a grimy old regimental coat a countenance at once grim and wizened interwoven paralyzed legs stiff as icicles suspended between rude crutches while the whole rigid body like a ship s long barometer on gimbals swung to and fro mechanically faithful to the motion of the boat Looking downward while he swung the cripple seemed in a brown study As moved by the sight and conjecturing that here was some battered hero from the Mexican battle fields the herb doctor had sympathetically accosted him as above and received the above rather dubious reply As with a half moody half surly sort of air that reply was given the cripple by a voluntary jerk nervously increased his swing his custom when seized by emotion so that one would have thought some squall had suddenly rolled the boat and with it the barometer Tombs my friend exclaimed the herb doctor in mild surprise You have not descended to the dead have you I had imagined you a scarred campaigner one of the noble children of war for your dear country a glorious sufferer But you are Lazarus it seems Yes he who had sores Ah the other Lazarus But I never knew that either of them was in the army glancing at the dilapidated regimentals That will do now Jokes enough Friend said the other reproachfully you think amiss On principle I greet unfortunates with some pleasant remark the better to call off their thoughts from their troubles The physician who is at once wise and humane seldom unreservedly sympathizes with his patient But come I am a herb doctor and also a natural bone setter I may be sanguine but I think I can do something for you You look up now Give me your story Ere I undertake a cure I require a full account of the case You can t help me returned the cripple gruffly Go away You seem sadly destitute of No I ain t destitute to day at least I can pay my way The Natural Bone setter is happy indeed to hear that But you were premature I was deploring your destitution not of cash but of confidence You think the Natural Bone setter can t help you Well suppose he can t have you any objection to telling him your story You my friend have in a signal way experienced adversity Tell me then for my private good how without aid from the noble cripple Epictetus you have arrived at his heroic sang froid in misfortune At these words the cripple fixed upon the speaker the hard ironic eye of one toughened and defiant in misery and in the end grinned upon him with his unshaven face like an ogre Come come be sociable be human my friend Don t make that face it distresses me I suppose with a sneer you are the man I ve long heard of The Happy Man Happy my friend Yes at least I ought to be My conscience is peaceful I have confidence in everybody I have confidence that in my humble profession I do some little good to the world Yes I think that without presumption I may venture to assent to the proposition that I am the Happy Man the Happy Bone setter Then you shall hear my story Many a month I have longed to get hold of the Happy Man drill him drop the powder and leave him to explode at his leisure What a demoniac unfortunate exclaimed the herb doctor retreating Regular infernal machine Look ye cried the other stumping after him and with his horny hand catching him by a horn button my name is Thomas Fry Until my Any relation of missus Fry interrupted the other I still correspond with that excellent lady on the subject of prisons Tell me are you anyway connected with my missus Fry Blister missus Fry What do them sentimental souls know of prisons or any other black fact I ll tell ye a story of prisons Ha ha The herb doctor shrank and with reason the laugh being strangely startling Positively my friend said he you must stop that I can t stand that no more of that I hope I have the milk of kindness but your thunder will soon turn it Hold I haven t come to the milk turning part yet My name is Thomas Fry Until my twenty third year I went by the nickname of Happy Tom happy ha ha They called me Happy Tom d ye see because I was so good natured and laughing all the time just as I am now ha ha Upon this the herb doctor would perhaps have run but once more the hyaena clawed him Presently sobering down he continued Well I was born in New York and there I lived a steady hard working man a cooper by trade One evening I went to a political meeting in the Park for you must know I was in those days a great patriot As bad luck would have it there was trouble near between a gentleman who had been drinking wine and a pavior who was sober The pavior chewed tobacco and the gentleman said it was beastly in him and pushed him wanting to have his place The pavior chewed on and pushed back Well the gentleman carried a sword cane and presently the pavior was down skewered How was that Why you see the pavior undertook something above his strength The other must have been a Samson then Strong as a pavior is a proverb So it is and the gentleman was in body a rather weakly man but for all that I say again the pavior undertook something above his strength What are you talking about He tried to maintain his rights didn t he Yes but for all that I say again he undertook something above his strength I don t understand you But go on Along with the gentleman I with other witnesses was taken to the Tombs There was an examination and to appear at the trial the gentleman and witnesses all gave bail I mean all but me And why didn t you Couldn t get it Steady hard working cooper like you what was the reason you couldn t get bail Steady hard working cooper hadn t no friends Well souse I went into a wet cell like a canal boat splashing into the lock locked up in pickle d ye see against the time of the trial But what had you done Why I hadn t got any friends I tell ye A worse crime than murder as ye ll see afore long Murder Did the wounded man die Died the third night Then the gentleman s bail didn t help him Imprisoned now wasn t he Had too many friends No it was I that was imprisoned But I was going on They let me walk about the corridor by day but at night I must into lock There the wet and the damp struck into my bones They doctored me but no use When the trial came I was boosted up and said my say And what was that My say was that I saw the steel go in and saw it sticking in And that hung the gentleman Hung him with a gold chain His friends called a meeting in the Park and presented him with a gold watch and chain upon his acquittal Acquittal Didn t I say he had friends There was a pause broken at last by the herb doctor s saying Well there is a bright side to everything If this speak prosaically for justice it speaks romantically for friendship But go on my fine fellow My say being said they told me I might go I said I could not without help So the constables helped me asking where would I go I told them back to the Tombs I knew no other place But where are your friends said they I have none So they put me into a hand barrow with an awning to it and wheeled me down to the dock and on board a boat and away to Blackwell s Island to the Corporation Hospital There I got worse got pretty much as you see me now Couldn t cure me After three years I grew sick of lying in a grated iron bed alongside of groaning thieves and mouldering burglars They gave me five silver dollars and these crutches and I hobbled off I had an only brother who went to Indiana years ago I begged about to make up a sum to go to him got to Indiana at last and they directed me to his grave It was on a great plain in a log church yard with a stump fence the old gray roots sticking all ways like moose antlers The bier set over the grave it being the last dug was of green hickory bark on and green twigs sprouting from it Some one had planted a bunch of violets on the mound but it was a poor soil always choose the poorest soils for grave yards and they were all dried to tinder I was going to sit and rest myself on the bier and think about my brother in heaven but the bier broke down the legs being only tacked So after driving some hogs out of the yard that were rooting there I came away and not to make too long a story of it here I am drifting down stream like any other bit of wreck The herb doctor was silent for a time buried in thought At last raising his head he said I have considered your whole story my friend and strove to consider it in the light of a commentary on what I believe to be the system of things but it so jars with all is so incompatible with all that you must pardon me if I honestly tell you I cannot believe it That don t surprise me How Hardly anybody believes my story and so to most I tell a different one How again Wait here a bit and I ll show ye With that taking off his rag of a cap and arranging his tattered regimentals the best he could off he went stumping among the passengers in an adjoining part of the deck saying with a jovial kind of air Sir a shilling for Happy Tom who fought at Buena Vista Lady something for General Scott s soldier crippled in both pins at glorious Contreras Now it so chanced that unbeknown to the cripple a prim looking stranger had overheard part of his story Beholding him then on his present begging adventure this person turning to the herb doctor indignantly said Is it not too bad sir that yonder rascal should lie so Charity never faileth my good sir was the reply The vice of this unfortunate is pardonable Consider he lies not out of wantonness Not out of wantonness I never heard more wanton lies In one breath to tell you what would appear to be his true story and in the next away and falsify it For all that I repeat he lies not out of wantonness A ripe philosopher turned out of the great Sorbonne of hard times he thinks that woes when told to strangers for money are best sugared Though the inglorious lock jaw of his knee pans in a wet dungeon is a far more pitiable ill than to have been crippled at glorious Contreras yet he is of opinion that this lighter and false ill shall attract while the heavier and real one might repel Nonsense he belongs to the Devil s regiment and I have a great mind to expose him Shame upon you Dare to expose that poor unfortunate and by heaven don t you do it sir Noting something in his manner the other thought it more prudent to retire than retort By and by the cripple came back and with glee having reaped a pretty good harvest There he laughed you know now what sort of soldier I am Aye one that fights not the stupid Mexican but a foe worthy your tactics Fortune Hi hi clamored the cripple like a fellow in the pit of a sixpenny theatre then said don t know much what you meant but it went off well This over his countenance capriciously put on a morose ogreness To kindly questions he gave no kindly answers Unhandsome notions were thrown out about free Ameriky as he sarcastically called his country These seemed to disturb and pain the herb doctor who after an interval of thoughtfulness gravely addressed him in these words You my Worthy friend to my concern have reflected upon the government under which you live and suffer Where is your patriotism Where your gratitude True the charitable may find something in your case as you put it partly to account for such reflections as coming from you Still be the facts how they may your reflections are none the less unwarrantable Grant for the moment that your experiences are as you give them in which case I would admit that government might be thought to have more or less to do with what seems undesirable in them But it is never to be forgotten that human government being subordinate to the divine must needs therefore in its degree partake of the characteristics of the divine That is while in general efficacious to happiness the world s law may yet in some cases have to the eye of reason an unequal operation just as in the same imperfect view some inequalities may appear in the operations of heaven s law nevertheless to one who has a right confidence final benignity is in every instance as sure with the one law as the other I expound the point at some length because these are the considerations my poor fellow which weighed as they merit will enable you to sustain with unimpaired trust the apparent calamities which are yours What do you talk your hog latin to me for cried the cripple who throughout the address betrayed the most illiterate obduracy and with an incensed look anew he swung himself Glancing another way till the spasm passed the other continued Charity marvels not that you should be somewhat hard of conviction my friend since you doubtless believe yourself hardly dealt by but forget not that those who are loved are chastened Mustn t chasten them too much though and too long because their skin and heart get hard and feel neither pain nor tickle To mere reason your case looks something piteous I grant But never despond many things the choicest yet remain You breathe this bounteous air are warmed by this gracious sun and though poor and friendless indeed nor so agile as in your youth yet how sweet to roam day by day through the groves plucking the bright mosses and flowers till forlornness itself becomes a hilarity and in your innocent independence you skip for joy Fine skipping with these ere horse posts ha ha Pardon I forgot the crutches My mind figuring you after receiving the benefit of my art overlooked you as you stand before me Your art You call yourself a bone setter a natural bone setter do ye Go bone set the crooked world and then come bone set crooked me Truly my honest friend I thank you for again recalling me to my original object Let me examine you bending down ah I see I see much such a case as the negro s Did you see him Oh no you came aboard since Well his case was a little something like yours I prescribed for him and I shouldn t wonder at all if in a very short time he were able to walk almost as well as myself Now have you no confidence in my art Ha ha The herb doctor averted himself but the wild laugh dying away resumed I will not force confidence on you Still I would fain do the friendly thing by you Here take this box just rub that liniment on the joints night and morning Take it Nothing to pay God bless you Good bye Stay pausing in his swing not untouched by so unexpected an act stay thank ee but will this really do me good Honor bright now will it Don t deceive a poor fellow with changed mien and glistening eye Try it Good bye Stay stay Sure it will do me good Possibly possibly no harm in trying Good bye Stay stay give me three more boxes and here s the money My friend returning towards him with a sadly pleased sort of air I rejoice in the birth of your confidence and hopefulness Believe me that like your crutches confidence and hopefulness will long support a man when his own legs will not Stick to confidence and hopefulness then since how mad for the cripple to throw his crutches away You ask for three more boxes of my liniment Luckily I have just that number remaining Here they are I sell them at half a dollar apiece But I shall take nothing from you There God bless you again good bye Stay in a convulsed voice and rocking himself stay stay You have made a better man of me You have borne with me like a good Christian and talked to me like one and all that is enough without making me a present of these boxes Here is the money I won t take nay There there and may Almighty goodness go with you As the herb doctor withdrew the cripple gradually subsided from his hard rocking into a gentle oscillation It expressed perhaps the soothed mood of his reverie CHAPTER XX REAPPEARANCE OF ONE WHO MAY BE REMEMBERED The herb doctor had not moved far away when in advance of him this spectacle met his eye A dried up old man with the stature of a boy of twelve was tottering about like one out of his mind in rumpled clothes of old moleskin showing recent contact with bedding his ferret eyes blinking in the sunlight of the snowy boat as imbecilely eager and at intervals coughing he peered hither and thither as if in alarmed search for his nurse He presented the aspect of one who bed rid has through overruling excitement like that of a fire been stimulated to his feet You seek some one said the herb doctor accosting him Can I assist you Do do I am so old and miserable coughed the old man Where is he This long time I ve been trying to get up and find him But I haven t any friends and couldn t get up till now Where is he Who do you mean drawing closer to stay the further wanderings of one so weakly Why why why now marking the other s dress why you yes you you you ugh ugh ugh I Ugh ugh ugh you are the man he spoke of Who is he Faith that is just what I want to know Mercy mercy coughed the old man bewildered ever since seeing him my head spins round so I ought to have a guard ee an Is this a snuff colored surtout of yours or ain t it Somehow can t trust my senses any more since trusting him ugh ugh ugh Oh you have trusted somebody Glad to hear it Glad to hear of any instance of that sort Reflects well upon all men But you inquire whether this is a snuff colored surtout I answer it is and will add that a herb doctor wears it Upon this the old man in his broken way replied that then he the herb doctor was the person he sought the person spoken of by the other person as yet unknown He then with flighty eagerness wanted to know who this last person was and where he was and whether he could be trusted with money to treble it Aye now I begin to understand ten to one you mean my worthy friend who in pure goodness of heart makes people s fortunes for them their everlasting fortunes as the phrase goes only charging his one small commission of confidence Aye aye before intrusting funds with my friend you want to know about him Very proper and I am glad to assure you you need have no hesitation none none just none in the world bona fide none Turned me in a trice a hundred dollars the other day into as many eagles Did he did he But where is he Take me to him Pray take my arm The boat is large We may have something of a hunt Come on Ah is that he Where where O no I took yonder coat skirts for his But no my honest friend would never turn tail that way Ah Where where Another mistake Surprising resemblance I took yonder clergyman for him Come on Having searched that part of the boat without success they went to another part and while exploring that the boat sided up to a landing when as the two were passing by the open guard the herb doctor suddenly rushed towards the disembarking throng crying out mister Truman mister Truman There he goes that s he mister Truman mister Truman Confound that steam pipe mister Truman for God s sake mister Truman No no There the plank s in too late we re off With that the huge boat with a mighty walrus wallow rolled away from the shore resuming her course How vexatious exclaimed the herb doctor returning Had we been but one single moment sooner There he goes now towards yon hotel his portmanteau following You see him don t you Where where Can t see him any more Wheel house shot between I am very sorry I should have so liked you to have let him have a hundred or so of your money You would have been pleased with the investment believe me Oh I have let him have some of my money groaned the old man You have My dear sir seizing both the miser s hands in both his own and heartily shaking them My dear sir how I congratulate you You don t know Ugh ugh I fear I don t with another groan His name is Truman is it John Truman Where does he live In saint Louis Where s his office Let me see Jones street number one hundred and no no anyway it s somewhere or other up stairs in Jones street Can t you remember the number Try now One hundred two hundred three hundred Oh my hundred dollars I wonder whether it will be one hundred two hundred three hundred with them Ugh ugh Can t remember the number Positively though I once knew I have forgotten quite forgotten it Strange But never mind You will easily learn in saint Louis He is well known there But I have no receipt ugh ugh Nothing to show don t know where I stand ought to have a guard ee an ugh ugh Don t know anything Ugh ugh Why you know that you gave him your confidence don t you Oh yes Well then But what what how how ugh ugh Why didn t he tell you No What Didn t he tell you that it was a secret a mystery Oh yes Well then But I have no bond Don t need any with mister Truman mister Truman s word is his bond But how am I to get my profits ugh ugh and my money back Don t know anything Ugh ugh Oh you must have confidence Don t say that word again Makes my head spin so Oh I m so old and miserable nobody caring for me everybody fleecing me and my head spins so ugh ugh and this cough racks me so I say again I ought to have a guard ee an So you ought and mister Truman is your guardian to the extent you invested with him Sorry we missed him just now But you ll hear from him All right It s imprudent though to expose yourself this way Let me take you to your berth Forlornly enough the old miser moved slowly away with him But while descending a stairway he was seized with such coughing that he was fain to pause That is a very bad cough Church yard ugh ugh church yard cough Ugh Have you tried anything for it Tired of trying Nothing does me any good ugh ugh Not even the Mammoth Cave Ugh ugh Denned there six months but coughed so bad the rest of the coughers ugh ugh black balled me out Ugh ugh Nothing does me good But have you tried the Omni Balsamic Reinvigorator sir That s what that Truman ugh ugh said I ought to take Yarb medicine you are that yarb doctor too The same Suppose you try one of my boxes now Trust me from what I know of mister Truman he is not the gentleman to recommend even in behalf of a friend anything of whose excellence he is not conscientiously satisfied Ugh how much Only two dollars a box Two dollars Why don t you say two millions ugh ugh Two dollars that s two hundred cents that s eight hundred farthings that s two thousand mills and all for one little box of yarb medicine My head my head oh I ought to have a guard ee an for my head Ugh ugh ugh ugh Well if two dollars a box seems too much take a dozen boxes at twenty dollars and that will be getting four boxes for nothing and you need use none but those four the rest you can retail out at a premium and so cure your cough and make money by it Come you had better do it Cash down Can fill an order in a day or two Here now producing a box pure herbs At that moment seized with another spasm the miser snatched each interval to fix his half distrustful half hopeful eye upon the medicine held alluringly up Sure ugh Sure it s all nat ral Nothing but yarbs If I only thought it was a purely nat ral medicine now all yarbs ugh ugh oh this cough this cough ugh ugh shatters my whole body Ugh ugh ugh For heaven s sake try my medicine if but a single box That it is pure nature you may be confident Refer you to mister Truman Don t know his number ugh ugh ugh ugh Oh this cough He did speak well of this medicine though said solemnly it would cure me ugh ugh ugh ugh take off a dollar and I ll have a box Can t sir can t Say a dollar and half Ugh Can t Am pledged to the one price system only honorable one Take off a shilling ugh ugh Can t Ugh ugh ugh I ll take it There Grudgingly he handed eight silver coins but while still in his hand his cough took him and they were shaken upon the deck One by one the herb doctor picked them up and examining them said These are not quarters these are pistareens and clipped and sweated at that Oh don t be so miserly ugh ugh better a beast than a miser ugh ugh Well let it go Anything rather than the idea of your not being cured of such a cough And I hope for the credit of humanity you have not made it appear worse than it is merely with a view to working upon the weak point of my pity and so getting my medicine the cheaper Now mind don t take it till night Just before retiring is the time There you can get along now can t you I would attend you further but I land presently and must go hunt up my luggage CHAPTER XXI A HARD CASE Yarbs yarbs natur natur you foolish old file you He diddled you with that hocus pocus did he Yarbs and natur will cure your incurable cough you think It was a rather eccentric looking person who spoke somewhat ursine in aspect sporting a shaggy spencer of the cloth called bear s skin a high peaked cap of raccoon skin the long bushy tail switching over behind raw hide leggings grim stubble chin and to end a double barreled gun in hand a Missouri bachelor a Hoosier gentleman of Spartan leisure and fortune and equally Spartan manners and sentiments and as the sequel may show not less acquainted in a Spartan way of his own with philosophy and books than with woodcraft and rifles He must have overheard some of the talk between the miser and the herb doctor for just after the withdrawal of the one he made up to the other now at the foot of the stairs leaning against the baluster there with the greeting above Think it will cure me coughed the miser in echo why shouldn t it The medicine is nat ral yarbs pure yarbs yarbs must cure me Because a thing is nat ral as you call it you think it must be good But who gave you that cough Was it or was it not nature Sure you don t think that natur Dame Natur will hurt a body do you Natur is good Queen Bess but who s responsible for the cholera But yarbs yarbs yarbs are good What s deadly nightshade Yarb ain t it Oh that a Christian man should speak agin natur and yarbs ugh ugh ugh ain t sick men sent out into the country sent out to natur and grass Aye and poets send out the sick spirit to green pastures like lame horses turned out unshod to the turf to renew their hoofs A sort of yarb doctors in their way poets have it that for sore hearts as for sore lungs nature is the grand cure But who froze to death my teamster on the prairie And who made an idiot of Peter the Wild Boy Then you don t believe in these ere yarb doctors Yarb doctors I remember the lank yarb doctor I saw once on a hospital cot in Mobile One of the faculty passing round and seeing who lay there said with professional triumph Ah doctor Green your yarbs don t help ye now doctor Green Have to come to us and the mercury now doctor Green Natur Y a r b s Did I hear something about herbs and herb doctors here said a flute like voice advancing It was the herb doctor in person Carpet bag in hand he happened to be strolling back that way Pardon me addressing the Missourian but if I caught your words aright you would seem to have little confidence in nature which really in my way of thinking looks like carrying the spirit of distrust pretty far And who of my sublime species may you be turning short round upon him clicking his rifle lock with an air which would have seemed half cynic half wild cat were it not for the grotesque excess of the expression which made its sincerity appear more or less dubious One who has confidence in nature and confidence in man with some little modest confidence in himself That s your Confession of Faith is it Confidence in man eh Pray which do you think are most knaves or fools Having met with few or none of either I hardly think I am competent to answer I will answer for you Fools are most Why do you think so For the same reason that I think oats are numerically more than horses Don t knaves munch up fools just as horses do oats A droll sir you are a droll I can appreciate drollery ha ha ha But I m in earnest That s the drollery to deliver droll extravagance with an earnest air knaves munching up fools as horses oats Faith very droll indeed ha ha ha Yes I think I understand you now sir How silly I was to have taken you seriously in your droll conceits too about having no confidence in nature In reality you have just as much as I have I have confidence in nature I I say again there is nothing I am more suspicious of I once lost ten thousand dollars by nature Nature embezzled that amount from me absconded with ten thousand dollars worth of my property a plantation on this stream swept clean away by one of those sudden shiftings of the banks in a freshet ten thousand dollars worth of alluvion thrown broad off upon the waters But have you no confidence that by a reverse shifting that soil will come back after many days ah here is my venerable friend observing the old miser not in your berth yet Pray if you will keep afoot don t lean against that baluster take my arm It was taken and the two stood together the old miser leaning against the herb doctor with something of that air of trustful fraternity with which when standing the less strong of the Siamese twins habitually leans against the other The Missourian eyed them in silence which was broken by the herb doctor You look surprised sir Is it because I publicly take under my protection a figure like this But I am never ashamed of honesty whatever his coat Look you said the Missourian after a scrutinizing pause you are a queer sort of chap Don t know exactly what to make of you Upon the whole though you somewhat remind me of the last boy I had on my place Good trustworthy boy I hope Oh very I am now started to get me made some kind of machine to do the sort of work which boys are supposed to be fitted for Then you have passed a veto upon boys And men too But my dear sir does not that again imply more or less lack of confidence Stand up a little just a very little my venerable friend you lean rather hard No confidence in boys no confidence in men no confidence in nature Pray sir who or what may you have confidence in I have confidence in distrust more particularly as applied to you and your herbs Well with a forbearing smile that is frank But pray don t forget that when you suspect my herbs you suspect nature Didn t I say that before Very good For the argument s sake I will suppose you are in earnest Now can you who suspect nature deny that this same nature not only kindly brought you into being but has faithfully nursed you to your present vigorous and independent condition Is it not to nature that you are indebted for that robustness of mind which you so unhandsomely use to her scandal Pray is it not to nature that you owe the very eyes by which you criticise her No for the privilege of vision I am indebted to an oculist who in my tenth year operated upon me in Philadelphia Nature made me blind and would have kept me so My oculist counterplotted her And yet sir by your complexion I judge you live an out of door life without knowing it you are partial to nature you fly to nature the universal mother Very motherly Sir in the passion fits of nature I ve known birds fly from nature to me rough as I look yes sir in a tempest refuge here smiting the folds of his bearskin Fact sir fact Come come mister Palaverer for all your palavering did you yourself never shut out nature of a cold wet night Bar her out Bolt her out Lint her out As to that said the herb doctor calmly much may be said Say it then ruffling all his hairs You can t sir can t Then as in apostrophe Look you nature I don t deny but your clover is sweet and your dandelions don t roar but whose hailstones smashed my windows Sir with unimpaired affability producing one of his boxes I am pained to meet with one who holds nature a dangerous character Though your manner is refined your voice is rough in short you seem to have a sore throat In the calumniated name of nature I present you with this box my venerable friend here has a similar one but to you a free gift sir Through her regularly authorized agents of whom I happen to be one Nature delights in benefiting those who most abuse her Pray take it Away with it Don t hold it so near Ten to one there is a torpedo in it Such things have been Editors been killed that way Take it further off I say Good heavens my dear sir I tell you I want none of your boxes snapping his rifle Oh take it ugh ugh do take it chimed in the old miser I wish he would give me one for nothing You find it lonely eh turning short round gulled yourself you would have a companion How can he find it lonely returned the herb doctor or how desire a companion when here I stand by him I even I in whom he has trust For the gulling tell me is it humane to talk so to this poor old man Granting that his dependence on my medicine is vain is it kind to deprive him of what in mere imagination if nothing more may help eke out with hope his disease For you if you have no confidence and thanks to your native health can get along without it so far at least as trusting in my medicine goes yet how cruel an argument to use with this afflicted one here Is it not for all the world as if some brawny pugilist aglow in December should rush in and put out a hospital fire because forsooth he feeling no need of artificial heat the shivering patients shall have none Put it to your conscience sir and you will admit that whatever be the nature of this afflicted one s trust you in opposing it evince either an erring head or a heart amiss Come own are you not pitiless Yes poor soul said the Missourian gravely eying the old man yes it is pitiless in one like me to speak too honestly to one like you You are a late sitter up in this life past man s usual bed time and truth though with some it makes a wholesome breakfast proves to all a supper too hearty Hearty food taken late gives bad dreams What in wonder s name ugh ugh is he talking about asked the old miser looking up to the herb doctor Heaven be praised for that cried the Missourian Out of his mind ain t he again appealed the old miser Pray sir said the herb doctor to the Missourian for what were you giving thanks just now For this that with some minds truth is in effect not so cruel a thing after all seeing that like a loaded pistol found by poor devils of savages it raises more wonder than terror its peculiar virtue being unguessed unless indeed by indiscreet handling it should happen to go off of itself I pretend not to divine your meaning there said the herb doctor after a pause during which he eyed the Missourian with a kind of pinched expression mixed of pain and curiosity as if he grieved at his state of mind and at the same time wondered what had brought him to it but this much I know he added that the general cast of your thoughts is to say the least unfortunate There is strength in them but a strength whose source being physical must wither You will yet recant Recant Yes when as with this old man your evil days of decay come on when a hoary captive in your chamber then will you something like the dungeoned Italian we read of gladly seek the breast of that confidence begot in the tender time of your youth blessed beyond telling if it return to you in age Go back to nurse again eh Second childhood indeed You are soft Mercy mercy cried the old miser what is all this ugh ugh Do talk sense my good friends Ain t you to the Missourian going to buy some of that medicine Pray my venerable friend said the herb doctor now trying to straighten himself don t lean quite so hard my arm grows numb abate a little just a very little Go said the Missourian go lay down in your grave old man if you can t stand of yourself It s a hard world for a leaner As to his grave said the herb doctor that is far enough off so he but faithfully take my medicine Ugh ugh ugh He says true No I ain t ugh a going to die yet ugh ugh ugh Many years to live yet ugh ugh ugh I approve your confidence said the herb doctor but your coughing distresses me besides being injurious to you Pray let me conduct you to your berth You are best there Our friend here will wait till my return I know With which he led the old miser away and then coming back the talk with the Missourian was resumed Sir said the herb doctor with some dignity and more feeling now that our infirm friend is withdrawn allow me to the full to express my concern at the words you allowed to escape you in his hearing Some of those words if I err not besides being calculated to beget deplorable distrust in the patient seemed fitted to convey unpleasant imputations against me his physician Suppose they did with a menacing air Why then then indeed respectfully retreating I fall back upon my previous theory of your general facetiousness I have the fortune to be in company with a humorist a wag Fall back you had better and wag it is cried the Missourian following him up and wagging his raccoon tail almost into the herb doctor s face look you At what At this coon Can you the fox catch him If you mean returned the other not unselfpossessed whether I flatter myself that I can in any way dupe you or impose upon you or pass myself off upon you for what I am not I as an honest man answer that I have neither the inclination nor the power to do aught of the kind Honest man Seems to me you talk more like a craven You in vain seek to pick a quarrel with me or put any affront upon me The innocence in me heals me A healing like your own nostrums But you are a queer man a very queer and dubious man upon the whole about the most so I ever met The scrutiny accompanying this seemed unwelcome to the diffidence of the herb doctor As if at once to attest the absence of resentment as well as to change the subject he threw a kind of familiar cordiality into his air and said So you are going to get some machine made to do your work Philanthropic scruples doubtless forbid your going as far as New Orleans for slaves Slaves morose again in a twinkling won t have em Bad enough to see whites ducking and grinning round for a favor without having those poor devils of niggers congeeing round for their corn Though to me the niggers are the freer of the two You are an abolitionist ain t you he added squaring himself with both hands on his rifle used for a staff and gazing in the herb doctor s face with no more reverence than if it were a target You are an abolitionist ain t you As to that I cannot so readily answer If by abolitionist you mean a zealot I am none but if you mean a man who being a man feels for all men slaves included and by any lawful act opposed to nobody s interest and therefore rousing nobody s enmity would willingly abolish suffering supposing it in its degree to exist from among mankind irrespective of color then am I what you say Picked and prudent sentiments You are the moderate man the invaluable understrapper of the wicked man You the moderate man may be used for wrong but are useless for right From all this said the herb doctor still forgivingly I infer that you a Missourian though living in a slave state are without slave sentiments Aye but are you Is not that air of yours so spiritlessly enduring and yielding the very air of a slave Who is your master pray or are you owned by a company My master Aye for come from Maine or Georgia you come from a slave state and a slave pen where the best breeds are to be bought up at any price from a livelihood to the Presidency Abolitionism ye gods but expresses the fellow feeling of slave for slave The back woods would seem to have given you rather eccentric notions now with polite superiority smiled the herb doctor still with manly intrepidity forbearing each unmanly thrust but to return since for your purpose you will have neither man nor boy bond nor free truly then some sort of machine for you is all there is left My desires for your success attend you sir Ah glancing shoreward here is Cape Giradeau I must leave you CHAPTER XXII IN THE POLITE SPIRIT OF THE TUSCULAN DISPUTATIONS Philosophical Intelligence Office novel idea But how did you come to dream that I wanted anything in your absurd line eh About twenty minutes after leaving Cape Giradeau the above was growled out over his shoulder by the Missourian to a chance stranger who had just accosted him a round backed baker kneed man in a mean five dollar suit wearing collar wise by a chain a small brass plate inscribed P I O and who with a sort of canine deprecation slunk obliquely behind How did you come to dream that I wanted anything in your line eh Oh respected sir whined the other crouching a pace nearer and in his obsequiousness seeming to wag his very coat tails behind him shabby though they were oh sir from long experience one glance tells me the gentleman who is in need of our humble services But suppose I did want a boy what they jocosely call a good boy how could your absurd office help me Philosophical Intelligence Office Yes respected sir an office founded on strictly philosophical and physio Look you come up here how by philosophy or physiology either make good boys to order Come up here Don t give me a crick in the neck Come up here come sir come calling as if to his pointer Tell me how put the requisite assortment of good qualities into a boy as the assorted mince into the pie Respected sir our office You talk much of that office Where is it On board this boat Oh no sir I just came aboard Our office Came aboard at that last landing eh Pray do you know a herb doctor there Smooth scamp in a snuff colored surtout Oh sir I was but a sojourner at Cape Giradeau Though now that you mention a snuff colored surtout I think I met such a man as you speak of stepping ashore as I stepped aboard and pears to me I have seen him somewhere before Looks like a very mild Christian sort of person I should say Do you know him respected sir Not much but better than you seem to Proceed with your business With a low shabby bow as grateful for the permission the other began Our office Look you broke in the bachelor with ire have you the spinal complaint What are you ducking and groveling about Keep still Where s your office The branch one which I represent is at Alton sir in the free state we now pass pointing somewhat proudly ashore Free eh You a freeman you flatter yourself With those coat tails and that spinal complaint of servility Free Just cast up in your private mind who is your master will you Oh oh oh I don t understand indeed indeed But respected sir as before said our office founded on principles wholly new To the devil with your principles Bad sign when a man begins to talk of his principles Hold come back sir back here back sir back I tell you no more boys for me Nay I m a Mede and Persian In my old home in the woods I m pestered enough with squirrels weasels chipmunks skunks I want no more wild vermin to spoil my temper and waste my substance Don t talk of boys enough of your boys a plague of your boys chilblains on your boys As for Intelligence Offices I ve lived in the East and know em Swindling concerns kept by low born cynics under a fawning exterior wreaking their cynic malice upon mankind You are a fair specimen of em Oh dear dear dear Dear Yes a thrice dear purchase one of your boys would be to me A rot on your boys But respected sir if you will not have boys might we not in our small way accommodate you with a man Accommodate Pray no doubt you could accommodate me with a bosom friend too couldn t you Accommodate Obliging word accommodate there s accommodation notes now where one accommodates another with a loan and if he don t pay it pretty quickly accommodates him with a chain to his foot Accommodate God forbid that I should ever be accommodated No no Look you as I told that cousin german of yours the herb doctor I m now on the road to get me made some sort of machine to do my work Machines for me My cider mill does that ever steal my cider My mowing machine does that ever lay a bed mornings My corn husker does that ever give me insolence No cider mill mowing machine corn husker all faithfully attend to their business Disinterested too no board no wages yet doing good all their lives long shining examples that virtue is its own reward the only practical Christians I know Oh dear dear dear dear Yes sir boys Start my soul bolts what a difference in a moral point of view between a corn husker and a boy Sir a corn husker for its patient continuance in well doing might not unfitly go to heaven Do you suppose a boy will A corn husker in heaven turning up the whites of his eyes Respected sir this way of talking as if heaven were a kind of Washington patent office museum oh oh oh as if mere machine work and puppet work went to heaven oh oh oh Things incapable of free agency to receive the eternal reward of well doing oh oh oh You Praise God Barebones you what are you groaning about Did I say anything of that sort Seems to me though you talk so good you are mighty quick at a hint the other way or else you want to pick a polemic quarrel with me It may be so or not respected sir was now the demure reply but if it be it is only because as a soldier out of honor is quick in taking affront so a Christian out of religion is quick sometimes perhaps a little too much so in spying heresy Well after an astonished pause for an unaccountable pair you and the herb doctor ought to yoke together So saying the bachelor was eying him rather sharply when he with the brass plate recalled him to the discussion by a hint not unflattering that he the man with the brass plate was all anxiety to hear him further on the subject of servants About that matter exclaimed the impulsive bachelor going off at the hint like a rocket all thinking minds are now a days coming to the conclusion one derived from an immense hereditary experience see what Horace and others of the ancients say of servants coming to the conclusion I say that boy or man the human animal is for most work purposes a losing animal Can t be trusted less trustworthy than oxen for conscientiousness a turn spit dog excels him Hence these thousand new inventions carding machines horseshoe machines tunnel boring machines reaping machines apple paring machines boot blacking machines sewing machines shaving machines run of errand machines dumb waiter machines and the Lord only knows what machines all of which announce the era when that refractory animal the working or serving man shall be a buried by gone a superseded fossil Shortly prior to which glorious time I doubt not that a price will be put upon their peltries as upon the knavish possums especially the boys Yes sir ringing his rifle down on the deck I rejoice to think that the day is at hand when prompted to it by law I shall shoulder this gun and go out a boy shooting Oh now Lord Lord Lord But our office respected sir conducted as I ventured to observe No sir bristlingly settling his stubble chin in his coon skins Don t try to oil me the herb doctor tried that My experience carried now through a course worse than salivation a course of five and thirty boys proves to me that boyhood is a natural state of rascality Save us save us Yes sir yes My name is Pitch I stick to what I say I speak from fifteen years experience five and thirty boys American Irish English German African Mulatto not to speak of that China boy sent me by one who well knew my perplexities from California and that Lascar boy from Bombay Thug I found him sucking the embryo life from my spring eggs All rascals sir every soul of them Caucasian or Mongol Amazing the endless variety of rascality in human nature of the juvenile sort I remember that having discharged one after another twenty nine boys each too for some wholly unforeseen species of viciousness peculiar to that one peculiar boy I remember saying to myself Now then surely I have got to the end of the list wholly exhausted it I have only now to get me a boy any boy different from those twenty nine preceding boys and he infallibly shall be that virtuous boy I have so long been seeking But bless me this thirtieth boy by the way having at the time long forsworn your intelligence offices I had him sent to me from the Commissioners of Emigration all the way from New York culled out carefully in fine at my particular request from a standing army of eight hundred boys the flowers of all nations so they wrote me temporarily in barracks on an East River island I say this thirtieth boy was in person not ungraceful his deceased mother a lady s maid or something of that sort and in manner why in a plebeian way a perfect Chesterfield very intelligent too quick as a flash But such suavity Please sir please sir always bowing and saying Please sir In the strangest way too combining a filial affection with a menial respect Took such warm singular interest in my affairs Wanted to be considered one of the family sort of adopted son of mine I suppose Of a morning when I would go out to my stable with what childlike good nature he would trot out my nag Please sir I think he s getting fatter and fatter But he don t look very clean does he unwilling to be downright harsh with so affectionate a lad and he seems a little hollow inside the haunch there don t he or no perhaps I don t see plain this morning Oh please sir it s just there I think he s gaining so please Polite scamp I soon found he never gave that wretched nag his oats of nights didn t bed him either Was above that sort of chambermaid work No end to his willful neglects But the more he abused my service the more polite he grew Oh sir some way you mistook him Not a bit of it Besides sir he was a boy who under a Chesterfieldian exterior hid strong destructive propensities He cut up my horse blanket for the bits of leather for hinges to his chest Denied it point blank After he was gone found the shreds under his mattress Would slyly break his hoe handle too on purpose to get rid of hoeing Then be so gracefully penitent for his fatal excess of industrious strength Offer to mend all by taking a nice stroll to the nighest settlement cherry trees in full bearing all the way to get the broken thing cobbled Very politely stole my pears odd pennies shillings dollars and nuts regular squirrel at it But I could prove nothing Expressed to him my suspicions Said I moderately enough A little less politeness and a little more honesty would suit me better He fired up threatened to sue for libel I won t say anything about his afterwards in Ohio being found in the act of gracefully putting a bar across a rail road track for the reason that a stoker called him the rogue that he was But enough polite boys or saucy boys white boys or black boys smart boys or lazy boys Caucasian boys or Mongol boys all are rascals Shocking shocking nervously tucking his frayed cravat end out of sight Surely respected sir you labor under a deplorable hallucination Why pardon again you seem to have not the slightest confidence in boys I admit indeed that boys some of them at least are but too prone to one little foolish foible or other But what then respected sir when by natural laws they finally outgrow such things and wholly Having until now vented himself mostly in plaintive dissent of canine whines and groans the man with the brass plate seemed beginning to summon courage to a less timid encounter But upon his maiden essay was not very encouragingly handled since the dialogue immediately continued as follows Boys outgrow what is amiss in them From bad boys spring good men Sir the child is father of the man hence as all boys are rascals so are all men But God bless me you must know these things better than I keeping an intelligence office as you do a business which must furnish peculiar facilities for studying mankind Come come up here sir confess you know these things pretty well after all Do you not know that all men are rascals and all boys too Sir replied the other spite of his shocked feelings seeming to pluck up some spirit but not to an indiscreet degree Sir heaven be praised I am far very far from knowing what you say True he thoughtfully continued with my associates I keep an intelligence office and for ten years come October have one way or other been concerned in that line for no small period in the great city of Cincinnati too and though as you hint within that long interval I must have had more or less favorable opportunity for studying mankind in a business way scanning not only the faces but ransacking the lives of several thousands of human beings male and female of various nations both employers and employed genteel and ungenteel educated and uneducated yet of course I candidly admit with some random exceptions I have so far as my small observation goes found that mankind thus domestically viewed confidentially viewed I may say they upon the whole making some reasonable allowances for human imperfection present as pure a moral spectacle as the purest angel could wish I say it respected sir with confidence Gammon You don t mean what you say Else you are like a landsman at sea don t know the ropes the very things everlastingly pulled before your eyes Serpent like they glide about traveling blocks too subtle for you In short the entire ship is a riddle Why you green ones wouldn t know if she were unseaworthy but still with thumbs stuck back into your arm holes pace the rotten planks singing like a fool words put into your green mouth by the cunning owner the man who heavily insuring it sends his ship to be wrecked A wet sheet and a flowing sea and sir now that it occurs to me your talk the whole of it is but a wet sheet and a flowing sea and an idle wind that follows fast offering a striking contrast to my own discourse Sir exclaimed the man with the brass plate his patience now more or less tasked permit me with deference to hint that some of your remarks are injudiciously worded And thus we say to our patrons when they enter our office full of abuse of us because of some worthy boy we may have sent them some boy wholly misjudged for the time Yes sir permit me to remark that you do not sufficiently consider that though a small man I may have my small share of feelings Well well I didn t mean to wound your feelings at all And that they are small very small I take your word for it Sorry sorry But truth is like a thrashing machine tender sensibilities must keep out of the way Hope you understand me Don t want to hurt you All I say is what I said in the first place only now I swear it that all boys are rascals Sir lowly replied the other still forbearing like an old lawyer badgered in court or else like a good hearted simpleton the butt of mischievous wags Sir since you come back to the point will you allow me in my small quiet way to submit to you certain small quiet views of the subject in hand Oh yes with insulting indifference rubbing his chin and looking the other way Oh yes go on Well then respected sir continued the other now assuming as genteel an attitude as the irritating set of his pinched five dollar suit would permit well then sir the peculiar principles the strictly philosophical principles I may say guardedly rising in dignity as he guardedly rose on his toes upon which our office is founded has led me and my associates in our small quiet way to a careful analytical study of man conducted too on a quiet theory and with an unobtrusive aim wholly our own That theory I will not now at large set forth But some of the discoveries resulting from it I will by your permission very briefly mention such of them I mean as refer to the state of boyhood scientifically viewed Then you have studied the thing expressly studied boys eh Why didn t you out with that before Sir in my small business way I have not conversed with so many masters gentlemen masters for nothing I have been taught that in this world there is a precedence of opinions as well as of persons You have kindly given me your views I am now with modesty about to give you mine Stop flunkying go on In the first place sir our theory teaches us to proceed by analogy from the physical to the moral Are we right there sir Now sir take a young boy a young male infant rather a man child in short what sir I respectfully ask do you in the first place remark A rascal sir present and prospective a rascal Sir if passion is to invade surely science must evacuate May I proceed Well then what in the first place in a general view do you remark respected sir in that male baby or man child The bachelor privily growled but this time upon the whole better governed himself than before though not indeed to the degree of thinking it prudent to risk an articulate response What do you remark I respectfully repeat But as no answer came only the low half suppressed growl as of Bruin in a hollow trunk the questioner continued Well sir if you will permit me in my small way to speak for you you remark respected sir an incipient creation loose sort of sketchy thing a little preliminary rag paper study or careless cartoon so to speak of a man The idea you see respected sir is there but as yet wants filling out In a word respected sir the man child is at present but little every way I don t pretend to deny it but then he promises well does he not Yes promises very well indeed I may say So too we say to our patrons in reference to some noble little youngster objected to for being a dwarf But to advance one step further extending his thread bare leg as he drew a pace nearer we must now drop the figure of the rag paper cartoon and borrow one to use presently when wanted from the horticultural kingdom Some bud lily bud if you please Now such points as the new born man child has as yet not all that could be desired I am free to confess still such as they are there they are and palpable as those of an adult But we stop not here taking another step The man child not only possesses these present points small though they are but likewise now our horticultural image comes into play like the bud of the lily he contains concealed rudiments of others that is points at present invisible with beauties at present dormant Come come this talk is getting too horticultural and beautiful altogether Cut it short cut it short Respected sir with a rustily martial sort of gesture like a decayed corporal s when deploying into the field of discourse the vanguard of an important argument much more in evolving the grand central forces of a new philosophy of boys as I may say surely you will kindly allow scope adequate to the movement in hand small and humble in its way as that movement may be Is it worth my while to go on respected sir Yes stop flunkying and go on Thus encouraged again the philosopher with the brass plate proceeded Supposing sir that worthy gentleman in such terms to an applicant for service we allude to some patron we chance to have in our eye supposing respected sir that worthy gentleman Adam to have been dropped overnight in Eden as a calf in the pasture supposing that sir then how could even the learned serpent himself have foreknown that such a downy chinned little innocent would eventually rival the goat in a beard Sir wise as the serpent was that eventuality would have been entirely hidden from his wisdom I don t know about that The devil is very sagacious To judge by the event he appears to have understood man better even than the Being who made him For God s sake don t say that sir To the point Can it now with fairness be denied that in his beard the man child prospectively possesses an appendix not less imposing than patriarchal and for this goodly beard should we not by generous anticipation give the man child even in his cradle credit Should we not now sir respectfully I put it Yes if like pig weed he mows it down soon as it shoots porcinely rubbing his stubble chin against his coon skins I have hinted at the analogy continued the other calmly disregardful of the digression now to apply it Suppose a boy evince no noble quality Then generously give him credit for his prospective one Don t you see So we say to our patrons when they would fain return a boy upon us as unworthy Madam or sir as the case may be has this boy a beard No Has he we respectfully ask as yet evinced any noble quality No indeed Then madam or sir take him back we humbly beseech and keep him till that same noble quality sprouts for have confidence it like the beard is in him Very fine theory scornfully exclaimed the bachelor yet in secret perhaps not entirely undisturbed by these strange new views of the matter but what trust is to be placed in it The trust of perfect confidence sir To proceed Once more if you please regard the man child Hold paw like thrusting put his bearskin arm don t intrude that man child upon me too often He who loves not bread dotes not on dough As little of your man child as your logical arrangements will admit Anew regard the man child with inspired intrepidity repeated he with the brass plate in the perspective of his developments I mean At first the man child has no teeth but about the sixth month am I right sir Don t know anything about it To proceed then though at first deficient in teeth about the sixth month the man child begins to put forth in that particular And sweet those tender little puttings forth are Very but blown out of his mouth directly worthless enough Admitted And therefore we say to our patrons returning with a boy alleged not only to be deficient in goodness but redundant in ill The lad madam or sir evinces very corrupt qualities does he No end to them But have confidence there will be for pray madam in this lad s early childhood were not those frail first teeth then his followed by his present sound even beautiful and permanent set And the more objectionable those first teeth became was not that madam we respectfully submit so much the more reason to look for their speedy substitution by the present sound even beautiful and permanent ones True true can t deny that Then madam take him back we respectfully beg and wait till in the now swift course of nature dropping those transient moral blemishes you complain of he replacingly buds forth in the sound even beautiful and permanent virtues Very philosophical again was the contemptuous reply the outward contempt perhaps proportioned to the inward misgiving Vastly philosophical indeed but tell me to continue your analogy since the second teeth followed in fact came from the first is there no chance the blemish may be transmitted Not at all Abating in humility as he gained in the argument The second teeth follow but do not come from the first successors not sons The first teeth are not like the germ blossom of the apple at once the father of and incorporated into the growth it foreruns but they are thrust from their place by the independent undergrowth of the succeeding set an illustration by the way which shows more for me than I meant though not more than I wish What does it show Surly looking as a thundercloud with the inkept unrest of unacknowledged conviction It shows this respected sir that in the case of any boy especially an ill one to apply unconditionally the saying that the child is father of the man is besides implying an uncharitable aspersion of the race affirming a thing very wide of Your analogy like a snapping turtle Yes respected sir But is analogy argument You are a punster Punster respected sir with a look of being aggrieved Yes you pun with ideas as another man may with words Oh well sir whoever talks in that strain whoever has no confidence in human reason whoever despises human reason in vain to reason with him Still respected sir altering his air permit me to hint that had not the force of analogy moved you somewhat you would hardly have offered to contemn it Talk away disdainfully but pray tell me what has that last analogy of yours to do with your intelligence office business Everything to do with it respected sir From that analogy we derive the reply made to such a patron as shortly after being supplied by us with an adult servant proposes to return him upon our hands not that while with the patron said adult has given any cause of dissatisfaction but the patron has just chanced to hear something unfavorable concerning him from some gentleman who employed said adult long before while a boy To which too fastidious patron we taking said adult by the hand and graciously reintroducing him to the patron say Far be it from you madam or sir to proceed in your censure against this adult in anything of the spirit of an ex post facto law Madam or sir would you visit upon the butterfly the caterpillar In the natural advance of all creatures do they not bury themselves over and over again in the endless resurrection of better and better Madam or sir take back this adult he may have been a caterpillar but is now a butterfly Pun away but even accepting your analogical pun what does it amount to Was the caterpillar one creature and is the butterfly another The butterfly is the caterpillar in a gaudy cloak stripped of which there lies the impostor s long spindle of a body pretty much worm shaped as before You reject the analogy To the facts then You deny that a youth of one character can be transformed into a man of an opposite character Now then yes I have it There s the founder of La Trappe and Ignatius Loyola in boyhood and someway into manhood both devil may care bloods and yet in the end the wonders of the world for anchoritish self command These two examples by the way we cite to such patrons as would hastily return rakish young waiters upon us Madam or sir patience patience we say good madam or sir would you discharge forth your cask of good wine because while working it riles more or less Then discharge not forth this young waiter the good in him is working But he is a sad rake Therein is his promise the rake being crude material for the saint Ah you are a talking man what I call a wordy man You talk talk And with submission sir what is the greatest judge bishop or prophet but a talking man He talks talks It is the peculiar vocation of a teacher to talk What s wisdom itself but table talk The best wisdom in this world and the last spoken by its teacher did it not literally and truly come in the form of table talk You you you rattling down his rifle To shift the subject since we cannot agree Pray what is your opinion respected sir of saint Augustine saint Augustine What should I or you either know of him Seems to me for one in such a business to say nothing of such a coat that though you don t know a great deal indeed yet you know a good deal more than you ought to know or than you have a right to know or than it is safe or expedient for you to know or than in the fair course of life you could have honestly come to know I am of opinion you should be served like a Jew in the middle ages with his gold this knowledge of yours which you haven t enough knowledge to know how to make a right use of it should be taken from you And so I have been thinking all along You are merry sir But you have a little looked into saint Augustine I suppose saint Augustine on Original Sin is my text book But you I ask again where do you find time or inclination for these out of the way speculations In fact your whole talk the more I think of it is altogether unexampled and extraordinary Respected sir have I not already informed you that the quite new method the strictly philosophical one on which our office is founded has led me and my associates to an enlarged study of mankind It was my fault if I did not likewise hint that these studies directed always to the scientific procuring of good servants of all sorts boys included for the kind gentlemen our patrons that these studies I say have been conducted equally among all books of all libraries as among all men of all nations Then you rather like saint Augustine sir Excellent genius In some points he was yet how comes it that under his own hand saint Augustine confesses that until his thirtieth year he was a very sad dog A saint a sad dog Not the saint but the saint s irresponsible little forerunner the boy All boys are rascals and so are all men again flying off at his tangent my name is Pitch I stick to what I say Ah sir permit me when I behold you on this mild summer s eve thus eccentrically clothed in the skins of wild beasts I cannot but conclude that the equally grim and unsuitable habit of your mind is likewise but an eccentric assumption having no basis in your genuine soul no more than in nature herself Well really now really fidgeted the bachelor not unaffected in his conscience by these benign personalities really really now I don t know but that I may have been a little bit too hard upon those five and thirty boys of mine Glad to find you a little softening sir Who knows now but that flexile gracefulness however questionable at the time of that thirtieth boy of yours might have been the silky husk of the most solid qualities of maturity It might have been with him as with the ear of the Indian corn Yes yes yes excitedly cried the bachelor as the light of this new illustration broke in yes yes and now that I think of it how often I ve sadly watched my Indian corn in May wondering whether such sickly half eaten sprouts could ever thrive up into the stiff stately spear of August A most admirable reflection sir and you have only according to the analogical theory first started by our office to apply it to that thirtieth boy in question and see the result Had you but kept that thirtieth boy been patient with his sickly virtues cultivated them hoed round them why what a glorious guerdon would have been yours when at last you should have had a saint Augustine for an ostler Really really well I am glad I didn t send him to jail as at first I intended Oh that would have been too bad Grant he was vicious The petty vices of boys are like the innocent kicks of colts as yet imperfectly broken Some boys know not virtue only for the same reason they know not French it was never taught them Established upon the basis of parental charity juvenile asylums exist by law for the benefit of lads convicted of acts which in adults would have received other requital Why Because do what they will society like our office at bottom has a Christian confidence in boys And all this we say to our patrons Your patrons sir seem your marines to whom you may say anything said the other relapsing Why do knowing employers shun youths from asylums though offered them at the smallest wages I ll none of your reformado boys Such a boy respected sir I would not get for you but a boy that never needed reform Do not smile for as whooping cough and measles are juvenile diseases and yet some juveniles never have them so are there boys equally free from juvenile vices True for the best of boys measles may be contagious and evil communications corrupt good manners but a boy with a sound mind in a sound body such is the boy I would get you If hitherto sir you have struck upon a peculiarly bad vein of boys so much the more hope now of your hitting a good one That sounds a kind of reasonable as it were a little so really In fact though you have said a great many foolish things very foolish and absurd things yet upon the whole your conversation has been such as might almost lead one less distrustful than I to repose a certain conditional confidence in you I had almost added in your office also Now for the humor of it supposing that even I I myself really had this sort of conditional confidence though but a grain what sort of a boy in sober fact could you send me And what would be your fee Conducted replied the other somewhat loftily rising now in eloquence as his proselyte for all his pretenses sunk in conviction conducted upon principles involving care learning and labor exceeding what is usual in kindred institutions the Philosophical Intelligence Office is forced to charge somewhat higher than customary Briefly our fee is three dollars in advance As for the boy by a lucky chance I have a very promising little fellow now in my eye a very likely little fellow indeed Honest As the day is long Might trust him with untold millions Such at least were the marginal observations on the phrenological chart of his head submitted to me by the mother How old Just fifteen Tall Stout Uncommonly so for his age his mother remarked Industrious The busy bee The bachelor fell into a troubled reverie At last with much hesitancy he spoke Do you think now candidly that I say candidly candidly could I have some small limited some faint conditional degree of confidence in that boy Candidly now Candidly you could A sound boy A good boy Never knew one more so The bachelor fell into another irresolute reverie then said Well now you have suggested some rather new views of boys and men too Upon those views in the concrete I at present decline to determine Nevertheless for the sake purely of a scientific experiment I will try that boy I don t think him an angel mind No no But I ll try him There are my three dollars and here is my address Send him along this day two weeks Hold you will be wanting the money for his passage There handing it somewhat reluctantly Ah thank you I had forgotten his passage then altering in manner and gravely holding the bills continued Respected sir never willingly do I handle money not with perfect willingness nay with a certain alacrity paid Either tell me that you have a perfect and unquestioning confidence in me never mind the boy now or permit me respectfully to return these bills Put em up put em up Thank you Confidence is the indispensable basis of all sorts of business transactions Without it commerce between man and man as between country and country would like a watch run down and stop And now supposing that against present expectation the lad should after all evince some little undesirable trait do not respected sir rashly dismiss him Have but patience have but confidence Those transient vices will ere long fall out and be replaced by the sound firm even and permanent virtues Ah glancing shoreward towards a grotesquely shaped bluff there s the Devil s Joke as they call it the bell for landing will shortly ring I must go look up the cook I brought for the innkeeper at Cairo CHAPTER XXIII IN WHICH THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF NATURAL SCENERY IS EVINCED IN THE CASE OF THE MISSOURIAN WHO IN VIEW OF THE REGION ROUND ABOUT CAIRO HAS A RETURN OF HIS CHILLY FIT At Cairo the old established firm of Fever Ague is still settling up its unfinished business that Creole grave digger Yellow Jack his hand at the mattock and spade has not lost its cunning while Don Saturninus Typhus taking his constitutional with Death Calvin Edson and three undertakers in the morass snuffs up the mephitic breeze with zest In the dank twilight fanned with mosquitoes and sparkling with fire flies the boat now lies before Cairo She has landed certain passengers and tarries for the coming of expected ones Leaning over the rail on the inshore side the Missourian eyes through the dubious medium that swampy and squalid domain and over it audibly mumbles his cynical mind to himself as Apermantus dog may have mumbled his bone He bethinks him that the man with the brass plate was to land on this villainous bank and for that cause if no other begins to suspect him Like one beginning to rouse himself from a dose of chloroform treacherously given he half divines too that he the philosopher had unwittingly been betrayed into being an unphilosophical dupe To what vicissitudes of light and shade is man subject He ponders the mystery of human subjectivity in general He thinks he perceives with Crossbones his favorite author that as one may wake up well in the morning very well indeed and brisk as a buck I thank you but ere bed time get under the weather there is no telling how so one may wake up wise and slow of assent very wise and very slow I assure you and for all that before night by like trick in the atmosphere be left in the lurch a ninny Health and wisdom equally precious and equally little as unfluctuating possessions to be relied on But where was slipped in the entering wedge Philosophy knowledge experience were those trusty knights of the castle recreant No but unbeknown to them the enemy stole on the castle s south side its genial one where Suspicion the warder parleyed In fine his too indulgent too artless and companionable nature betrayed him Admonished by which he thinks he must be a little splenetic in his intercourse henceforth He revolves the crafty process of sociable chat by which as he fancies the man with the brass plate wormed into him and made such a fool of him as insensibly to persuade him to waive in his exceptional case that general law of distrust systematically applied to the race He revolves but cannot comprehend the operation still less the operator Was the man a trickster it must be more for the love than the lucre Two or three dirty dollars the motive to so many nice wiles And yet how full of mean needs his seeming Before his mental vision the person of that threadbare Talleyrand that impoverished Machiavelli that seedy Rosicrucian for something of all these he vaguely deems him passes now in puzzled review Fain in his disfavor would he make out a logical case The doctrine of analogies recurs Fallacious enough doctrine when wielded against one s prejudices but in corroboration of cherished suspicions not without likelihood Analogically he couples the slanting cut of the equivocator s coat tails with the sinister cast in his eye he weighs slyboot s sleek speech in the light imparted by the oblique import of the smooth slope of his worn boot heels the insinuator s undulating flunkyisms dovetail into those of the flunky beast that windeth his way on his belly From these uncordial reveries he is roused by a cordial slap on the shoulder accompanied by a spicy volume of tobacco smoke out of which came a voice sweet as a seraph s A penny for your thoughts my fine fellow CHAPTER XXIV A PHILANTHROPIST UNDERTAKES TO CONVERT A MISANTHROPE BUT DOES NOT GET BEYOND CONFUTING HIM Hands off cried the bachelor involuntarily covering dejection with moroseness Hands off that sort of label won t do in our Fair Whoever in our Fair has fine feelings loves to feel the nap of fine cloth especially when a fine fellow wears it And who of my fine fellow species may you be From the Brazils ain t you Toucan fowl Fine feathers on foul meat This ungentle mention of the toucan was not improbably suggested by the parti hued and rather plumagy aspect of the stranger no bigot it would seem but a liberalist in dress and whose wardrobe almost anywhere than on the liberal Mississippi used to all sorts of fantastic informalities might even to observers less critical than the bachelor have looked if anything a little out of the common but not more so perhaps than considering the bear and raccoon costume the bachelor s own appearance In short the stranger sported a vesture barred with various hues that of the cochineal predominating in style participating of a Highland plaid Emir s robe and French blouse from its plaited sort of front peeped glimpses of a flowered regatta shirt while for the rest white trowsers of ample duck flowed over maroon colored slippers and a jaunty smoking cap of regal purple crowned him off at top king of traveled good fellows evidently Grotesque as all was nothing looked stiff or unused all showed signs of easy service the least wonted thing setting like a wonted glove That genial hand which had just been laid on the ungenial shoulder was now carelessly thrust down before him sailor fashion into a sort of Indian belt confining the redundant vesture the other held by its long bright cherry stem a Nuremburgh pipe in blast its great porcelain bowl painted in miniature with linked crests and arms of interlinked nations a florid show As by subtle saturations of its mellowing essence the tobacco had ripened the bowl so it looked as if something similar of the interior spirit came rosily out on the cheek But rosy pipe bowl or rosy countenance all was lost on that unrosy man the bachelor who waiting a moment till the commotion caused by the boat s renewed progress had a little abated thus continued Hark ye jeeringly eying the cap and belt did you ever see Signor Marzetti in the African pantomime No good performer Excellent plays the intelligent ape till he seems it With such naturalness can a being endowed with an immortal spirit enter into that of a monkey But where s your tail In the pantomime Marzetti no hypocrite in his monkery prides himself on that The stranger now at rest sideways and genially on one hip his right leg cavalierly crossed before the other the toe of his vertical slipper pointed easily down on the deck whiffed out a long leisurely sort of indifferent and charitable puff betokening him more or less of the mature man of the world a character which like its opposite the sincere Christian s is not always swift to take offense and then drawing near still smoking again laid his hand this time with mild impressiveness on the ursine shoulder and not unamiably said That in your address there is a sufficiency of the fortiter in re few unbiased observers will question but that this is duly attempered with the suaviter in modo may admit I think of an honest doubt My dear fellow beaming his eyes full upon him what injury have I done you that you should receive my greeting with a curtailed civility Off hands once more shaking the friendly member from him Who in the name of the great chimpanzee in whose likeness you Marzetti and the other chatterers are made who in thunder are you A cosmopolitan a catholic man who being such ties himself to no narrow tailor or teacher but federates in heart as in costume something of the various gallantries of men under various suns Oh one roams not over the gallant globe in vain Bred by it is a fraternal and fusing feeling No man is a stranger You accost anybody Warm and confiding you wait not for measured advances And though indeed mine in this instance have met with no very hilarious encouragement yet the principle of a true citizen of the world is still to return good for ill My dear fellow tell me how I can serve you By dispatching yourself mister Popinjay of the world into the heart of the Lunar Mountains You are another of them Out of my sight Is the sight of humanity so very disagreeable to you then Ah I may be foolish but for my part in all its aspects I love it Served up a la Pole or a la Moor a la Ladrone or a la Yankee that good dish man still delights me or rather is man a wine I never weary of comparing and sipping wherefore am I a pledged cosmopolitan a sort of London Dock Vault connoisseur going about from Teheran to Natchitoches a taster of races in all his vintages smacking my lips over this racy creature man continually But as there are teetotal palates which have a distaste even for Amontillado so I suppose there may be teetotal souls which relish not even the very best brands of humanity Excuse me but it just occurs to me that you my dear fellow possibly lead a solitary life Solitary starting as at a touch of divination Yes in a solitary life one insensibly contracts oddities talking to one s self now Been eaves dropping eh Why a soliloquist in a crowd can hardly but be overheard and without much reproach to the hearer You are an eaves dropper Well Be it so Confess yourself an eaves dropper I confess that when you were muttering here I passing by caught a word or two and by like chance something previous of your chat with the Intelligence office man a rather sensible fellow by the way much of my style of thinking would for his own sake he were of my style of dress Grief to good minds to see a man of superior sense forced to hide his light under the bushel of an inferior coat Well from what little I heard I said to myself Here now is one with the unprofitable philosophy of disesteem for man Which disease in the main I have observed excuse me to spring from a certain lowness if not sourness of spirits inseparable from sequestration Trust me one had better mix in and do like others Sad business this holding out against having a good time Life is a pic nic en costume one must take a part assume a character stand ready in a sensible way to play the fool To come in plain clothes with a long face as a wiseacre only makes one a discomfort to himself and a blot upon the scene Like your jug of cold water among the wine flasks it leaves you unelated among the elated ones No no This austerity won t do Let me tell you too en confiance that while revelry may not always merge into ebriety soberness in too deep potations may become a sort of sottishness Which sober sottishness in my way of thinking is only to be cured by beginning at the other end of the horn to tipple a little Pray what society of vintners and old topers are you hired to lecture for I fear I did not give my meaning clearly A little story may help The story of the worthy old woman of Goshen a very moral old woman who wouldn t let her shoats eat fattening apples in fall for fear the fruit might ferment upon their brains and so make them swinish Now during a green Christmas inauspicious to the old this worthy old woman fell into a moping decline took to her bed no appetite and refused to see her best friends In much concern her good man sent for the doctor who after seeing the patient and putting a question or two beckoned the husband out and said Deacon do you want her cured Indeed I do Go directly then and buy a jug of Santa Cruz Santa Cruz my wife drink Santa Cruz Either that or die But how much As much as she can get down But she ll get drunk That s the cure Wise men like doctors must be obeyed Much against the grain the sober deacon got the unsober medicine and equally against her conscience the poor old woman took it but by so doing ere long recovered health and spirits famous appetite and glad again to see her friends and having by this experience broken the ice of arid abstinence never afterwards kept herself a cup too low This story had the effect of surprising the bachelor into interest though hardly into approval If I take your parable right said he sinking no little of his former churlishness the meaning is that one cannot enjoy life with gusto unless he renounce the too sober view of life But since the too sober view is doubtless nearer true than the too drunken I who rate truth though cold water above untruth though Tokay will stick to my earthen jug I see slowly spirting upward a spiral staircase of lazy smoke I see you go in for the lofty How Oh nothing but if I wasn t afraid of prosing I might tell another story about an old boot in a pieman s loft contracting there between sun and oven an unseemly dry seasoned curl and warp You ve seen such leathery old garretteers haven t you Very high sober solitary philosophic grand old boots indeed but I for my part would rather be the pieman s trodden slipper on the ground Talking of piemen humble pie before proud cake for me This notion of being lone and lofty is a sad mistake Men I hold in this respect to be like roosters the one that betakes himself to a lone and lofty perch is the hen pecked one or the one that has the pip You are abusive cried the bachelor evidently touched Who is abused You or the race You won t stand by and see the human race abused Oh then you have some respect for the human race I have some respect for myself with a lip not so firm as before And what race may you belong to now don t you see my dear fellow in what inconsistencies one involves himself by affecting disesteem for men To a charm my little stratagem succeeded Come come think better of it and as a first step to a new mind give up solitude I fear by the way you have at some time been reading Zimmermann that old mister Megrims of a Zimmermann whose book on Solitude is as vain as Hume s on Suicide as Bacon s on Knowledge and like these will betray him who seeks to steer soul and body by it like a false religion All they be they what boasted ones you please who to the yearning of our kind after a founded rule of content offer aught not in the spirit of fellowly gladness based on due confidence in what is above away with them for poor dupes or still poorer impostors His manner here was so earnest that scarcely any auditor perhaps but would have been more or less impressed by it while possibly nervous opponents might have a little quailed under it Thinking within himself a moment the bachelor replied Had you experience you would know that your tippling theory take it in what sense you will is poor as any other And Rabelais s pro wine Koran no more trustworthy than Mahomet s anti wine one Enough for a finality knocking the ashes from his pipe we talk and keep talking and still stand where we did What do you say for a walk My arm and let s a turn They are to have dancing on the hurricane deck to night I shall fling them off a Scotch jig while to save the pieces you hold my loose change and following that I propose that you my dear fellow stack your gun and throw your bearskins in a sailor s hornpipe I holding your watch What do you say At this proposition the other was himself again all raccoon Look you thumping down his rifle are you Jeremy Diddler No three Jeremy Diddler I have heard of Jeremy the prophet and Jeremy Taylor the divine but your other Jeremy is a gentleman I am unacquainted with You are his confidential clerk ain t you Whose pray Not that I think myself unworthy of being confided in but I don t understand You are another of them Somehow I meet with the most extraordinary metaphysical scamps to day Sort of visitation of them And yet that herb doctor Diddler somehow takes off the raw edge of the Diddlers that come after him Herb doctor who is he Like you another of them Who Then drawing near as if for a good long explanatory chat his left hand spread and his pipe stem coming crosswise down upon it like a ferule You think amiss of me Now to undeceive you I will just enter into a little argument and No you don t No more little arguments for me Had too many little arguments to day But put a case Can you deny I dare you to deny that the man leading a solitary life is peculiarly exposed to the sorriest misconceptions touching strangers Yes I do deny it again in his impulsiveness snapping at the controversial bait and I will confute you there in a trice Look you Now now now my dear fellow thrusting out both vertical palms for double shields you crowd me too hard You don t give one a chance Say what you will to shun a social proposition like mine to shun society in any way evinces a churlish nature cold loveless as to embrace it shows one warm and friendly in fact sunshiny Here the other all agog again in his perverse way launched forth into the unkindest references to deaf old worldlings keeping in the deafening world and gouty gluttons limping to their gouty gormandizings and corseted coquets clasping their corseted cavaliers in the waltz all for disinterested society s sake and thousands bankrupt through lavishness ruining themselves out of pure love of the sweet company of man no envies rivalries or other unhandsome motive to it Ah now deprecating with his pipe irony is so unjust never could abide irony something Satanic about irony God defend me from Irony and Satire his bosom friend A right knave s prayer and a right fool s too snapping his rifle lock Now be frank Own that was a little gratuitous But no no you didn t mean it any way I can make allowances Ah did you but know it how much pleasanter to puff at this philanthropic pipe than still to keep fumbling at that misanthropic rifle As for your worldling glutton and coquette though doubtless being such they may have their little foibles as who has not yet not one of the three can be reproached with that awful sin of shunning society awful I call it for not seldom it presupposes a still darker thing than itself remorse Remorse drives man away from man How came your fellow creature Cain after the first murder to go and build the first city And why is it that the modern Cain dreads nothing so much as solitary confinement My dear fellow you get excited Say what you will I for one must have my fellow creatures round me Thick too I must have them thick The pick pocket too loves to have his fellow creatures round him Tut man no one goes into the crowd but for his end and the end of too many is the same as the pick pocket s a purse Now my dear fellow how can you have the conscience to say that when it is as much according to natural law that men are social as sheep gregarious But grant that in being social each man has his end do you upon the strength of that do you yourself I say mix with man now immediately and be your end a more genial philosophy Come let s take a turn Again he offered his fraternal arm but the bachelor once more flung it off and raising his rifle in energetic invocation cried Now the high constable catch and confound all knaves in towns and rats in grain bins and if in this boat which is a human grain bin for the time any sly smooth philandering rat be dodging now pin him thou high rat catcher against this rail A noble burst shows you at heart a trump And when a card s that little matters it whether it be spade or diamond You are good wine that to be still better only needs a shaking up Come let s agree that we ll to New Orleans and there embark for London I staying with my friends nigh Primrose hill and you putting up at the Piazza Covent Garden Piazza Covent Garden for tell me since you will not be a disciple to the full tell me was not that humor of Diogenes which led him to live a merry andrew in the flower market better than that of the less wise Athenian which made him a skulking scare crow in pine barrens An injudicious gentleman Lord Timon Your hand seizing it Bless me how cordial a squeeze It is agreed we shall be brothers then As much so as a brace of misanthropes can be with another and terrific squeeze I had thought that the moderns had degenerated beneath the capacity of misanthropy Rejoiced though but in one instance and that disguised to be undeceived The other stared in blank amaze Won t do You are Diogenes Diogenes in disguise I say Diogenes masquerading as a cosmopolitan With ruefully altered mien the stranger still stood mute awhile At length in a pained tone spoke How hard the lot of that pleader who in his zeal conceding too much is taken to belong to a side which he but labors however ineffectually to convert Then with another change of air To you an Ishmael disguising in sportiveness my intent I came ambassador from the human race charged with the assurance that for your mislike they bore no answering grudge but sought to conciliate accord between you and them Yet you take me not for the honest envoy but I know not what sort of unheard of spy Sir he less lowly added this mistaking of your man should teach you how you may mistake all men For God s sake laying both hands upon him get you confidence See how distrust has duped you I Diogenes I he who going a step beyond misanthropy was less a man hater than a man hooter Better were I stark and stiff With which the philanthropist moved away less lightsome than he had come leaving the discomfited misanthrope to the solitude he held so sapient CHAPTER XXV THE COSMOPOLITAN MAKES AN ACQUAINTANCE In the act of retiring the cosmopolitan was met by a passenger who with the bluff abord of the West thus addressed him though a stranger Queer coon your friend Had a little skrimmage with him myself Rather entertaining old coon if he wasn t so deuced analytical Reminded me somehow of what I ve heard about Colonel John Moredock of Illinois only your friend ain t quite so good a fellow at bottom I should think It was in the semicircular porch of a cabin opening a recess from the deck lit by a zoned lamp swung overhead and sending its light vertically down like the sun at noon Beneath the lamp stood the speaker affording to any one disposed to it no unfavorable chance for scrutiny but the glance now resting on him betrayed no such rudeness A man neither tall nor stout neither short nor gaunt but with a body fitted as by measure to the service of his mind For the rest one less favored perhaps in his features than his clothes and of these the beauty may have been less in the fit than the cut to say nothing of the fineness of the nap seeming out of keeping with something the reverse of fine in the skin and the unsuitableness of a violet vest sending up sunset hues to a countenance betokening a kind of bilious habit But upon the whole it could not be fairly said that his appearance was unprepossessing indeed to the congenial it would have been doubtless not uncongenial while to others it could not fail to be at least curiously interesting from the warm air of florid cordiality contrasting itself with one knows not what kind of aguish sallowness of saving discretion lurking behind it Ungracious critics might have thought that the manner flushed the man something in the same fictitious way that the vest flushed the cheek And though his teeth were singularly good those same ungracious ones might have hinted that they were too good to be true or rather were not so good as they might be since the best false teeth are those made with at least two or three blemishes the more to look like life But fortunately for better constructions no such critics had the stranger now in eye only the cosmopolitan who after in the first place acknowledging his advances with a mute salute in which acknowledgment if there seemed less of spirit than in his way of accosting the Missourian it was probably because of the saddening sequel of that late interview thus now replied Colonel John Moredock repeating the words abstractedly that surname recalls reminiscences Pray with enlivened air was he anyway connected with the Moredocks of Moredock Hall Northamptonshire England I know no more of the Moredocks of Moredock Hall than of the Burdocks of Burdock Hut returned the other with the air somehow of one whose fortunes had been of his own making all I know is that the late Colonel John Moredock was a famous one in his time eye like Lochiel s finger like a trigger nerve like a catamount s and with but two little oddities seldom stirred without his rifle and hated Indians like snakes Your Moredock then would seem a Moredock of Misanthrope Hall the Woods No very sleek creature the colonel I fancy Sleek or not he was no uncombed one but silky bearded and curly headed and to all but Indians juicy as a peach But Indians how the late Colonel John Moredock Indian hater of Illinois did hate Indians to be sure Never heard of such a thing Hate Indians Why should he or anybody else hate Indians I admire Indians Indians I have always heard to be one of the finest of the primitive races possessed of many heroic virtues Some noble women too When I think of Pocahontas I am ready to love Indians Then there s Massasoit and Philip of Mount Hope and Tecumseh and Red Jacket and Logan all heroes and there s the Five Nations and Araucanians federations and communities of heroes God bless me hate Indians Surely the late Colonel John Moredock must have wandered in his mind Wandered in the woods considerably but never wandered elsewhere that I ever heard Are you in earnest Was there ever one who so made it his particular mission to hate Indians that to designate him a special word has been coined Indian hater Even so Dear me you take it very calmly But really I would like to know something about this Indian hating I can hardly believe such a thing to be Could you favor me with a little history of the extraordinary man you mentioned With all my heart and immediately stepping from the porch gestured the cosmopolitan to a settee near by on deck There sir sit you there and I will sit here beside you you desire to hear of Colonel John Moredock Well a day in my boyhood is marked with a white stone the day I saw the colonel s rifle powder horn attached hanging in a cabin on the West bank of the Wabash river I was going westward a long journey through the wilderness with my father It was nigh noon and we had stopped at the cabin to unsaddle and bait The man at the cabin pointed out the rifle and told whose it was adding that the colonel was that moment sleeping on wolf skins in the corn loft above so we must not talk very loud for the colonel had been out all night hunting Indians mind and it would be cruel to disturb his sleep Curious to see one so famous we waited two hours over in hopes he would come forth but he did not So it being necessary to get to the next cabin before nightfall we had at last to ride off without the wished for satisfaction Though to tell the truth I for one did not go away entirely ungratified for while my father was watering the horses I slipped back into the cabin and stepping a round or two up the ladder pushed my head through the trap and peered about Not much light in the loft but off in the further corner I saw what I took to be the wolf skins and on them a bundle of something like a drift of leaves and at one end what seemed a moss ball and over it deer antlers branched and close by a small squirrel sprang out from a maple bowl of nuts brushed the moss ball with his tail through a hole and vanished squeaking That bit of woodland scene was all I saw No Colonel Moredock there unless that moss ball was his curly head seen in the back view I would have gone clear up but the man below had warned me that though from his camping habits the colonel could sleep through thunder he was for the same cause amazing quick to waken at the sound of footsteps however soft and especially if human Excuse me said the other softly laying his hand on the narrator s wrist but I fear the colonel was of a distrustful nature little or no confidence He was a little suspicious minded wasn t he Not a bit Knew too much Suspected nobody but was not ignorant of Indians Well though as you may gather I never fully saw the man yet have I one way and another heard about as much of him as any other in particular have I heard his history again and again from my father s friend James Hall the judge you know In every company being called upon to give this history which none could better do the judge at last fell into a style so methodic you would have thought he spoke less to mere auditors than to an invisible amanuensis seemed talking for the press very impressive way with him indeed And I having an equally impressible memory think that upon a pinch I can render you the judge upon the colonel almost word for word Do so by all means said the cosmopolitan well pleased Shall I give you the judge s philosophy and all As to that rejoined the other gravely pausing over the pipe bowl he was filling the desirableness to a man of a certain mind of having another man s philosophy given depends considerably upon what school of philosophy that other man belongs to Of what school or system was the judge pray Why though he knew how to read and write the judge never had much schooling But I should say he belonged if anything to the free school system Yes a true patriot the judge went in strong for free schools In philosophy The man of a certain mind then while respecting the judge s patriotism and not blind to the judge s capacity for narrative such as he may prove to have might perhaps with prudence waive an opinion of the judge s probable philosophy But I am no rigorist proceed I beg his philosophy or not as you please Well I would mostly skip that part only to begin some reconnoitering of the ground in a philosophical way the judge always deemed indispensable with strangers For you must know that Indian hating was no monopoly of Colonel Moredock s but a passion in one form or other and to a degree greater or less largely shared among the class to which he belonged And Indian hating still exists and no doubt will continue to exist so long as Indians do Indian hating then shall be my first theme and Colonel Moredock the Indian hater my next and last With which the stranger settling himself in his seat commenced the hearer paying marked regard slowly smoking his glance meanwhile steadfastly abstracted towards the deck but his right ear so disposed towards the speaker that each word came through as little atmospheric intervention as possible To intensify the sense of hearing he seemed to sink the sense of sight No complaisance of mere speech could have been so flattering or expressed such striking politeness as this mute eloquence of thoroughly digesting attention CHAPTER XXVI CONTAINING THE METAPHYSICS OF INDIAN HATING ACCORDING TO THE VIEWS OF ONE EVIDENTLY NOT SO PREPOSSESSED AS ROUSSEAU IN FAVOR OF SAVAGES The judge always began in these words The backwoodsman s hatred of the Indian has been a topic for some remark In the earlier times of the frontier the passion was thought to be readily accounted for But Indian rapine having mostly ceased through regions where it once prevailed the philanthropist is surprised that Indian hating has not in like degree ceased with it He wonders why the backwoodsman still regards the red man in much the same spirit that a jury does a murderer or a trapper a wild cat a creature in whose behalf mercy were not wisdom truce is vain he must be executed A curious point the judge would continue which perhaps not everybody even upon explanation may fully understand while in order for any one to approach to an understanding it is necessary for him to learn or if he already know to bear in mind what manner of man the backwoodsman is as for what manner of man the Indian is many know either from history or experience The backwoodsman is a lonely man He is a thoughtful man He is a man strong and unsophisticated Impulsive he is what some might call unprincipled At any rate he is self willed being one who less hearkens to what others may say about things than looks for himself to see what are things themselves If in straits there are few to help he must depend upon himself he must continually look to himself Hence self reliance to the degree of standing by his own judgment though it stand alone Not that he deems himself infallible too many mistakes in following trails prove the contrary but he thinks that nature destines such sagacity as she has given him as she destines it to the possum To these fellow beings of the wilds their untutored sagacity is their best dependence If with either it prove faulty if the possum s betray it to the trap or the backwoodsman s mislead him into ambuscade there are consequences to be undergone but no self blame As with the possum instincts prevail with the backwoodsman over precepts Like the possum the backwoodsman presents the spectacle of a creature dwelling exclusively among the works of God yet these truth must confess breed little in him of a godly mind Small bowing and scraping is his further than when with bent knee he points his rifle or picks its flint With few companions solitude by necessity his lengthened lot he stands the trial no slight one since next to dying solitude rightly borne is perhaps of fortitude the most rigorous test But not merely is the backwoodsman content to be alone but in no few cases is anxious to be so The sight of smoke ten miles off is provocation to one more remove from man one step deeper into nature Is it that he feels that whatever man may be man is not the universe that glory beauty kindness are not all engrossed by him that as the presence of man frights birds away so many bird like thoughts Be that how it will the backwoodsman is not without some fineness to his nature Hairy Orson as he looks it may be with him as with the Shetland seal beneath the bristles lurks the fur Though held in a sort a barbarian the backwoodsman would seem to America what Alexander was to Asia captain in the vanguard of conquering civilization Whatever the nation s growing opulence or power does it not lackey his heels Pathfinder provider of security to those who come after him for himself he asks nothing but hardship Worthy to be compared with Moses in the Exodus or the Emperor Julian in Gaul who on foot and bare browed at the head of covered or mounted legions marched so through the elements day after day The tide of emigration let it roll as it will never overwhelms the backwoodsman into itself he rides upon advance as the Polynesian upon the comb of the surf Thus though he keep moving on through life he maintains with respect to nature much the same unaltered relation throughout with her creatures too including panthers and Indians Hence it is not unlikely that accurate as the theory of the Peace Congress may be with respect to those two varieties of beings among others yet the backwoodsman might be qualified to throw out some practical suggestions As the child born to a backwoodsman must in turn lead his father s life a life which as related to humanity is related mainly to Indians it is thought best not to mince matters out of delicacy but to tell the boy pretty plainly what an Indian is and what he must expect from him For however charitable it may be to view Indians as members of the Society of Friends yet to affirm them such to one ignorant of Indians whose lonely path lies a long way through their lands this in the event might prove not only injudicious but cruel At least something of this kind would seem the maxim upon which backwoods education is based Accordingly if in youth the backwoodsman incline to knowledge as is generally the case he hears little from his schoolmasters the old chroniclers of the forest but histories of Indian lying Indian theft Indian double dealing Indian fraud and perfidy Indian want of conscience Indian blood thirstiness Indian diabolism histories which though of wild woods are almost as full of things unangelic as the Newgate Calendar or the Annals of Europe In these Indian narratives and traditions the lad is thoroughly grounded As the twig is bent the tree s inclined The instinct of antipathy against an Indian grows in the backwoodsman with the sense of good and bad right and wrong In one breath he learns that a brother is to be loved and an Indian to be hated Such are the facts the judge would say upon which if one seek to moralize he must do so with an eye to them It is terrible that one creature should so regard another should make it conscience to abhor an entire race It is terrible but is it surprising Surprising that one should hate a race which he believes to be red from a cause akin to that which makes some tribes of garden insects green A race whose name is upon the frontier a memento mori painted to him in every evil light now a horse thief like those in Moyamensing now an assassin like a New York rowdy now a treaty breaker like an Austrian now a Palmer with poisoned arrows now a judicial murderer and Jeffries after a fierce farce of trial condemning his victim to bloody death or a Jew with hospitable speeches cozening some fainting stranger into ambuscade there to burk him and account it a deed grateful to Manitou his god Still all this is less advanced as truths of the Indians than as examples of the backwoodsman s impression of them in which the charitable may think he does them some injustice Certain it is the Indians themselves think so quite unanimously too The Indians in deed protest against the backwoodsman s view of them and some think that one cause of their returning his antipathy so sincerely as they do is their moral indignation at being so libeled by him as they really believe and say But whether on this or any point the Indians should be permitted to testify for themselves to the exclusion of other testimony is a question that may be left to the Supreme Court At any rate it has been observed that when an Indian becomes a genuine proselyte to Christianity such cases however not being very many though indeed entire tribes are sometimes nominally brought to the true light he will not in that case conceal his enlightened conviction that his race s portion by nature is total depravity and in that way as much as admits that the backwoodsman s worst idea of it is not very far from true while on the other hand those red men who are the greatest sticklers for the theory of Indian virtue and Indian loving kindness are sometimes the arrantest horse thieves and tomahawkers among them So at least avers the backwoodsman And though knowing the Indian nature as he thinks he does he fancies he is not ignorant that an Indian may in some points deceive himself almost as effectually as in bush tactics he can another yet his theory and his practice as above contrasted seem to involve an inconsistency so extreme that the backwoodsman only accounts for it on the supposition that when a tomahawking red man advances the notion of the benignity of the red race it is but part and parcel with that subtle strategy which he finds so useful in war in hunting and the general conduct of life In further explanation of that deep abhorrence with which the backwoodsman regards the savage the judge used to think it might perhaps a little help to consider what kind of stimulus to it is furnished in those forest histories and traditions before spoken of In which behalf he would tell the story of the little colony of Wrights and Weavers originally seven cousins from Virginia who after successive removals with their families at last established themselves near the southern frontier of the Bloody Ground Kentucky They were strong brave men but unlike many of the pioneers in those days theirs was no love of conflict for conflict s sake Step by step they had been lured to their lonely resting place by the ever beckoning seductions of a fertile and virgin land with a singular exemption during the march from Indian molestation But clearings made and houses built the bright shield was soon to turn its other side After repeated persecutions and eventual hostilities forced on them by a dwindled tribe in their neighborhood persecutions resulting in loss of crops and cattle hostilities in which they lost two of their number illy to be spared besides others getting painful wounds the five remaining cousins made with some serious concessions a kind of treaty with Mocmohoc the chief being to this induced by the harryings of the enemy leaving them no peace But they were further prompted indeed first incited by the suddenly changed ways of Mocmohoc who though hitherto deemed a savage almost perfidious as Caesar Borgia yet now put on a seeming the reverse of this engaging to bury the hatchet smoke the pipe and be friends forever not friends in the mere sense of renouncing enmity but in the sense of kindliness active and familiar But what the chief now seemed did not wholly blind them to what the chief had been so that though in no small degree influenced by his change of bearing they still distrusted him enough to covenant with him among other articles on their side that though friendly visits should be exchanged between the wigwams and the cabins yet the five cousins should never on any account be expected to enter the chief s lodge together The intention was though they reserved it that if ever under the guise of amity the chief should mean them mischief and effect it it should be but partially so that some of the five might survive not only for their families sake but also for retribution s Nevertheless Mocmohoc did upon a time with such fine art and pleasing carriage win their confidence that he brought them all together to a feast of bear s meat and there by stratagem ended them Years after over their calcined bones and those of all their families the chief reproached for his treachery by a proud hunter whom he had made captive jeered out Treachery pale face Twas they who broke their covenant first in coming all together they that broke it first in trusting Mocmohoc At this point the judge would pause and lifting his hand and rolling his eyes exclaim in a solemn enough voice Circling wiles and bloody lusts The acuteness and genius of the chief but make him the more atrocious After another pause he would begin an imaginary kind of dialogue between a backwoodsman and a questioner But are all Indians like Mocmohoc Not all have proved such but in the least harmful may lie his germ There is an Indian nature Indian blood is in me is the half breed s threat But are not some Indians kind Yes but kind Indians are mostly lazy and reputed simple at all events are seldom chiefs chiefs among the red men being taken from the active and those accounted wise Hence with small promotion kind Indians have but proportionate influence And kind Indians may be forced to do unkind biddings So beware the Indian kind or unkind said Daniel Boone who lost his sons by them But have all you backwoodsmen been some way victimized by Indians No Well and in certain cases may not at least some few of you be favored by them Yes but scarce one among us so self important or so selfish minded as to hold his personal exemption from Indian outrage such a set off against the contrary experience of so many others as that he must needs in a general way think well of Indians or if he do an arrow in his flank might suggest a pertinent doubt In short according to the judge if we at all credit the backwoodsman his feeling against Indians to be taken aright must be considered as being not so much on his own account as on others or jointly on both accounts True it is scarce a family he knows but some member of it or connection has been by Indians maimed or scalped What avails then that some one Indian or some two or three treat a backwoodsman friendly like He fears me he thinks Take my rifle from me give him motive and what will come Or if not so how know I what involuntary preparations may be going on in him for things as unbeknown in present time to him as me a sort of chemical preparation in the soul for malice as chemical preparation in the body for malady Not that the backwoodsman ever used those words you see but the judge found him expression for his meaning And this point he would conclude with saying that what is called a friendly Indian is a very rare sort of creature and well it was so for no ruthlessness exceeds that of a friendly Indian turned enemy A coward friend he makes a valiant foe But thus far the passion in question has been viewed in a general way as that of a community When to his due share of this the backwoodsman adds his private passion we have then the stock out of which is formed if formed at all the Indian hater par excellence The Indian hater par excellence the judge defined to be one who having with his mother s milk drank in small love for red men in youth or early manhood ere the sensibilities become osseous receives at their hand some signal outrage or which in effect is much the same some of his kin have or some friend Now nature all around him by her solitudes wooing or bidding him muse upon this matter he accordingly does so till the thought develops such attraction that much as straggling vapors troop from all sides to a storm cloud so straggling thoughts of other outrages troop to the nucleus thought assimilate with it and swell it At last taking counsel with the elements he comes to his resolution An intenser Hannibal he makes a vow the hate of which is a vortex from whose suction scarce the remotest chip of the guilty race may reasonably feel secure Next he declares himself and settles his temporal affairs With the solemnity of a Spaniard turned monk he takes leave of his kin or rather these leave takings have something of the still more impressive finality of death bed adieus Last he commits himself to the forest primeval there so long as life shall be his to act upon a calm cloistered scheme of strategical implacable and lonesome vengeance Ever on the noiseless trail cool collected patient less seen than felt snuffing smelling a Leather stocking Nemesis In the settlements he will not be seen again in eyes of old companions tears may start at some chance thing that speaks of him but they never look for him nor call they know he will not come Suns and seasons fleet the tiger lily blows and falls babes are born and leap in their mothers arms but the Indian hater is good as gone to his long home and Terror is his epitaph Here the judge not unaffected would pause again but presently resume How evident that in strict speech there can be no biography of an Indian hater par excellence any more than one of a sword fish or other deep sea denizen or which is still less imaginable one of a dead man The career of the Indian hater par excellence has the impenetrability of the fate of a lost steamer Doubtless events terrible ones have happened must have happened but the powers that be in nature have taken order that they shall never become news But luckily for the curious there is a species of diluted Indian hater one whose heart proves not so steely as his brain Soft enticements of domestic life too often draw him from the ascetic trail a monk who apostatizes to the world at times Like a mariner too though much abroad he may have a wife and family in some green harbor which he does not forget It is with him as with the Papist converts in Senegal fasting and mortification prove hard to bear The judge with his usual judgment always thought that the intense solitude to which the Indian hater consigns himself has by its overawing influence no little to do with relaxing his vow He would relate instances where after some months lonely scoutings the Indian hater is suddenly seized with a sort of calenture hurries openly towards the first smoke though he knows it is an Indian s announces himself as a lost hunter gives the savage his rifle throws himself upon his charity embraces him with much affection imploring the privilege of living a while in his sweet companionship What is too often the sequel of so distempered a procedure may be best known by those who best know the Indian Upon the whole the judge by two and thirty good and sufficient reasons would maintain that there was no known vocation whose consistent following calls for such self containings as that of the Indian hater par excellence In the highest view he considered such a soul one peeping out but once an age For the diluted Indian hater although the vacations he permits himself impair the keeping of the character yet it should not be overlooked that this is the man who by his very infirmity enables us to form surmises however inadequate of what Indian hating in its perfection is One moment gently interrupted the cosmopolitan here and let me refill my calumet Which being done the other proceeded CHAPTER XXVII SOME ACCOUNT OF A MAN OF QUESTIONABLE MORALITY BUT WHO NEVERTHELESS WOULD SEEM ENTITLED TO THE ESTEEM OF THAT EMINENT ENGLISH MORALIST WHO SAID HE LIKED A GOOD HATER Coming to mention the man to whose story all thus far said was but the introduction the judge who like you was a great smoker would insist upon all the company taking cigars and then lighting a fresh one himself rise in his place and with the solemnest voice say Gentlemen let us smoke to the memory of Colonel John Moredock when after several whiffs taken standing in deep silence and deeper reverie he would resume his seat and his discourse something in these words Though Colonel John Moredock was not an Indian hater par excellence he yet cherished a kind of sentiment towards the red man and in that degree and so acted out his sentiment as sufficiently to merit the tribute just rendered to his memory John Moredock was the son of a woman married thrice and thrice widowed by a tomahawk The three successive husbands of this woman had been pioneers and with them she had wandered from wilderness to wilderness always on the frontier With nine children she at last found herself at a little clearing afterwards Vincennes There she joined a company about to remove to the new country of Illinois On the eastern side of Illinois there were then no settlements but on the west side the shore of the Mississippi there were near the mouth of the Kaskaskia some old hamlets of French To the vicinity of those hamlets very innocent and pleasant places a new Arcadia missus Moredock s party was destined for thereabouts among the vines they meant to settle They embarked upon the Wabash in boats proposing descending that stream into the Ohio and the Ohio into the Mississippi and so northwards towards the point to be reached All went well till they made the rock of the Grand Tower on the Mississippi where they had to land and drag their boats round a point swept by a strong current Here a party of Indians lying in wait rushed out and murdered nearly all of them The widow was among the victims with her children John excepted who some fifty miles distant was following with a second party He was just entering upon manhood when thus left in nature sole survivor of his race Other youngsters might have turned mourners he turned avenger His nerves were electric wires sensitive but steel He was one who from self possession could be made neither to flush nor pale It is said that when the tidings were brought him he was ashore sitting beneath a hemlock eating his dinner of venison and as the tidings were told him after the first start he kept on eating but slowly and deliberately chewing the wild news with the wild meat as if both together turned to chyle together should sinew him to his intent From that meal he rose an Indian hater He rose got his arms prevailed upon some comrades to join him and without delay started to discover who were the actual transgressors They proved to belong to a band of twenty renegades from various tribes outlaws even among Indians and who had formed themselves into a maurauding crew No opportunity for action being at the time presented he dismissed his friends told them to go on thanking them and saying he would ask their aid at some future day For upwards of a year alone in the wilds he watched the crew Once what he thought a favorable chance having occurred it being midwinter and the savages encamped apparently to remain so he anew mustered his friends and marched against them but getting wind of his coming the enemy fled and in such panic that everything was left behind but their weapons During the winter much the same thing happened upon two subsequent occasions The next year he sought them at the head of a party pledged to serve him for forty days At last the hour came It was on the shore of the Mississippi From their covert Moredock and his men dimly descried the gang of Cains in the red dusk of evening paddling over to a jungled island in mid stream there the more securely to lodge for Moredock s retributive spirit in the wilderness spoke ever to their trepidations now like the voice calling through the garden Waiting until dead of night the whites swam the river towing after them a raft laden with their arms On landing Moredock cut the fastenings of the enemy s canoes and turned them with his own raft adrift resolved that there should be neither escape for the Indians nor safety except in victory for the whites Victorious the whites were but three of the Indians saved themselves by taking to the stream Moredock s band lost not a man Three of the murderers survived He knew their names and persons In the course of three years each successively fell by his own hand All were now dead But this did not suffice He made no avowal but to kill Indians had become his passion As an athlete he had few equals as a shot none in single combat not to be beaten Master of that woodland cunning enabling the adept to subsist where the tyro would perish and expert in all those arts by which an enemy is pursued for weeks perhaps months without once suspecting it he kept to the forest The solitary Indian that met him died When a murder was descried he would either secretly pursue their track for some chance to strike at least one blow or if while thus engaged he himself was discovered he would elude them by superior skill Many years he spent thus and though after a time he was in a degree restored to the ordinary life of the region and period yet it is believed that John Moredock never let pass an opportunity of quenching an Indian Sins of commission in that kind may have been his but none of omission It were to err to suppose the judge would say that this gentleman was naturally ferocious or peculiarly possessed of those qualities which unhelped by provocation of events tend to withdraw man from social life On the contrary Moredock was an example of something apparently self contradicting certainly curious but at the same time undeniable namely that nearly all Indian haters have at bottom loving hearts at any rate hearts if anything more generous than the average Certain it is that to the degree in which he mingled in the life of the settlements Moredock showed himself not without humane feelings No cold husband or colder father he and though often and long away from his household bore its needs in mind and provided for them He could be very convivial told a good story though never of his more private exploits and sung a capital song Hospitable not backward to help a neighbor by report benevolent as retributive in secret while in a general manner though sometimes grave as is not unusual with men of his complexion a sultry and tragical brown yet with nobody Indians excepted otherwise than courteous in a manly fashion a moccasined gentleman admired and loved In fact no one more popular as an incident to follow may prove His bravery whether in Indian fight or any other was unquestionable An officer in the ranging service during the war of eighteen twelve he acquitted himself with more than credit Of his soldierly character this anecdote is told Not long after Hull s dubious surrender at Detroit Moredock with some of his rangers rode up at night to a log house there to rest till morning The horses being attended to supper over and sleeping places assigned the troop the host showed the colonel his best bed not on the ground like the rest but a bed that stood on legs But out of delicacy the guest declined to monopolize it or indeed to occupy it at all when to increase the inducement as the host thought he was told that a general officer had once slept in that bed Who pray asked the colonel General Hull Then you must not take offense said the colonel buttoning up his coat but really no coward s bed for me however comfortable Accordingly he took up with valor s bed a cold one on the ground At one time the colonel was a member of the territorial council of Illinois and at the formation of the state government was pressed to become candidate for governor but begged to be excused And though he declined to give his reasons for declining yet by those who best knew him the cause was not wholly unsurmised In his official capacity he might be called upon to enter into friendly treaties with Indian tribes a thing not to be thought of And even did no such contingecy arise yet he felt there would be an impropriety in the Governor of Illinois stealing out now and then during a recess of the legislative bodies for a few days shooting at human beings within the limits of his paternal chief magistracy If the governorship offered large honors from Moredock it demanded larger sacrifices These were incompatibles In short he was not unaware that to be a consistent Indian hater involves the renunciation of ambition with its objects the pomps and glories of the world and since religion pronouncing such things vanities accounts it merit to renounce them therefore so far as this goes Indian hating whatever may be thought of it in other respects may be regarded as not wholly without the efficacy of a devout sentiment Here the narrator paused Then after his long and irksome sitting started to his feet and regulating his disordered shirt frill and at the same time adjustingly shaking his legs down in his rumpled pantaloons concluded There I have done having given you not my story mind or my thoughts but another s And now for your friend Coonskins I doubt not that if the judge were here he would pronounce him a sort of comprehensive Colonel Moredock who too much spreading his passion shallows it CHAPTER XXVIII MOOT POINTS TOUCHING THE LATE COLONEL JOHN MOREDOCK Charity charity exclaimed the cosmopolitan never a sound judgment without charity When man judges man charity is less a bounty from our mercy than just allowance for the insensible lee way of human fallibility God forbid that my eccentric friend should be what you hint You do not know him or but imperfectly His outside deceived you at first it came near deceiving even me But I seized a chance when owing to indignation against some wrong he laid himself a little open I seized that lucky chance I say to inspect his heart and found it an inviting oyster in a forbidding shell His outside is but put on Ashamed of his own goodness he treats mankind as those strange old uncles in romances do their nephews snapping at them all the time and yet loving them as the apple of their eye Well my words with him were few Perhaps he is not what I took him for Yes for aught I know you may be right Glad to hear it Charity like poetry should be cultivated if only for its being graceful And now since you have renounced your notion I should be happy would you so to speak renounce your story too That story strikes me with even more incredulity than wonder To me some parts don t hang together If the man of hate how could John Moredock be also the man of love Either his lone campaigns are fabulous as Hercules or else those being true what was thrown in about his geniality is but garnish In short if ever there was such a man as Moredock he in my way of thinking was either misanthrope or nothing and his misanthropy the more intense from being focused on one race of men Though like suicide man hatred would seem peculiarly a Roman and a Grecian passion that is Pagan yet the annals of neither Rome nor Greece can produce the equal in man hatred of Colonel Moredock as the judge and you have painted him As for this Indian hating in general I can only say of it what doctor Johnson said of the alleged Lisbon earthquake Sir I don t believe it Didn t believe it Why not Clashed with any little prejudice of his Doctor Johnson had no prejudice but like a certain other person with an ingenuous smile he had sensibilities and those were pained doctor Johnson was a good Christian wasn t he He was Suppose he had been something else Then small incredulity as to the alleged earthquake Suppose he had been also a misanthrope Then small incredulity as to the robberies and murders alleged to have been perpetrated under the pall of smoke and ashes The infidels of the time were quick to credit those reports and worse So true is it that while religion contrary to the common notion implies in certain cases a spirit of slow reserve as to assent infidelity which claims to despise credulity is sometimes swift to it You rather jumble together misanthropy and infidelity I do not jumble them they are coordinates For misanthropy springing from the same root with disbelief of religion is twin with that It springs from the same root I say for set aside materialism and what is an atheist but one who does not or will not see in the universe a ruling principle of love and what a misanthrope but one who does not or will not see in man a ruling principle of kindness Don t you see In either case the vice consists in a want of confidence What sort of a sensation is misanthropy Might as well ask me what sort of sensation is hydrophobia Don t know never had it But I have often wondered what it can be like Can a misanthrope feel warm I ask myself take ease be companionable with himself Can a misanthrope smoke a cigar and muse How fares he in solitude Has the misanthrope such a thing as an appetite Shall a peach refresh him The effervescence of champagne with what eye does he behold it Is summer good to him Of long winters how much can he sleep What are his dreams How feels he and what does he when suddenly awakened alone at dead of night by fusilades of thunder Like you said the stranger I can t understand the misanthrope So far as my experience goes either mankind is worthy one s best love or else I have been lucky Never has it been my lot to have been wronged though but in the smallest degree Cheating backbiting superciliousness disdain hard heartedness and all that brood I know but by report Cold regards tossed over the sinister shoulder of a former friend ingratitude in a beneficiary treachery in a confidant such things may be but I must take somebody s word for it Now the bridge that has carried me so well over shall I not praise it Ingratitude to the worthy bridge not to do so Man is a noble fellow and in an age of satirists I am not displeased to find one who has confidence in him and bravely stands up for him Yes I always speak a good word for man and what is more am always ready to do a good deed for him You are a man after my own heart responded the cosmopolitan with a candor which lost nothing by its calmness Indeed he added our sentiments agree so that were they written in a book whose was whose few but the nicest critics might determine Since we are thus joined in mind said the stranger why not be joined in hand My hand is always at the service of virtue frankly extending it to him as to virtue personified And now said the stranger cordially retaining his hand you know our fashion here at the West It may be a little low but it is kind Briefly we being newly made friends must drink together What say you Thank you but indeed you must excuse me Why Because to tell the truth I have to day met so many old friends all free hearted convivial gentlemen that really really though for the present I succeed in mastering it I am at bottom almost in the condition of a sailor who stepping ashore after a long voyage ere night reels with loving welcomes his head of less capacity than his heart At the allusion to old friends the stranger s countenance a little fell as a jealous lover s might at hearing from his sweetheart of former ones But rallying he said No doubt they treated you to something strong but wine surely that gentle creature wine come let us have a little gentle wine at one of these little tables here Come come Then essaying to roll about like a full pipe in the sea sang in a voice which had had more of good fellowship had there been less of a latent squeak to it Let us drink of the wine of the vine benign That sparkles warm in Zansovine The cosmopolitan with longing eye upon him stood as sorely tempted and wavering a moment then abruptly stepping towards him with a look of dissolved surrender said When mermaid songs move figure heads then may glory gold and women try their blandishments on me But a good fellow singing a good song he woos forth my every spike so that my whole hull like a ship s sailing by a magnetic rock caves in with acquiescence Enough when one has a heart of a certain sort it is in vain trying to be resolute CHAPTER XXIX THE BOON COMPANIONS The wine port being called for and the two seated at the little table a natural pause of convivial expectancy ensued the stranger s eye turned towards the bar near by watching the red cheeked white aproned man there blithely dusting the bottle and invitingly arranging the salver and glasses when with a sudden impulse turning round his head towards his companion he said Ours is friendship at first sight ain t it It is was the placidly pleased reply and the same may be said of friendship at first sight as of love at first sight it is the only true one the only noble one It bespeaks confidence Who would go sounding his way into love or friendship like a strange ship by night into an enemy s harbor Right Boldly in before the wind Agreeable how we always agree By the way though but a formality friends should know each other s names What is yours pray Francis Goodman But those who love me call me Frank And yours Charles Arnold Noble But do you call me Charlie I will Charlie nothing like preserving in manhood the fraternal familiarities of youth It proves the heart a rosy boy to the last My sentiments again Ah It was a smiling waiter with the smiling bottle the cork drawn a common quart bottle but for the occasion fitted at bottom into a little bark basket braided with porcupine quills gayly tinted in the Indian fashion This being set before the entertainer he regarded it with affectionate interest but seemed not to understand or else to pretend not to a handsome red label pasted on the bottle bearing the capital letters P W P W said he at last perplexedly eying the pleasing poser now what does P W mean Shouldn t wonder said the cosmopolitan gravely if it stood for port wine You called for port wine didn t you Why so it is so it is I find some little mysteries not very hard to clear up said the other quietly crossing his legs This commonplace seemed to escape the stranger s hearing for full of his bottle he now rubbed his somewhat sallow hands over it and with a strange kind of cackle meant to be a chirrup cried Good wine good wine is it not the peculiar bond of good feeling Then brimming both glasses pushed one over saying with what seemed intended for an air of fine disdain Ill betide those gloomy skeptics who maintain that now a days pure wine is unpurchasable that almost every variety on sale is less the vintage of vineyards than laboratories that most bar keepers are but a set of male Brinvilliarses with complaisant arts practicing against the lives of their best friends their customers A shade passed over the cosmopolitan After a few minutes down cast musing he lifted his eyes and said I have long thought my dear Charlie that the spirit in which wine is regarded by too many in these days is one of the most painful examples of want of confidence Look at these glasses He who could mistrust poison in this wine would mistrust consumption in Hebe s cheek While as for suspicions against the dealers in wine and sellers of it those who cherish such suspicions can have but limited trust in the human heart Each human heart they must think to be much like each bottle of port not such port as this but such port as they hold to Strange traducers who see good faith in nothing however sacred Not medicines not the wine in sacraments has escaped them The doctor with his phial and the priest with his chalice they deem equally the unconscious dispensers of bogus cordials to the dying Dreadful Dreadful indeed said the cosmopolitan solemnly These distrusters stab at the very soul of confidence If this wine impressively holding up his full glass if this wine with its bright promise be not true how shall man be whose promise can be no brighter But if wine be false while men are true whither shall fly convivial geniality To think of sincerely genial souls drinking each other s health at unawares in perfidious and murderous drugs Horrible Much too much so to be true Charlie Let us forget it Come you are my entertainer on this occasion and yet you don t pledge me I have been waiting for it Pardon pardon half confusedly and half ostentatiously lifting his glass I pledge you Frank with my whole heart believe me taking a draught too decorous to be large but which small though it was was followed by a slight involuntary wryness to the mouth And I return you the pledge Charlie heart warm as it came to me and honest as this wine I drink it in reciprocated the cosmopolitan with princely kindliness in his gesture taking a generous swallow concluding in a smack which though audible was not so much so as to be unpleasing Talking of alleged spuriousness of wines said he tranquilly setting down his glass and then sloping back his head and with friendly fixedness eying the wine perhaps the strangest part of those allegings is that there is as claimed a kind of man who while convinced that on this continent most wines are shams yet still drinks away at them accounting wine so fine a thing that even the sham article is better than none at all And if the temperance people urge that by this course he will sooner or later be undermined in health he answers And do you think I don t know that But health without cheer I hold a bore and cheer even of the spurious sort has its price which I am willing to pay Such a man Frank must have a disposition ungovernably bacchanalian Yes if such a man there be which I don t credit It is a fable but a fable from which I once heard a person of less genius than grotesqueness draw a moral even more extravagant than the fable itself He said that it illustrated as in a parable how that a man of a disposition ungovernably good natured might still familiarly associate with men though at the same time he believed the greater part of men false hearted accounting society so sweet a thing that even the spurious sort was better than none at all And if the Rochefoucaultites urge that by this course he will sooner or later be undermined in security he answers And do you think I don t know that But security without society I hold a bore and society even of the spurious sort has its price which I am willing to pay A most singular theory said the stranger with a slight fidget eying his companion with some inquisitiveness indeed Frank a most slanderous thought he exclaimed in sudden heat and with an involuntary look almost of being personally aggrieved In one sense it merits all you say and more rejoined the other with wonted mildness but for a kind of drollery in it charity might perhaps overlook something of the wickedness Humor is in fact so blessed a thing that even in the least virtuous product of the human mind if there can be found but nine good jokes some philosophers are clement enough to affirm that those nine good jokes should redeem all the wicked thoughts though plenty as the populace of Sodom At any rate this same humor has something there is no telling what of beneficence in it it is such a catholicon and charm nearly all men agreeing in relishing it though they may agree in little else and in its way it undeniably does such a deal of familiar good in the world that no wonder it is almost a proverb that a man of humor a man capable of a good loud laugh seem how he may in other things can hardly be a heartless scamp Ha ha ha laughed the other pointing to the figure of a pale pauper boy on the deck below whose pitiableness was touched as it were with ludicrousness by a pair of monstrous boots apparently some mason s discarded ones cracked with drouth half eaten by lime and curled up about the toe like a bassoon Look ha ha ha I see said the other with what seemed quiet appreciation but of a kind expressing an eye to the grotesque without blindness to what in this case accompanied it I see and the way in which it moves you Charlie comes in very apropos to point the proverb I was speaking of Indeed had you intended this effect it could not have been more so For who that heard that laugh but would as naturally argue from it a sound heart as sound lungs True it is said that a man may smile and smile and smile and be a villain but it is not said that a man may laugh and laugh and laugh and be one is it Charlie Ha ha ha no no no no Why Charlie your explosions illustrate my remarks almost as aptly as the chemist s imitation volcano did his lectures But even if experience did not sanction the proverb that a good laugher cannot be a bad man I should yet feel bound in confidence to believe it since it is a saying current among the people and I doubt not originated among them and hence must be true for the voice of the people is the voice of truth Don t you think so Of course I do If Truth don t speak through the people it never speaks at all so I heard one say A true saying But we stray The popular notion of humor considered as index to the heart would seem curiously confirmed by Aristotle I think in his Politics a work by the by which however it may be viewed upon the whole yet from the tenor of certain sections should not without precaution be placed in the hands of youth who remarks that the least lovable men in history seem to have had for humor not only a disrelish but a hatred and this in some cases along with an extraordinary dry taste for practical punning I remember it is related of Phalaris the capricious tyrant of Sicily that he once caused a poor fellow to be beheaded on a horse block for no other cause than having a horse laugh Funny Phalaris Cruel Phalaris As after fire crackers there was a pause both looking downward on the table as if mutually struck by the contrast of exclamations and pondering upon its significance if any So at least it seemed but on one side it might have been otherwise for presently glancing up the cosmopolitan said In the instance of the moral drolly cynic drawn from the queer bacchanalian fellow we were speaking of who had his reasons for still drinking spurious wine though knowing it to be such there I say we have an example of what is certainly a wicked thought but conceived in humor I will now give you one of a wicked thought conceived in wickedness You shall compare the two and answer whether in the one case the sting is not neutralized by the humor and whether in the other the absence of humor does not leave the sting free play I once heard a wit a mere wit mind an irreligious Parisian wit say with regard to the temperance movement that none to their personal benefit joined it sooner than niggards and knaves because as he affirmed the one by it saved money and the other made money as in ship owners cutting off the spirit ration without giving its equivalent and gamblers and all sorts of subtle tricksters sticking to cold water the better to keep a cool head for business A wicked thought indeed cried the stranger feelingly Yes leaning over the table on his elbow and genially gesturing at him with his forefinger yes and as I said you don t remark the sting of it I do indeed Most calumnious thought Frank No humor in it Not a bit Well now Charlie eying him with moist regard let us drink It appears to me you don t drink freely Oh oh indeed indeed I am not backward there I protest a freer drinker than friend Charlie you will find nowhere with feverish zeal snatching his glass but only in the sequel to dally with it By the way Frank said he perhaps or perhaps not to draw attention from himself by the way I saw a good thing the other day capital thing a panegyric on the press It pleased me so I got it by heart at two readings It is a kind of poetry but in a form which stands in something the same relation to blank verse which that does to rhyme A sort of free and easy chant with refrains to it Shall I recite it Anything in praise of the press I shall be happy to hear rejoined the cosmopolitan the more so he gravely proceeded as of late I have observed in some quarters a disposition to disparage the press Disparage the press Even so some gloomy souls affirming that it is proving with that great invention as with brandy or eau de vie which upon its first discovery was believed by the doctors to be as its French name implies a panacea a notion which experience it may be thought has not fully verified You surprise me Frank Are there really those who so decry the press Tell me more Their reasons Reasons they have none but affirmations they have many among other things affirming that while under dynastic despotisms the press is to the people little but an improvisatore under popular ones it is too apt to be their Jack Cade In fine these sour sages regard the press in the light of a Colt s revolver pledged to no cause but his in whose chance hands it may be deeming the one invention an improvement upon the pen much akin to what the other is upon the pistol involving along with the multiplication of the barrel no consecration of the aim The term freedom of the press they consider on a par with freedom of Colt s revolver Hence for truth and the right they hold to indulge hopes from the one is little more sensible than for Kossuth and Mazzini to indulge hopes from the other Heart breaking views enough you think but their refutation is in every true reformer s contempt Is it not so Without doubt But go on go on I like to hear you flatteringly brimming up his glass for him For one continued the cosmopolitan grandly swelling his chest I hold the press to be neither the people s improvisatore nor Jack Cade neither their paid fool nor conceited drudge I think interest never prevails with it over duty The press still speaks for truth though impaled in the teeth of lies though intrenched Disdaining for it the poor name of cheap diffuser of news I claim for it the independent apostleship of Advancer of Knowledge the iron Paul Paul I say for not only does the press advance knowledge but righteousness In the press as in the sun resides my dear Charlie a dedicated principle of beneficent force and light For the Satanic press by its coappearance with the apostolic it is no more an aspersion to that than to the true sun is the coappearance of the mock one For all the baleful looking parhelion god Apollo dispenses the day In a word Charlie what the sovereign of England is titularly I hold the press to be actually Defender of the Faith defender of the faith in the final triumph of truth over error metaphysics over superstition theory over falsehood machinery over nature and the good man over the bad Such are my views which if stated at some length you Charlie must pardon for it is a theme upon which I cannot speak with cold brevity And now I am impatient for your panegyric which I doubt not will put mine to the blush It is rather in the blush giving vein smiled the other but such as it is Frank you shall have it Tell me when you are about to begin said the cosmopolitan for when at public dinners the press is toasted I always drink the toast standing and shall stand while you pronounce the panegyric Very good Frank you may stand up now He accordingly did so when the stranger likewise rose and uplifting the ruby wine flask began CHAPTER XXX OPENING WITH A POETICAL EULOGY OF THE PRESS AND CONTINUING WITH TALK INSPIRED BY THE SAME Praise be unto the press not Faust s but Noah s let us extol and magnify the press the true press of Noah from which breaketh the true morning Praise be unto the press not the black press but the red let us extol and magnify the press the red press of Noah from which cometh inspiration Ye pressmen of the Rhineland and the Rhine join in with all ye who tread out the glad tidings on isle Madeira or Mitylene Who giveth redness of eyes by making men long to tarry at the fine print Praise be unto the press the rosy press of Noah which giveth rosiness of hearts by making men long to tarry at the rosy wine Who hath babblings and contentions Who without cause inflicteth wounds Praise be unto the press the kindly press of Noah which knitteth friends which fuseth foes Who may be bribed Who may be bound Praise be unto the press the free press of Noah which will not lie for tyrants but make tyrants speak the truth Then praise be unto the press the frank old press of Noah then let us extol and magnify the press the brave old press of Noah then let us with roses garland and enwreath the press the grand old press of Noah from which flow streams of knowledge which give man a bliss no more unreal than his pain You deceived me smiled the cosmopolitan as both now resumed their seats you roguishly took advantage of my simplicity you archly played upon my enthusiasm But never mind the offense if any was so charming I almost wish you would offend again As for certain poetic left handers in your panegyric those I cheerfully concede to the indefinite privileges of the poet Upon the whole it was quite in the lyric style a style I always admire on account of that spirit of Sibyllic confidence and assurance which is perhaps its prime ingredient But come glancing at his companion s glass for a lyrist you let the bottle stay with you too long The lyre and the vine forever cried the other in his rapture or what seemed such heedless of the hint the vine the vine is it not the most graceful and bounteous of all growths And by its being such is not something meant divinely meant As I live a vine a Catawba vine shall be planted on my grave A genial thought but your glass there Oh oh taking a moderate sip but you why don t you drink You have forgotten my dear Charlie what I told you of my previous convivialities to day Oh cried the other now in manner quite abandoned to the lyric mood not without contrast to the easy sociability of his companion Oh one can t drink too much of good old wine the genuine mellow old port Pooh pooh drink away Then keep me company Of course with a flourish taking another sip suppose we have cigars Never mind your pipe there a pipe is best when alone I say waiter bring some cigars your best They were brought in a pretty little bit of western pottery representing some kind of Indian utensil mummy colored set down in a mass of tobacco leaves whose long green fans fancifully grouped formed with peeps of red the sides of the receptacle Accompanying it were two accessories also bits of pottery but smaller both globes one in guise of an apple flushed with red and gold to the life and through a cleft at top you saw it was hollow This was for the ashes The other gray with wrinkled surface in the likeness of a wasp s nest was the match box There said the stranger pushing over the cigar stand help yourself and I will touch you off taking a match Nothing like tobacco he added when the fumes of the cigar began to wreathe glancing from the smoker to the pottery I will have a Virginia tobacco plant set over my grave beside the Catawba vine Improvement upon your first idea which by itself was good but you don t smoke Presently presently let me fill your glass again You don t drink Thank you but no more just now Fill your glass Presently presently do you drink on Never mind me Now that it strikes me let me say that he who out of superfine gentility or fanatic morality denies himself tobacco suffers a more serious abatement in the cheap pleasures of life than the dandy in his iron boot or the celibate on his iron cot While for him who would fain revel in tobacco but cannot it is a thing at which philanthropists must weep to see such an one again and again madly returning to the cigar which for his incompetent stomach he cannot enjoy while still after each shameful repulse the sweet dream of the impossible good goads him on to his fierce misery once more poor eunuch I agree with you said the cosmopolitan still gravely social but you don t smoke Presently presently do you smoke on As I was saying about But why don t you smoke come You don t think that tobacco when in league with wine too much enhances the latter s vinous quality in short with certain constitutions tends to impair self possession do you To think that were treason to good fellowship was the warm disclaimer No no But the fact is there is an unpropitious flavor in my mouth just now Ate of a diabolical ragout at dinner so I shan t smoke till I have washed away the lingering memento of it with wine But smoke away you and pray don t forget to drink By the way while we sit here so companionably giving loose to any companionable nothing your uncompanionable friend Coonskins is by pure contrast brought to recollection If he were but here now he would see how much of real heart joy he denies himself by not hob a nobbing with his kind Why with loitering emphasis slowly withdrawing his cigar I thought I had undeceived you there I thought you had come to a better understanding of my eccentric friend Well I thought so too but first impressions will return you know In truth now that I think of it I am led to conjecture from chance things which dropped from Coonskins during the little interview I had with him that he is not a Missourian by birth but years ago came West here a young misanthrope from the other side of the Alleghanies less to make his fortune than to flee man Now since they say trifles sometimes effect great results I shouldn t wonder if his history were probed it would be found that what first indirectly gave his sad bias to Coonskins was his disgust at reading in boyhood the advice of Polonius to Laertes advice which in the selfishness it inculcates is almost on a par with a sort of ballad upon the economies of money making to be occasionally seen pasted against the desk of small retail traders in New England I do hope now my dear fellow said the cosmopolitan with an air of bland protest that in my presence at least you will throw out nothing to the prejudice of the sons of the Puritans Hey day and high times indeed exclaimed the other nettled sons of the Puritans forsooth And who be Puritans that I an Alabamaian must do them reverence A set of sourly conceited old Malvolios whom Shakespeare laughs his fill at in his comedies Pray what were you about to suggest with regard to Polonius observed the cosmopolitan with quiet forbearance expressive of the patience of a superior mind at the petulance of an inferior one how do you characterize his advice to Laertes As false fatal and calumnious exclaimed the other with a degree of ardor befitting one resenting a stigma upon the family escutcheon and for a father to give his son monstrous The case you see is this The son is going abroad and for the first What does the father Invoke God s blessing upon him Put the blessed Bible in his trunk No Crams him with maxims smacking of my Lord Chesterfield with maxims of France with maxims of Italy No no be charitable not that Why does he not among other things say The friends thou hast and their adoption tried Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel Is that compatible with maxims of Italy Yes it is Frank Don t you see Laertes is to take the best of care of his friends his proved friends on the same principle that a wine corker takes the best of care of his proved bottles When a bottle gets a sharp knock and don t break he says Ah I ll keep that bottle Why Because he loves it No he has particular use for it Dear dear appealingly turning in distress that that kind of criticism is is in fact it won t do Won t truth do Frank You are so charitable with everybody do but consider the tone of the speech Now I put it to you Frank is there anything in it hortatory to high heroic disinterested effort Anything like sell all thou hast and give to the poor And in other points what desire seems most in the father s mind that his son should cherish nobleness for himself or be on his guard against the contrary thing in others An irreligious warner Frank no devout counselor is Polonius I hate him Nor can I bear to hear your veterans of the world affirm that he who steers through life by the advice of old Polonius will not steer among the breakers No no I hope nobody affirms that rejoined the cosmopolitan with tranquil abandonment sideways reposing his arm at full length upon the table I hope nobody affirms that because if Polonius advice be taken in your sense then the recommendation of it by men of experience would appear to involve more or less of an unhandsome sort of reflection upon human nature And yet with a perplexed air your suggestions have put things in such a strange light to me as in fact a little to disturb my previous notions of Polonius and what he says To be frank by your ingenuity you have unsettled me there to that degree that were it not for our coincidence of opinion in general I should almost think I was now at length beginning to feel the ill effect of an immature mind too much consorting with a mature one except on the ground of first principles in common Really and truly cried the other with a kind of tickled modesty and pleased concern mine is an understanding too weak to throw out grapnels and hug another to it I have indeed heard of some great scholars in these days whose boast is less that they have made disciples than victims But for me had I the power to do such things I have not the heart to desire I believe you my dear Charlie And yet I repeat by your commentaries on Polonius you have I know not how unsettled me so that now I don t exactly see how Shakespeare meant the words he puts in Polonius mouth Some say that he meant them to open people s eyes but I don t think so Open their eyes echoed the cosmopolitan slowly expanding his what is there in this world for one to open his eyes to I mean in the sort of invidious sense you cite Well others say he meant to corrupt people s morals and still others that he had no express intention at all but in effect opens their eyes and corrupts their morals in one operation All of which I reject Of course you reject so crude an hypothesis and yet to confess in reading Shakespeare in my closet struck by some passage I have laid down the volume and said This Shakespeare is a queer man At times seeming irresponsible he does not always seem reliable There appears to be a certain what shall I call it hidden sun say about him at once enlightening and mystifying Now I should be afraid to say what I have sometimes thought that hidden sun might be Do you think it was the true light with clandestine geniality again filling the other s glass I would prefer to decline answering a categorical question there Shakespeare has got to be a kind of deity Prudent minds having certain latent thoughts concerning him will reserve them in a condition of lasting probation Still as touching avowable speculations we are permitted a tether Shakespeare himself is to be adored not arraigned but so we do it with humility we may a little canvass his characters There s his Autolycus now a fellow that always puzzled me How is one to take Autolycus A rogue so happy so lucky so triumphant of so almost captivatingly vicious a career that a virtuous man reduced to the poor house were such a contingency conceivable might almost long to change sides with him And yet see the words put into his mouth Oh cries Autolycus as he comes galloping gay as a buck upon the stage oh he laughs oh what a fool is Honesty and Trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman Think of that Trust that is confidence that is the thing in this universe the sacredest is rattlingly pronounced just the simplest And the scenes in which the rogue figures seem purposely devised for verification of his principles Mind Charlie I do not say it is so far from it but I do say it seems so Yes Autolycus would seem a needy varlet acting upon the persuasion that less is to be got by invoking pockets than picking them more to be made by an expert knave than a bungling beggar and for this reason as he thinks that the soft heads outnumber the soft hearts The devil s drilled recruit Autolycus is joyous as if he wore the livery of heaven When disturbed by the character and career of one thus wicked and thus happy my sole consolation is in the fact that no such creature ever existed except in the powerful imagination which evoked him And yet a creature a living creature he is though only a poet was his maker It may be that in that paper and ink investiture of his Autolycus acts more effectively upon mankind than he would in a flesh and blood one Can his influence be salutary True in Autolycus there is humor but though according to my principle humor is in general to be held a saving quality yet the case of Autolycus is an exception because it is his humor which so to speak oils his mischievousness The bravadoing mischievousness of Autolycus is slid into the world on humor as a pirate schooner with colors flying is launched into the sea on greased ways I approve of Autolycus as little as you said the stranger who during his companion s commonplaces had seemed less attentive to them than to maturing with in his own mind the original conceptions destined to eclipse them But I cannot believe that Autolycus mischievous as he must prove upon the stage can be near so much so as such a character as Polonius I don t know about that bluntly and yet not impolitely returned the cosmopolitan to be sure accepting your view of the old courtier then if between him and Autolycus you raise the question of unprepossessingness I grant you the latter comes off best For a moist rogue may tickle the midriff while a dry worldling may but wrinkle the spleen But Polonius is not dry said the other excitedly he drules One sees the fly blown old fop drule and look wise His vile wisdom is made the viler by his vile rheuminess The bowing and cringing time serving old sinner is such an one to give manly precepts to youth The discreet decorous old dotard of state senile prudence fatuous soullessness The ribanded old dog is paralytic all down one side and that the side of nobleness His soul is gone out Only nature s automatonism keeps him on his legs As with some old trees the bark survives the pith and will still stand stiffly up though but to rim round punk so the body of old Polonius has outlived his soul Come come said the cosmopolitan with serious air almost displeased though I yield to none in admiration of earnestness yet I think even earnestness may have limits To human minds strong language is always more or less distressing Besides Polonius is an old man as I remember him upon the stage with snowy locks Now charity requires that such a figure think of it how you will should at least be treated with civility Moreover old age is ripeness and I once heard say Better ripe than raw But not better rotten than raw bringing down his hand with energy on the table Why bless me in mild surprise contemplating his heated comrade how you fly out against this unfortunate Polonius a being that never was nor will be And yet viewed in a Christian light he added pensively I don t know that anger against this man of straw is a whit less wise than anger against a man of flesh Madness to be mad with anything That may be or may not be returned the other a little testily perhaps but I stick to what I said that it is better to be raw than rotten And what is to be feared on that head may be known from this that it is with the best of hearts as with the best of pears a dangerous experiment to linger too long upon the scene This did Polonius Thank fortune Frank I am young every tooth sound in my head and if good wine can keep me where I am long shall I remain so True with a smile But wine to do good must be drunk You have talked much and well Charlie but drunk little and indifferently fill up Presently presently with a hasty and preoccupied air If I remember right Polonius hints as much as that one should under no circumstances commit the indiscretion of aiding in a pecuniary way an unfortunate friend He drules out some stale stuff about loan losing both itself and friend don t he But our bottle is it glued fast Keep it moving my dear Frank Good wine and upon my soul I begin to feel it and through me old Polonius yes this wine I fear is what excites me so against that detestable old dog without a tooth Upon this the cosmopolitan cigar in mouth slowly raised the bottle and brought it slowly to the light looking at it steadfastly as one might at a thermometer in August to see not how low it was but how high Then whiffing out a puff set it down and said Well Charlie if what wine you have drunk came out of this bottle in that case I should say that if supposing a case that if one fellow had an object in getting another fellow fuddled and this fellow to be fuddled was of your capacity the operation would be comparatively inexpensive What do you think Charlie Why I think I don t much admire the supposition said Charlie with a look of resentment it ain t safe depend upon it Frank to venture upon too jocose suppositions with one s friends Why bless you Frank my supposition wasn t personal but general You mustn t be so touchy If I am touchy it is the wine Sometimes when I freely drink it has a touchy effect on me I have observed Freely drink you haven t drunk the perfect measure of one glass yet While for me this must be my fourth or fifth thanks to your importunity not to speak of all I drank this morning for old acquaintance sake Drink drink you must drink Oh I drink while you are talking laughed the other you have not noticed it but I have drunk my share Have a queer way I learned from a sedate old uncle who used to tip off his glass unperceived Do you fill up and my glass too There Now away with that stump and have a new cigar Good fellowship forever again in the lyric mood Say Frank are we not men I say are we not human Tell me were they not human who engendered us as before heaven I believe they shall be whom we shall engender Fill up up up my friend Let the ruby tide aspire and all ruby aspirations with it Up fill up Be we convivial And conviviality what is it The word I mean what expresses it A living together But bats live together and did you ever hear of convivial bats If I ever did observed the cosmopolitan it has quite slipped my recollection But why did you never hear of convivial bats nor anybody else Because bats though they live together live not together genially Bats are not genial souls But men are and how delightful to think that the word which among men signifies the highest pitch of geniality implies as indispensable auxiliary the cheery benediction of the bottle Yes Frank to live together in the finest sense we must drink together And so what wonder that he who loves not wine that sober wretch has a lean heart a heart like a wrung out old bluing bag and loves not his kind Out upon him to the rag house with him hang him the ungenial soul Oh now now can t you be convivial without being censorious I like easy unexcited conviviality For the sober man really though for my part I naturally love a cheerful glass I will not prescribe my nature as the law to other natures So don t abuse the sober man Conviviality is one good thing and sobriety is another good thing So don t be one sided Well if I am one sided it is the wine Indeed indeed I have indulged too genially My excitement upon slight provocation shows it But yours is a stronger head drink you By the way talking of geniality it is much on the increase in these days ain t it It is and I hail the fact Nothing better attests the advance of the humanitarian spirit In former and less humanitarian ages the ages of amphitheatres and gladiators geniality was mostly confined to the fireside and table But in our age the age of joint stock companies and free and easies it is with this precious quality as with precious gold in old Peru which Pizarro found making up the scullion s sauce pot as the Inca s crown Yes we golden boys the moderns have geniality everywhere a bounty broadcast like noonlight True true my sentiments again Geniality has invaded each department and profession We have genial senators genial authors genial lecturers genial doctors genial clergymen genial surgeons and the next thing we shall have genial hangmen As to the last named sort of person said the cosmopolitan I trust that the advancing spirit of geniality will at last enable us to dispense with him No murderers no hangmen And surely when the whole world shall have been genialized it will be as out of place to talk of murderers as in a Christianized world to talk of sinners To pursue the thought said the other every blessing is attended with some evil and Stay said the cosmopolitan that may be better let pass for a loose saying than for hopeful doctrine Well assuming the saying s truth it would apply to the future supremacy of the genial spirit since then it will fare with the hangman as it did with the weaver when the spinning jenny whizzed into the ascendant Thrown out of employment what could Jack Ketch turn his hand to Butchering That he could turn his hand to it seems probable but that under the circumstances it would be appropriate might in some minds admit of a question For one I am inclined to think and I trust it will not be held fastidiousness that it would hardly be suitable to the dignity of our nature that an individual once employed in attending the last hours of human unfortunates should that office being extinct transfer himself to the business of attending the last hours of unfortunate cattle I would suggest that the individual turn valet a vocation to which he would perhaps appear not wholly inadapted by his familiar dexterity about the person In particular for giving a finishing tie to a gentleman s cravat I know few who would in all likelihood be from previous occupation better fitted than the professional person in question Are you in earnest regarding the serene speaker with unaffected curiosity are you really in earnest I trust I am never otherwise was the mildly earnest reply but talking of the advance of geniality I am not without hopes that it will eventually exert its influence even upon so difficult a subject as the misanthrope A genial misanthrope I thought I had stretched the rope pretty hard in talking of genial hangmen A genial misanthrope is no more conceivable than a surly philanthropist True lightly depositing in an unbroken little cylinder the ashes of his cigar true the two you name are well opposed Why you talk as if there was such a being as a surly philanthropist I do My eccentric friend whom you call Coonskins is an example Does he not as I explained to you hide under a surly air a philanthropic heart Now the genial misanthrope when in the process of eras he shall turn up will be the converse of this under an affable air he will hide a misanthropical heart In short the genial misanthrope will be a new kind of monster but still no small improvement upon the original one since instead of making faces and throwing stones at people like that poor old crazy man Timon he will take steps fiddle in hand and set the tickled world a dancing In a word as the progress of Christianization mellows those in manner whom it cannot mend in mind much the same will it prove with the progress of genialization And so thanks to geniality the misanthrope reclaimed from his boorish address will take on refinement and softness to so genial a degree indeed that it may possibly fall out that the misanthrope of the coming century will be almost as popular as I am sincerely sorry to say some philanthropists of the present time would seem not to be as witness my eccentric friend named before Well cried the other a little weary perhaps of a speculation so abstract well however it may be with the century to come certainly in the century which is whatever else one may be he must be genial or he is nothing So fill up fill up and be genial I am trying my best said the cosmopolitan still calmly companionable A moment since we talked of Pizarro gold and Peru no doubt now you remember that when the Spaniard first entered Atahalpa s treasure chamber and saw such profusion of plate stacked up right and left with the wantonness of old barrels in a brewer s yard the needy fellow felt a twinge of misgiving of want of confidence as to the genuineness of an opulence so profuse He went about rapping the shining vases with his knuckles But it was all gold pure gold good gold sterling gold which how cheerfully would have been stamped such at Goldsmiths Hall And just so those needy minds which through their own insincerity having no confidence in mankind doubt lest the liberal geniality of this age be spurious They are small Pizarros in their way by the very princeliness of men s geniality stunned into distrust of it Far be such distrust from you and me my genial friend cried the other fervently fill up fill up Well this all along seems a division of labor smiled the cosmopolitan I do about all the drinking and you do about all the genial But yours is a nature competent to do that to a large population And now my friend with a peculiarly grave air evidently foreshadowing something not unimportant and very likely of close personal interest wine you know opens the heart and Opens it with exultation it thaws it right out Every heart is ice bound till wine melt it and reveal the tender grass and sweet herbage budding below with every dear secret hidden before like a dropped jewel in a snow bank lying there unsuspected through winter till spring And just in that way my dear Charlie is one of my little secrets now to be shown forth Ah eagerly moving round his chair what is it Be not so impetuous my dear Charlie Let me explain You see naturally I am a man not overgifted with assurance in general I am if anything diffidently reserved so if I shall presently seem otherwise the reason is that you by the geniality you have evinced in all your talk and especially the noble way in which while affirming your good opinion of men you intimated that you never could prove false to any man but most by your indignation at a particularly illiberal passage in Polonius advice in short in short with extreme embarrassment how shall I express what I mean unless I add that by your whole character you impel me to throw myself upon your nobleness in one word put confidence in you a generous confidence I see I see with heightened interest something of moment you wish to confide Now what is it Frank Love affair No not that What then my dear Frank Speak depend upon me to the last Out with it Out it shall come then said the cosmopolitan I am in want urgent want of money CHAPTER XXXI A METAMORPHOSIS MORE SURPRISING THAN ANY IN OVID In want of money pushing back his chair as from a suddenly disclosed man trap or crater Yes naively assented the cosmopolitan and you are going to loan me fifty dollars I could almost wish I was in need of more only for your sake Yes my dear Charlie for your sake that you might the better prove your noble kindliness my dear Charlie None of your dear Charlies cried the other springing to his feet and buttoning up his coat as if hastily to depart upon a long journey Why why why painfully looking up None of your why why whys tossing out a foot go to the devil sir Beggar impostor never so deceived in a man in my life CHAPTER XXXII SHOWING THAT THE AGE OF MAGIC AND MAGICIANS IS NOT YET OVER While speaking or rather hissing those words the boon companion underwent much such a change as one reads of in fairy books Out of old materials sprang a new creature Cadmus glided into the snake The cosmopolitan rose the traces of previous feeling vanished looked steadfastly at his transformed friend a moment then taking ten half eagles from his pocket stooped down and laid them one by one in a circle round him and retiring a pace waved his long tasseled pipe with the air of a necromancer an air heightened by his costume accompanying each wave with a solemn murmur of cabalistical words Meantime he within the magic ring stood suddenly rapt exhibiting every symptom of a successful charm a turned cheek a fixed attitude a frozen eye spellbound not more by the waving wand than by the ten invincible talismans on the floor Reappear reappear reappear oh my former friend Replace this hideous apparition with thy blest shape and be the token of thy return the words My dear Frank My dear Frank now cried the restored friend cordially stepping out of the ring with regained self possession regaining lost identity My dear Frank what a funny man you are full of fun as an egg of meat How could you tell me that absurd story of your being in need But I relish a good joke too well to spoil it by letting on Of course I humored the thing and on my side put on all the cruel airs you would have me Come this little episode of fictitious estrangement will but enhance the delightful reality Let us sit down again and finish our bottle With all my heart said the cosmopolitan dropping the necromancer with the same facility with which he had assumed it Yes he added soberly picking up the gold pieces and returning them with a chink to his pocket yes I am something of a funny man now and then while for you Charlie eying him in tenderness what you say about your humoring the thing is true enough never did man second a joke better than you did just now You played your part better than I did mine you played it Charlie to the life You see I once belonged to an amateur play company that accounts for it But come fill up and let s talk of something else Well acquiesced the cosmopolitan seating himself and quietly brimming his glass what shall we talk about Oh anything you please a sort of nervously accommodating Well suppose we talk about Charlemont Charlemont What s Charlemont Who s Charlemont You shall hear my dear Charlie answered the cosmopolitan I will tell you the story of Charlemont the gentleman madman CHAPTER XXXIII WHICH MAY PASS FOR WHATEVER IT MAY PROVE TO BE WORTH But ere be given the rather grave story of Charlemont a reply must in civility be made to a certain voice which methinks I hear that in view of past chapters and more particularly the last where certain antics appear exclaims How unreal all this is Who did ever dress or act like your cosmopolitan And who it might be returned did ever dress or act like harlequin Strange that in a work of amusement this severe fidelity to real life should be exacted by any one who by taking up such a work sufficiently shows that he is not unwilling to drop real life and turn for a time to something different Yes it is indeed strange that any one should clamor for the thing he is weary of that any one who for any cause finds real life dull should yet demand of him who is to divert his attention from it that he should be true to that dullness There is another class and with this class we side who sit down to a work of amusement tolerantly as they sit at a play and with much the same expectations and feelings They look that fancy shall evoke scenes different from those of the same old crowd round the custom house counter and same old dishes on the boardinghouse table with characters unlike those of the same old acquaintances they meet in the same old way every day in the same old street And as in real life the proprieties will not allow people to act out themselves with that unreserve permitted to the stage so in books of fiction they look not only for more entertainment but at bottom even for more reality than real life itself can show Thus though they want novelty they want nature too but nature unfettered exhilarated in effect transformed In this way of thinking the people in a fiction like the people in a play must dress as nobody exactly dresses talk as nobody exactly talks act as nobody exactly acts It is with fiction as with religion it should present another world and yet one to which we feel the tie If then something is to be pardoned to well meant endeavor surely a little is to be allowed to that writer who in all his scenes does but seek to minister to what as he understands it is the implied wish of the more indulgent lovers of entertainment before whom harlequin can never appear in a coat too parti colored or cut capers too fantastic One word more Though every one knows how bootless it is to be in all cases vindicating one s self never mind how convinced one may be that he is never in the wrong yet so precious to man is the approbation of his kind that to rest though but under an imaginary censure applied to but a work of imagination is no easy thing The mention of this weakness will explain why such readers as may think they perceive something harmonious between the boisterous hilarity of the cosmopolitan with the bristling cynic and his restrained good nature with the boon companion are now referred to that chapter where some similar apparent inconsistency in another character is on general principles modestly endeavored to be apologized for CHAPTER XXXIV IN WHICH THE COSMOPOLITAN TELLS THE STORY OF THE GENTLEMAN MADMAN Charlemont was a young merchant of French descent living in saint Louis a man not deficient in mind and possessed of that sterling and captivating kindliness seldom in perfection seen but in youthful bachelors united at times to a remarkable sort of gracefully devil may care and witty good humor Of course he was admired by everybody and loved as only mankind can love by not a few But in his twenty ninth year a change came over him Like one whose hair turns gray in a night so in a day Charlemont turned from affable to morose His acquaintances were passed without greeting while as for his confidential friends them he pointedly unscrupulously and with a kind of fierceness cut dead One provoked by such conduct would fain have resented it with words as disdainful while another shocked by the change and in concern for a friend magnanimously overlooking affronts implored to know what sudden secret grief had distempered him But from resentment and from tenderness Charlemont alike turned away Ere long to the general surprise the merchant Charlemont was gazetted and the same day it was reported that he had withdrawn from town but not before placing his entire property in the hands of responsible assignees for the benefit of creditors Whither he had vanished none could guess At length nothing being heard it was surmised that he must have made away with himself a surmise doubtless originating in the remembrance of the change some months previous to his bankruptcy a change of a sort only to be ascribed to a mind suddenly thrown from its balance Years passed It was spring time and lo one bright morning Charlemont lounged into the saint Louis coffee houses gay polite humane companionable and dressed in the height of costly elegance Not only was he alive but he was himself again Upon meeting with old acquaintances he made the first advances and in such a manner that it was impossible not to meet him half way Upon other old friends whom he did not chance casually to meet he either personally called or left his card and compliments for them and to several sent presents of game or hampers of wine They say the world is sometimes harshly unforgiving but it was not so to Charlemont The world feels a return of love for one who returns to it as he did Expressive of its renewed interest was a whisper an inquiring whisper how now exactly so long after his bankruptcy it fared with Charlemont s purse Rumor seldom at a loss for answers replied that he had spent nine years in Marseilles in France and there acquiring a second fortune had returned with it a man devoted henceforth to genial friendships Added years went by and the restored wanderer still the same or rather by his noble qualities grew up like golden maize in the encouraging sun of good opinions But still the latent wonder was what had caused that change in him at a period when pretty much as now he was to all appearance in the possession of the same fortune the same friends the same popularity But nobody thought it would be the thing to question him here At last at a dinner at his house when all the guests but one had successively departed this remaining guest an old acquaintance being just enough under the influence of wine to set aside the fear of touching upon a delicate point ventured in a way which perhaps spoke more favorably for his heart than his tact to beg of his host to explain the one enigma of his life Deep melancholy overspread the before cheery face of Charlemont he sat for some moments tremulously silent then pushing a full decanter towards the guest in a choked voice said No no when by art and care and time flowers are made to bloom over a grave who would seek to dig all up again only to know the mystery The wine When both glasses were filled Charlemont took his and lifting it added lowly If ever in days to come you shall see ruin at hand and thinking you understand mankind shall tremble for your friendships and tremble for your pride and partly through love for the one and fear for the other shall resolve to be beforehand with the world and save it from a sin by prospectively taking that sin to yourself then will you do as one I now dream of once did and like him will you suffer but how fortunate and how grateful should you be if like him after all that had happened you could be a little happy again When the guest went away it was with the persuasion that though outwardly restored in mind as in fortune yet some taint of Charlemont s old malady survived and that it was not well for friends to touch one dangerous string CHAPTER XXXV IN WHICH THE COSMOPOLITAN STRIKINGLY EVINCES THE ARTLESSNESS OF HIS NATURE Well what do you think of the story of Charlemont mildly asked he who had told it A very strange one answered the auditor who had been such not with perfect ease but is it true Of course not it is a story which I told with the purpose of every story teller to amuse Hence if it seem strange to you that strangeness is the romance it is what contrasts it with real life it is the invention in brief the fiction as opposed to the fact For do but ask yourself my dear Charlie lovingly leaning over towards him I rest it with your own heart now whether such a forereaching motive as Charlemont hinted he had acted on in his change whether such a motive I say were a sort of one at all justified by the nature of human society Would you for one turn the cold shoulder to a friend a convivial one say whose pennilessness should be suddenly revealed to you How can you ask me my dear Frank You know I would scorn such meanness But rising somewhat disconcerted really early as it is I think I must retire my head putting up his hand to it feels unpleasantly this confounded elixir of logwood little as I drank of it has played the deuce with me Little as you drank of this elixir of logwood Why Charlie you are losing your mind To talk so of the genuine mellow old port Yes I think that by all means you had better away and sleep it off There don t apologize don t explain go go I understand you exactly I will see you to morrow CHAPTER XXXVI IN WHICH THE COSMOPOLITAN IS ACCOSTED BY A MYSTIC WHEREUPON ENSUES PRETTY MUCH SUCH TALK AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED As not without some haste the boon companion withdrew a stranger advanced and touching the cosmopolitan said I think I heard you say you would see that man again Be warned don t you do so He turned surveying the speaker a blue eyed man sandy haired and Saxon looking perhaps five and forty tall and but for a certain angularity well made little touch of the drawing room about him but a look of plain propriety of a Puritan sort with a kind of farmer dignity His age seemed betokened more by his brow placidly thoughtful than by his general aspect which had that look of youthfulness in maturity peculiar sometimes to habitual health of body the original gift of nature or in part the effect or reward of steady temperance of the passions kept so perhaps by constitution as much as morality A neat comely almost ruddy cheek coolly fresh like a red clover blossom at coolish dawn the color of warmth preserved by the virtue of chill Toning the whole man was one knows not what of shrewdness and mythiness strangely jumbled in that way he seemed a kind of cross between a Yankee peddler and a Tartar priest though it seemed as if at a pinch the first would not in all probability play second fiddle to the last Sir said the cosmopolitan rising and bowing with slow dignity if I cannot with unmixed satisfaction hail a hint pointed at one who has just been clinking the social glass with me on the other hand I am not disposed to underrate the motive which in the present case could alone have prompted such an intimation My friend whose seat is still warm has retired for the night leaving more or less in his bottle here Pray sit down in his seat and partake with me and then if you choose to hint aught further unfavorable to the man the genial warmth of whose person in part passes into yours and whose genial hospitality meanders through you be it so Quite beautiful conceits said the stranger now scholastically and artistically eying the picturesque speaker as if he were a statue in the Pitti Palace very beautiful then with the gravest interest yours sir if I mistake not must be a beautiful soul one full of all love and truth for where beauty is there must those be A pleasing belief rejoined the cosmopolitan beginning with an even air and to confess long ago it pleased me Yes with you and Schiller I am pleased to believe that beauty is at bottom incompatible with ill and therefore am so eccentric as to have confidence in the latent benignity of that beautiful creature the rattle snake whose lithe neck and burnished maze of tawny gold as he sleekly curls aloft in the sun who on the prairie can behold without wonder As he breathed these words he seemed so to enter into their spirit as some earnest descriptive speakers will as unconsciously to wreathe his form and sidelong crest his head till he all but seemed the creature described Meantime the stranger regarded him with little surprise apparently though with much contemplativeness of a mystical sort and presently said When charmed by the beauty of that viper did it never occur to you to change personalities with him to feel what it was to be a snake to glide unsuspected in grass to sting to kill at a touch your whole beautiful body one iridescent scabbard of death In short did the wish never occur to you to feel yourself exempt from knowledge and conscience and revel for a while in the carefree joyous life of a perfectly instinctive unscrupulous and irresponsible creature Such a wish replied the other not perceptibly disturbed I must confess never consciously was mine Such a wish indeed could hardly occur to ordinary imaginations and mine I cannot think much above the average But now that the idea is suggested said the stranger with infantile intellectuality does it not raise the desire Hardly For though I do not think I have any uncharitable prejudice against the rattle snake still I should not like to be one If I were a rattle snake now there would be no such thing as being genial with men men would be afraid of me and then I should be a very lonesome and miserable rattle snake True men would be afraid of you And why Because of your rattle your hollow rattle a sound as I have been told like the shaking together of small dry skulls in a tune of the Waltz of Death And here we have another beautiful truth When any creature is by its make inimical to other creatures nature in effect labels that creature much as an apothecary does a poison So that whoever is destroyed by a rattle snake or other harmful agent it is his own fault He should have respected the label Hence that significant passage in Scripture Who will pity the charmer that is bitten with a serpent I would pity him said the cosmopolitan a little bluntly perhaps But don t you think rejoined the other still maintaining his passionless air don t you think that for a man to pity where nature is pitiless is a little presuming Let casuists decide the casuistry but the compassion the heart decides for itself But sir deepening in seriousness as I now for the first realize you but a moment since introduced the word irresponsible in a way I am not used to Now sir though out of a tolerant spirit as I hope I try my best never to be frightened at any speculation so long as it is pursued in honesty yet for once I must acknowledge that you do really in the point cited cause me uneasiness because a proper view of the universe that view which is suited to breed a proper confidence teaches if I err not that since all things are justly presided over not very many living agents but must be some way accountable Is a rattle snake accountable asked the stranger with such a preternaturally cold gemmy glance out of his pellucid blue eye that he seemed more a metaphysical merman than a feeling man is a rattle snake accountable If I will not affirm that it is returned the other with the caution of no inexperienced thinker neither will I deny it But if we suppose it so I need not say that such accountability is neither to you nor me nor the Court of Common Pleas but to something superior He was proceeding when the stranger would have interrupted him but as reading his argument in his eye the cosmopolitan without waiting for it to be put into words at once spoke to it You object to my supposition for but such it is that the rattle snake s accountability is not by nature manifest but might not much the same thing be urged against man s A reductio ad absurdum proving the objection vain But if now he continued you consider what capacity for mischief there is in a rattle snake observe I do not charge it with being mischievous I but say it has the capacity could you well avoid admitting that that would be no symmetrical view of the universe which should maintain that while to man it is forbidden to kill without judicial cause his fellow yet the rattle snake has an implied permit of unaccountability to murder any creature it takes capricious umbrage at man included But with a wearied air this is no genial talk at least it is not so to me Zeal at unawares embarked me in it I regret it Pray sit down and take some of this wine Your suggestions are new to me said the other with a kind of condescending appreciativeness as of one who out of devotion to knowledge disdains not to appropriate the least crumb of it even from a pauper s board and as I am a very Athenian in hailing a new thought I cannot consent to let it drop so abruptly Now the rattle snake Nothing more about rattle snakes I beseech in distress I must positively decline to reenter upon that subject Sit down sir I beg and take some of this wine To invite me to sit down with you is hospitable collectedly acquiescing now in the change of topics and hospitality being fabled to be of oriental origin and forming as it does the subject of a pleasing Arabian romance as well as being a very romantic thing in itself hence I always hear the expressions of hospitality with pleasure But as for the wine my regard for that beverage is so extreme and I am so fearful of letting it sate me that I keep my love for it in the lasting condition of an untried abstraction Briefly I quaff immense draughts of wine from the page of Hafiz but wine from a cup I seldom as much as sip The cosmopolitan turned a mild glance upon the speaker who now occupying the chair opposite him sat there purely and coldly radiant as a prism It seemed as if one could almost hear him vitreously chime and ring That moment a waiter passed whom arresting with a sign the cosmopolitan bid go bring a goblet of ice water Ice it well waiter said he and now turning to the stranger will you if you please give me your reason for the warning words you first addressed to me I hope they were not such warnings as most warnings are said the stranger warnings which do not forewarn but in mockery come after the fact And yet something in you bids me think now that whatever latent design your impostor friend might have had upon you it as yet remains unaccomplished You read his label And what did it say This is a genial soul So you see you must either give up your doctrine of labels or else your prejudice against my friend But tell me with renewed earnestness what do you take him for What is he What are you What am I Nobody knows who anybody is The data which life furnishes towards forming a true estimate of any being are as insufficient to that end as in geometry one side given would be to determine the triangle But is not this doctrine of triangles someway inconsistent with your doctrine of labels Yes but what of that I seldom care to be consistent In a philosophical view consistency is a certain level at all times maintained in all the thoughts of one s mind But since nature is nearly all hill and dale how can one keep naturally advancing in knowledge without submitting to the natural inequalities in the progress Advance into knowledge is just like advance upon the grand Erie canal where from the character of the country change of level is inevitable you are locked up and locked down with perpetual inconsistencies and yet all the time you get on while the dullest part of the whole route is what the boatmen call the long level a consistently flat surface of sixty miles through stagnant swamps In one particular rejoined the cosmopolitan your simile is perhaps unfortunate For after all these weary lockings up and lockings down upon how much of a higher plain do you finally stand Enough to make it an object Having from youth been taught reverence for knowledge you must pardon me if on but this one account I reject your analogy But really you someway bewitch me with your tempting discourse so that I keep straying from my point unawares You tell me you cannot certainly know who or what my friend is pray what do you conjecture him to be I conjecture him to be what among the ancient Egyptians was called a using some unknown word A And what is that A is what Proclus in a little note to his third book on the theology of Plato defines as coming out with a sentence of Greek Holding up his glass and steadily looking through its transparency the cosmopolitan rejoined That in so defining the thing Proclus set it to modern understandings in the most crystal light it was susceptible of I will not rashly deny still if you could put the definition in words suited to perceptions like mine I should take it for a favor A favor slightly lifting his cool eyebrows a bridal favor I understand a knot of white ribands a very beautiful type of the purity of true marriage but of other favors I am yet to learn and still in a vague way the word as you employ it strikes me as unpleasingly significant in general of some poor unheroic submission to being done good to Here the goblet of iced water was brought and in compliance with a sign from the cosmopolitan was placed before the stranger who not before expressing acknowledgments took a draught apparently refreshing its very coldness as with some is the case proving not entirely uncongenial At last setting down the goblet and gently wiping from his lips the beads of water freshly clinging there as to the valve of a coral shell upon a reef he turned upon the cosmopolitan and in a manner the most cool self possessed and matter of fact possible said I hold to the metempsychosis and whoever I may be now I feel that I was once the stoic Arrian and have inklings of having been equally puzzled by a word in the current language of that former time very probably answering to your word favor Would you favor me by explaining said the cosmopolitan blandly Sir responded the stranger with a very slight degree of severity I like lucidity of all things and am afraid I shall hardly be able to converse satisfactorily with you unless you bear it in mind The cosmopolitan ruminatingly eyed him awhile then said The best way as I have heard to get out of a labyrinth is to retrace one s steps I will accordingly retrace mine and beg you will accompany me In short once again to return to the point for what reason did you warn me against my friend Briefly then and clearly because as before said I conjecture him to be what among the ancient Egyptians Pray now earnestly deprecated the cosmopolitan pray now why disturb the repose of those ancient Egyptians What to us are their words or their thoughts Are we pauper Arabs without a house of our own that with the mummies we must turn squatters among the dust of the Catacombs Pharaoh s poorest brick maker lies proudlier in his rags than the Emperor of all the Russias in his hollands oracularly said the stranger for death though in a worm is majestic while life though in a king is contemptible So talk not against mummies It is a part of my mission to teach mankind a due reverence for mummies Fortunately to arrest these incoherencies or rather to vary them a haggard inspired looking man now approached a crazy beggar asking alms under the form of peddling a rhapsodical tract composed by himself and setting forth his claims to some rhapsodical apostleship Though ragged and dirty there was about him no touch of vulgarity for by nature his manner was not unrefined his frame slender and appeared the more so from the broad untanned frontlet of his brow tangled over with a disheveled mass of raven curls throwing a still deeper tinge upon a complexion like that of a shriveled berry Nothing could exceed his look of picturesque Italian ruin and dethronement heightened by what seemed just one glimmering peep of reason insufficient to do him any lasting good but enough perhaps to suggest a torment of latent doubts at times whether his addled dream of glory were true Accepting the tract offered him the cosmopolitan glanced over it and seeming to see just what it was closed it put it in his pocket eyed the man a moment then leaning over and presenting him with a shilling said to him in tones kind and considerate I am sorry my friend that I happen to be engaged just now but having purchased your work I promise myself much satisfaction in its perusal at my earliest leisure In his tattered single breasted frock coat buttoned meagerly up to his chin the shutter brain made him a bow which for courtesy would not have misbecome a viscount then turned with silent appeal to the stranger But the stranger sat more like a cold prism than ever while an expression of keen Yankee cuteness now replacing his former mystical one lent added icicles to his aspect His whole air said Nothing from me The repulsed petitioner threw a look full of resentful pride and cracked disdain upon him and went his way Come now said the cosmopolitan a little reproachfully you ought to have sympathized with that man tell me did you feel no fellow feeling Look at his tract here quite in the transcendental vein Excuse me said the stranger declining the tract I never patronize scoundrels Scoundrels I detected in him sir a damning peep of sense damning I say for sense in a seeming madman is scoundrelism I take him for a cunning vagabond who picks up a vagabond living by adroitly playing the madman Did you not remark how he flinched under my eye Really drawing a long astonished breath I could hardly have divined in you a temper so subtlely distrustful Flinched to be sure he did poor fellow you received him with so lame a welcome As for his adroitly playing the madman invidious critics might object the same to some one or two strolling magi of these days But that is a matter I know nothing about But once more and for the last time to return to the point why sir did you warn me against my friend I shall rejoice if as I think it will prove your want of confidence in my friend rests upon a basis equally slender with your distrust of the lunatic Come why did you warn me Put it I beseech in few words and those English I warned you against him because he is suspected for what on these boats is known so they tell me as a Mississippi operator An operator ah he operates does he My friend then is something like what the Indians call a Great Medicine is he He operates he purges he drains off the repletions I perceive sir said the stranger constitutionally obtuse to the pleasant drollery that your notion of what is called a Great Medicine needs correction The Great Medicine among the Indians is less a bolus than a man in grave esteem for his politic sagacity And is not my friend politic Is not my friend sagacious By your own definition is not my friend a Great Medicine No he is an operator a Mississippi operator an equivocal character That he is such I little doubt having had him pointed out to me as such by one desirous of initiating me into any little novelty of this western region where I never before traveled And sir if I am not mistaken you also are a stranger here but indeed where in this strange universe is not one a stranger and that is a reason why I felt moved to warn you against a companion who could not be otherwise than perilous to one of a free and trustful disposition But I repeat the hope that thus far at least he has not succeeded with you and trust that for the future he will not Thank you for your concern but hardly can I equally thank you for so steadily maintaining the hypothesis of my friend s objectionableness True I but made his acquaintance for the first to day and know little of his antecedents but that would seem no just reason why a nature like his should not of itself inspire confidence And since your own knowledge of the gentleman is not by your account so exact as it might be you will pardon me if I decline to welcome any further suggestions unflattering to him Indeed sir with friendly decision let us change the subject CHAPTER XXXVII THE MYSTICAL MASTER INTRODUCES THE PRACTICAL DISCIPLE Both the subject and the interlocutor replied the stranger rising and waiting the return towards him of a promenader that moment turning at the further end of his walk Egbert said he calling Egbert a well dressed commercial looking gentleman of about thirty responded in a way strikingly deferential and in a moment stood near in the attitude less of an equal companion apparently than a confidential follower This said the stranger taking Egbert by the hand and leading him to the cosmopolitan this is Egbert a disciple I wish you to know Egbert Egbert was the first among mankind to reduce to practice the principles of Mark Winsome principles previously accounted as less adapted to life than the closet Egbert turning to the disciple who with seeming modesty a little shrank under these compliments Egbert this with a salute towards the cosmopolitan is like all of us a stranger I wish you Egbert to know this brother stranger be communicative with him Particularly if by anything hitherto dropped his curiosity has been roused as to the precise nature of my philosophy I trust you will not leave such curiosity ungratified You Egbert by simply setting forth your practice can do more to enlighten one as to my theory than I myself can by mere speech Indeed it is by you that I myself best understand myself For to every philosophy are certain rear parts very important parts and these like the rear of one s head are best seen by reflection Now as in a glass you Egbert in your life reflect to me the more important part of my system He who approves you approves the philosophy of Mark Winsome Though portions of this harangue may perhaps in the phraseology seem self complaisant yet no trace of self complacency was perceptible in the speaker s manner which throughout was plain unassuming dignified and manly the teacher and prophet seemed to lurk more in the idea so to speak than in the mere bearing of him who was the vehicle of it Sir said the cosmopolitan who seemed not a little interested in this new aspect of matters you speak of a certain philosophy and a more or less occult one it may be and hint of its bearing upon practical life pray tell me if the study of this philosophy tends to the same formation of character with the experiences of the world It does and that is the test of its truth for any philosophy that being in operation contradictory to the ways of the world tends to produce a character at odds with it such a philosophy must necessarily be but a cheat and a dream You a little surprise me answered the cosmopolitan for from an occasional profundity in you and also from your allusions to a profound work on the theology of Plato it would seem but natural to surmise that if you are the originator of any philosophy it must needs so partake of the abstruse as to exalt it above the comparatively vile uses of life No uncommon mistake with regard to me rejoined the other Then meekly standing like a Raphael If still in golden accents old Memnon murmurs his riddle none the less does the balance sheet of every man s ledger unriddle the profit or loss of life Sir with calm energy man came into this world not to sit down and muse not to befog himself with vain subtleties but to gird up his loins and to work Mystery is in the morning and mystery in the night and the beauty of mystery is everywhere but still the plain truth remains that mouth and purse must be filled If hitherto you have supposed me a visionary be undeceived I am no one ideaed one either no more than the seers before me Was not Seneca a usurer Bacon a courtier and Swedenborg though with one eye on the invisible did he not keep the other on the main chance Along with whatever else it may be given me to be I am a man of serviceable knowledge and a man of the world Know me for such And as for my disciple here turning towards him if you look to find any soft Utopianisms and last year s sunsets in him I smile to think how he will set you right The doctrines I have taught him will I trust lead him neither to the mad house nor the poor house as so many other doctrines have served credulous sticklers Furthermore glancing upon him paternally Egbert is both my disciple and my poet For poetry is not a thing of ink and rhyme but of thought and act and in the latter way is by any one to be found anywhere when in useful action sought In a word my disciple here is a thriving young merchant a practical poet in the West India trade There presenting Egbert s hand to the cosmopolitan I join you and leave you With which words and without bowing the master withdrew CHAPTER XXXVIII THE DISCIPLE UNBENDS AND CONSENTS TO ACT A SOCIAL PART In the master s presence the disciple had stood as one not ignorant of his place modesty was in his expression with a sort of reverential depression But the presence of the superior withdrawn he seemed lithely to shoot up erect from beneath it like one of those wire men from a toy snuff box He was as before said a young man of about thirty His countenance of that neuter sort which in repose is neither prepossessing nor disagreeable so that it seemed quite uncertain how he would turn out His dress was neat with just enough of the mode to save it from the reproach of originality in which general respect though with a readjustment of details his costume seemed modeled upon his master s But upon the whole he was to all appearances the last person in the world that one would take for the disciple of any transcendental philosophy though indeed something about his sharp nose and shaved chin seemed to hint that if mysticism as a lesson ever came in his way he might with the characteristic knack of a true New Englander turn even so profitless a thing to some profitable account Well said he now familiarly seating himself in the vacated chair what do you think of Mark Sublime fellow ain t he That each member of the human guild is worthy respect my friend rejoined the cosmopolitan is a fact which no admirer of that guild will question but that in view of higher natures the word sublime so frequently applied to them can without confusion be also applied to man is a point which man will decide for himself though indeed if he decide it in the affirmative it is not for me to object But I am curious to know more of that philosophy of which at present I have but inklings You its first disciple among men it seems are peculiarly qualified to expound it Have you any objections to begin now None at all squaring himself to the table Where shall I begin At first principles You remember that it was in a practical way that you were represented as being fitted for the clear exposition Now what you call first principles I have in some things found to be more or less vague Permit me then in a plain way to suppose some common case in real life and that done I would like you to tell me how you the practical disciple of the philosophy I wish to know about would in that case conduct A business like view Propose the case Not only the case but the persons The case is this There are two friends friends from childhood bosom friends one of whom for the first time being in need for the first time seeks a loan from the other who so far as fortune goes is more than competent to grant it And the persons are to be you and I you the friend from whom the loan is sought I the friend who seeks it you the disciple of the philosophy in question I a common man with no more philosophy than to know that when I am comfortably warm I don t feel cold and when I have the ague I shake Mind now you must work up your imagination and as much as possible talk and behave just as if the case supposed were a fact For brevity you shall call me Frank and I will call you Charlie Are you agreed Perfectly You begin The cosmopolitan paused a moment then assuming a serious and care worn air suitable to the part to be enacted addressed his hypothesized friend CHAPTER XXXIX THE HYPOTHETICAL FRIENDS Charlie I am going to put confidence in you You always have and with reason What is it Frank Charlie I am in want urgent want of money That s not well But it will be well Charlie if you loan me a hundred dollars I would not ask this of you only my need is sore and you and I have so long shared hearts and minds together however unequally on my side that nothing remains to prove our friendship than with the same inequality on my side to share purses You will do me the favor won t you Favor What do you mean by asking me to do you a favor Why Charlie you never used to talk so Because Frank you on your side never used to talk so But won t you loan me the money No Frank Why Because my rule forbids I give away money but never loan it and of course the man who calls himself my friend is above receiving alms The negotiation of a loan is a business transaction And I will transact no business with a friend What a friend is he is socially and intellectually and I rate social and intellectual friendship too high to degrade it on either side into a pecuniary make shift To be sure there are and I have what is called business friends that is commercial acquaintances very convenient persons But I draw a red ink line between them and my friends in the true sense my friends social and intellectual In brief a true friend has nothing to do with loans he should have a soul above loans Loans are such unfriendly accommodations as are to be had from the soulless corporation of a bank by giving the regular security and paying the regular discount An unfriendly accommodation Do those words go together handsomely Like the poor farmer s team of an old man and a cow not handsomely but to the purpose Look Frank a loan of money on interest is a sale of money on credit To sell a thing on credit may be an accommodation but where is the friendliness Few men in their senses except operators borrow money on interest except upon a necessity akin to starvation Well now where is the friendliness of my letting a starving man have say the money s worth of a barrel of flour upon the condition that on a given day he shall let me have the money s worth of a barrel and a half of flour especially if I add this further proviso that if he fail so to do I shall then to secure to myself the money s worth of my barrel and his half barrel put his heart up at public auction and as it is cruel to part families throw in his wife s and children s I understand with a pathetic shudder but even did it come to that such a step on the creditor s part let us for the honor of human nature hope were less the intention than the contingency But Frank a contingency not unprovided for in the taking beforehand of due securities Still Charlie was not the loan in the first place a friend s act And the auction in the last place an enemy s act Don t you see The enmity lies couched in the friendship just as the ruin in the relief I must be very stupid to day Charlie but really I can t understand this Excuse me my dear friend but it strikes me that in going into the philosophy of the subject you go somewhat out of your depth So said the incautious wader out to the ocean but the ocean replied It is just the other way my wet friend and drowned him That Charlie is a fable about as unjust to the ocean as some of AEsop s are to the animals The ocean is a magnanimous element and would scorn to assassinate a poor fellow let alone taunting him in the act But I don t understand what you say about enmity couched in friendship and ruin in relief I will illustrate Frank The needy man is a train slipped off the rail He who loans him money on interest is the one who by way of accommodation helps get the train back where it belongs but then by way of making all square and a little more telegraphs to an agent thirty miles a head by a precipice to throw just there on his account a beam across the track Your needy man s principle and interest friend is I say again a friend with an enmity in reserve No no my dear friend no interest for me I scorn interest Well Charlie none need you charge Loan me without interest That would be alms again Alms if the sum borrowed is returned Yes an alms not of the principle but the interest Well I am in sore need so I will not decline the alms Seeing that it is you Charlie gratefully will I accept the alms of the interest No humiliation between friends Now how in the refined view of friendship can you suffer yourself to talk so my dear Frank It pains me For though I am not of the sour mind of Solomon that in the hour of need a stranger is better than a brother yet I entirely agree with my sublime master who in his Essay on Friendship says so nobly that if he want a terrestrial convenience not to his friend celestial or friend social and intellectual would he go no for his terrestrial convenience to his friend terrestrial or humbler business friend he goes Very lucidly he adds the reason Because for the superior nature which on no account can ever descend to do good to be annoyed with requests to do it when the inferior one which by no instruction can ever rise above that capacity stands always inclined to it this is unsuitable Then I will not consider you as my friend celestial but as the other It racks me to come to that but to oblige you I ll do it We are business friends business is business You want to negotiate a loan Very good On what paper Will you pay three per cent a month Where is your security Surely you will not exact those formalities from your old schoolmate him with whom you have so often sauntered down the groves of Academe discoursing of the beauty of virtue and the grace that is in kindliness and all for so paltry a sum Security Our being fellow academics and friends from childhood up is security Pardon me my dear Frank our being fellow academics is the worst of securities while our having been friends from childhood up is just no security at all You forget we are now business friends And you on your side forget Charlie that as your business friend I can give you no security my need being so sore that I cannot get an indorser No indorser then no business loan Since then Charlie neither as the one nor the other sort of friend you have defined can I prevail with you how if combining the two I sue as both Are you a centaur When all is said then what good have I of your friendship regarded in what light you will The good which is in the philosophy of Mark Winsome as reduced to practice by a practical disciple And why don t you add much good may the philosophy of Mark Winsome do me Ah turning invokingly what is friendship if it be not the helping hand and the feeling heart the good Samaritan pouring out at need the purse as the vial Now my dear Frank don t be childish Through tears never did man see his way in the dark I should hold you unworthy that sincere friendship I bear you could I think that friendship in the ideal is too lofty for you to conceive And let me tell you my dear Frank that you would seriously shake the foundations of our love if ever again you should repeat the present scene The philosophy which is mine in the strongest way teaches plain dealing Let me then now as at the most suitable time candidly disclose certain circumstances you seem in ignorance of Though our friendship began in boyhood think not that on my side at least it began injudiciously Boys are little men it is said You I juvenilely picked out for my friend for your favorable points at the time not the least of which were your good manners handsome dress and your parents rank and repute of wealth In short like any grown man boy though I was I went into the market and chose me my mutton not for its leanness but its fatness In other words there seemed in you the schoolboy who always had silver in his pocket a reasonable probability that you would never stand in lean need of fat succor and if my early impression has not been verified by the event it is only because of the caprice of fortune producing a fallibility of human expectations however discreet Oh that I should listen to this cold blooded disclosure A little cold blood in your ardent veins my dear Frank wouldn t do you any harm let me tell you Cold blooded You say that because my disclosure seems to involve a vile prudence on my side But not so My reason for choosing you in part for the points I have mentioned was solely with a view of preserving inviolate the delicacy of the connection For do but think of it what more distressing to delicate friendship formed early than your friend s eventually in manhood dropping in of a rainy night for his little loan of five dollars or so Can delicate friendship stand that And on the other side would delicate friendship so long as it retained its delicacy do that Would you not instinctively say of your dripping friend in the entry I have been deceived fraudulently deceived in this man he is no true friend that in platonic love to demand love rites And rites doubly rights they are cruel Charlie Take it how you will heed well how by too importunately claiming those rights as you call them you shake those foundations I hinted of For though as it turns out I in my early friendship built me a fair house on a poor site yet such pains and cost have I lavished on that house that after all it is dear to me No I would not lose the sweet boon of your friendship Frank But beware And of what Of being in need Oh Charlie you talk not to a god a being who in himself holds his own estate but to a man who being a man is the sport of fate s wind and wave and who mounts towards heaven or sinks towards hell as the billows roll him in trough or on crest Tut Frank Man is no such poor devil as that comes to no poor drifting sea weed of the universe Man has a soul which if he will puts him beyond fortune s finger and the future s spite Don t whine like fortune s whipped dog Frank or by the heart of a true friend I will cut ye Cut me you have already cruel Charlie and to the quick Call to mind the days we went nutting the times we walked in the woods arms wreathed about each other showing trunks invined like the trees oh Charlie Pish we were boys Then lucky the fate of the first born of Egypt cold in the grave ere maturity struck them with a sharper frost Charlie Fie you re a girl Help help Charlie I want help Help to say nothing of the friend there is something wrong about the man who wants help There is somewhere a defect a want in brief a need a crying need somewhere about that man So there is Charlie Help Help How foolish a cry when to implore help is itself the proof of undesert of it Oh this all along is not you Charlie but some ventriloquist who usurps your larynx It is Mark Winsome that speaks not Charlie If so thank heaven the voice of Mark Winsome is not alien but congenial to my larynx If the philosophy of that illustrious teacher find little response among mankind at large it is less that they do not possess teachable tempers than because they are so unfortunate as not to have natures predisposed to accord with him Welcome that compliment to humanity exclaimed Frank with energy the truer because unintended And long in this respect may humanity remain what you affirm it And long it will since humanity inwardly feeling how subject it is to straits and hence how precious is help will for selfishness sake if no other long postpone ratifying a philosophy that banishes help from the world But Charlie Charlie speak as you used to tell me you will help me Were the case reversed not less freely would I loan you the money than you would ask me to loan it I ask I ask a loan Frank by this hand under no circumstances would I accept a loan though without asking pressed on me The experience of China Aster might warn me And what was that Not very unlike the experience of the man that built himself a palace of moon beams and when the moon set was surprised that his palace vanished with it I will tell you about China Aster I wish I could do so in my own words but unhappily the original story teller here has so tyrannized over me that it is quite impossible for me to repeat his incidents without sliding into his style I forewarn you of this that you may not think me so maudlin as in some parts the story would seem to make its narrator It is too bad that any intellect especially in so small a matter should have such power to impose itself upon another against its best exerted will too However it is satisfaction to know that the main moral to which all tends I fully approve But to begin CHAPTER XL IN WHICH THE STORY OF CHINA ASTER IS AT SECOND HAND TOLD BY ONE WHO WHILE NOT DISAPPROVING THE MORAL DISCLAIMS THE SPIRIT OF THE STYLE China Aster was a young candle maker of Marietta at the mouth of the Muskingum one whose trade would seem a kind of subordinate branch of that parent craft and mystery of the hosts of heaven to be the means effectively or otherwise of shedding some light through the darkness of a planet benighted But he made little money by the business Much ado had poor China Aster and his family to live he could if he chose light up from his stores a whole street but not so easily could he light up with prosperity the hearts of his household Now China Aster it so happened had a friend Orchis a shoemaker one whose calling it is to defend the understandings of men from naked contact with the substance of things a very useful vocation and which spite of all the wiseacres may prophesy will hardly go out of fashion so long as rocks are hard and flints will gall All at once by a capital prize in a lottery this useful shoemaker was raised from a bench to a sofa A small nabob was the shoemaker now and the understandings of men let them shift for themselves Not that Orchis was by prosperity elated into heartlessness Not at all Because in his fine apparel strolling one morning into the candlery and gayly switching about at the candle boxes with his gold headed cane while poor China Aster with his greasy paper cap and leather apron was selling one candle for one penny to a poor orange woman who with the patronizing coolness of a liberal customer required it to be carefully rolled up and tied in a half sheet of paper lively Orchis the woman being gone discontinued his gay switchings and said This is poor business for you friend China Aster your capital is too small You must drop this vile tallow and hold up pure spermaceti to the world I tell you what it is you shall have one thousand dollars to extend with In fact you must make money China Aster I don t like to see your little boy paddling about without shoes as he does Heaven bless your goodness friend Orchis replied the candle maker but don t take it illy if I call to mind the word of my uncle the blacksmith who when a loan was offered him declined it saying To ply my own hammer light though it be I think best rather than piece it out heavier by welding to it a bit off a neighbor s hammer though that may have some weight to spare otherwise were the borrowed bit suddenly wanted again it might not split off at the welding but too much to one side or the other Nonsense friend China Aster don t be so honest your boy is barefoot Besides a rich man lose by a poor man Or a friend be the worse by a friend China Aster I am afraid that in leaning over into your vats here this morning you have spilled out your wisdom Hush I won t hear any more Where s your desk Oh here With that Orchis dashed off a check on his bank and off handedly presenting it said There friend China Aster is your one thousand dollars when you make it ten thousand as you soon enough will for experience the only true knowledge teaches me that for every one good luck is in store then China Aster why then you can return me the money or not just as you please But in any event give yourself no concern for I shall never demand payment Now as kind heaven will so have it that to a hungry man bread is a great temptation and therefore he is not too harshly to be blamed if when freely offered he take it even though it be uncertain whether he shall ever be able to reciprocate so to a poor man proffered money is equally enticing and the worst that can be said of him if he accept it is just what can be said in the other case of the hungry man In short the poor candle maker s scrupulous morality succumbed to his unscrupulous necessity as is now and then apt to be the case He took the check and was about carefully putting it away for the present when Orchis switching about again with his gold headed cane said By the way China Aster it don t mean anything but suppose you make a little memorandum of this won t do any harm you know So China Aster gave Orchis his note for one thousand dollars on demand Orchis took it and looked at it a moment Pooh I told you friend China Aster I wasn t going ever to make any demand Then tearing up the note and switching away again at the candle boxes said carelessly Put it at four years So China Aster gave Orchis his note for one thousand dollars at four years You see I ll never trouble you about this said Orchis slipping it in his pocket book give yourself no further thought friend China Aster than how best to invest your money And don t forget my hint about spermaceti Go into that and I ll buy all my light of you with which encouraging words he with wonted rattling kindness took leave China Aster remained standing just where Orchis had left him when suddenly two elderly friends having nothing better to do dropped in for a chat The chat over China Aster in greasy cap and apron ran after Orchis and said Friend Orchis heaven will reward you for your good intentions but here is your check and now give me my note Your honesty is a bore China Aster said Orchis not without displeasure I won t take the check from you Then you must take it from the pavement Orchis said China Aster and picking up a stone he placed the check under it on the walk China Aster said Orchis inquisitively eying him after my leaving the candlery just now what asses dropped in there to advise with you that now you hurry after me and act so like a fool Shouldn t wonder if it was those two old asses that the boys nickname Old Plain Talk and Old Prudence Yes it was those two Orchis but don t call them names A brace of spavined old croakers Old Plain Talk had a shrew for a wife and that s made him shrewish and Old Prudence when a boy broke down in an apple stall and that discouraged him for life No better sport for a knowing spark like me than to hear Old Plain Talk wheeze out his sour old saws while Old Prudence stands by leaning on his staff wagging his frosty old pow and chiming in at every clause How can you speak so friend Orchis of those who were my father s friends Save me from my friends if those old croakers were Old Honesty s friends I call your father so for every one used to Why did they let him go in his old age on the town Why China Aster I ve often heard from my mother the chronicler that those two old fellows with Old Conscience as the boys called the crabbed old quaker that s dead now they three used to go to the poor house when your father was there and get round his bed and talk to him for all the world as Eliphaz Bildad and Zophar did to poor old pauper Job Yes Job s comforters were Old Plain Talk and Old Prudence and Old Conscience to your poor old father Friends I should like to know who you call foes With their everlasting croaking and reproaching they tormented poor Old Honesty your father to death At these words recalling the sad end of his worthy parent China Aster could not restrain some tears Upon which Orchis said Why China Aster you are the dolefulest creature Why don t you China Aster take a bright view of life You will never get on in your business or anything else if you don t take the bright view of life It s the ruination of a man to take the dismal one Then gayly poking at him with his gold headed cane Why don t you then Why don t you be bright and hopeful like me Why don t you have confidence China Aster I m sure I don t know friend Orchis soberly replied China Aster but may be my not having drawn a lottery prize like you may make some difference Nonsense before I knew anything about the prize I was gay as a lark just as gay as I am now In fact it has always been a principle with me to hold to the bright view Upon this China Aster looked a little hard at Orchis because the truth was that until the lucky prize came to him Orchis had gone under the nickname of Doleful Dumps he having been beforetimes of a hypochondriac turn so much so as to save up and put by a few dollars of his scanty earnings against that rainy day he used to groan so much about I tell you what it is now friend China Aster said Orchis pointing down to the check under the stone and then slapping his pocket the check shall lie there if you say so but your note shan t keep it company In fact China Aster I am too sincerely your friend to take advantage of a passing fit of the blues in you You shall reap the benefit of my friendship With which buttoning up his coat in a jiffy away he ran leaving the check behind At first China Aster was going to tear it up but thinking that this ought not to be done except in the presence of the drawer of the check he mused a while and picking it up trudged back to the candlery fully resolved to call upon Orchis soon as his day s work was over and destroy the check before his eyes But it so happened that when China Aster called Orchis was out and having waited for him a weary time in vain China Aster went home still with the check but still resolved not to keep it another day Bright and early next morning he would a second time go after Orchis and would no doubt make a sure thing of it by finding him in his bed for since the lottery prize came to him Orchis besides becoming more cheery had also grown a little lazy But as destiny would have it that same night China Aster had a dream in which a being in the guise of a smiling angel and holding a kind of cornucopia in her hand hovered over him pouring down showers of small gold dollars thick as kernels of corn I am Bright Future friend China Aster said the angel and if you do what friend Orchis would have you do just see what will come of it With which Bright Future with another swing of her cornucopia poured such another shower of small gold dollars upon him that it seemed to bank him up all round and he waded about in it like a maltster in malt Now dreams are wonderful things as everybody knows so wonderful indeed that some people stop not short of ascribing them directly to heaven and China Aster who was of a proper turn of mind in everything thought that in consideration of the dream it would be but well to wait a little ere seeking Orchis again During the day China Aster s mind dwelling continually upon the dream he was so full of it that when Old Plain Talk dropped in to see him just before dinnertime as he often did out of the interest he took in Old Honesty s son China Aster told all about his vision adding that he could not think that so radiant an angel could deceive and indeed talked at such a rate that one would have thought he believed the angel some beautiful human philanthropist Something in this sort Old Plain Talk understood him and accordingly in his plain way said China Aster you tell me that an angel appeared to you in a dream Now what does that amount to but this that you dreamed an angel appeared to you Go right away China Aster and return the check as I advised you before If friend Prudence were here he would say just the same thing With which words Old Plain Talk went off to find friend Prudence but not succeeding was returning to the candlery himself when at distance mistaking him for a dun who had long annoyed him China Aster in a panic barred all his doors and ran to the back part of the candlery where no knock could be heard By this sad mistake being left with no friend to argue the other side of the question China Aster was so worked upon at last by musing over his dream that nothing would do but he must get the check cashed and lay out the money the very same day in buying a good lot of spermaceti to make into candles by which operation he counted upon turning a better penny than he ever had before in his life in fact this he believed would prove the foundation of that famous fortune which the angel had promised him Now in using the money China Aster was resolved punctually to pay the interest every six months till the principal should be returned howbeit not a word about such a thing had been breathed by Orchis though indeed according to custom as well as law in such matters interest would legitimately accrue on the loan nothing to the contrary having been put in the bond Whether Orchis at the time had this in mind or not there is no sure telling but to all appearance he never so much as cared to think about the matter one way or other Though the spermaceti venture rather disappointed China Aster s sanguine expectations yet he made out to pay the first six months interest and though his next venture turned out still less prosperously yet by pinching his family in the matter of fresh meat and what pained him still more his boys schooling he contrived to pay the second six months interest sincerely grieved that integrity as well as its opposite though not in an equal degree costs something sometimes Meanwhile Orchis had gone on a trip to Europe by advice of a physician it so happening that since the lottery prize came to him it had been discovered to Orchis that his health was not very firm though he had never complained of anything before but a slight ailing of the spleen scarce worth talking about at the time So Orchis being abroad could not help China Aster s paying his interest as he did however much he might have been opposed to it for China Aster paid it to Orchis s agent who was of too business like a turn to decline interest regularly paid in on a loan But overmuch to trouble the agent on that score was not again to be the fate of China Aster for not being of that skeptical spirit which refuses to trust customers his third venture resulted through bad debts in almost a total loss a bad blow for the candle maker Neither did Old Plain Talk and Old Prudence neglect the opportunity to read him an uncheerful enough lesson upon the consequences of his disregarding their advice in the matter of having nothing to do with borrowed money It s all just as I predicted said Old Plain Talk blowing his old nose with his old bandana Yea indeed is it chimed in Old Prudence rapping his staff on the floor and then leaning upon it looking with solemn forebodings upon China Aster Low spirited enough felt the poor candle maker till all at once who should come with a bright face to him but his bright friend the angel in another dream Again the cornucopia poured out its treasure and promised still more Revived by the vision he resolved not to be down hearted but up and at it once more contrary to the advice of Old Plain Talk backed as usual by his crony which was to the effect that under present circumstances the best thing China Aster could do would be to wind up his business settle if he could all his liabilities and then go to work as a journeyman by which he could earn good wages and give up from that time henceforth all thoughts of rising above being a paid subordinate to men more able than himself for China Aster s career thus far plainly proved him the legitimate son of Old Honesty who as every one knew had never shown much business talent so little in fact that many said of him that he had no business to be in business And just this plain saying Plain Talk now plainly applied to China Aster and Old Prudence never disagreed with him But the angel in the dream did and maugre Plain Talk put quite other notions into the candle maker He considered what he should do towards reestablishing himself Doubtless had Orchis been in the country he would have aided him in this strait As it was he applied to others and as in the world much as some may hint to the contrary an honest man in misfortune still can find friends to stay by him and help him even so it proved with China Aster who at last succeeded in borrowing from a rich old farmer the sum of six hundred dollars at the usual interest of money lenders upon the security of a secret bond signed by China Aster s wife and himself to the effect that all such right and title to any property that should be left her by a well to do childless uncle an invalid tanner such property should in the event of China Aster s failing to return the borrowed sum on the given day be the lawful possession of the money lender True it was just as much as China Aster could possibly do to induce his wife a careful woman to sign this bond because she had always regarded her promised share in her uncle s estate as an anchor well to windward of the hard times in which China Aster had always been more or less involved and from which in her bosom she never had seen much chance of his freeing himself Some notion may be had of China Aster s standing in the heart and head of his wife by a short sentence commonly used in reply to such persons as happened to sound her on the point China Aster she would say is a good husband but a bad business man Indeed she was a connection on the maternal side of Old Plain Talk s But had not China Aster taken good care not to let Old Plain Talk and Old Prudence hear of his dealings with the old farmer ten to one they would in some way have interfered with his success in that quarter It has been hinted that the honesty of China Aster was what mainly induced the money lender to befriend him in his misfortune and this must be apparent for had China Aster been a different man the money lender might have dreaded lest in the event of his failing to meet his note he might some way prove slippery more especially as in the hour of distress worked upon by remorse for so jeopardizing his wife s money his heart might prove a traitor to his bond not to hint that it was more than doubtful how such a secret security and claim as in the last resort would be the old farmer s would stand in a court of law But though one inference from all this may be that had China Aster been something else than what he was he would not have been trusted and therefore he would have been effectually shut out from running his own and wife s head into the usurer s noose yet those who when everything at last came out maintained that in this view and to this extent the honesty of the candle maker was no advantage to him in so saying such persons said what every good heart must deplore and no prudent tongue will admit It may be mentioned that the old farmer made China Aster take part of his loan in three old dried up cows and one lame horse not improved by the glanders These were thrown in at a pretty high figure the old money lender having a singular prejudice in regard to the high value of any sort of stock raised on his farm With a great deal of difficulty and at more loss China Aster disposed of his cattle at public auction no private purchaser being found who could be prevailed upon to invest And now raking and scraping in every way and working early and late China Aster at last started afresh nor without again largely and confidently extending himself However he did not try his hand at the spermaceti again but admonished by experience returned to tallow But having bought a good lot of it by the time he got it into candles tallow fell so low and candles with it that his candles per pound barely sold for what he had paid for the tallow Meantime a year s unpaid interest had accrued on Orchis loan but China Aster gave himself not so much concern about that as about the interest now due to the old farmer But he was glad that the principal there had yet some time to run However the skinny old fellow gave him some trouble by coming after him every day or two on a scraggy old white horse furnished with a musty old saddle and goaded into his shambling old paces with a withered old raw hide All the neighbors said that surely Death himself on the pale horse was after poor China Aster now And something so it proved for ere long China Aster found himself involved in troubles mortal enough At this juncture Orchis was heard of Orchis it seemed had returned from his travels and clandestinely married and in a kind of queer way was living in Pennsylvania among his wife s relations who among other things had induced him to join a church or rather semi religious school of Come Outers and what was still more Orchis without coming to the spot himself had sent word to his agent to dispose of some of his property in Marietta and remit him the proceeds Within a year after China Aster received a letter from Orchis commending him for his punctuality in paying the first year s interest and regretting the necessity that he Orchis was now under of using all his dividends so he relied upon China Aster s paying the next six months interest and of course with the back interest Not more surprised than alarmed China Aster thought of taking steamboat to go and see Orchis but he was saved that expense by the unexpected arrival in Marietta of Orchis in person suddenly called there by that strange kind of capriciousness lately characterizing him No sooner did China Aster hear of his old friend s arrival than he hurried to call upon him He found him curiously rusty in dress sallow in cheek and decidedly less gay and cordial in manner which the more surprised China Aster because in former days he had more than once heard Orchis in his light rattling way declare that all he Orchis wanted to make him a perfectly happy hilarious and benignant man was a voyage to Europe and a wife with a free development of his inmost nature Upon China Aster s stating his case his trusted friend was silent for a time then in an odd way said that he would not crowd China Aster but still his Orchis necessities were urgent Could not China Aster mortgage the candlery He was honest and must have moneyed friends and could he not press his sales of candles Could not the market be forced a little in that particular The profits on candles must be very great Seeing now that Orchis had the notion that the candle making business was a very profitable one and knowing sorely enough what an error was here China Aster tried to undeceive him But he could not drive the truth into Orchis Orchis being very obtuse here and at the same time strange to say very melancholy Finally Orchis glanced off from so unpleasing a subject into the most unexpected reflections taken from a religious point of view upon the unstableness and deceitfulness of the human heart But having as he thought experienced something of that sort of thing China Aster did not take exception to his friend s observations but still refrained from so doing almost as much for the sake of sympathetic sociality as anything else Presently Orchis without much ceremony rose and saying he must write a letter to his wife bade his friend good bye but without warmly shaking him by the hand as of old In much concern at the change China Aster made earnest inquiries in suitable quarters as to what things as yet unheard of had befallen Orchis to bring about such a revolution and learned at last that besides traveling and getting married and joining the sect of Come Outers Orchis had somehow got a bad dyspepsia and lost considerable property through a breach of trust on the part of a factor in New York Telling these things to Old Plain Talk that man of some knowledge of the world shook his old head and told China Aster that though he hoped it might prove otherwise yet it seemed to him that all he had communicated about Orchis worked together for bad omens as to his future forbearance especially he added with a grim sort of smile in view of his joining the sect of Come Outers for if some men knew what was their inmost natures instead of coming out with it they would try their best to keep it in which indeed was the way with the prudent sort In all which sour notions Old Prudence as usual chimed in When interest day came again China Aster by the utmost exertions could only pay Orchis agent a small part of what was due and a part of that was made up by his children s gift money bright tenpenny pieces and new quarters kept in their little money boxes and pawning his best clothes with those of his wife and children so that all were subjected to the hardship of staying away from church And the old usurer too now beginning to be obstreperous China Aster paid him his interest and some other pressing debts with money got by at last mortgaging the candlery When next interest day came round for Orchis not a penny could be raised With much grief of heart China Aster so informed Orchis agent Meantime the note to the old usurer fell due and nothing from China Aster was ready to meet it yet as heaven sends its rain on the just and unjust alike by a coincidence not unfavorable to the old farmer the well to do uncle the tanner having died the usurer entered upon possession of such part of his property left by will to the wife of China Aster When still the next interest day for Orchis came round it found China Aster worse off than ever for besides his other troubles he was now weak with sickness Feebly dragging himself to Orchis agent he met him in the street told him just how it was upon which the agent with a grave enough face said that he had instructions from his employer not to crowd him about the interest at present but to say to him that about the time the note would mature Orchis would have heavy liabilities to meet and therefore the note must at that time be certainly paid and of course the back interest with it and not only so but as Orchis had had to allow the interest for good part of the time he hoped that for the back interest China Aster would in reciprocation have no objections to allowing interest on the interest annually To be sure this was not the law but between friends who accommodate each other it was the custom Just then Old Plain Talk with Old Prudence turned the corner coming plump upon China Aster as the agent left him and whether it was a sun stroke or whether they accidentally ran against him or whether it was his being so weak or whether it was everything together or how it was exactly there is no telling but poor China Aster fell to the earth and striking his head sharply was picked up senseless It was a day in July such a light and heat as only the midsummer banks of the inland Ohio know China Aster was taken home on a door lingered a few days with a wandering mind and kept wandering on till at last at dead of night when nobody was aware his spirit wandered away into the other world Old Plain Talk and Old Prudence neither of whom ever omitted attending any funeral which indeed was their chief exercise these two were among the sincerest mourners who followed the remains of the son of their ancient friend to the grave It is needless to tell of the executions that followed how that the candlery was sold by the mortgagee how Orchis never got a penny for his loan and how in the case of the poor widow chastisement was tempered with mercy for though she was left penniless she was not left childless Yet unmindful of the alleviation a spirit of complaint at what she impatiently called the bitterness of her lot and the hardness of the world so preyed upon her as ere long to hurry her from the obscurity of indigence to the deeper shades of the tomb But though the straits in which China Aster had left his family had besides apparently dimming the world s regard likewise seemed to dim its sense of the probity of its deceased head and though this as some thought did not speak well for the world yet it happened in this case as in others that though the world may for a time seem insensible to that merit which lies under a cloud yet sooner or later it always renders honor where honor is due for upon the death of the widow the freemen of Marietta as a tribute of respect for China Aster and an expression of their conviction of his high moral worth passed a resolution that until they attained maturity his children should be considered the town s guests No mere verbal compliment like those of some public bodies for on the same day the orphans were officially installed in that hospitable edifice where their worthy grandfather the town s guest before them had breathed his last breath But sometimes honor maybe paid to the memory of an honest man and still his mound remain without a monument Not so however with the candle maker At an early day Plain Talk had procured a plain stone and was digesting in his mind what pithy word or two to place upon it when there was discovered in China Aster s otherwise empty wallet an epitaph written probably in one of those disconsolate hours attended with more or less mental aberration perhaps so frequent with him for some months prior to his end A memorandum on the back expressed the wish that it might be placed over his grave Though with the sentiment of the epitaph Plain Talk did not disagree he himself being at times of a hypochondriac turn at least so many said yet the language struck him as too much drawn out so after consultation with Old Prudence he decided upon making use of the epitaph yet not without verbal retrenchments And though when these were made the thing still appeared wordy to him nevertheless thinking that since a dead man was to be spoken about it was but just to let him speak for himself especially when he spoke sincerely and when by so doing the more salutary lesson would be given he had the retrenched inscription chiseled as follows upon the stone HERE LIE THE REMAINS OF CHINA ASTER THE CANDLE MAKER WHOSE CAREER WAS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRUTH OF SCRIPTURE AS FOUND IN THE SOBER PHILOSOPHY OF SOLOMON THE WISE FOR HE WAS RUINED BY ALLOWING HIMSELF TO BE PERSUADED AGAINST HIS BETTER SENSE INTO THE FREE INDULGENCE OF CONFIDENCE AND AN ARDENTLY BRIGHT VIEW OF LIFE TO THE EXCLUSION OF THAT COUNSEL WHICH COMES BY HEEDING THE OPPOSITE VIEW This inscription raised some talk in the town and was rather severely criticised by the capitalist one of a very cheerful turn who had secured his loan to China Aster by the mortgage and though it also proved obnoxious to the man who in town meeting had first moved for the compliment to China Aster s memory and indeed was deemed by him a sort of slur upon the candle maker to that degree that he refused to believe that the candle maker himself had composed it charging Old Plain Talk with the authorship alleging that the internal evidence showed that none but that veteran old croaker could have penned such a jeremiade yet for all this the stone stood In everything of course Old Plain Talk was seconded by Old Prudence who one day going to the grave yard in great coat and over shoes for though it was a sunshiny morning he thought that owing to heavy dews dampness might lurk in the ground long stood before the stone sharply leaning over on his staff spectacles on nose spelling out the epitaph word by word and afterwards meeting Old Plain Talk in the street gave a great rap with his stick and said Friend Plain Talk that epitaph will do very well Nevertheless one short sentence is wanting Upon which Plain Talk said it was too late the chiseled words being so arranged after the usual manner of such inscriptions that nothing could be interlined Then said Old Prudence I will put it in the shape of a postscript Accordingly with the approbation of Old Plain Talk he had the following words chiseled at the left hand corner of the stone and pretty low down The root of all was a friendly loan CHAPTER XLI ENDING WITH A RUPTURE OF THE HYPOTHESIS With what heart cried Frank still in character have you told me this story A story I can no way approve for its moral if accepted would drain me of all reliance upon my last stay and therefore of my last courage in life For what was that bright view of China Aster but a cheerful trust that if he but kept up a brave heart worked hard and ever hoped for the best all at last would go well If your purpose Charlie in telling me this story was to pain me and keenly you have succeeded but if it was to destroy my last confidence I praise God you have not Confidence cried Charlie who on his side seemed with his whole heart to enter into the spirit of the thing what has confidence to do with the matter That moral of the story which I am for commending to you is this the folly on both sides of a friend s helping a friend For was not that loan of Orchis to China Aster the first step towards their estrangement And did it not bring about what in effect was the enmity of Orchis I tell you Frank true friendship like other precious things is not rashly to be meddled with And what more meddlesome between friends than a loan A regular marplot For how can you help that the helper must turn out a creditor And creditor and friend can they ever be one no not in the most lenient case since out of lenity to forego one s claim is less to be a friendly creditor than to cease to be a creditor at all But it will not do to rely upon this lenity no not in the best man for the best man as the worst is subject to all mortal contingencies He may travel he may marry he may join the Come Outers or some equally untoward school or sect not to speak of other things that more or less tend to new cast the character And were there nothing else who shall answer for his digestion upon which so much depends But Charlie dear Charlie Nay wait You have hearkened to my story in vain if you do not see that however indulgent and right minded I may seem to you now that is no guarantee for the future And into the power of that uncertain personality which through the mutability of my humanity I may hereafter become should not common sense dissuade you my dear Frank from putting yourself Consider Would you in your present need be willing to accept a loan from a friend securing him by a mortgage on your homestead and do so knowing that you had no reason to feel satisfied that the mortgage might not eventually be transferred into the hands of a foe Yet the difference between this man and that man is not so great as the difference between what the same man be to day and what he may be in days to come For there is no bent of heart or turn of thought which any man holds by virtue of an unalterable nature or will Even those feelings and opinions deemed most identical with eternal right and truth it is not impossible but that as personal persuasions they may in reality be but the result of some chance tip of Fate s elbow in throwing her dice For not to go into the first seeds of things and passing by the accident of parentage predisposing to this or that habit of mind descend below these and tell me if you change this man s experiences or that man s books will wisdom go surety for his unchanged convictions As particular food begets particular dreams so particular experiences or books particular feelings or beliefs I will hear nothing of that fine babble about development and its laws there is no development in opinion and feeling but the developments of time and tide You may deem all this talk idle Frank but conscience bids me show you how fundamental the reasons for treating you as I do But Charlie dear Charlie what new notions are these I thought that man was no poor drifting weed of the universe as you phrased it that if so minded he could have a will a way a thought and a heart of his own But now you have turned everything upside down again with an inconsistency that amazes and shocks me Inconsistency Bah There speaks the ventriloquist again sighed Frank in bitterness Illy pleased it may be by this repetition of an allusion little flattering to his originality however much so to his docility the disciple sought to carry it off by exclaiming Yes I turn over day and night with indefatigable pains the sublime pages of my master and unfortunately for you my dear friend I find nothing there that leads me to think otherwise than I do But enough in this matter the experience of China Aster teaches a moral more to the point than anything Mark Winsome can offer or I either I cannot think so Charlie for neither am I China Aster nor do I stand in his position The loan to China Aster was to extend his business with the loan I seek is to relieve my necessities Your dress my dear Frank is respectable your cheek is not gaunt Why talk of necessities when nakedness and starvation beget the only real necessities But I need relief Charlie and so sorely that I now conjure you to forget that I was ever your friend while I apply to you only as a fellow being whom surely you will not turn away That I will not Take off your hat bow over to the ground and supplicate an alms of me in the way of London streets and you shall not be a sturdy beggar in vain But no man drops pennies into the hat of a friend let me tell you If you turn beggar then for the honor of noble friendship I turn stranger Enough cried the other rising and with a toss of his shoulders seeming disdainfully to throw off the character he had assumed Enough I have had my fill of the philosophy of Mark Winsome as put into action And moonshiny as it in theory may be yet a very practical philosophy it turns out in effect as he himself engaged I should find But miserable for my race should I be if I thought he spoke truth when he claimed for proof of the soundness of his system that the study of it tended to much the same formation of character with the experiences of the world Apt disciple Why wrinkle the brow and waste the oil both of life and the lamp only to turn out a head kept cool by the under ice of the heart What your illustrious magian has taught you any poor old broken down heart shrunken dandy might have lisped Pray leave me and with you take the last dregs of your inhuman philosophy And here take this shilling and at the first wood landing buy yourself a few chips to warm the frozen natures of you and your philosopher by With these words and a grand scorn the cosmopolitan turned on his heel leaving his companion at a loss to determine where exactly the fictitious character had been dropped and the real one if any resumed If any because with pointed meaning there occurred to him as he gazed after the cosmopolitan these familiar lines All the world s a stage And all the men and women merely players Who have their exits and their entrances And one man in his time plays many parts CHAPTER XLII UPON THE HEEL OF THE LAST SCENE THE COSMOPOLITAN ENTERS THE BARBER S SHOP A BENEDICTION ON HIS LIPS Bless you barber Now owing to the lateness of the hour the barber had been all alone until within the ten minutes last passed when finding himself rather dullish company to himself he thought he would have a good time with Souter John and Tam O Shanter otherwise called Somnus and Morpheus two very good fellows though one was not very bright and the other an arrant rattlebrain who though much listened to by some no wise man would believe under oath In short with back presented to the glare of his lamps and so to the door the honest barber was taking what are called cat naps and dreaming in his chair so that upon suddenly hearing the benediction above pronounced in tones not unangelic starting up half awake he stared before him but saw nothing for the stranger stood behind What with cat naps dreams and bewilderments therefore the voice seemed a sort of spiritual manifestation to him so that for the moment he stood all agape eyes fixed and one arm in the air Why barber are you reaching up to catch birds there with salt Ah turning round disenchanted it is only a man then Only a man As if to be but a man were nothing But don t be too sure what I am You call me man just as the townsfolk called the angels who in man s form came to Lot s house just as the Jew rustics called the devils who in man s form haunted the tombs You can conclude nothing absolute from the human form barber But I can conclude something from that sort of talk with that sort of dress shrewdly thought the barber eying him with regained self possession and not without some latent touch of apprehension at being alone with him What was passing in his mind seemed divined by the other who now more rationally and gravely and as if he expected it should be attended to said Whatever else you may conclude upon it is my desire that you conclude to give me a good shave at the same time loosening his neck cloth Are you competent to a good shave barber No broker more so sir answered the barber whom the business like proposition instinctively made confine to business ends his views of the visitor Broker What has a broker to do with lather A broker I have always understood to be a worthy dealer in certain papers and metals He he taking him now for some dry sort of joker whose jokes he being a customer it might be as well to appreciate he he You understand well enough sir Take this seat sir laying his hand on a great stuffed chair high backed and high armed crimson covered and raised on a sort of dais and which seemed but to lack a canopy and quarterings to make it in aspect quite a throne take this seat sir Thank you sitting down and now pray explain that about the broker But look look what s this suddenly rising and pointing with his long pipe towards a gilt notification swinging among colored fly papers from the ceiling like a tavern sign No Trust No trust means distrust distrust means no confidence Barber turning upon him excitedly what fell suspiciousness prompts this scandalous confession My life stamping his foot if but to tell a dog that you have no confidence in him be matter for affront to the dog what an insult to take that way the whole haughty race of man by the beard By my heart sir but at least you are valiant backing the spleen of Thersites with the pluck of Agamemnon Your sort of talk sir is not exactly in my line said the barber rather ruefully being now again hopeless of his customer and not without return of uneasiness not in my line sir he emphatically repeated But the taking of mankind by the nose is a habit barber which I sadly fear has insensibly bred in you a disrespect for man For how indeed may respectful conceptions of him coexist with the perpetual habit of taking him by the nose But tell me though I too clearly see the import of your notification I do not as yet perceive the object What is it Now you speak a little in my line sir said the barber not unrelieved at this return to plain talk that notification I find very useful sparing me much work which would not pay Yes I lost a good deal off and on before putting that up gratefully glancing towards it But what is its object Surely you don t mean to say in so many words that you have no confidence For instance now flinging aside his neck cloth throwing back his blouse and reseating himself on the tonsorial throne at sight of which proceeding the barber mechanically filled a cup with hot water from a copper vessel over a spirit lamp for instance now suppose I say to you Barber my dear barber unhappily I have no small change by me to night but shave me and depend upon your money to morrow suppose I should say that now you would put trust in me wouldn t you You would have confidence Seeing that it is you sir with complaisance replied the barber now mixing the lather seeing that it is you sir I won t answer that question No need to Of course of course in that view But as a supposition you would have confidence in me wouldn t you Why yes yes Then why that sign Ah sir all people ain t like you was the smooth reply at the same time as if smoothly to close the debate beginning smoothly to apply the lather which operation however was by a motion protested against by the subject but only out of a desire to rejoin which was done in these words All people ain t like me Then I must be either better or worse than most people Worse you could not mean no barber you could not mean that hardly that It remains then that you think me better than most people But that I ain t vain enough to believe though from vanity I confess I could never yet by my best wrestlings entirely free myself nor indeed to be frank am I at bottom over anxious to this same vanity barber being so harmless so useful so comfortable so pleasingly preposterous a passion Very true sir and upon my honor sir you talk very well But the lather is getting a little cold sir Better cold lather barber than a cold heart Why that cold sign Ah I don t wonder you try to shirk the confession You feel in your soul how ungenerous a hint is there And yet barber now that I look into your eyes which somehow speak to me of the mother that must have so often looked into them before me I dare say though you may not think it that the spirit of that notification is not one with your nature For look now setting business views aside regarding the thing in an abstract light in short supposing a case barber supposing I say you see a stranger his face accidentally averted but his visible part very respectable looking what now barber I put it to your conscience to your charity what would be your impression of that man in a moral point of view Being in a signal sense a stranger would you for that signally set him down for a knave Certainly not sir by no means cried the barber humanely resentful You would upon the face of him Hold sir said the barber nothing about the face you remember sir that is out of sight I forgot that Well then you would upon the back of him conclude him to be not improbably some worthy sort of person in short an honest man wouldn t you Not unlikely I should sir Well now don t be so impatient with your brush barber suppose that honest man meet you by night in some dark corner of the boat where his face would still remain unseen asking you to trust him for a shave how then Wouldn t trust him sir But is not an honest man to be trusted Why why yes sir There don t you see now See what asked the disconcerted barber rather vexedly Why you stand self contradicted barber don t you No doggedly Barber gravely and after a pause of concern the enemies of our race have a saying that insincerity is the most universal and inveterate vice of man the lasting bar to real amelioration whether of individuals or of the world Don t you now barber by your stubbornness on this occasion give color to such a calumny Hity tity cried the barber losing patience and with it respect stubbornness Then clattering round the brush in the cup Will you be shaved or won t you Barber I will be shaved and with pleasure but pray don t raise your voice that way Why now if you go through life gritting your teeth in that fashion what a comfortless time you will have I take as much comfort in this world as you or any other man cried the barber whom the other s sweetness of temper seemed rather to exasperate than soothe To resent the imputation of anything like unhappiness I have often observed to be peculiar to certain orders of men said the other pensively and half to himself just as to be indifferent to that imputation from holding happiness but for a secondary good and inferior grace I have observed to be equally peculiar to other kinds of men Pray barber innocently looking up which think you is the superior creature All this sort of talk cried the barber still unmollified is as I told you once before not in my line In a few minutes I shall shut up this shop Will you be shaved Shave away barber What hinders turning up his face like a flower The shaving began and proceeded in silence till at length it became necessary to prepare to relather a little affording an opportunity for resuming the subject which on one side was not let slip Barber with a kind of cautious kindliness feeling his way barber now have a little patience with me do trust me I wish not to offend I have been thinking over that supposed case of the man with the averted face and I cannot rid my mind of the impression that by your opposite replies to my questions at the time you showed yourself much of a piece with a good many other men that is you have confidence and then again you have none Now what I would ask is do you think it sensible standing for a sensible man one foot on confidence and the other on suspicion Don t you think barber that you ought to elect Don t you think consistency requires that you should either say I have confidence in all men and take down your notification or else say I suspect all men and keep it up This dispassionate if not deferential way of putting the case did not fail to impress the barber and proportionately conciliate him Likewise from its pointedness it served to make him thoughtful for instead of going to the copper vessel for more water as he had purposed he halted half way towards it and after a pause cup in hand said Sir I hope you would not do me injustice I don t say and can t say and wouldn t say that I suspect all men but I do say that strangers are not to be trusted and so pointing up to the sign no trust But look now I beg barber rejoined the other deprecatingly not presuming too much upon the barber s changed temper look now to say that strangers are not to be trusted does not that imply something like saying that mankind is not to be trusted for the mass of mankind are they not necessarily strangers to each individual man Come come my friend winningly you are no Timon to hold the mass of mankind untrustworthy Take down your notification it is misanthropical much the same sign that Timon traced with charcoal on the forehead of a skull stuck over his cave Take it down barber take it down to night Trust men Just try the experiment of trusting men for this one little trip Come now I m a philanthropist and will insure you against losing a cent The barber shook his head dryly and answered Sir you must excuse me I have a family CHAPTER XLIII VERY CHARMING So you are a philanthropist sir added the barber with an illuminated look that accounts then for all Very odd sort of man the philanthropist You are the second one sir I have seen Very odd sort of man indeed the philanthropist Ah sir again meditatively stirring in the shaving cup I sadly fear lest you philanthropists know better what goodness is than what men are Then eying him as if he were some strange creature behind cage bars So you are a philanthropist sir I am Philanthropos and love mankind And what is more than you do barber I trust them Here the barber casually recalled to his business would have replenished his shaving cup but finding now that on his last visit to the water vessel he had not replaced it over the lamp he did so now and while waiting for it to heat again became almost as sociable as if the heating water were meant for whisky punch and almost as pleasantly garrulous as the pleasant barbers in romances Sir said he taking a throne beside his customer for in a row there were three thrones on the dais as for the three kings of Cologne those patron saints of the barber sir you say you trust men Well I suppose I might share some of your trust were it not for this trade that I follow too much letting me in behind the scenes I think I understand with a saddened look and much the same thing I have heard from persons in pursuits different from yours from the lawyer from the congressman from the editor not to mention others each with a strange kind of melancholy vanity claiming for his vocation the distinction of affording the surest inlets to the conviction that man is no better than he should be All of which testimony if reliable would by mutual corroboration justify some disturbance in a good man s mind But no no it is a mistake all a mistake True sir very true assented the barber Glad to hear that brightening up Not so fast sir said the barber I agree with you in thinking that the lawyer and the congressman and the editor are in error but only in so far as each claims peculiar facilities for the sort of knowledge in question because you see sir the truth is that every trade or pursuit which brings one into contact with the facts sir such trade or pursuit is equally an avenue to those facts How exactly is that Why sir in my opinion and for the last twenty years I have at odd times turned the matter over some in my mind he who comes to know man will not remain in ignorance of man I think I am not rash in saying that am I sir Barber you talk like an oracle obscurely barber obscurely Well sir with some self complacency the barber has always been held an oracle but as for the obscurity that I don t admit But pray now by your account what precisely may be this mysterious knowledge gained in your trade I grant you indeed as before hinted that your trade imposing on you the necessity of functionally tweaking the noses of mankind is in that respect unfortunate very much so nevertheless a well regulated imagination should be proof even to such a provocation to improper conceits But what I want to learn from you barber is how does the mere handling of the outside of men s heads lead you to distrust the inside of their hearts What sir to say nothing more can one be forever dealing in macassar oil hair dyes cosmetics false moustaches wigs and toupees and still believe that men are wholly what they look to be What think you sir are a thoughtful barber s reflections when behind a careful curtain he shaves the thin dead stubble off a head and then dismisses it to the world radiant in curling auburn To contrast the shamefaced air behind the curtain the fearful looking forward to being possibly discovered there by a prying acquaintance with the cheerful assurance and challenging pride with which the same man steps forth again a gay deception into the street while some honest shock headed fellow humbly gives him the wall Ah sir they may talk of the courage of truth but my trade teaches me that truth sometimes is sheepish Lies lies sir brave lies are the lions You twist the moral barber you sadly twist it Look now take it this way A modest man thrust out naked into the street would he not be abashed Take him in and clothe him would not his confidence be restored And in either case is any reproach involved Now what is true of the whole holds proportionably true of the part The bald head is a nakedness which the wig is a coat to To feel uneasy at the possibility of the exposure of one s nakedness at top and to feel comforted by the consciousness of having it clothed these feelings instead of being dishonorable to a bold man do in fact but attest a proper respect for himself and his fellows And as for the deception you may as well call the fine roof of a fine chateau a deception since like a fine wig it also is an artificial cover to the head and equally in the common eye decorates the wearer I have confuted you my dear barber I have confounded you Pardon said the barber but I do not see that you have His coat and his roof no man pretends to palm off as a part of himself but the bald man palms off hair not his for his own Not his barber If he have fairly purchased his hair the law will protect him in its ownership even against the claims of the head on which it grew But it cannot be that you believe what you say barber you talk merely for the humor I could not think so of you as to suppose that you would contentedly deal in the impostures you condemn Ah sir I must live And can t you do that without sinning against your conscience as you believe Take up some other calling Wouldn t mend the matter much sir Do you think then barber that in a certain point all the trades and callings of men are much on a par Fatal indeed raising his hand inexpressibly dreadful the trade of the barber if to such conclusions it necessarily leads Barber eying him not without emotion you appear to me not so much a misbeliever as a man misled Now let me set you on the right track let me restore you to trust in human nature and by no other means than the very trade that has brought you to suspect it You mean sir you would have me try the experiment of taking down that notification again pointing to it with his brush but dear me while I sit chatting here the water boils over With which words and such a well pleased sly snug expression as they say some men have when they think their little stratagem has succeeded he hurried to the copper vessel and soon had his cup foaming up with white bubbles as if it were a mug of new ale Meantime the other would have fain gone on with the discourse but the cunning barber lathered him with so generous a brush so piled up the foam on him that his face looked like the yeasty crest of a billow and vain to think of talking under it as for a drowning priest in the sea to exhort his fellow sinners on a raft Nothing would do but he must keep his mouth shut Doubtless the interval was not in a meditative way unimproved for upon the traces of the operation being at last removed the cosmopolitan rose and for added refreshment washed his face and hands and having generally readjusted himself began at last addressing the barber in a manner different singularly so from his previous one Hard to say exactly what the manner was any more than to hint it was a sort of magical in a benign way not wholly unlike the manner fabled or otherwise of certain creatures in nature which have the power of persuasive fascination the power of holding another creature by the button of the eye as it were despite the serious disinclination and indeed earnest protest of the victim With this manner the conclusion of the matter was not out of keeping for in the end all argument and expostulation proved vain the barber being irresistibly persuaded to agree to try for the remainder of the present trip the experiment of trusting men as both phrased it True to save his credit as a free agent he was loud in averring that it was only for the novelty of the thing that he so agreed and he required the other as before volunteered to go security to him against any loss that might ensue but still the fact remained that he engaged to trust men a thing he had before said he would not do at least not unreservedly Still the more to save his credit he now insisted upon it as a last point that the agreement should be put in black and white especially the security part The other made no demur pen ink and paper were provided and grave as any notary the cosmopolitan sat down but ere taking the pen glanced up at the notification and said First down with that sign barber Timon s sign there down with it This being in the agreement was done though a little reluctantly with an eye to the future the sign being carefully put away in a drawer Now then for the writing said the cosmopolitan squaring himself Ah with a sigh I shall make a poor lawyer I fear Ain t used you see barber to a business which ignoring the principle of honor holds no nail fast till clinched Strange barber taking up the blank paper that such flimsy stuff as this should make such strong hawsers vile hawsers too Barber starting up I won t put it in black and white It were a reflection upon our joint honor I will take your word and you shall take mine But your memory may be none of the best sir Well for you on your side to have it in black and white just for a memorandum like you know That indeed Yes and it would help your memory too wouldn t it barber Yours on your side being a little weak too I dare say Ah barber how ingenious we human beings are and how kindly we reciprocate each other s little delicacies don t we What better proof now that we are kind considerate fellows with responsive fellow feelings eh barber But to business Let me see What s your name barber William Cream sir Pondering a moment he began to write and after some corrections leaned back and read aloud the following AGREEMENT Between FRANK GOODMAN Philanthropist and Citizen of the World and WILLIAM CREAM Barber of the Mississippi steamer Fidele The first hereby agrees to make good to the last any loss that may come from his trusting mankind in the way of his vocation for the residue of the present trip PROVIDED that William Cream keep out of sight for the given term his notification of NO TRUST and by no other mode convey any the least hint or intimation tending to discourage men from soliciting trust from him in the way of his vocation for the time above specified but on the contrary he do by all proper and reasonable words gestures manners and looks evince a perfect confidence in all men especially strangers otherwise this agreement to be void Done in good faith this first day of April eighteen at a quarter to twelve o clock P M in the shop of said William Cream on board the said boat Fidele There barber will that do That will do said the barber only now put down your name Both signatures being affixed the question was started by the barber who should have custody of the instrument which point however he settled for himself by proposing that both should go together to the captain and give the document into his hands the barber hinting that this would be a safe proceeding because the captain was necessarily a party disinterested and what was more could not from the nature of the present case make anything by a breach of trust All of which was listened to with some surprise and concern Why barber said the cosmopolitan this don t show the right spirit for me I have confidence in the captain purely because he is a man but he shall have nothing to do with our affair for if you have no confidence in me barber I have in you There keep the paper yourself handing it magnanimously Very good said the barber and now nothing remains but for me to receive the cash Though the mention of that word or any of its singularly numerous equivalents in serious neighborhood to a requisition upon one s purse is attended with a more or less noteworthy effect upon the human countenance producing in many an abrupt fall of it in others a writhing and screwing up of the features to a point not undistressing to behold in some attended with a blank pallor and fatal consternation yet no trace of any of these symptoms was visible upon the countenance of the cosmopolitan notwithstanding nothing could be more sudden and unexpected than the barber s demand You speak of cash barber pray in what connection In a nearer one sir answered the barber less blandly than I thought the man with the sweet voice stood who wanted me to trust him once for a shave on the score of being a sort of thirteenth cousin Indeed and what did you say to him I said Thank you sir but I don t see the connection How could you so unsweetly answer one with a sweet voice Because I recalled what the son of Sirach says in the True Book An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips and so I did what the son of Sirach advises in such cases I believed not his many words What barber do you say that such cynical sort of things are in the True Book by which of course you mean the Bible Yes and plenty more to the same effect Read the Book of Proverbs That s strange now barber for I never happen to have met with those passages you cite Before I go to bed this night I ll inspect the Bible I saw on the cabin table to day But mind you mustn t quote the True Book that way to people coming in here it would be impliedly a violation of the contract But you don t know how glad I feel that you have for one while signed off all that sort of thing No sir not unless you down with the cash Cash again What do you mean Why in this paper here you engage sir to insure me against a certain loss and Certain Is it so certain you are going to lose Why that way of taking the word may not be amiss but I didn t mean it so I meant a certain loss you understand a CERTAIN loss that is to say a certain loss Now then sir what use your mere writing and saying you will insure me unless beforehand you place in my hands a money pledge sufficient to that end I see the material pledge Yes and I will put it low say fifty dollars Now what sort of a beginning is this You barber for a given time engage to trust man to put confidence in men and for your first step make a demand implying no confidence in the very man you engage with But fifty dollars is nothing and I would let you have it cheerfully only I unfortunately happen to have but little change with me just now But you have money in your trunk though To be sure But you see in fact barber you must be consistent No I won t let you have the money now I won t let you violate the inmost spirit of our contract that way So good night and I will see you again Stay sir humming and hawing you have forgotten something Handkerchief gloves No forgotten nothing Good night Stay sir the the shaving Ah I did forget that But now that it strikes me I shan t pay you at present Look at your agreement you must trust Tut against loss you hold the guarantee Good night my dear barber With which words he sauntered off leaving the barber in a maze staring after But it holding true in fascination as in natural philosophy that nothing can act where it is not so the barber was not long now in being restored to his self possession and senses the first evidence of which perhaps was that drawing forth his notification from the drawer he put it back where it belonged while as for the agreement that he tore up which he felt the more free to do from the impression that in all human probability he would never again see the person who had drawn it Whether that impression proved well founded or not does not appear But in after days telling the night s adventure to his friends the worthy barber always spoke of his queer customer as the man charmer as certain East Indians are called snake charmers and all his friends united in thinking him QUITE AN ORIGINAL CHAPTER XLIV IN WHICH THE LAST THREE WORDS OF THE LAST CHAPTER ARE MADE THE TEXT OF DISCOURSE WHICH WILL BE SURE OF RECEIVING MORE OR LESS ATTENTION FROM THOSE READERS WHO DO NOT SKIP IT Quite an original A phrase we fancy rather oftener used by the young or the unlearned or the untraveled than by the old or the well read or the man who has made the grand tour Certainly the sense of originality exists at its highest in an infant and probably at its lowest in him who has completed the circle of the sciences As for original characters in fiction a grateful reader will on meeting with one keep the anniversary of that day True we sometimes hear of an author who at one creation produces some two or three score such characters it may be possible But they can hardly be original in the sense that Hamlet is or Don Quixote or Milton s Satan That is to say they are not in a thorough sense original at all They are novel or singular or striking or captivating or all four at once More likely they are what are called odd characters but for that are no more original than what is called an odd genius in his way is But if original whence came they Or where did the novelist pick them up Where does any novelist pick up any character For the most part in town to be sure Every great town is a kind of man show where the novelist goes for his stock just as the agriculturist goes to the cattle show for his But in the one fair new species of quadrupeds are hardly more rare than in the other are new species of characters that is original ones Their rarity may still the more appear from this that while characters merely singular imply but singular forms so to speak original ones truly so imply original instincts In short a due conception of what is to be held for this sort of personage in fiction would make him almost as much of a prodigy there as in real history is a new law giver a revolutionizing philosopher or the founder of a new religion In nearly all the original characters loosely accounted such in works of invention there is discernible something prevailingly local or of the age which circumstance of itself would seem to invalidate the claim judged by the principles here suggested Furthermore if we consider what is popularly held to entitle characters in fiction to being deemed original is but something personal confined to itself The character sheds not its characteristic on its surroundings whereas the original character essentially such is like a revolving Drummond light raying away from itself all round it everything is lit by it everything starts up to it mark how it is with Hamlet so that in certain minds there follows upon the adequate conception of such a character an effect in its way akin to that which in Genesis attends upon the beginning of things For much the same reason that there is but one planet to one orbit so can there be but one such original character to one work of invention Two would conflict to chaos In this view to say that there are more than one to a book is good presumption there is none at all But for new singular striking odd eccentric and all sorts of entertaining and instructive characters a good fiction may be full of them To produce such characters an author beside other things must have seen much and seen through much to produce but one original character he must have had much luck There would seem but one point in common between this sort of phenomenon in fiction and all other sorts it cannot be born in the author s imagination it being as true in literature as in zoology that all life is from the egg In the endeavor to show if possible the impropriety of the phrase Quite an Original as applied by the barber s friends we have at unawares been led into a dissertation bordering upon the prosy perhaps upon the smoky If so the best use the smoke can be turned to will be by retiring under cover of it in good trim as may be to the story CHAPTER XLV THE COSMOPOLITAN INCREASES IN SERIOUSNESS In the middle of the gentleman s cabin burned a solar lamp swung from the ceiling and whose shade of ground glass was all round fancifully variegated in transparency with the image of a horned altar from which flames rose alternate with the figure of a robed man his head encircled by a halo The light of this lamp after dazzlingly striking on marble snow white and round the slab of a centre table beneath on all sides went rippling off with ever diminishing distinctness till like circles from a stone dropped in water the rays died dimly away in the furthest nook of the place Here and there true to their place but not to their function swung other lamps barren planets which had either gone out from exhaustion or been extinguished by such occupants of berths as the light annoyed or who wanted to sleep not see By a perverse man in a berth not remote the remaining lamp would have been extinguished as well had not a steward forbade saying that the commands of the captain required it to be kept burning till the natural light of day should come to relieve it This steward who like many in his vocation was apt to be a little free spoken at times had been provoked by the man s pertinacity to remind him not only of the sad consequences which might upon occasion ensue from the cabin being left in darkness but also of the circumstance that in a place full of strangers to show one s self anxious to produce darkness there such an anxiety was to say the least not becoming So the lamp last survivor of many burned on inwardly blessed by those in some berths and inwardly execrated by those in others Keeping his lone vigils beneath his lone lamp which lighted his book on the table sat a clean comely old man his head snowy as the marble and a countenance like that which imagination ascribes to good Simeon when having at last beheld the Master of Faith he blessed him and departed in peace From his hale look of greenness in winter and his hands ingrained with the tan less apparently of the present summer than of accumulated ones past the old man seemed a well to do farmer happily dismissed after a thrifty life of activity from the fields to the fireside one of those who at three score and ten are fresh hearted as at fifteen to whom seclusion gives a boon more blessed than knowledge and at last sends them to heaven untainted by the world because ignorant of it just as a countryman putting up at a London inn and never stirring out of it as a sight seer will leave London at last without once being lost in its fog or soiled by its mud Redolent from the barber s shop as any bridegroom tripping to the bridal chamber might come and by his look of cheeriness seeming to dispense a sort of morning through the night in came the cosmopolitan but marking the old man and how he was occupied he toned himself down and trod softly and took a seat on the other side of the table and said nothing Still there was a kind of waiting expression about him Sir said the old man after looking up puzzled at him a moment sir said he one would think this was a coffee house and it was war time and I had a newspaper here with great news and the only copy to be had you sit there looking at me so eager And so you have good news there sir the very best of good news Too good to be true here came from one of the curtained berths Hark said the cosmopolitan Some one talks in his sleep Yes said the old man and you you seem to be talking in a dream Why speak you sir of news and all that when you must see this is a book I have here the Bible not a newspaper I know that and when you are through with it but not a moment sooner I will thank you for it It belongs to the boat I believe a present from a society Oh take it take it Nay sir I did not mean to touch you at all I simply stated the fact in explanation of my waiting here nothing more Read on sir or you will distress me This courtesy was not without effect Removing his spectacles and saying he had about finished his chapter the old man kindly presented the volume which was received with thanks equally kind After reading for some minutes until his expression merged from attentiveness into seriousness and from that into a kind of pain the cosmopolitan slowly laid down the book and turning to the old man who thus far had been watching him with benign curiosity said Can you my aged friend resolve me a doubt a disturbing doubt There are doubts sir replied the old man with a changed countenance there are doubts sir which if man have them it is not man that can solve them True but look now what my doubt is I am one who thinks well of man I love man I have confidence in man But what was told me not a half hour since I was told that I would find it written Believe not his many words an enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips and also I was told that I would find a good deal more to the same effect and all in this book I could not think it and coming here to look for myself what do I read Not only just what was quoted but also as was engaged more to the same purpose such as this With much communication he will tempt thee he will smile upon thee and speak thee fair and say What wantest thou If thou be for his profit he will use thee he will make thee bear and will not be sorry for it Observe and take good heed When thou hearest these things awake in thy sleep Who s that describing the confidence man here came from the berth again Awake in his sleep sure enough ain t he said the cosmopolitan again looking off in surprise Same voice as before ain t it Strange sort of dreamy man that Which is his berth pray Never mind him sir said the old man anxiously but tell me truly did you indeed read from the book just now I did with changed air and gall and wormwood it is to me a truster in man to me a philanthropist Why moved you don t mean to say that what you repeated is really down there Man and boy I have read the good book this seventy years and don t remember seeing anything like that Let me see it rising earnestly and going round to him There it is and there and there turning over the leaves and pointing to the sentences one by one there all down in the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach Ah cried the old man brightening up now I know Look turning the leaves forward and back till all the Old Testament lay flat on one side and all the New Testament flat on the other while in his fingers he supported vertically the portion between look sir all this to the right is certain truth and all this to the left is certain truth but all I hold in my hand here is apocrypha Apocrypha Yes and there s the word in black and white pointing to it And what says the word It says as much as not warranted for what do college men say of anything of that sort They say it is apocryphal The word itself I ve heard from the pulpit implies something of uncertain credit So if your disturbance be raised from aught in this apocrypha again taking up the pages in that case think no more of it for it s apocrypha What s that about the Apocalypse here a third time came from the berth He s seeing visions now ain t he said the cosmopolitan once more looking in the direction of the interruption But sir resuming I cannot tell you how thankful I am for your reminding me about the apocrypha here For the moment its being such escaped me Fact is when all is bound up together it s sometimes confusing The uncanonical part should be bound distinct And now that I think of it how well did those learned doctors who rejected for us this whole book of Sirach I never read anything so calculated to destroy man s confidence in man This son of Sirach even says I saw it but just now Take heed of thy friends not observe thy seeming friends thy hypocritical friends thy false friends but thy friends thy real friends that is to say not the truest friend in the world is to be implicitly trusted Can Rochefoucault equal that I should not wonder if his view of human nature like Machiavelli s was taken from this Son of Sirach And to call it wisdom the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach Wisdom indeed What an ugly thing wisdom must be Give me the folly that dimples the cheek say I rather than the wisdom that curdles the blood But no no it ain t wisdom it s apocrypha as you say sir For how can that be trustworthy that teaches distrust I tell you what it is here cried the same voice as before only more in less of mockery if you two don t know enough to sleep don t be keeping wiser men awake And if you want to know what wisdom is go find it under your blankets Wisdom cried another voice with a brogue arrah and is t wisdom the two geese are gabbling about all this while To bed with ye ye divils and don t be after burning your fingers with the likes of wisdom We must talk lower said the old man I fear we have annoyed these good people I should be sorry if wisdom annoyed any one said the other but we will lower our voices as you say To resume taking the thing as I did can you be surprised at my uneasiness in reading passages so charged with the spirit of distrust No sir I am not surprised said the old man then added from what you say I see you are something of my way of thinking you think that to distrust the creature is a kind of distrusting of the Creator Well my young friend what is it This is rather late for you to be about What do you want of me These questions were put to a boy in the fragment of an old linen coat bedraggled and yellow who coming in from the deck barefooted on the soft carpet had been unheard All pointed and fluttering the rags of the little fellow s red flannel shirt mixed with those of his yellow coat flamed about him like the painted flames in the robes of a victim in auto da fe His face too wore such a polish of seasoned grime that his sloe eyes sparkled from out it like lustrous sparks in fresh coal He was a juvenile peddler or marchand as the polite French might have called him of travelers conveniences and having no allotted sleeping place had in his wanderings about the boat spied through glass doors the two in the cabin and late though it was thought it might never be too much so for turning a penny Among other things he carried a curious affair a miniature mahogany door hinged to its frame and suitably furnished in all respects but one which will shortly appear This little door he now meaningly held before the old man who after staring at it a while said Go thy ways with thy toys child Now may I never get so old and wise as that comes to laughed the boy through his grime and by so doing disclosing leopard like teeth like those of Murillo s wild beggar boy s The divils are laughing now are they here came the brogue from the berth What do the divils find to laugh about in wisdom begorrah To bed with ye ye divils and no more of ye You see child you have disturbed that person said the old man you mustn t laugh any more Ah now said the cosmopolitan don t pray say that don t let him think that poor Laughter is persecuted for a fool in this world Well said the old man to the boy you must at any rate speak very low Yes that wouldn t be amiss perhaps said the cosmopolitan but my fine fellow you were about saying something to my aged friend here what was it Oh with a lowered voice coolly opening and shutting his little door only this when I kept a toy stand at the fair in Cincinnati last month I sold more than one old man a child s rattle No doubt of it said the old man I myself often buy such things for my little grandchildren But these old men I talk of were old bachelors The old man stared at him a moment then whispering to the cosmopolitan Strange boy this sort of simple ain t he Don t know much hey Not much said the boy or I wouldn t be so ragged Why child what sharp ears you have exclaimed the old man If they were duller I would hear less ill of myself said the boy You seem pretty wise my lad said the cosmopolitan why don t you sell your wisdom and buy a coat Faith said the boy that s what I did to day and this is the coat that the price of my wisdom bought But won t you trade See now it is not the door I want to sell I only carry the door round for a specimen like Look now sir standing the thing up on the table supposing this little door is your state room door well opening it you go in for the night you close your door behind you thus Now is all safe I suppose so child said the old man Of course it is my fine fellow said the cosmopolitan All safe Well Now about two o clock in the morning say a soft handed gentleman comes softly and tries the knob here thus in creeps my soft handed gentleman and hey presto how comes on the soft cash I see I see child said the old man your fine gentleman is a fine thief and there s no lock to your little door to keep him out with which words he peered at it more closely than before Well now again showing his white teeth well now some of you old folks are knowing uns sure enough but now comes the great invention producing a small steel contrivance very simple but ingenious and which being clapped on the inside of the little door secured it as with a bolt There now admiringly holding it off at arm s length there now let that soft handed gentleman come now a softly trying this little knob here and let him keep a trying till he finds his head as soft as his hand Buy the traveler s patent lock sir only twenty five cents Dear me cried the old man this beats printing Yes child I will have one and use it this very night With the phlegm of an old banker pouching the change the boy now turned to the other Sell you one sir Excuse me my fine fellow but I never use such blacksmiths things Those who give the blacksmith most work seldom do said the boy tipping him a wink expressive of a degree of indefinite knowingness not uninteresting to consider in one of his years But the wink was not marked by the old man nor to all appearances by him for whom it was intended Now then said the boy again addressing the old man With your traveler s lock on your door to night you will think yourself all safe won t you I think I will child But how about the window Dear me the window child I never thought of that I must see to that Never you mind about the window said the boy nor to be honor bright about the traveler s lock either though I ain t sorry for selling one do you just buy one of these little jokers producing a number of suspender like objects which he dangled before the old man money belts sir only fifty cents Money belt never heard of such a thing A sort of pocket book said the boy only a safer sort Very good for travelers Oh a pocket book Queer looking pocket books though seems to me Ain t they rather long and narrow for pocket books They go round the waist sir inside said the boy door open or locked wide awake on your feet or fast asleep in your chair impossible to be robbed with a money belt I see I see It would be hard to rob one s money belt And I was told to day the Mississippi is a bad river for pick pockets How much are they Only fifty cents sir I ll take one There Thank ee And now there s a present for ye with which drawing from his breast a batch of little papers he threw one before the old man who looking at it read Counterfeit Detector Very good thing said the boy I give it to all my customers who trade seventy five cents worth best present can be made them Sell you a money belt sir turning to the cosmopolitan Excuse me my fine fellow but I never use that sort of thing my money I carry loose Loose bait ain t bad said the boy look a lie and find the truth don t care about a Counterfeit Detector do ye or is the wind East d ye think Child said the old man in some concern you mustn t sit up any longer it affects your mind there go away go to bed If I had some people s brains to lie on I would said the boy but planks is hard you know Go child go go Yes child yes yes said the boy with which roguish parody by way of conge he scraped back his hard foot on the woven flowers of the carpet much as a mischievous steer in May scrapes back his horny hoof in the pasture and then with a flourish of his hat which like the rest of his tatters was thanks to hard times a belonging beyond his years though not beyond his experience being a grown man s cast off beaver turned and with the air of a young Caffre quitted the place That s a strange boy said the old man looking after him I wonder who s his mother and whether she knows what late hours he keeps The probability is observed the other that his mother does not know But if you remember sir you were saying something when the boy interrupted you with his door So I was Let me see unmindful of his purchases for the moment what now was it What was that I was saying Do you remember Not perfectly sir but if I am not mistaken it was something like this you hoped you did not distrust the creature for that would imply distrust of the Creator Yes that was something like it mechanically and unintelligently letting his eye fall now on his purchases Pray will you put your money in your belt to night It s best ain t it with a slight start Never too late to be cautious Beware of pick pockets is all over the boat Yes and it must have been the Son of Sirach or some other morbid cynic who put them there But that s not to the purpose Since you are minded to it pray sir let me help you about the belt I think that between us we can make a secure thing of it Oh no no no said the old man not unperturbed no no I wouldn t trouble you for the world then nervously folding up the belt and I won t be so impolite as to do it for myself before you either But now that I think of it after a pause carefully taking a little wad from a remote corner of his vest pocket here are two bills they gave me at saint Louis yesterday No doubt they are all right but just to pass time I ll compare them with the Detector here Blessed boy to make me such a present Public benefactor that little boy Laying the Detector square before him on the table he then with something of the air of an officer bringing by the collar a brace of culprits to the bar placed the two bills opposite the Detector upon which the examination began lasting some time prosecuted with no small research and vigilance the forefinger of the right hand proving of lawyer like efficacy in tracing out and pointing the evidence whichever way it might go After watching him a while the cosmopolitan said in a formal voice Well what say you mister Foreman guilty or not guilty Not guilty ain t it I don t know I don t know returned the old man perplexed there s so many marks of all sorts to go by it makes it a kind of uncertain Here now is this bill touching one it looks to be a three dollar bill on the Vicksburgh Trust and Insurance Banking Company Well the Detector says But why in this case care what it says Trust and Insurance What more would you have No but the Detector says among fifty other things that if a good bill it must have thickened here and there into the substance of the paper little wavy spots of red and it says they must have a kind of silky feel being made by the lint of a red silk handkerchief stirred up in the paper maker s vat the paper being made to order for the company Well and is Stay But then it adds that sign is not always to be relied on for some good bills get so worn the red marks get rubbed out And that s the case with my bill here see how old it is or else it s a counterfeit or else I don t see right or else dear dear me I don t know what else to think What a peck of trouble that Detector makes for you now believe me the bill is good don t be so distrustful Proves what I ve always thought that much of the want of confidence in these days is owing to these Counterfeit Detectors you see on every desk and counter Puts people up to suspecting good bills Throw it away I beg if only because of the trouble it breeds you No it s troublesome but I think I ll keep it Stay now here s another sign It says that if the bill is good it must have in one corner mixed in with the vignette the figure of a goose very small indeed all but microscopic and for added precaution like the figure of Napoleon outlined by the tree not observable even if magnified unless the attention is directed to it Now pore over it as I will I can t see this goose Can t see the goose why I can and a famous goose it is There reaching over and pointing to a spot in the vignette I don t see it dear me I don t see the goose Is it a real goose A perfect goose beautiful goose Dear dear I don t see it Then throw that Detector away I say again it only makes you purblind don t you see what a wild goose chase it has led you The bill is good Throw the Detector away No it ain t so satisfactory as I thought for but I must examine this other bill As you please but I can t in conscience assist you any more pray then excuse me So while the old man with much painstakings resumed his work the cosmopolitan to allow him every facility resumed his reading At length seeing that he had given up his undertaking as hopeless and was at leisure again the cosmopolitan addressed some gravely interesting remarks to him about the book before him and presently becoming more and more grave said as he turned the large volume slowly over on the table and with much difficulty traced the faded remains of the gilt inscription giving the name of the society who had presented it to the boat Ah sir though every one must be pleased at the thought of the presence in public places of such a book yet there is something that abates the satisfaction Look at this volume on the outside battered as any old valise in the baggage room and inside white and virgin as the hearts of lilies in bud So it is so it is said the old man sadly his attention for the first directed to the circumstance Nor is this the only time continued the other that I have observed these public Bibles in boats and hotels All much like this old without and new within True this aptly typifies that internal freshness the best mark of truth however ancient but then it speaks not so well as could be wished for the good book s esteem in the minds of the traveling public I may err but it seems to me that if more confidence was put in it by the traveling public it would hardly be so With an expression very unlike that with which he had bent over the Detector the old man sat meditating upon his companions remarks a while and at last with a rapt look said And yet of all people the traveling public most need to put trust in that guardianship which is made known in this book True true thoughtfully assented the other And one would think they would want to and be glad to continued the old man kindling for in all our wanderings through this vale how pleasant not less than obligatory to feel that we need start at no wild alarms provide for no wild perils trusting in that Power which is alike able and willing to protect us when we cannot ourselves His manner produced something answering to it in the cosmopolitan who leaning over towards him said sadly Though this is a theme on which travelers seldom talk to each other yet to you sir I will say that I share something of your sense of security I have moved much about the world and still keep at it nevertheless though in this land and especially in these parts of it some stories are told about steamboats and railroads fitted to make one a little apprehensive yet I may say that neither by land nor by water am I ever seriously disquieted however at times transiently uneasy since with you sir I believe in a Committee of Safety holding silent sessions over all in an invisible patrol most alert when we soundest sleep and whose beat lies as much through forests as towns along rivers as streets In short I never forget that passage of Scripture which says Jehovah shall be thy confidence The traveler who has not this trust what miserable misgivings must be his or what vain short sighted care must he take of himself Even so said the old man lowly There is a chapter continued the other again taking the book which as not amiss I must read you But this lamp solar lamp as it is begins to burn dimly So it does so it does said the old man with changed air dear me it must be very late I must to bed to bed Let me see rising and looking wistfully all round first on the stools and settees and then on the carpet let me see let me see is there anything I have forgot forgot Something I a sort of dimly remember Something my son careful man told me at starting this morning this very morning Something about seeing to something before I got into my berth What could it be Something for safety Oh my poor old memory Let me give a little guess sir Life preserver So it was He told me not to omit seeing I had a life preserver in my state room said the boat supplied them too But where are they I don t see any What are they like They are something like this sir I believe lifting a brown stool with a curved tin compartment underneath yes this I think is a life preserver sir and a very good one I should say though I don t pretend to know much about such things never using them myself Why indeed now Who would have thought it that a life preserver That s the very stool I was sitting on ain t it It is And that shows that one s life is looked out for when he ain t looking out for it himself In fact any of these stools here will float you sir should the boat hit a snag and go down in the dark But since you want one in your room pray take this one handing it to him I think I can recommend this one the tin part rapping it with his knuckles seems so perfect sounds so very hollow Sure it s quite perfect though Then anxiously putting on his spectacles he scrutinized it pretty closely well soldered quite tight I should say so sir though indeed as I said I never use this sort of thing myself Still I think that in case of a wreck barring sharp pointed timbers you could have confidence in that stool for a special providence Then good night good night and Providence have both of us in its good keeping Be sure it will eying the old man with sympathy as for the moment he stood money belt in hand and life preserver under arm be sure it will sir since in Providence as in man you and I equally put trust But bless me we are being left in the dark here Pah what a smell too Ah my way now cried the old man peering before him where lies my way to my state room I have indifferent eyes and will show you but first for the good of all lungs let me extinguish this lamp The next moment the waning light expired and with it the waning flames of the horned altar and the waning halo round the robed man s brow while in the darkness which ensued the cosmopolitan kindly led the old man away Something further may follow of this Masquerade Transcriber s Note and Errata The following
