my girlfriends in general And in particular To my namesake niece Lucy Larcom Spaulding Happy those early days when I Shined in my angel infancy When on some gilded cloud or flower My gazing soul would dwell an hour And in those weaker glories spy Some shadows of eternity Before I taught my tongue to wound My conscience by a sinful sound But felt through all this fleshy dress Bright shoots of everlastingness HENRY VAUGHAN The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction WORDSWORTH PREFACE THE following sketch was written for the young at the suggestion of friends My audience is understood to be composed of girls of all ages and of women who have not forgotten their girlhood Such as have a friendly appreciation of girls and of those who write for them are also welcome to listen to as much of my narrative as they choose All others are eavesdroppers and of course have no right to criticise To many the word autobiography implies nothing but conceit and egotism But these are not necessarily its characteristics If an apple blossom or a ripe apple could tell its own story it would be still more than its own the story of the sunshine that smiled upon it of the winds that whispered to it of the birds that sang around it of the storms that visited it and of the motherly tree that held it and fed it until its petals were unfolded and its form developed A complete autobiography would indeed be a picture of the outer and inner universe photographed upon one little life s consciousness For does not the whole world seen and unseen go to the making up of every human being The commonest personal history has its value when it is looked at as a part of the One Infinite Life Our life which is the very best thing we have is ours only that we may share it with Our Father s family at their need If we have anything within us worth giving away to withhold it is ungenerous and we cannot look honestly into ourselves without acknowledging with humility our debt to the lives around us for whatever of power or beauty has been poured into ours None of us can think of ourselves as entirely separate beings Even an autobiographer has to say we much oftener than I Indeed there may be more egotism in withdrawing mysteriously into one s self than in frankly unfolding one s life story for better or worse There may be more vanity in covering one s face with a veil to be wondered at and guessed about than in drawing it aside and saying by that act There you see that I am nothing remarkable However I do not know that I altogether approve of autobiography myself when the subject is a person of so little importance as in the present instance Still it may have a reason for being even in a case like this Every one whose name is before the public at all must be aware of a common annoyance in the frequent requests which are made for personal facts data for biographical paragraphs and the like To answer such requests and furnish the material asked for were it desirable would interfere seriously with the necessary work of almost any writer The first impulse is to pay no attention to them putting them aside as mere signs of the ill bred idle curiosity of the age we live in about people and their private affairs It does not seem to be supposed possible that authors can have any natural shrinking from publicity like other mortals But while one would not willingly encourage an intrusive custom there is another view of the matter The most enjoyable thing about writing is that the relation between writer and reader may be and often does become that of mutual friendship an friends naturally like to know each other in a neighborly way We are all willing to gossip about ourselves sometimes with those who are really interested in us Girls especially are fond of exchanging confidences with those whom they think they can trust it is one of the most charming traits of a simple earnest hearted girlhood and they are the happiest women who never lose it entirely I should like far better to listen to my girl readers thoughts about life and themselves than to be writing out my own experiences It is to my disadvantage that the confidences in this case must all be on one side But I have known so many girls so well in my relation to them of schoolmate workmate and teacher I feel sure of a fair share of their sympathy and attention It is hardly possible for an author to write anything sincerely without making it something of an autobiography Friends can always read a personal history or guess at it between the lines So I sometimes think I have already written mine in my verses In them I have found the most natural and free expression of myself They have seemed to set my life to music for me a life that has always had to be occupied with many things besides writing Not however that I claim to have written much poetry only perhaps some true rhymes I do not see how there could be any pleasure in writing insincere ones Whatever special interest this little narrative of mine may have is due to the social influences under which I was reared and particularly to the prominent place held by both work and religion in New England half a century ago The period of my growing up had peculiarities which our future history can never repeat although something far better is undoubtedly already resulting thence Those peculiarities were the natural development of the seed sown by our sturdy Puritan ancestry The religion of our fathers overhung us children like the shadow of a mighty tree against the trunk of which we rested while we looked up in wonder through the great boughs that half hid and half revealed the sky Some of the boughs were already decaying so that perhaps we began to see a little more of the sky than our elders but the tree was sound at its heart There was life in it that can never be lost to the world One thing we are at last beginning to understand which our ancestors evidently had not learned that it is far more needful for theologians to become as little children than for little children to become theologians They considered it a duty that they owed to the youngest of us to teach us doctrines And we believed in our instructors if we could not always digest their instructions We learned to reverence truth as they received it and lived it and to feel that the search for truth was one chief end of our being It was a pity that we were expected to begin thinking upon hard subjects so soon and it was also a pity that we were set to hard work while so young Yet these were both inevitable results of circumstances then existing and perhaps the two belong together Perhaps habits of conscientious work induce thought Certainly right thinking naturally impels people to work We learned no theories about the dignity of labor but we were taught to work almost as if it were a religion to keep at work expecting nothing else It was our inheritance banded down from the outcasts of Eden And for us as for them there was a blessing hidden in the curse I am glad that I grew up under these wholesome Puritanic influences as glad as I am that I was born a New Englander and I surely should have chosen New England for my birthplace before any region under the sun Rich or poor every child comes into the world with some imperative need of its own which shapes its individuality I believe it was Grotius who said Books are necessities of my life Food and clothing I can do without if I must My must have was poetry From the first life meant that to me And fortunately poetry is not purchasable material but an atmosphere in which every life may expand I found it everywhere about me The children of old New England were always surrounded it is true with stubborn matter of fact the hand to hand struggle for existence But that was no hindrance Poetry must have prose to root itself in the homelier its earth spot the lovelier by contrast its heaven breathing flowers To different minds poetry may present different phases To me the reverent faith of the people I lived among and their faithful everyday living was poetry blossoms and trees and blue skies were poetry God himself was poetry As I grew up and lived on friendship became to me the deepest and sweetest ideal of poetry To live in other lives to take their power and beauty into our own that is poetry experienced the most inspiring of all Poetry embodied in persons in lovely and lofty characters more sacredly than all in the One Divine Person who has transfigured our human life with the glory of His sacrifice all the great lyrics and epics pale before that and it is within the reach and comprehension of every human soul To care for poetry in this way does not make one a poet but it does make one feel blessedly rich and quite indifferent to many things which are usually looked upon as desirable possessions I am sincerely grateful that it was given to me from childhood to see life from this point of view And it seems to me that every young girl would be happier for beginning her earthly journey with the thankful consciousness that her life does not consist in the abundance of things that she possesses The highest possible poetic conception is that of a life consecrated to a noble ideal It may be unable to find expression for itself except through humble even menial services or through unselfish devotion whose silent song is audible to God alone yet such music as this might rise to heaven from every young girl s heart and character if she would set it free In such ways it was meant that the world should be filled with the true poetry of womanhood It is one of the most beautiful facts in this human existence of ours that we remember the earliest and freshest part of it most vividly Doubtless it was meant that our childhood should live on in us forever My childhood was by no means a cloudless one It had its light and shade each contributing a charm which makes it wholly delightful in the retrospect I can see very distinctly the child that I was and I know how the world looked to her far off as she is now She seems to me like my little sister at play in a garden where I can at any time return and find her I have enjoyed bringing her back and letting her tell her story almost as if she were somebody else I like her better than I did when I was really a child and I hope never to part company with her I do not feel so much satisfaction in the older girl who comes between her and me although she too is enough like me to be my sister or even more like my young undisciplined mother for the girl is mother of the woman But I have to acknowledge her faults and mistakes as my own while I sometimes feel like reproving her severely for her carelessly performed tasks her habit of lapsing into listless reveries her cowardly shrinking from responsibility and vigorous endeavor and many other faults that I have inherited from her Still she is myself and I could not be quite happy without her comradeship Every phase of our life belongs to us The moon does not except in appearance lose her first thin luminous curve nor her silvery crescent in rounding to her full The woman is still both child and girl in the completeness of womanly character We have a right to our entire selves through all the changes of this mortal state a claim which we shall doubtless carry along with us into the unfolding mysteries of our eternal being Perhaps in this thought lies hidden the secret of immortal youth for a seer has said that to grow old in heaven is to grow young To take life as it is sent to us to live it faithfully looking and striving always towards better life this was the lesson that came to me from my early teachers It was not an easy lesson but it was a healthful one and I pass it on to younger pupils trusting that they will learn it more thoroughly than I ever have Young or old we may all win inspiration to do our best from the needs of a world to which the humblest life may be permitted to bring immeasurable blessings For no one doth know What he can bestow What light strength and beauty may after him go Thus onward we move And save God above None guesseth how wondrous the journey will prove L L BEVERLY MASSACHUSETTS October eighteen eighty nine CONTENTS CHAPTER I UP AND DOWN THE LANE II SCHOOLROOM AND MEETING HOUSE

FROM THE MERRIMACK TO THE MISSISSIPPI A NEW ENGLAND GIRLHOOD I UP AND DOWN THE LANE IT is strange that the spot of earth where we were born should make such a difference to us People can live and grow anywhere but people as well as plants have their habitat the place where they belong and where they find their happiest because their most natural life If I had opened my eyes upon this planet elsewhere than in this northeastern corner of Massachusetts elsewhere than on this green rocky strip of shore between Beverly Bridge and the Misery Islands it seems to me as if I must have been somebody else and not myself These gray ledges hold me by the roots as they do the bayberry bushes the sweet fern and the rock saxifrage When I look from my window over the tree tops to the sea I could almost fancy that from the deck of some one of those inward bound vessels the wistful eyes of the Lady Arbella might be turned towards this very hillside and that mine were meeting hers in sympathy across the graves of two hundred and fifty years For Winthrop s fleet led by the ship that bore her name must have passed into harbor that way Dear and gracious spirit The memory of her brief sojourn here has left New England more truly consecrated ground Sweetest of womanly pioneers It is as if an angel in passing on to heaven just touched with her wings this rough coast of ours In those primitive years before any town but Salem had been named this whole region was known as Cape Ann Side and about ten years after Winthrop s arrival my first ancestor s name appears among those of other hardy settlers of the neighborhood No record has been found of his coming but emigration by that time had grown so rapid that ships lists were no longer carefully preserved And then he was but a simple yeoman a tiller of the soil one who must have loved the sea however for he moved nearer and nearer towards it from Agawam through Wenham woods until the close of the seventeenth century found his descendants my own great great grandfather s family planted in a romantic homestead nook on a hillside overlooking wide gray spaces of the bay at the part of Beverly known as The Farms The situation was beautiful and home attachments proved tenacious the family claim to the farm having only been resigned within the last thirty or forty years I am proud of my unlettered forefathers who were also too humbly proud to care whether their names would be remembered or not for they were God fearing men and had been persecuted for their faith long before they found their way either to Old or New England The name is rather an unusual one and has been traced back from Wales and the Isle of Wight through France to Languedoc and Piedmont a little hamlet in the south of France still bearing it in what was probably the original spelling La Combe There is a family shield in existence showing a hill surmounted by a tree and a bird with spread wings above It might symbolize flight in times of persecution from the mountains to the forests and thence to heaven or to the free skies of this New World But it is certain that my own immediate ancestors were both indifferent and ignorant as to questions of pedigree and accepted with sturdy dignity an inheritance of hard work and the privileges of poverty leaving the same bequest to their descendants And poverty has its privileges When there is very little of the seen and temporal to intercept spiritual vision unseen and eternal realities are or may be more clearly beheld To have been born of people of integrity and profound faith in God is better than to have inherited material wealth of any kind And to those serious minded reticent progenitors of mine looking out from their lonely fields across the lonelier sea their faith must have been everything My father s parents both died years before my birth My grandmother had been left a widow with a large family in my father s boyhood and he with the rest had to toil early for a livelihood She was an earnest Christian woman of keen intelligence and unusual spiritual perception She was supposed by her neighbors to have the gift of second sight and some remarkable stories are told of her knowledge of distant events while they were occurring or just before they took place Her dignity of presence and character must have been noticeable A relative of mine who as a very little child was taken by her mother to visit my grandmother told me that she had always remembered the aged woman s solemnity of voice and bearing and her mother s deferential attitude towards her and she was so profoundly impressed by it all at the time that when they had left the house and were on their homeward path through the woods she looked up into her mother s face and asked in a whisper Mother was that God I used sometimes to feel a little resentment at my fate in not having been born at the old Beverly Farms home place as my father and uncles and aunts and some of my cousins had been But perhaps I had more of the romantic and legendary charm of it than if I had been brought up there for my father in his communicative moods never wearied of telling us about his childhood and we felt that we still held a birthright claim upon that picturesque spot through him Besides it was only three or four miles away and before the day of railroads that was thought nothing of as a walk by young or old But in fact I first saw the light in the very middle of Beverly in full view of the town clock and the Old South steeple I believe there is an Old South in nearly all these first settled cities and villages of Eastern Massachusetts The town wore a half rustic air of antiquity then with its old fashioned people and weather worn houses for I was born while my mother century was still in her youth just rounding the first quarter of her hundred years Primitive ways of doing things had not wholly ceased during my childhood they were kept up in these old towns longer than elsewhere We used tallow candles and oil lamps and sat by open fireplaces There was always a tinder box in some safe corner or other and fire was kindled by striking flint and steel upon the tinder What magic it seemed to me when I was first allowed to strike that wonderful spark and light the kitchen fire The fireplace was deep and there was a settle in the chimney corner where three of us youngest girls could sit together and toast our toes on the andirons two Continental soldiers in full uniform marching one after the other while we looked up the chimney into a square of blue sky and sometimes caught a snowflake on our foreheads or sometimes smirched our clean aprons high necked and long sleeved ones known as tiers against the swinging crane with its sooty pot hooks and trammels The coffee pot was set for breakfast over hot coals on a three legged bit of iron called a trivet Potatoes were roasted in the ashes and the Thanksgiving turkey in a tin kitchen the business of turning the spit being usually delegate to some of us small folk who were only too willing to burn our faces in honor of the annual festival There were brick ovens in the chimney corner where the great bakings were done but there was also an iron article called a Dutch oven in which delicious bread could be baked over the coals at short notice And there was never was anything that tasted better than my mother s firecake a short cake spread on a smooth piece of board and set up with a flat iron before the blaze browned on one side and then turned over to be browned on the other It required some sleight of hand to do that If I could only be allowed to blow the bellows the very old people called them belluses when the fire began to get low I was a happy girl Cooking stoves were coming into fashion but they were clumsy affairs and our elders thought that no cooking could be quite so nice as that which was done by an open fire We younger ones reveled in the warm beautiful glow that we look back to as to a remembered sunset There is no such home splendor now When supper was finished and the tea kettle was pushed back on the crane and the backlog had been reduced to a heap of fiery embers then was the time for listening to sailor yarns and ghost and witch legends The wonder seems somehow to have faded out of those tales of eld since the gleam of red hot coals died away from the hearthstone The shutting up of the great fireplaces and the introduction of stoves marks an era the abdication of shaggy Romance and the enthronement of elegant Commonplace sometimes alas the opposite of elegant at the New England fireside Have we indeed a fireside any longer in the old sense It hardly seems as if the young people of to day can really understand the poetry of English domestic life reading it as they must by a reflected illumination from the past What would Cotter s Saturday Night have been if Burns had written it by the opaque heat of a stove instead of at his Wee bit ingle blinkin bonnilie New England as it used to be was so much like Scotland in many of its ways of doing and thinking that it almost seems as if that tender poem of hearth and home life had been written for us too I can see the features of my father who died when I was a little child whenever I read the familiar verse The cheerfu supper done wi serious face They round the ingle form a circle wide The sire turns o er wi patriarchal grace The big ha Bible ance his father s pride A grave thoughtful face his was lifted up so grandly amid that blooming semicircle of boys and girls all gathered silently in the glow of the ruddy firelight The great family Bible had the look upon its leathern covers of a book that bad never been new and we honored it the more for its apparent age Its companion was the Westminster Assembly s and Shorter Catechism out of which my father asked us questions on Sabbath afternoons when the tea table had been cleared He ended the exercise with a prayer standing up with his face turned toward the wall My most vivid recollection of his living face is as I saw it reflected in a mirror while he stood thus praying His closed eyes the paleness and seriousness of his countenance awed me I never forgot that look I saw it but once again when a child of six or seven years I was lifted to a footstool beside his coffin to gaze upon his face for the last time It wore the same expression that it did in prayer paler but no longer care worn so peaceful so noble They left me standing there a long time and I could not take my eyes away I had never thought my father s face a beautiful one until then but I believe it must have been so always I know that he was a studious man fond of what was called solid reading He delighted in problems of navigation he was for many years the master of a merchant vessel sailing to various European ports in astronomical calculations and historical computations A rhyming genius in the town who undertook to hit off the peculiarities of well known residents characterized my father as Philosophic Ben Who pointing to the stars cries Land ahead His reserved abstracted manner though his gravity concealed a fund of rare humor kept us children somewhat aloof from him but my mother s temperament formed a complete contrast to his She was chatty and social rosy cheeked and dimpled with bright blue eyes and soft dark curling hair which she kept pinned up under her white lace cap border Not even the eldest child remembered her without her cap and when some of us asked her why she never let her pretty curls be visible she said Your father liked to see me in a cap I put it on soon after we were married to please him I always have worn it and I always shall wear it for the same reason My mother had that sort of sunshiny nature which easily shifts to shadow like the atmosphere of an April day Cheerfulness held sway with her except occasionally when her domestic cares grew too overwhelming but her spirits rebounded quickly from discouragement Her father was the only one of our grandparents who had survived to my time of French descent piquant merry exceedingly polite and very fond of us children whom he was always treating to raisins and peppermints and rules for good behavior He had been a soldier in the Revolutionary War the greatest distinction we could imagine And he was also the sexton of the oldest church in town the Old South and had charge of the winding up of the town clock and the ringing of the bell on week days and Sundays and the tolling for funerals into which mysteries he sometimes allowed us youngsters a furtive glimpse I did not believe that there was another grandfather so delightful as ours in all the world Uncles aunts and cousins were plentiful in the family but they did not live near enough for us to see them very often excepting one aunt my father s sister for whom I was named She was fair with large clear eyes that seemed to look far into one s heart with an expression at once penetrating and benignant To my childish imagination she was an embodiment of serene and lofty goodness I wished and hoped that by bearing her baptismal name I might become like her and when I found out its signification I learned that Lucy means with light I wished it more earnestly still For her beautiful character was just such an illumination to my young life as I should most desire mine to be to the lives of others My aunt like my father was always studying something Some map or book always lay open before her when I went to visit her in her picturesque old house with its sloping roof and tall well sweep And she always brought out some book or picture for me from her quaint old fashioned chest of drawers I still possess the Children in the Wood which she gave me as a keepsake when I was about ten years old Our relatives form the natural setting of our childhood We understand ourselves best and are best understood by others through the persons who came nearest to us in our earliest years Those larger planets held our little one to its orbit and lent it their brightness Happy indeed is the infancy which is surrounded only by the loving and the good Besides those who were of my kindred I had several aunts by courtesy or rather by the privilege of neighborhood who seemed to belong to my babyhood Indeed the family hearthstone came near being the scene of a tragedy to me through the blind fondness of one of these The adjective is literal This dear old lady almost sightless sitting in a low chair far in the chimney corner where she had been placed on her first call to see the new baby took me upon her lap and so they say unconsciously let me slip off into the coals I was rescued unsinged however and it was one of the earliest accomplishments of my infancy to thread my poor half blind Aunt Stanley s needles for her We were close neighbors and gossips until my fourth year Many an hour I sat by her side drawing a needle and thread through a bit of calico under the delusion that I was sewing while she repeated all sorts of juvenile singsongs of which her memory seemed full for my entertainment There used to be a legend current among my brothers and sisters that this aunt unwittingly taught me to use a reprehensible word One of her ditties began with the lines Miss Lucy was a charming child She never said I won t After bearing this once or twice the willful negative was continually upon my lips doubtless a symptom of what was dormant within a will perhaps not quite so aggressive as it was obstinate But she meant only to praise me and please me and dearly I loved to stay with her in her cozy up stairs room across the lane that the sun looked into nearly all day Another adopted aunt lived down stairs in the same house This one was a sober woman life meant business to her and she taught me to sew in earnest with a knot in the end of my thread although it was only upon clothing for my ragchildren absurd creatures of my own invention limbless and destitute of features except as now and then one of my older sisters would upon my earnest petition outline a face for one of them with pen and ink I loved them nevertheless far better than I did the London doll that lay in waxen state in an upper drawer at home the fine lady that did not wish to be played with but only to be looked at and admired This latter aunt I regarded as a woman of great possessions She owned the land beside us and opposite us Her well was close to our door a well of the coldest and clearest water I ever drank and it abundantly supplied the whole neighborhood The hill behind her house was our general playground and I supposed she owned that too since through her dooryard and over her stone wall was our permitted thoroughfare thither I imagined that those were her buttercups that we gathered when we got over the wall and held under each other s chin to see by the reflection who was fond of butter and surely the yellow toadflax we called it lady s slipper that grew in the rock crevices was hers for we found it nowhere else The blue gill over the ground unmistakably belonged to her for it carpeted an unused triangular corner of her garden inclosed by a leaning fence gray and gold with sea side lichens Its blue was beautiful but its pungent earthy odor I can smell it now repelled us from the damp corner where it grew It made us think of graves and ghosts and I think we were forbidden to go there We much preferred to sit on the sunken curbstones in the shade of the broad leaved burdocks and shape their spiny balls into chairs and cradles and sofas for our dollies or to play school on the doorsteps or to climb over the wall and to feel the freedom of the hill We were a neighborhood of large families and most of us enjoyed the privilege of a little wholesome neglect Our tether was a long one and when grown a little older we occasionally asked to have it lengthened a maternal I don t care amounted to almost unlimited liberty The hill itself was well nigh boundless in its capacities for juvenile occupation Besides its miniature precipices that walled in some of the neighbors gardens and its slanting slides worn smooth by the feet of many childish generations there were partly quarried ledges which had shaped themselves into rock stairs carpeted with lovely mosses in various patterns These were the winding ways up our castle towers with breakfast rooms and boudoirs along the landings where we set our tables for expected guests with bits of broken china and left our numerous rag children tucked in asleep under mullein blankets or plantain coverlets while we ascended to the topmost turret to watch for our ships coming in from sea For leagues of ocean were visible from the tiptop of the ledge a tiny cleft peak that held always little rain pool for thirsty birds that now and then stopped as they flew over to dip their beaks and glance shyly at us as if they wished to share our games We could see the steeples and smokes of Salem in the distance and the bill as it descended lost itself in mowing fields that slid again into the river Beyond that was Rial Side and Folly Hill and they looked so very far off They called it over to Green s across the river I thought it was because of the thick growth of dark green junipers that covered the cliff side down to the water s edge but they were only giving the name of the farmer who owned the land Whenever there was an unusual barking of dogs in the distance they said it was over to Green s That barking of dogs made the place seem very mysterious to me Our lane ran parallel with the hill and the mowing fields and down our lane we were always free to go It was a genuine lane all ups and downs and too narrow for a street although at last they have leveled it and widened it and made a commonplace thoroughfare of it I am glad that my baby life knew it in all its queer original irregularities for it seemed to have a character of its own like many of its inhabitants all the more charming because it was unlike anything but itself The hill too is lost now buried under houses Our lane came to an end at some bars that let us into another lane or rather a footpath or cowpath bordered with cornfields and orchards We were still on home ground for my father s vegetable garden and orchard were here After a long straight stretch the path suddenly took an abrupt turn widening into a cart road then to a tumble down wharf and there was the river An arm of the sea I was told that our river was and it did seem to reach around the town and hold it in a liquid embrace Twice a day the tide came in and filled its muddy bed with a sparkling flood So it was a river only half the time but at high tide it was a river indeed all that a child could wish with its boats and its sloops and now and then that most available craft for a crew of children a gundalow We easily transformed the spelling into gondola and in fancy were afloat on Venetian waters under some overhanging balcony perhaps at the very Palace of the Doges willingly blind to the reality of a mudscow leaning against some rickety wharf posts covered with barnacles Sometimes a neighbor boy who was the fortunate owner of a boat would row us down the river a fearful because a forbidden joy The widening waters made us tremble with dread and longing for what might be beyond for when we had passed under the piers of the bridge the estuary broadened into the harbor and the open sea Then somebody on board would tell a story of children who had drifted away beyond the harbor bar and the light house and were drowned and our boyish helmsman would begin to look grave and anxious and would turn his boat and row us back swiftly to the safe gundalow and tumbledown wharf The cars rush into the station now right over our riverside playground I can often hear the mirthful shout of boys and girls under the shriek of the steam whistle No dream of a railroad had then come to the quiet old town but it was a wild train of children that ran homeward in the twilight up the narrow lane with wind shod feet and hair flying like the manes of young colts and light hearts bounding to their own footsteps How good and dear our plain two story dwelling house looked to us as we came in sight of it and what sweet odors stole out to meet us from the white fenced inclosure of our small garden from peach trees and lilac bushes in bloom from bergamot and balm and beds of camomile Sometimes we would find the pathetic figure of white haired Larkin Moore the insane preacher his two canes lain aside waiting in our dooryard for any audience that he could gather boys and girls were as welcome as anybody He would seat us in a row on the green slope and give us a half hour or so of incoherent exhortation to which we attended respectfully if not reverently for his whole manner showed that though demented he was deeply in earnest He seemed there in the twilight like a dazed angel who had lost his way and had half forgotten his errand which yet he must try to tell to anybody who would listen I have heard my mother say that sometimes he would ask if he might take her baby in his arms and sing to it and that though she was half afraid herself the baby I like to fancy I was that baby seemed to enjoy it and played gleefully with the old man s flowing gray locks Good Larkin Moore was well known through the two neighboring counties Essex and Middlesex We saw him afterward on the banks of the Merrimack He always wore a loose calico tunic over his trousers and when the mood came upon him he started off with two canes seeming to think he could travel faster as a quadruped than as a biped He was entirely harmless his only wish was to preach or to sing A characteristic anecdote used to be told of him that once as a stage coach containing only a few passengers passed him on the road he asked the favor of a seat on the top and was refused There were many miles between him and his destination But he did not upbraid the ungracious driver he only swung his two canes a little more briskly and kept breast of the horses all the way entering the town side by side with the inhospitable vehicles a running reproach to the churl on the box There was another wanderer a blind woman whom my mother treated with great respect on her annual pilgrimages She brought with her some printed rhymes to sell purporting to be composed by herself and beginning with the verse I Nancy Welsh was born and bred In Essex County Marblehead And when I was an infant quite The Lord deprived me of my sight I labored under the delusion that blindness was a sort of insanity and I used to run away when this pilgrim came for she was not talkative like Larkin Moore I fancied she disliked children and so I shrank from her There were other odd estrays going about who were either well known or could account for them selves The one human phenomenon that filled us little ones with mortal terror was an unknown man with a pack on his back I do not know what we thought he would do with us but the sight of one always sent us breathless with fright to the shelter of the maternal wing I did not at all like the picture of Christian on his way to the wicket gate in Pilgrim s Progress before I had read the book because he had a pack on his back But there was really nothing to be afraid of in those simple honest old times I suppose we children would not have known how happy and safe we were in our secluded lane if we had not conjured up a few imaginary fears Long as it is since the rural features of our lane were entirely obliterated my feet often go back and press in memory its grass grown borders and in delight and liberty I am a child again Its narrow limits were once my whole known world Even then it seemed to me as if it might lead everywhere and it was indeed but the beginning of a road which must lengthen and widen beneath my feet forever II SCHOOLROOM AND MEETING HOUSE THERE were only two or three houses between ours and the main street and then our lane came out directly opposite the finest house in town a three story edifice of brick painted white the Colonel s residence There was a spacious garden behind it from which we caught glimpses and perfumes of unknown flowers Over its high walls hung boughs of splendid great yellow sweet apples which when they fell on the outside we children considered as our perquisites When I first read about the apples of the Hesperides my idea of them was that they were like the Colonel s pumpkin sweetings Beyond the garden were wide green fields which reached eastward down to the beach It was one of those large old estates which used to give to the very heart of our New England coast towns a delightful breeziness and roominess A coach and pair was one of the appurtenances of this estate with a coachman on the box and when he took the family out for an airing we small children thought it was a sort of Cinderella spectacle prepared expressly for us It was not however quite so interesting as the Boston stage coach that rolled regularly every day past the head of our lane into and out of its headquarters a big unpainted stable close at hand This stage coach in our minds meant the city twenty miles off an immeasurable distance to us then Even our elders did not go there very often In those early days towns used to give each other nicknames like schoolboys Ours was called Bean town not because it was especially devoted to the cultivation of this leguminous edible but probably because it adhered a long time to the Puritanic custom of saving Sunday work by baking beans on Saturday evening leaving them in the oven over night After a while as families left off heating their ovens the bean pots were taken by the village baker on Saturday afternoon who returned them to each house early on Sunday morning with the pan of brown bread that went with them The jingling of the baker s bells made the matter a public one The towns through which our stage coach passed sometimes called it the bean pot The Jehn who drove it was something of a wag Once coming through Charlestown while waiting in the street for a resident passenger he was hailed by another resident who thought him obstructing the passage with the shout Halloo there Get your old bean pot out of the way I will when I have got my pork in was the ready reply What the sobriquet of Charlestown was need not be explained We had a good opportunity to watch both coaches as my father s shop was just at the head of the lane and we went to school upstairs in the same building After he left off going to sea before my birth my father took a store for the sale of what used to be called West India goods and various other domestic commodities The school was kept by a neighbor whom everybody called Aunt Hannah It took in all the little ones about us no matter how young they were provided they could walk and talk and were considered capable of learning their letters A ladder like flight of stairs on the outside of the house led up to the schoolroom and another flight also outside took us down into a bit of a garden where grew tansy and spearmint and southernwood and wormwood and among other old fashioned flowers an abundance of many tinted four o clocks whose regular afternoon opening just at the close of school was a daily wonder to us babies From the schoolroom window we could watch the slow hands of the town clock and get a peep at what was going on in the street although there was seldom anybody in sight except the Colonel s gardener or coachman going into or out of the driveway directly opposite It was a very still street the front windows of the houses were generally closed and a few military looking Lombardy poplars stood like sentinels on guard before them Another shop a very small one joined my father s where three shoemakers all of the same name the name our lane went by sat at their benches and plied their waxed ends One of them an elderly man tall and erect used to come out regularly every day and stand for a long time at the corner motionless as a post with his nose and chin pointing skyward usually to the northeast I watched his face with wonder for it was said that Uncle John was weatherwise and knew all the secrets of the heavens Aunt Hannah s schoolroom and our shop are a blended memory to me As I was only a baby when I began to go to school I was often sent down stairs for a half hour s recreation not permitted to the older ones I think I looked upon both school and shop entirely as places of entertainment for little children The front shop window was especially interesting to us children for there were in it a few glass jars containing sticks of striped barley candy and red and white peppermint drops and that delectable achievement of the ancient confectioner s art the Salem gibraltar One of my first recollections of my father is connected with that window He had taken me into the shop with him after dinner I was perhaps two years old and I was playing beside him on the counter when one of his old sea comrades came in whom we knew as Captain Cross The Captain tried to make friends with me and to seal the bond asked my father to take down from its place of exhibition a strip of red peppermints dropped on white paper in a style I particularly admired which he twisted around my neck saying Now I ve bought you Now you are my girl Come go home with me His words sounded as if he meant them I took it all in earnest and ran scared and screaming to my father dashing down the sugar plums I wanted so much and refusing even to bestow a glance upon my amused purchaser My father pacified me by taking me on his shoulders and carrying me pickaback up and down the shop and I clung to him in the happy consciousness that I belonged to him and that he would not let anybody else have me though I did not feel quite easy until Captain Cross disappeared I suppose that this little incident has always remained in my memory because it then for the first time became a fact in my consciousness that my father really loved me as I loved him He was not at all a demonstrative man and any petting that he gave us children could not fail to make a permanent impression I think that must have been also the last special attention I received from him for a little sister appeared soon after whose coming was announced to me with the accompaniment of certain mysterious hints about my nose being out of joint I examined that feature carefully in the looking glass but could not discover anything usual about it It was quite beyond me to imagine that our innocent little baby could have anything to do with the possible disfigurement of my face but she did absorb the fondness of the whole family myself included and she became my father s playmate and darling the very apple of his eye I used sometimes to wish I were a baby too so that he would notice me but gradually I accepted the situation Aunt Hannah used her kitchen or her sitting room for a schoolroom as best suited her convenience We were delighted observers of her culinary operations and other employments If a baby s head nodded a little bed was made for it on a soft comforter in the corner where it had its nap out undisturbed But this did not often happen there were so many interesting things going on that we seldom became sleepy Aunt Hannah was very kind and motherly but she kept us in fear of her ferule which indicated to us a possibility of smarting palms This ferule was shaped much like the stick with which she stirred her hasty pudding for dinner I thought it was the same and I found myself caught in a whirlwind of family laughter by reporting at home that Aunt Hannah punished the scholars with the pudding stick There was one colored boy in school who did not sit on a bench like the rest but on a block of wood that looked like a backlog turned endwise Aunt Hannah often called him a blockhead and I supposed it was because he sat on that block Sometimes in his absence a boy was made to sit in his place for punishment for being a blockhead too as I imagined I hoped I should never be put there Stupid little girls received a different treatment an occasional rap on the head with the teacher s thimble accompanied with a half whispered impatient ejaculation which sounded very much like Numskull I think this was a rare occurrence however for she was a good natured much enduring woman One of our greatest school pleasures was to watch Aunt Hannah spinning on her flax wheel wetting her thumb and forefinger at her lips to twist the thread keeping time meanwhile to some quaint old tune with her foot upon the treadle A verse of one of her hymns which I never heard anybody else sing resounds in the farthest corner of my memory yet Whither goest thou pilgrim stranger Wandering through this lowly vale Knowest thou not t is full of danger And will not thy courage fail Then a little pause and the refrain of the answer broke in with a change quick and jubilant the treadle moving more rapidly also No I m bound for the kingdom Will you go to glory with me Hallelujah Praise the Lord I began to go to school when I was about two years old as other children about us did The mothers of those large families had to resort to some means of keeping their little ones out of mischief while they attended to their domestic duties Not much more than that sort of temporary guardianship was expected of the good dame who had us in charge But I learned my letters in a few days standing at Aunt Hannah s knee while she pointed them out in the spelling book with a pin skipping over the a b abs into words of one and two syllables thence taking a flying leap into the New Testament in which there is concurrent family testimony that I was reading at the age of two years and a half Certain it is that a few passages in the Bible whenever I read them now do not fail to bring before me a vision of Aunt Hannah s somewhat sternly smiling lips with her spectacles just above them far down on her nose encouraging me to pronounce the hard words I think she tried to choose for me the least difficult verses or perhaps those of which she was herself especially fond Those which I distinctly recall are the Beatitudes the Twenty third Psalm parts of the first and fourteenth chapters of the Gospel of saint John and the thirteenth chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians I liked to say over the Blesseds the shortest ones best about the meek and the pure in heart and the two In the beginnings both in Genesis and John Every child s earliest and proudest Scriptural conquest in school was almost as a matter of course the first verse in the Bible But the passage which I learned first and most delighted to repeat after Aunt Hannah I think it must have been her favorite too was Let not your heart be troubled In my Father s house are many mansions The Voice in the Book seemed so tender Somebody was speaking who had a heart and who knew that even a little child s heart was sometimes troubled And it was a Voice that called us somewhere to the Father s house with its many mansions so sunshiny and so large It was a beautiful vision that came to me with the words I could see it best with my eyes shut a great dim Door standing ajar opening out of rosy morning mists overhung with swaying vines and arching boughs that were full of birds and from beyond the Door the ripple of running waters and the sound of many happy voices and above them all the One Voice that was saying I go to prepare a place for you The vision gave me a sense of freedom fearless and infinite What was there to be afraid of anywhere Even we little children could see the open door of our Father s house We were playing around its threshold now and we need never wander out of sight of it The feeling was a vague one but it was like a remembrance The spacious mansions were not far away They were my home I had known them and should return to them again This dim half memory which perhaps comes to all children I had felt when younger still almost before I could walk Sitting on the floor in a square of sunshine made by an open window the leaf shadows from great boughs outside dancing and wavering around me I seemed to be talking to them and they to me in unknown tongues that left within me an ecstasy yet unforgotten These shadows had brought a message to me from an unseen Somewhere which my baby heart was to keep forever The wonder of that moment often returns Shadow traceries of bough and leaf still seem to me like the hieroglyphics of a lost language The stars brought me the same feeling I remember the surprise they were to me seen for the first time One evening just before I was put to bed I was taken in somebody s arms my sister s I think outside the door and lifted up under the dark still clear sky splendid with stars thicker and nearer earth than they have ever seemed since All my little being shaped itself into a subdued delighted Oh And then the exultant thought flitted through the mind of the reluctant child as she was carried in Why that is the roof of the house I live in After that I always went to sleep happier for the feeling that the stars were outside there in the dark though I could not see them I did firmly believe that I came from some other country to this I had a vague notion that we were all here on a journey that this was not the place where we really belonged Some of the family have told me that before I could talk plainly I used to run about humming the sentence My father and mother Shall come unto the land sometimes varying it with My brothers and sisters Shall come unto the land Nobody knew where I had caught the words but I chanted them so constantly that my brother wrote them down with chalk on the under side of a table where they remained for years My thought about that other land may have been only a baby s dream but the dream was very real to me I used to talk in sober earnest about what happened before I was a little girl and came here to live and it did seem to me as if I remembered But I was hearty and robust full of frolicsome health and very fond of the matter of fact world I lived in My sturdy little feet felt the solid earth beneath them I grew with the sprouting grass and enjoyed my life as the buds and birds seemed to enjoy theirs It was only as if the bud and the bird and the dear warm earth knew in the same dumb way that I did that all their joy and sweetness came to them out of the sky These recollections that so distinctly belong the baby Myself before she could speak her thoughts though clear and vivid are difficult to put into shape But other grown up children in looking back will doubtless see many a trailing cloud of glory that lighted their unconscious infancy from within and from beyond I was quite as literal as I was visionary in my mental renderings of the New Testament read at Aunt Hannah s knee I was much taken with the sound of words without any thought of their meaning a habit not always outgrown with childhood The sounding brass and tinkling cymbals for instance in the Epistle to the Corinthians seemed to me things to be greatly desired Charity was an abstract idea I did not know what it meant But tinkling cymbals one could make music with I wished I could get hold of them It never occurred to me that the Apostle meant to speak of their melody slightingly At meeting where I began to go also at two years of age I made my own private interpretations of the Bible readings They were absurd enough but after getting laughed at a few times at home for making them public I escaped mortification by forming a habit of great reserve as to my Sabbath day thoughts When the minister read Cut it down why cumbereth it the ground I thought he meant to say cu cumbereth These vegetables grew on the ground and I had heard that they were not very good for people to eat I honestly supposed that the New Testament forbade the cultivation of cucumbers And Galilee I understood as a mispronunciation of gallery Going up into Galilee I interpreted into clattering up the uncarpeted stairs in the meeting house porch as the boys did with their squeaking brogans looking as restless as imprisoned monkeys after they had got into those conspicuous seats where they behaved as if they thought nobody could see their pranks I did not think it could be at all nice to go up into Galilee I had an Aunt Nancy an uncle s wife to whom I was sometimes sent for safe keeping when house cleaning or anything unusual was going on at home She was a large featured woman with a very deep masculine voice and she conducted family worship herself kneeling at prayer which was not the Orthodox custom She always began by saying Oh Lord Thou knowest that we are all groveling worms of the dust I thought she meant that we all looked like wriggling red earthworms and tried to make out the resemblance in my mind but could not I unburdened my difficulty at home telling the family that Aunt Nancy got down on the floor and said we were all grubbelin worms begging to know whether everybody did sometimes have to crawl about in the dust A little later I was much puzzled as to whether I was a Jew or Gentile The Bible seemed to divide people into these two classes only The Gentiles were not well spoken of I did not want to be one of them The talked about Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and the rest away back to Adam as if they were our forefathers there was a time when I thought that Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel were our four fathers and yet I was very sure that I was not a Jew When I ventured to ask I was told that we were all Christians or heathen now That did not help me for I thought that only grown up persons could be Christians from which it followed that all children must be heathen Must I think of Myself as a heathen then until I should be old enough to be a Christian It was a shocking conclusion but I could see no other answer to my question and I felt ashamed to ask again My self invented theory about the human race was that Adam and Eve were very tall people taller than the tallest trees in the Garden of Eden before they were sent out of it but that they then began to dwindle that their children had ever since been getting smaller and smaller and that by and by the inhabitants of the world would be no bigger than babies I was afraid I should stop growing while I was a child and I used to stand on the footstool in the pew and try to stretch myself up to my mother s height to imagine how it would seem to be a woman I hoped I should be a tall one I did not wish to be a diminishing specimen of the race an anxiety which proved to be entirely groundless The Sabbath mornings in those old times had a peculiar charm They seemed so much cleaner than other mornings The roads and the grassy footpaths seemed fresher and the air itself purer and more wholesome than on week days Saturday afternoon and evening were regarded as part of the Sabbath we were taught that it was heathenish to call the day Sunday work and playthings were laid aside and every body as well as every thing was subjected to a rigid renovation Sabbath morning would not have seemed like itself without a clean house a clean skin and tidy and spotless clothing The Saturday s baking was a great event the brick oven being heated to receive the flour bread the flour and Indian and the rye and Indian bread the traditional pot of beans the Indian pudding and the pies for no further cooking was to be done until Monday We smaller girls thought it a great privilege to be allowed to watch the oven till the roof of it should be white hot so that the coals could be shoveled out Then it was so still both out of doors and within We were not allowed to walk anywhere except in the yard or garden I remember wondering whether it was never Sabbath day over the fence in the next field whether the field was not a kind of heathen field since we could only go into it on week days The wild flowers over there were perhaps Gentile blossoms Only the flowers in the garden were well behaved Christians It was Sabbath in the house and possibly even on the doorstep but not much farther The town itself was so quiet that it scarcely seemed to breathe The sound of wheels was seldom heard in the streets on that day if we heard it we expected some unusual explanation I liked to go to meeting not wholly oblivious to the fact that going there sometimes implied wearing a new bonnet and my best white dress and muslin vandyke of which adornments if very new I vainly supposed the whole congregation to be as admiringly aware as I was myself But my Sabbath day enjoyment was not wholly without drawbacks It was so hard sometimes to stand up through the long prayer and to sit still through the ninthlies and tenthlies and finallys of the sermon It was impressed upon me that good children were never restless in meeting and never laughed or smiled however their big brothers tempted them with winks or grimaces And I did want to be good I was not tall enough to see very far over the top of the pew I think there were only three persons that came within range of my eyes One was a dark man with black curly hair brushed down in bangs over his eyebrows who sat behind a green baize curtain near the outside door peeping out at me as I thought I had an impression that he was the tidy man though that personage had become mythical long before my day He had a dragonish look to me and I tried never to meet his glance But I did sometimes gaze more earnestly than was polite at a dear demure little lady who sat in the corner of the pew next ours her downcast eyes shaded by a green calash and her hidden right hand gently swaying a long handled Chinese fan She was the deacon s wife and I felt greatly interested in her movements and in the expression of her face because I thought she represented the people they called saints who were as I supposed about the same as first cousins to the angels The third figure in sight was the minister I did not think he ever saw me he was talking to the older people usually telling them how wicked they were He often said to them that there was not one good person among them but I supposed he excepted himself He seemed to me so very good that I was very much afraid of him I was a little afraid of my father but then he sometimes played with us children and besides my father was only a man I thought the minister belonged to some different order of beings Up there in the pulpit he seemed to me so far off oh a great deal farther off than God did His distance made my reverence for him take the form of idolatry The pulpit was his pedestal If any one had told me that the minister ever did or thought anything that was wrong I should have felt as if the foundations of the earth under me were shaken I wondered if he ever did laugh Perhaps it was wicked for a minister even to smile One day when I was very little I met the minister in the street and he probably recognizing me as the child of one of his parishioners actually bowed to me His bows were always ministerially profound and I was so overwhelmed with surprise and awe that I forgot to make the proper response of a curtsey but ran home as fast as I could go to proclaim the wonder It would not have astonished me any more if one of the tall Lombardy poplars that stood along the sidewalk had laid itself down at my feet I do not remember anything that the preacher ever said except some words which I thought sounded well such as dispensations decrees ordinances covenants although I attached no meaning to them He seemed to be trying to explain the Bible by putting it into long words I did not understand them at all It was from Aunt Hannah that I received my first real glimpses of the beautiful New Testament revelation In her unconscious wisdom she chose for me passages and chapters that were like openings into heaven They contained the great deep truths which are simple because they are great It was not explanations of those grand words that I required or that anybody requires In reading them we are all children together and need only to be led to the banks of the river of God which is full of water that we may look down into its pellucid depths for ourselves Our minister was not unlike other ministers of the time and his seeming distance from his congregation was doubtless owing to the deep reverence in which the ministerial office was universally held among our predecessors My own graven image worship of him was only a childish exaggeration of the general feeling of grown people around me He seemed to us an inhabitant of a Sabbath day sphere while we belonged to the every day world I distinctly remember the day of my christening when I was between three and four years old My parents did not make a public profession of their faith until after the birth of all their children eight of whom I being my father s ninth child and seventh daughter were baptized at one time My two half sisters were then grown up young women My mother had told us that the minister would be speaking directly to us and that we must pay close attention to what he said I felt that it was an important event and I wished to do exactly what the minister desired of me I listened eagerly while he read the chapter and the hymn The latter was one of my favorites See Israel s gentle Shepherd stands and the chapter was the third of saint Matthew containing the story of our Lord s baptism I could not make out any special message for us until he came to the words Whose fan is in his hand That must be it I looked anxiously at my sisters to see if they had brought their fans It was warm weather and I had taken a little one of my own to meeting Believing that I was following a direct instruction I clasped my fan to my bosom and held it there as we walked up the aisle and during the ceremony wondering why the others did not do so too The baby in my mother s arms Octavia the eighth daughter shocked me by crying a little but I tried to behave the better on that account It all seemed very solemn and mysterious to me I knew from my father s and mother s absorbed manner then and when we returned from church that it was something exceedingly important to Them something that they wished us neither to talk about nor to forget I never did forget it There remained within me a sweet haunting feeling of having come near the gentle Shepherd of the hymn who was calling the lambs to his side The chapter had ended with the echo of a voice from heaven and with the glimpse of a descending Dove And the water drops on my forehead were they not from that pure river of water of life clear as crystal that made music through those lovely verses in the last chapter of the good Book I am glad that I have always remembered that day of family consecration As I look back it seems as if the horizons of heaven and earth met and were blended then And who can tell whether the fragrance of that day s atmosphere may not enter into the freshness of some new childhood in the life which is to come III THE HYMN BOOK 
6215_68888_000003_000000	train-clean-360	ALMOST the first decided taste in my life was the love of hymns Committing them to memory was as natural to me as breathing 
6215_68888_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I followed my mother about with the hymn book Watts and Select reading or repeating them to her while she was busy with her baking or ironing and she was always a willing listener 
none	none	She was fond of devotional reading but had little time for it and it pleased her to know that so small a child as I really cared for the hymns she loved I learned most of them at meeting I was told to listen to the minister but as I did not understand a word he was saying I gave it up and took refuge in the hymn book with the conscientious purpose of trying to sit still I turned the leaves over as noiselessly as possible to avoid the dreaded reproof of my mother s keen blue eyes and sometimes I learned two or three hymns in a forenoon or an afternoon 
6215_68888_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Finding it so easy I thought I would begin at the beginning and learn the whole 
none	none	There were about a thousand of them included in the Psalms the First Second and Third Books and the Select Hymns But I had learned to read before I had any knowledge of counting up numbers and so was blissfully ignorant of the magnitude of my undertaking 
6215_68888_000004_000006	train-clean-360	I did not I think change my resolution because there were so many but because little as I was I discovered that there were hymns and hymns 
none	none	Some of them were so prosy that the words would not stay in my memory at all so I concluded that I would learn only those I liked I had various reasons for my preferences With some I was caught by a melodious echo or a sonorous ring with others by the hint of a picture or a story or by some sacred suggestion that attracted me I knew not why Of some I was fond just because I misunderstood them and of these I made a free version in my mind as I murmured them over One of my first favorites was certainly rather a singular choice for a child of three or four years 
6215_68888_000005_000004	train-clean-360	I had no idea of its meaning but made up a little story out of it with myself as the heroine 
6215_68888_000005_000005	train-clean-360	It began with the words 
none	none	Come humble sinner in whose breast A thousand thoughts revolve The second stanza read thus I ll go to Jesus though my sin Hath like a mountain rose 
6215_68888_000009_000000	train-clean-360	I did not know that this last line was bad grammar but thought that the sin in question was something pretty that looked like a mountain rose Mountains I had never seen they were a glorious dream to me And a rose that grew on a mountain must surely be prettier than any of our red wild roses on the hill sweet as they were 
none	none	I would pluck that rose and carry it up the mountain side into the temple where the King sat and would give it to Him and then He would touch me with his sceptre and let me through into a garden full of flowers There was no garden in the hymn I suppose the rose made me invent one 
6215_68888_000009_000003	train-clean-360	But it did read 
none	none	I know his courts I ll enter in Whatever may oppose and so I fancied there would be lions in the way as there were in the Pilgrim s at the House Beautiful but I should not be afraid of them they would no doubt be chained 
6215_68888_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The last verse began with the lines 
none	none	I can but perish if I go I am resolved to try and my heart beat a brave echo to the words as I started off in fancy on a Pilgrim s Progress of my own a happy little dreamer telling nobody the secret of my imaginary journey taken in sermon time Usually the hymns for which I cared most suggested Nature in some way flowers trees skies and stars 
6215_68888_000014_000001	train-clean-360	When I repeated 
none	none	There everlasting spring abides And never withering flowers I thought of the faintly flushed anemones and white and blue violets the dear little short lived children of our shivering spring They also would surely be found in that heavenly land blooming on through the cloudless endless year And I seemed to smell the spiciness of bay berry and sweet fern and wild roses and meadow sweet that grew in fragrant jungles up and down the hillside back of the meeting house in another verse which I dearly loved The hill of Zion yields A thousand sacred sweet Before we reach the heavenly fields Or walk the golden streets We were allowed to take a little nosegay to meeting sometimes a pink or two pinks were pink then not red nor white nor even double and a sprig of camomile and their blended perfume still seems to be a part of the June Sabbath mornings long passed away When the choir sang of Seas of heavenly rest a breath of salt wind came in with the words through the open door from the sheltered waters of the bay so softly blue and so lovely I always wondered how a world could be beautiful where there was no more sea I concluded that the hymn and the text could not really contradict other that there must be something like the sea in heaven after all One stanza that I used to croon over gave me the feeling of being rocked in a boat on a strange and beautiful ocean from whose far off shores the sunrise beckoned At anchor laid remote from home Toiling I cry Sweet Spirit come Celestial breeze no longer stay But spread my sails and speed my way Some of the chosen hymns of my infancy the world recognizes among its noblest treasures of sacred song That one of Doddridge s beginning with Ye golden lamps of heaven farewell made me feel as if I had just been gazing in at some window of the many mansions above Ye stars are but the shining dust Of my divine abode Had I not known that ever since I was a baby But the light does not stream down even into a baby s soul with equal brightness all the time Earth draws her dark curtains too soon over the windows of heaven and the little children fall asleep in her dim rooms and forget their visions That majestic hymn of Cowper s God moves in a mysterious way was one of my first and dearest It reminded me of the rolling of thunder through the sky and understood as little as the thunder itself which my mother told me was God s voice so that I bent my ear and listened expecting to hear it shaped into words it still did give me an idea of the presence of One Infinite Being that thrilled me with reverent awe And this was one of the best lessons taught in the Puritan school the lesson of reverence the certainty that life meant looking up to something to Some One greater than ourselves to a Life far above us which yet enfolded ours The thought of God when He was first spoken of to me seemed as natural as the thought of my father and mother That He should be invisible did not seem strange for I could not with my eyes see through the sky beyond which I supposed he lived But it was easy to believe that He could look down and see me and that He knew all about me We were taught very early to say Thou God seest me and it was one of my favorite texts Heaven seemed nearer because somebody I loved was up there looking at me A baby is not afraid of its father s eyes The first real unhappiness I remember to have felt was when some one told me one day that I did not love God I insisted almost tearfully that I did but I was told that if I did truly love Him I should always be good I knew I was not that and the feeling of sudden orphanage came over me like a bewildering cloud Yet I was sure that I loved my father and mother even when I was naughty Was He harder to please than they Then I heard of a dreadful dark Somewhere the horror of which was that it was away from Him What if I should wake some morning and find myself there Sometimes I did not dare to go to sleep for that dread And the thought was too awful to speak of to anybody Baby that I was I shut my lips in a sort of reckless despair and thought that if I could not be good I might as well be naughty and enjoy it But somehow I could not enjoy it I felt sorry and ashamed and degraded whenever I knew that I had been cross or selfish I heard them talk about Jesus as if He were a dead man one who died a great while ago whose death made a great difference to us I could not understand how It seemed like a lovely story the loveliest in the world but it sounded as if it were only a story even to those who repeated it to me something that had happened far away in the past But one day a strange minister came into the Sabbath school in our little chapel and spoke to us children about Him oh so differently Children he said Jesus is not dead
6215_68888_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 He is alive 
none	none	He loves you and wants you to love Him He is your best Friend and He will show you how to be good My heart beat fast I could hardly keep back the tears 
6215_68888_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The New Testament then did really mean what it said 
6215_68888_000036_000003	train-clean-360	Jesus said He would come back again and would always be with those who loved Him 
none	none	He is alive 
6215_68888_000037_000001	train-clean-360	He loves me 
none	none	He will tell me how to be good I said it over to myself but not to anybody else I was sure that I loved Him It was like a beautiful secret between us two I felt Him so alive and so near 
6215_68888_000037_000005	train-clean-360	He wanted me to be good and I could be I would be for his sake

none	none	It seemed to me that it must be delightful to grow up and learn things and do things and be very good indeed better than children could possibly know how to be I knew afterwards that my elders were sometimes at least sincere in their sadness for with many of them life must have been a hard struggle But when they shook their heads and said Child you will not be so happy by and by you are seeing your best days now I still doubted I was born with the blessing of a cheerful temperament and while that is not enough to sustain any of us through the inevitable sorrows that all must share it would have been most unnatural and ungrateful in me to think of earth as a dismal place when everything without and within was trying to tell me that this good and beautiful world belongs to God I took exception to some verses in many of the hymns that I loved the most I had my own mental reservations with regard even to that glorious chant of the ages Jerusalem my happy home Name ever dear to me I always wanted to skip one half of the third stanza as it stood in our Hymn Book Where congregations ne er break up And Sabbaths have no end I did not want it to be Sabbath day always I was conscious of a pleasure in the thought of games and frolics and coming week day delights that would flit across my mind even when I was studying my hymns or trying to listen to the minister And I did want the congregation to break up some time Indeed in those bright spring days the last hymn in the afternoon always sounded best because with it came the opening of doors into the outside air and the pouring in of a mingled scent of sea winds and apple blossoms like an invitation out into the freedom of the beach the hillsides the fields and gardens and orchards In all this I felt as if I were very wicked I was afraid that I loved earth better than I did heaven Nevertheless I always did welcome that last hymn announced to be sung with the Doxology usually in long metre to the tune of Old Hundred There were certain mysterious preliminaries the rustling of singing book leaves the sliding of the short screen curtains before the singers along by their clinking rings and now and then a premonitory groan or squeak from bass viol or violin as if the instruments were clearing their throats and finally the sudden uprising of that long row of heads in the singing seats My tallest and prettiest grown up sister Louise stood there among them and of all those girlish blooming faces I thought hers the very handsomest But she did not open her lips wide enough to satisfy me I could not see that she was singing at all To stand up there and be one of the choir seemed to me very little short of promotion to the ranks of cherubim and seraphim I quite envied that tall pretty sister of mine I was sure that I should open my mouth wide if I could only be in her place Alas the years proved that much as I loved the hymns there was no music in me to give them voice except to very indulgent ears Some of us must wait for the best human gifts until we come to heavenly places Our natural desire for musical utterance is perhaps a prophecy that in a perfect world we shall all know how to sing But it is something to feel music if we cannot make it That in itself is a kind of unconscious singing As I think back to my childhood it seems to me as if the air was full of hymns as it was of the fragrance of clover blossoms and the songs of bluebirds and robins and the deep undertone of the sea And the purity the calmness and the coolness of the dear old Sabbath days seems lingering yet in the words of those familiar hymns whenever I bear them sung Their melody penetrates deep into my life assuming me that I have not left the green pastures and the still waters of my childhood very far behind me

a spiritual freshness which has nothing to do with time or decay IV NAUGHTY CHILDREN AND FAIRY TALES ALTHOUGH the children of an earlier time heard a great deal of theological discussion which meant little or nothing to them there was one thing that was made clear and emphatic in all the Puritan training that the heavens and earth stood upon firm foundations upon the Moral Law as taught in the Old Testament and confirmed by the New Whatever else we did not understand we believed that to disobey our parents to lie or steal had been forbidden by a Voice which was not to be gainsaid People who broke or evaded these commands did so willfully and without excusing themselves or being excused by others I think most of us expected the fate of Ananias and Sapphira if we told what we knew was a falsehood There were reckless exceptions however A playmate of whom I was quite fond was once asked in my presence whether she had done something forbidden which I knew she had been about only a little while before She answered No and without any apparent hesitation After the person who made the inquiry had gone I exclaimed with horrified wonder How could you Her reply was Oh I only kind of said no What a real lie was to her if she understood a distinct denial of the truth as only kind of lying it perplexed me to imagine The years proved that this lack of moral perception was characteristic and nearly spoiled a nature full of beautiful gifts I could not deliberately lie but I had my own temptations which I did not always successfully resist I remember the very spot in a footpath through a green field where I first met the Eighth Commandment and felt it looking me full in the face I suppose I was five or six years old I had begun to be trusted with errands one of them was to go to a farmhouse for a quart of milk every morning to purchase which I went always to the money drawer in the shop and took out four cents We were allowed to take a small brown biscuit or a date or a fig or a gibraltar sometimes but we well understood that we could not help ourselves to money Now there was a little painted sugar equestrian in a shop window down town which I had seen and set my heart upon I had learned that its price was two cents and one morning as I passed around the counter with my tin pail I made up my mind to possess myself of that amount My father s back was turned he was busy at his desk with account books and ledgers I counted out four cents aloud but took six and started on my errand with a fascinating picture before me of that pink and green horseback rider as my very own I cannot imagine what I meant to do with him I knew that his paint was poisonous and I could not have intended to eat him there were much better candies in my father s window he would not sell these dangerous painted toys to children But the little man was pretty to look at and I wanted him and meant to have him It was just a child s first temptation to get possession of what was not her own the same ugly temptation that produces the defaulter the burglar and the highway robber and that made it necessary to declare to every human being the law Thou shalt not covet As I left the shop I was conscious of a certain pleasure in the success of my attempt as any thief might be and I walked off very fast clattering the coppers in the tin pail When I was fairly through the bars that led into the farmer s field and nobody was in sight I took out my purloined pennies and looked at them as they lay in my palm Then a strange thing happened It was a bright morning but it seemed to me as if the sky grew suddenly dark and those two pennies began to burn through my hand to scorch me as if they were red hot to my very soul It was agony to hold them I laid them down under a tuft of grass in the footpath and ran as if I had left a demon behind me I did my errand and returning I looked about in the grass for the two cents wondering whether they could make me feel so badly again But my good angel hid them from me I never found them I was too much of a coward to confess my fault to my father I had already begun to think of him as an austere man like him in the parable of the talents I should have been a much happier child if I bad confessed for I had to carry about with me for weeks and months a heavy burden of shame I thought of myself as a thief and used to dream of being carried off to jail and condemned to the gallows for my offense one of my story books told about a boy who was hanged at Tyburn for stealing and how was I better than he Whatever naughtiness I was guilty of afterwards I never again wanted to take what belonged to another whether in the family or out of it I hated the sight of the little sugar horseback rider from that day and was thankful enough when some other child had bought him and left his place in the window vacant About this time I used to lie awake nights a good deal wondering what became of infants who were wicked I had heard it said that all who died in infancy went to heaven but it was also said that those who sinned could not possibly go to heaven I understood from talks I had listened to among older people that infancy lasted until children were about twelve years of age Yet here was I an infant of less than six years who had committed a sin I did not know what to do with my own case I doubted whether it would do any good for me to pray to be forgiven but I did pray because I could not help it though not aloud I believe I preferred thinking my prayers to saying them almost always Inwardly I objected to the idea of being an infant it seemed to me like being nothing in particular neither a child nor a little girl neither a baby nor a woman Having discovered that I was capable of being wicked I thought it would be better if I could grow up at once and assume my own responsibilities It quite demoralized me when people talked in my presence about innocent little children There was much questioning in those days as to whether fictitious reading was good for children To tell a story was one equivalent expression for lying But those who came nearest to my child life recognized the value of truth as impressed through the imagination and left me in delightful freedom among my fairy tale books I think I saw a difference from the first between the old poetic legends and a modern lie especially if this latter was the invention of a fancy as youthful as my own I supposed that the beings of those imaginative tales had lived some time somewhere perhaps they still existed in foreign countries which were all a realm of fancy to me I was certain that they could not inhabit our matter of fact neighborhood I had never heard that any fairies or elves came over with the Pilgrims in the Mayflower But a little red haired playmate with whom I became intimate used to take me off with her into the fields where sitting on the edge of a disused cartway fringed with pussy clover she poured into my ears the most remarkable narratives of acquaintances she had made with people who lived under the ground close by us in my father s orchard Her literal descriptions quite deceived me I swallowed her stories entire just as people in the last century did Defoe s account of The Apparition of missus Veal She said that these subterranean people kept house and that they invited her down to play with their children on Wednesday and Saturday afternoons also that they sometimes left a plate of cakes and tarts for her at their door she offered to show me the very spot where it was under a great apple tree which my brothers called the luncheon tree because we used to rest and refresh ourselves there when we helped my father weed his vegetable garden But she guarded herself by informing me that it would be impossible for us to open the door ourselves that it could only be unfastened from the inside She told me these people s names a mister Pelican and a mister Apple tree Manasseh who had a very large family of little Manassehs She said that there was a still larger family some of them probably living just under the spot where we sat whose surname was Hokes If either of us had been familiar with another word pronounced in the same way though spelled differently I should since have thought that she was all the time laughing in her sleeve at my easy belief These Hokeses were not good natured people she added whispering to me that we must not speak about them aloud as they had sharp ears and might overhear us and do us mischief I think she was hoaxing herself as well as me it was her way of being a heroine in her own eyes and mine and she had always the manner of being entirely in earnest But she became more and more romantic in her inventions A distant aristocratic looking mansion which we could see half hidden by trees across the river she assured me was a haunted house and that she had passed many a night there seeing unaccountable sights and hearing mysterious sounds She further announced that she was to be married some time to a young man who lived over there I inferred that the marriage was to take place whenever the ghostly tenants of the house would give their consent She revealed to me under promise of strict secrecy the young man s name It was Alonzo Not long after I picked up a book which one of my sisters had borrowed called Alonzo and Melissa and I discovered that she had been telling me page after page of Melissa s adventures as if they were her own The fading memory I have of the book is that it was a very silly one and when I discovered that the rest of the romantic occurrences she had related not in that volume were to be found in The Children of the Abbey I left off listening to her I do not think I regarded her stories as lies I only lost my interest in them after I knew that they were all of her own clumsy second hand making up out of the most commonplace material My two brothers liked to play upon my credulity When my brother Ben pointed up to the gilded weather cock on the Old South steeple and said to me with a very grave face Did you know that whenever that cock crows every rooster in town crows too I listened out at the window and asked But when will he begin to crow Oh roosters crow in the night sometimes when you are asleep Then my younger brother would break in with a shout of delight at my stupidity I ll tell you when goosie The next day after never When the dead ducks fly over the river But this must have been when I was very small for I remember thinking that the next day after never would come some time in millions of years perhaps And how queer it would be to see dead ducks flying through the air Witches were seldom spoken of in the presence of us children We sometimes overheard a snatch of a witch story told in whispers by the flickering firelight just as we were being sent off to bed But to the older people those legends were too much like realities and they preferred not to repeat them Indeed it was over our town that the last black shadow of the dreadful witchcraft delusion had rested Mistress Hale s house was just across the burying ground and Gallows Hill was only two miles away beyond the bridge Yet I never really knew what the Salem Witchcraft was until Goodrich s History of the United States was put into my hands as a schoolbook and I read about it there Elves and gnomes and air sprites and genii were no strangers to us for my sister Emilie she who heard me say my hymns and taught me to write was mistress of an almost limitless fund of imaginative lore She was a very Scheherezade of story tellers so her younger sisters thought who listened to her while twilight grew into moonlight evening after evening with fascinated wakefulness Besides the tales that the child world of all ages is familiar with Red Riding Hood the Giant Killer Cinderella Aladdin the Sleeping Beauty and the rest she had picked up somewhere most of the folk stories of Ireland and Scotland and also the wild legends of Germany which latter were not then made into the compact volumes known among juvenile readers of to day as Grimm s Household Tales Her choice was usually judicious she omitted the ghosts and goblins that would have haunted our dreams although I was now and then visited by a nightmare consciousness of being a bewitched princess who must perform some impossible task such as turning a whole roomful of straws into gold one by one or else lose my head But she blended the humorous with the romantic in her selections so that we usually dropped to sleep in good spirits if not with a laugh That old story of the fisherman who had done the Man of the Sea a favor and was to be rewarded by having his wish granted she told in so quaintly realistic a way that I thought it might all have happened on one of the islands out in Massachusetts Bay The fisherman was foolish enough it seemed to let his wife do all his wishing for him and she unsatisfied still though she had been made first an immensely rich woman and then a great queen at last sent her husband to ask that they two might be made rulers over the sun moon and stars As my sister went on with the story I could see the waves grow black and could hear the wind mutter and growl while the fisherman called for the first second and then reluctantly for the third time O Man of the Sea Come listen to me For Alice my wife The plague of my life Has sent me to beg a boon of thee As his call died away on the sullen wind the mysterious Man of the Sea rose in his wrath out of the billows and said Go back to your old mud hut and stay there with your wife Alice and never come to trouble me again I sympathized with the Man of the Sea in his righteous indignation at the conduct of the greedy grasping woman and the moral of the story remained with me as the story itself did I think I understood dimly even then that mean avarice and self seeking ambition always find their true level in muddy earth never among the stars So it proved that my dear mother sister was preparing me for life when she did not know it when she thought she was only amusing me This sister though only just entering her teens was toughening herself by all sorts of unnecessary hardships for whatever might await her womanhood She used frequently to sleep in the garret on a hard wooden sea chest instead of in a bed And she would get up before daylight and run over into the burying ground barefooted and white robed we lived for two or three years in another house than our own where the oldest graveyard in town was only separated from us by our garden fence to see if there were any ghosts there she told us Returning noiselessly herself a smiling phantom with long golden brown hair rippling over her shoulders she would drop a trophy upon her little sisters pillow in the shape of a big yellow apple that had dropped from the Colonel s pumpkin sweeting tree into the graveyard close to our fence She was fond of giving me surprises of watching my wonder at seeing anything beautiful or strange for the first time Once when I was very little she made me supremely happy by rousing me before four o clock in the morning dressing me hurriedly and taking me out with her for a walk across the graveyard and through the dewy fields The birds were singing and the sun was just rising and we were walking toward the east hand in hand when suddenly there appeared before us what looked to me like an immense blue wall stretching right and left as far as I could see Oh what is it the wall of I cried It was a revelation she had meant for me So you did not know it was the sea little girl she said It was a wonderful illusion to My unaccustomed eyes and I took in at that moment for the first time something of the real grandeur of the ocean Not a sail was in sight and the blue expanse was scarcely disturbed by a ripple for it was the high tide calm That morning s freshness that vision of the sea I know I can never lose From our garret window and the garret was my usual retreat when I wanted to get away by myself with my books or my dreams we had the distant horizon line of the bay across a quarter of a mile of trees and mowing fields We could see the white breakers dashing against the long narrow island just outside of the harbor which I with my childish misconstruction of names called Breakers Island supposing that the grown people had made a mistake when they spoke of it as Baker s But that far off shining band of silver and blue seemed so different from the whole great sea stretching out as if into eternity from the feet of the baby on the shore The marvel was not lessened when I began to study geography and comprehended that the world is round Could it really be that we had that endless Atlantic Ocean to look at from our window to dance along the edge of to wade into or bathe in if we chose The map of the world became more interesting to me than any of the story books In my fanciful explorations I out traveled Captain Cook the only voyager around the world with whose name my childhood was familiar The field paths were safe and I was allowed to wander off alone through them I greatly enjoyed the freedom of a solitary explorer among the seashells and wild flowers There were wonders everywhere One day I picked up a star fish on the beach we called it a five finger and hung him on a tree to dry not thinking of him as a living creature When I went some time after to take him down he had clasped with two or three of his fingers the bough where I laid him so that he could not be removed without breaking his hardened shell My conscience smote me when I saw what an unhappy looking skeleton I had made of him I overtook the horse shoe crab on the sands but I did not like to turn him over and make him say his prayers as some of the children did I thought it must be wicked And then he looked so uncomfortable imploringly wriggling his claws while he lay upon his back I believe I did however make a small collection of the shells of stranded horseshoe crabs deserted by their tenants There were also pretty canary colored cockle shells and tiny purple mussels washed up by the tide I gathered them into my apron and carried them home and only learned that they too held living inhabitants by seeing a dead snail protruding from every shell after they had been left to themselves for a day or two This made me careful to pick up only the empty ones and there were plenty of them One we called a butterboat it had something shaped like a seat across the end of it on the inside And the curious sea urchin that looked as if he was made only for ornament when he had once got rid of his spines and the transparent jelly fish that seemed to have no more right to be alive than a ladleful of mucilage and the razor shells and the barnacles and the knotted kelp and the flabby green sea aprons there was no end to the interesting things I found when I was trusted to go down to the edge of the tide alone The tide itself was the greatest marvel slipping away so noiselessly and creeping back so softly over the flats whispering as it reached the sands and laughing aloud I am coming as dashing against the rocks it drove me back to where the sea lovage and purple beach peas had dared to root themselves I listened and felt through all my little being that great surging word of power but had no guess of its meaning I can think of it now as the eternal voice of Law ever returning to the green blossoming beautiful verge of Gospel truth to confirm its later revelation and to say that Law and Gospel belong together The sea is His and He made it and His hands formed the dry land And the dry land the very dust of the earth every day revealed to me some new miracle of a flower Coming home from school one warm noon I chanced to look down and saw for the first time the dry roadside all starred with lavender tinted flowers scarcely larger than a pin head fairy flowers indeed prettier than anything that grew in gardens It was the red sand wort but why a purple flower should be called red I do not know I remember holding these little amethystine blossoms like jewels in the palm of my hand and wondering whether people who walked along that road knew what beautiful things they were treading upon I never found the flower open except at noonday when the sun was hottest The rest of the time it was nothing but an insignificant dusty leaved weed a weed that was transformed into a flower only for an hour or two every day It seemed like magic The busy people at home could tell me very little about the wild flowers and when I found a new one I thought I was its discoverer I can see myself now leaning in ecstasy over a small rough leaved purple aster in a lonely spot on the hill and thinking that nobody else in all the world had ever beheld such a flower before because I never had I did not know then that the flower generations are older than the human race The commonest blossoms were after all the dearest because they were so familiar Very few of us lived upon carpeted floors but soft green grass stretched away from our door steps all golden with dandelions in spring Those dandelion fields were like another heaven dropped down upon the earth where our feet wandered at will among the stars What need had we of luxurious upholstery when we could step out into such splendor from the humblest door The dandelions could tell us secrets too We blew the fuzz off their gray beads and made them answer our question Does my mother want me to come home Or we sat down together in the velvety grass and wove chains for our necks and wrists of the dandelion sterns and made believe we were brides or queens or empresses Then there was the white rock saxifrage that filled the crevices of the ledges with soft tufty bloom like lingering snow drifts our May flower that brought us the first message of spring There was an elusive sweetness in its almost imperceptible breath which one could only get by smelling it in close bunches Its companion was the tiny four cleft innocence flower that drifted pale sky tints across the chilly fields Both came to us in crowds and looked out with us as they do with the small girls and boys of to day from the windy crest of Powder House Hill the one playground of my childhood which is left to the children and the cows just as it was then We loved these little democratic blossoms that gathered around us in mobs at our May Day rejoicings It is doubtful whether we should have loved the trailing arbutus any better had it strayed as it never did into our woods Violets and anemones played at hide and seek with us in shady places The gay columbine rooted herself among the bleak rocks and laughed and nodded in the face of the east wind coquettishly wasting the show of her finery on the frowning air Bluebirds twittered over the dandelions in spring In midsummer goldfinches warbled among the thistle tops and high above the bird congregations the song sparrow sent forth her clear warm penetrating trill sunshine translated into music We were not surfeited in those days with what is called pleasure but we grew up happy and healthy learning unconsciously the useful lesson of doing without The birds and blossoms hardly won a gladder or more wholesome life from the air of our homely New England than we did Out of the strong came forth sweetness The Beatitudes are the natural flowering forth of the Ten Commandments And the happiness of our lives was rooted in the stern vigorous virtues of the people we lived among drawing thence its bloom and song and fragrance There was granite in their character and beliefs but it was granite that could smile in the sunshine and clothe itself with flowers We little ones felt the firm rock beneath us and were lifted up on it to emulate their goodness and to share their aspirations V OLD NEW ENGLAND WHEN I first opened my eyes upon my native town it was already nearly two hundred years old counting from the time when it was part of the original Salem settlement old enough to have gained a character and an individuality of its own as it certainly had We children felt at once that we belonged to the town as we did to our father or our mother The sea was its nearest neighbor and penetrated to every fireside claiming close intimacy with every home and heart The farmers up and down the shore were as much fishermen as farmers they were as familiar with the Grand Banks of Newfoundland as they were with their own potato fields Every third man you met in the street you might safely hail as Shipmate or Skipper or Captain My father s early seafaring experience gave him the latter title to the end of his life It was hard to keep the boys from going off to sea before they were grown No inland occupation attracted them Land lubber was one of the most contemptuous epithets heard from boyish lips The spirit of adventure developed in them a rough breezy type of manliness now almost extinct Men talked about a voyage to Calcutta or Hong Kong or up the Straits meaning Gibraltar and the Mediterranean as if it were not much more than going to the next village It seemed as if our nearest neighbors lived over there across the water we breathed the air of foreign countries curiously interblended with our own The women of well to do families had Canton crape shawls and Smyrna silks and Turk satins for Sabbath day wear which somebody had brought home for them Mantel pieces were adorned with nautilus and conch shells and with branches and fans of coral and children had foreign curiosities and treasures of the sea for playthings There was one imported shell that we did not value much it was so abundant the freckled univalve they called a prop Yet it had a mysterious interest for us little ones We held it to our ears and listened for the sound of the waves which we were told that it still kept and always would keep I remember the time when I thought that the ocean was really imprisoned somewhere within that narrow aperture We were accustomed to seeing barrels full of cocoa nuts rolled about and there were jars of preserved tropical fruits tamarinds ginger root and other spicy appetizers almost as common as barberries and cranberries in the cupboards of most housekeepers I wonder what has become of those many many little red guinea peas we had to play with It never seemed as if they really belonged to the vegetable world notwithstanding their name We had foreign coins mixed in with our large copper cents all kinds from the Russian kopeck to the half penny token of Great Britain Those were the days when we had half cents in circulation to make change with For part of our currency was the old fashioned ninepence twelve and a half cents and the four pence ha penny six cents and a quarter There was a good deal of Old England about us still And we had also many living reminders of strange lands across the sea Green parrots went scolding and laughing down the thimbleberry hedges that bordered the cornfields as much at home out of doors as within Java sparrows and canaries and other tropical songbirds poured their music out of sunny windows into the street delighting the ears of passing school children long before the robins came Now and then somebody s pet monkey would escape along the stone walls and shed roofs and try to hide from his boy persecutors by dodging behind a chimney or by slipping through an open scuttle to the terror and delight of juveniles whose premises he invaded And there were wanderers from foreign countries domesticated in many families whose swarthy complexions and un Caucasian features became familiar in our streets Mongolians Africans and waifs from the Pacific islands who always were known to us by distinguished names Hector and Scipio and Julius Caesar and Christopher Columbus Families of black people were scattered about the place relics of a time when even New England had not freed her slaves Some of them had belonged in my great grandfather s family and they hung about the old homestead at The Farms long after they were at liberty to go anywhere they pleased There was a Rose and a Phillis among them who came often to our house to bring luscious high blackberries from the Farms woods or to do the household washing They seemed pathetically out of place although they lived among us on equal terms respectable and respected The pathos of the sea haunted the town made audible to every ear when a coming northeaster brought the rote of the waves in from the islands across the harbor bar with a moaning like that we heard when we listened for it in the shell Almost every house had its sea tragedy Somebody belonging to it had been shipwrecked or had sailed away one day and never returned Our own part of the bay was so sheltered by its islands that there were seldom any disasters heard of near home although the names of the two nearest Great and Little Misery are said to have originated with a shipwreck so far back in the history of the region that it was never recorded But one such calamity happened in my infancy spoken of always by those who knew its victims in subdued tones the wreck of the Persia The vessel was returning from the Mediterranean and in a blinding snow storm on a wild March night her captain probably mistook one of the Cape Ann light houses for that on Baker s Island and steered straight upon the rocks in a lonely cove just outside the cape In the morning the bodies of her dead crew were found tossing about with her cargo of paper manufacturers rags among the breakers Her captain and mate were Beverly men and their funeral from the meeting house the next Sabbath was an event which long left its solemnity hanging over the town We were rather a young nation at this time The History of the United States could only tell the story of the American Revolution of the War of eighteen twelve and of the administration of about half a dozen presidents Our republicanism was fresh and wide awake The edge of George Washington s little hatchet had not yet been worn down to its latter day dullness it flashed keenly on our young eyes and ears in the reading books and through Fourth of July speeches The Father of his Country had been dead only a little more than a quarter of a century and General Lafayette was still alive he had indeed passed through our town but a few years before and had been publicly welcomed under our own elms and lindens Even babies echoed the names of our two heroes in their prattle We had great training days when drum and fife took our ears by storm When the militia and the Light Infantry mustered and marched through the streets to the Common with boys and girls at their heels such girls as could get their mother s consent or the courage to run off without it We never could But we always managed to get a good look at the show in one way or another Old Election Lection Day we called it a lost holiday now was a general training day and it came at our most delightful season the last of May Lilacs and tulips were in bloom then and it was a picturesque fashion of the time for little girls whose parents had no flower gardens to go around begging a bunch of lilacs or a tulip or two My mother always made Lection cake for us on that day It was nothing but a kind of sweetened bread with a shine of egg and molasses on top but we thought it delicious The Fourth of July and Thanksgiving Day were the only other holidays that we made much account of and the former was a far more well behaved festival than it is in modern times The bells rang without stint and at morning and noon cannon were fired off But torpedoes and fire crackers did not make the highways dangerous perhaps they were thought too expensive an amusement Somebody delivered an oration there was a good deal said about this universal Yankee nation some rockets went up from Salem in the evening we watched them from the hill and then went to bed feeling that we had been good patriots There was always a Fast Day which I am afraid most of us younger ones regarded merely as a day when we were to eat unlimited quantities of molasses gingerbread instead of sitting down to our regular meals When I read about Christmas in the English story books I wished we could have that beautiful holiday But our Puritan fathers shook their heads at Christmas Our Sabbath school library books were nearly all English reprints and many of the story books were very interesting I think that most of my favorites were by missus Sherwood Some of them were about life in India Little Henry and his Bearer and Ayah and Lady Then there were The Hedge of Thorns Theophilus and Sophia Anna Ross and a whole series of little English books that I took great delight in I had begun to be rather introspective and somewhat unhealthily self critical contrasting myself meanwhile with my sister Lida just a little older who was my usual playmate and whom I admired very much for what I could not help seeing her unusual sweetness of disposition I read missus Sherwood s Infant s Progress and I made a personal application of it picturing myself as the naughty willful Playful and my sister Lida as the saintly little Peace This book gave me a morbid unhappy feeling while yet it had something of the fascination of the Pilgrim s Progress of which it is an imitation I fancied myself followed about by a fiend like boy who haunted its pages called Inbred Sin and the story implied that there was no such thing as getting rid of him I began to dislike all boys on his account There was one who tormented my sister and me we only knew him by name by jumping out at us from behind doorways or fences on our way to school making horrid faces at us Inbred Sin I was certain looked just like him and the two strangely blended in one hideous presence were the worst nightmare of my dreams There was too much reality about that Inbreed Sin I felt that I was acquainted with him He was the hateful hero of the little allegory as Satan is of Paradise Lost I liked lessons that came to me through fables and fairy tales although in reading Aesop I invariably skipped the moral pinned on at the end and made one for myself or else did without missus Lydia Maria Child s story of The Immortal Fountain in the Girl s Own Book which it was the joy of my heart to read although it preached a searching sermon to me I applied in the same way that I did the Infant s Progress I thought of Lida as the gentle unselfish Rose and myself as the ugly Marion She was patient and obliging and I felt that I was the reverse She was considered pretty and I knew that I was the reverse of that too I wondered if Lida really had bathed in the Immortal Fountain and oh how I wished I could find the way there But I feared that trying to do so would be of no use the fairies would cross their wands to keep me back and their wings would darken at my approach The book that I loved first and best and lived upon in my childhood was Pilgrim s Progress It was as a story that I cared for it although I knew that it meant something more something that was already going on in my own heart and life Oh how I used to wish that I too could start off on a pilgrimage It would be so much easier than the continual discouraging struggle to be good The lot I most envied was that of the contented Shepherd Boy in the Valley of Humiliation singing his cheerful songs and wearing the herb called Heart s Ease in his bosom but all the glorious ups and downs of the Progress I would gladly have shared with Christiana and her children never desiring to turn aside into any By Path Meadow while mister Great Heart led the way and the Shining Ones came down to meet us along the road It was one of the necessities of my nature as a child to have some one being real or ideal man or woman before whom I inwardly bowed down and worshiped mister Great Heart was the perfect hero of my imagination Nobody in books or out of them compared with him I wondered if there were really any mister Great Hearts to be met with among living men I remember reading this beloved book once in a snow storm and looking up from it out among the white wandering flakes with a feeling that they had come down from heaven as its interpreters that they were trying to tell me in their airy up and down flight the story of innumerable souls I tried to fix my eye on one particular flake and to follow its course until it touched the earth But I found that I could not A little breeze was stirring an the flake seemed to go and return to descend and then ascend again as if hastening homeward to the sky losing itself at last in the airy infinite throng and leaving me filled with thoughts of that great multitude which no man could number clothed with white robes crowding so gloriously into the closing pages of the Bible Oh if I could only be sure that I should some time be one of that invisible company But the heavens were already beginning to look a great way off I hummed over one of my best loved hymns Who are these in bright array and that seemed to bring them nearer again The history of the early martyrs the persecutions of the Waldenses and of the Scotch Covenanters I read and re read with longing emulation Why could not I be a martyr too It would be so beautiful to die for the truth as they did as Jesus did I did not understand then that He lived and died to show us what life really means and to give us true life like His the life of love to God with all our hearts of love to all His human children for His sake and that to live this life faithfully is greater even than to die a martyr s death It puzzled me to know what some of the talk I heard about being a Christian could mean I saw that it was something which only men and women could comprehend And yet they taught me to say those dear words of the Master Suffer the little children to come unto Me Surely He meant what He said He did not tell the children that they must receive the kingdom of God like grown people He said that everybody must enter into it as a little child But our fathers were stalwart men with many foes to encounter If anybody ever needed a grown up religion they surely did and it became them well Most of our every day reading also came to us over the sea Miss Edgworth s juvenile stories were in general circulation and we knew Harry and Lucy and Rosamond almost as well as we did our own playmates But we did not think those English children had so good a time as we did they had to be so prim and methodical It seemed to us that the little folks across the water never were allowed to romp and run wild some of us may have held a vague idea that this freedom of ours was the natural inheritance of republican children only Primroses and cowslips and daisies bloomed in these pleasant story books of ours and we went a Maying there with our transatlantic playmates I think we sometimes started off with our baskets expecting to find those English flowers in our own fields How should children be wiser than to look for every beautiful thing they have heard of on home ground And indeed our commonest field flowers were many of them importations from the mother country clover and dandelions and ox eye daisies I was delighted when my mother told me one day that a yellow flower I brought her was a cowslip for I thought she meant that it was the genuine English cowslip which I had read about I was disappointed to learn that it was a native blossom the marsh marigold My sisters had some books that I appropriated to myself a great deal Paul and Virginia Elizabeth or the Exiles of Siberia Nina an Icelandic Tale with the Vicar of Wakefield the Tour to the Hebrides Gulliver s Travels the Arabian Nights and some odd volumes of Sir Walter Scott s novels I read the Scottish Chiefs my first novel when I was about five years old So absorbed was I in the sorrows of Lady Helen Mar and Sir William Wallace that I crept into a corner where nobody would notice me and read on through sunset into moonlight with eyes blurred with tears I did not feel that I was doing anything wrong for I had heard my father say he was willing his daughters should read that one novel He probably did not intend the remark for the ears of his youngest however My appetite for reading was omnivorous and I devoured a great many romances My sisters took them from a circulating library many more perhaps than came to my parents knowledge but it was not often that one escaped me wherever it was hidden I did not understand what I was reading to be sure and that was one of the best and worst things about it The sentimentalism of some of those romances was altogether unchildlike but I did not take much of it in It was the habit of running over pages and pages to get to the end of a story the habit of reading without caring what I read that I know to have been bad for my mind To use a nautical expression my brain was in danger of getting water logged There are so many more books of fiction written nowadays I do not see how the young people who try to read one tenth of them have any brains left for every day use One result of my infantile novel reading was that I did not like to look at my own face in a mirror because it was so unlike that of heroines always pictured with high white foreheads and cheeks of a perfect oval Mine was round ruddy and laughing with health and though I practiced at the glass a good deal I could not lengthen it by puckering down my lips I quite envied the little girls who were pale and pensive looking as that was the only ladyfied standard in the romances Of course the chief pleasure of reading them was that of identifying myself with every new heroine They began to call me a bookworm at home I did not at all relish the title It was fortunate for me that I liked to be out of doors a great deal and that I had a brother John who was willing to have me for an occasional companion Sometimes he would take me with him when he went huckleberrying up the rural Montserrat Road through Cat Swamp to the edge of Burnt Hills and Beaver Pond He had a boy s pride in explaining these localities to me making me understand that I had a guide who was familiar with every inch of the way Then charging me not to move until he came back he would leave me sitting alone on a great craggy rock while he went off and filled his basket out of sight among the bushes Indeed I did not want to move it was all so new and fascinating The tall pine trees whispering to each other across the sky openings above me the graceful ferns the velvet mosses dotted with scarlet fairy cups as if the elves had just spread their table for tea the unspeakable charm of the spice breathing air all wove a web of enchantment about me from which I had no wish to disentangle myself The silent spell of the woods held me with a power stronger even than that of the solemn voiced sea Sometimes this same brother would get permission to take me on a longer excursion to visit the old homestead at The Farms Three or four miles was not thought too long a walk for a healthy child of five years and that road in the old time led through a rural Paradise beautiful at every season whether it were the time of song sparrows and violets of wild roses of coral hung barberry bushes or of fallen leaves and snow drifts The wildness of the road now exchanged for elegant modern cultivation was its great charm to us We stopped at the Cove Brook to hear the cat birds sing and at Mingo s Beach to revel in the sudden surprise of the open sea and to listen to the chant of the waves always stronger and grander there than anywhere along the shore We passed under dark wooded cliffs out into sunny openings the last of which held under its skirting pines the secret of the prettiest woodpath to us in all the world the path to the ancestral farmhouse We found children enough to play with there as numerous a family as our own We were sometimes I fancy the added drop too much of already overflowing juvenility Farther down the road where the cousins were all grown up men and women Aunt Betsey s cordial old fashioned hospitality sometimes detained us a day or two We watched the milking and fed the chickens and fared gloriously Aunt Betsey could not have done more to entertain us had we been the President s children I have always cherished the memory of a certain pair of large bowed spectacles that she wore and of the green calash held by a ribbon bridle that sheltered her head when she walked up from the shore to see us as she often did They announced to us the approach of inexhaustible kindliness and good cheer We took in a home feeling with the words Aunt Betsey then and always She had just the husband that belonged to her in my Uncle David an upright man frank faced large hearted and spiritually minded He was my father s favorite brother and to our branch of the family The Farms meant Uncle David and Aunt Betsey My brother John s plans for my entertainment did not always harmonize entirely with my own ideas He had an inventive mind and wanted me to share his boyish sports But I did not like to ride in a wheelbarrow nor to walk on stilts nor even to coast down the hill on his sled and I always got a tumble if I tried for I was rather a clumsy child besides I much preferred girls quieter games We were seldom permitted to play with any boys except our brothers I drew the inference that our boys must be a great deal better than the other boys My brother John had some fine play fellows but he seemed to consider me in the way when they were his guests Occasionally we would forget that the neighbor boys were not girls and would find ourselves all playing together in delightful unconsciousness although possibly a thought like that of the Ettrick Shepherd may now and then have flitted through the mind of some masculine juvenile Why the boys should drive away Little sweet maidens from the play Or love to banter and fight so well That Is the thing I never could tell One day I thoughtlessly accepted an invitation to get through a gap in the garden fence to where the doctor s two boys were preparing to take an imaginary sleigh ride in midsummer The sleigh was stranded among tall weeds an cornstalks but I was politely handed in by the elder boy who sat down by my side and tucked his little brother in front at our feet informing me that we were father and mother and little son going to take a ride to Newburyport He had found an old pair of reins and tied them to a saw horse that he switched and Gee up ed vigorously The journey was as brief as delightful I ran home feeling like the heroine of an elopement asking myself meanwhile What would my brother John say if he knew I had been playing with boys He was very particular about his sisters behavior But I incautiously said to one sister in whom I did not usually confide that I thought James was the nicest boy in the lane and that I liked his little brother Charles too She laughed at me so unmercifully for making the remark that I never dared look towards the gap in the fence again beyond which I could hear the boys voices around the old sleigh where they were playing entirely forgetful of their former traveling companion Still I continued to think that my courteous cavalier James was the nicest boy in the lane My brother s vigilant care of his two youngest sisters was once the occasion to them of a serious fright My grandfather the sexton sometimes trusted him to toll the bell for a funeral In those days the bell was tolled for everybody who died John was social and did not like to go up into the belfry and stay an hour or so alone and as my grandfather positively forbade him to take any other boy up there he one day got permission for us two little girls to go with him for company We had to climb up a great many stairs and the last flight was inclosed by a rough door with a lock inside which he was charged to fasten so that no mischievous boys should follow It was strange to be standing up there in the air gazing over the balcony railing down into the street where the men and women looked so small and across to the water and the ships in the east and the clouds and hills in the west But when he struck the tongue against the great bell close to our ears it was more than we were prepared for The little sister scarcely three years old screamed and shrieked I shall be stunned ded I shall be stunned ded I do not know where she had picked up that final syllable but it made her terror much more emphatic Still the great waves of solemn sound went eddying on over the hills and over the sea and we had to hear it all though we stopped our ears with our fingers It was an immense relief to us when the last stroke of the passing bell was struck and John said we could go down He took the key from his pocket and was fitting it into the lock when it slipped beyond our reach Now the little sister cried again and would not be pacified and when I looked up and caught John s blank dismayed look I began to feel like crying too The question went swiftly through my mind How many days can we stay up here without starving to death for I really thought we should never get down out of our prison in the air never see our mother s face again But my brother s wits returned to him He led us back to the balcony and shouted over the railing to a boy in the street making him understand that he must go and inform my father that we were locked into the belfry It was not long before we saw both him and my grandfather on their way to the church They came up to the little door and told us to push with our united strength against it The rusty lock soon yielded and how good it was to look into those two beloved human faces once more But we little girls were not invited to join my brother again when he tolled the bell if we had been I think we should have promptly declined the invitation Many of my childish misadventures came to me in connection with my little sister who having been much indulged too it for granted that she could always have what she wanted One day we two were allowed to take a walk together I as the older being supposed to take care of her Although we were going towards the Cove over a secluded road she insisted upon wearing a brand new pair of red morocco boots All went well until we came to a bog by the roadside where sweet flag and cat tails grew Out in the middle of the bog where no venturesome boy had ever attempted their seizure there were many tall fine looking brown cat tails growing She caught sight of them and before I saw what she was doing she had shot from my side like an arrow from the bow and was far out on the black quaking surface that at first upheld her light weight I stood petrified with horror I knew all about that dangerous place I had been told that nobody had ever found out how deep that mud was I was uttered just one imploring Come back when she turned to me with a shriek throwing up her arms towards me She was sinking There was nobody in sight and there was no time to think I ran or rather flew across the bog with just one thought in my mind I have got to get her out Some angel must have prevented me from making a misstep and sinking with her I felt the power of a giant suddenly taking possession of my small frame Quicker than I could tell of it I had given one tremendous pull she had already sunk above her boot tops and had dragged her back to the road It is a marvel to me now how I a child of scarcely six years succeeded in rescuing her It did not seem to me as if I were doing it myself but as if some unseen Power had taken possession of me for a moment and made me do it And I suppose that when we act from a sudden impulse to help another out of trouble it never is ourself that does the good deed The Highest Strength just takes us and uses us I certainly felt equal to going straight through the earth to China after my little sister if she had stink out of sight We were two miserable looking children when we reached home the sticky ooze having changed her feet into unmanageable lumps of mud with which my own clothes also were soiled I had to drag or carry her all the way for she could not or would not walk a step And alas for the morocco boots They were never again red I also received a scolding for not taking better care of my little sister and I was not very soon allowed again to have her company in my rambles We usually joined with other little neighbor girls in some out of door amusement near home And our sports as well as our books had a spice of Merry Old England They were full of kings and queens and made sharp contrasts as well as odd mixtures with the homeliness of our everyday life One of them a sort of rhymed dialogue began with the couplet Queen Anne Queen Anne she sits in the sun As fair as a lady as white as a nun If Queen Anne did not give a right guess as to which hand of the messenger held the king s letter to her she was contemptuously informed that she was as brown as a bun In another name four little girls joined hands across in couples chanting I wish my father were a king I wish my mother were a queen And I a little companion concluding with a close embrace in a dizzying whirl breathlessly shouting all together A bundle of fagots A bundle of fagots In a third which may have begun with a juvenile reacting of the Colonial struggle for liberty we ranged ourselves under two leaders who made an archway over our heads of their lifted hands and arms saying as we passed beneath Lift up the gates as high as the sky And let King George and his army pass by We were told to whisper Oranges or Lemons for a pass word and Oranges always won the larger enlistment whether British or American And then there was Grandmother Gray and the Old woman from Newfoundland With all her children in her hand and the Knight from Spain Inquiring for your daughter Jane and numberless others nearly all of them bearing a distinct Old World flavor One of our play places was an unoccupied end of the burying ground overhung by the Colonel s apple trees and close under his wall so that we should not be too near the grave stones I do not think that death was at all a real thing to me or to my brothers and sisters at this time We lived so near the graveyard that it seemed merely the extension of our garden We wandered there at will trying to decipher the moss grown inscriptions and wondering at the homely carvings of cross bones and cherubs and willow trees on the gray slate stones I did not associate those long green mounds with people who had once lived though we were careful having been so instructed not to step on the graves To ramble about there and puzzle ourselves with the names and dates was like turning over the pages of a curious old book We had not the least feeling of irreverence in taking the edge of the grave yard for our playground It was known as the old burying ground and we children regarded it with a sort of affectionate freedom as we would a grandmother because it was old That indeed was one peculiar attraction of the town itself it was old and it seemed old much older than it does now There was only one main street said to have been the first settlers cowpath to Wenham which might account for its zigzag picturesqueness All the rest were courts or lanes The town used to wear a delightful air of drowsiness as if she had stretched herself out for an afternoon nap with her head towards her old mother Salem and her whole length reclining towards the sea till she felt at her feet through her green robes the clip of the deep water at the Farms All her elder children recognized in her quiet steady going ways a maternal unity and strength of character as of a town that understood her own plans and had settled down to peaceful permanent habits Her spirit was that of most of our Massachusetts coast towns They were transplanted shoots of Old England And it was the voice of a mother country more ancient than their own that little children heard crooning across the sea in their cradle hymns and nursery songs VI GLIMPSES OF POETRY OUR close relationship to Old England was sometimes a little misleading to us juveniles The conditions of our life were entirely different but we read her descriptive stories and sang her songs as if they were true for us too One of the first things I learned to repeat I think it was in the spelling book began with the verse I thank the goodness and the grace That on my birth has smiled And made me in these latter days A happy English child And some lines of a very familiar hymn by doctor Watts ran thus Whene er I take my walks abroad How many poor I see How many children in the street Half naked I behold While I am clothed from head to feet And sheltered from the cold Now a ragged half clothed child or one that could really be called poor in the extreme sense of the word was the rarest of all sights in a thrifty New England town fifty years ago I used to look sharply for those children but I never could see one And a beggar Oh if a real beggar would come along like the one described in Pity the sorrows of a poor old man what a wonderful event that would be I believe I had more curiosity about a beggar and more ignorance too than about a king The poem read A pampered menial drove me from the door What sort of creature could a pampered menial be Nothing that had ever come under our observation corresponded to the words Nor was it easy for us to attach any meaning to the word servant There were women who came in occasionally to do the washing or to help about extra work But they were decently clothed and had homes of their own more or less comfortable and their quaint talk and free and easy ways were often as much of a lift to the household as the actual assistance they rendered I settled down upon the conclusion that rich and poor were book words only describing something far off and having nothing to do with our every day experience My mental definition of rich people from home observation was something like this People who live in three story houses and keep their green blinds closed and hardly ever come out and talk with the folks in the street There were a few such houses in Beverly and a great many in Salem where my mother sometimes took me for a shopping walk But I did not suppose that any of the people who lived near us were very rich like those in books Everybody about us worked and we expected to take hold of our part while young I think we were rather eager to begin for we believed that work would make men and women of us I however was not naturally an industrious child but quite the reverse When my father sent us down to weed his vegetable garden at the foot of the lane I the youngest of his weeders liked to go with the rest but not for the sake of the work or the pay I generally gave it up before I had weeded half a bed It made me so warm and my back did ache so I stole off into the shade of the great apple trees and let the west wind fan my hot cheeks and looked up into the boughs and listened to the many many birds that seemed chattering to each other in a language of their own What was it they were saying and why could not I understand it Perhaps I should sometime I had read of people who did in fairy tales When the others started homeward I followed I did not mind their calling me lazy nor that my father gave me only one tarnished copper cent while Lida received two or three bright ones I had had what I wanted most I would rather sit under the apple trees and hear the birds sing than have a whole handful of bright copper pennies It was well for my father and his garden that his other children were not like me The work which I was born to but had not begun to do was sometimes a serious weight upon my small forecasting brain One of my hymns ended with the lines With books and work and healthful play May my first years be passed That I may give for every day Some good account at last I knew all about the books and the play but the work how should I ever learn to do it My father had always strongly emphasized his wish that all his children girls as well as boys should have some independent means of self support by the labor of their hands that every one should as was the general custom learn a trade Tailor s work the finishing of men s outside garments was the trade learned most frequently by women in those days and one or more of my older sisters worked at it I think it must have been at home for I somehow or somewhere got the idea while I was a small child that the chief end of woman was to make clothing for mankind This thought came over me with a sudden dread one Sabbath morning when I was a toddling thing led along by my sister behind my father and mother As they walked arm in arm before me I lifted my eyes from my father s heels to his head and mused How tall he is and how long his coat looks and how many thousand thousand stitches there must be in his coat and pantaloons And I suppose I have got to grow up and have a husband and put all those little stitches into his coats and pantaloons Oh I never never can do it A shiver of utter discouragement went through me With that task before me it hardly seemed to me as if life were worth living I went on to meeting and I suppose I forgot my trouble in a hymn but for the moment it was real It was not the only time in my life that I have tired myself out with crossing bridges to which I never came Another trial confronted me in the shape of an ideal but impossible patchwork quilt We learned to sew patchwork at school while we were learning the alphabet and almost every girl large or small had a bed quilt of her own begun with an eye to future house furnishing I was not over fond of sewing but I thought it best to begin mine early So I collected a few squares of calico and undertook to put them together in my usual independent way without asking direction I liked assorting those little figured bits of cotton cloth for they were scraps of gowns I had seen worn and they reminded me of the persons who wore them One fragment in particular was like a picture to me It was a delicate pink and brown sea moss pattern on a white ground a piece of a dress belonging to my married sister who was to me bride and angel in One I always saw her face before me when I unfolded this scrap a face with an expression truly heavenly in its loveliness Heaven claimed her before my childhood was ended Her beautiful form was laid to rest in mid ocean too deep to be pillowed among the soft sea mosses But she lived long enough to make a heaven of my childhood whenever she came home One of the sweetest of our familiar hymns I always think of as belonging to her and as a still unbroken bond between her spirit and mine She had come back to us for a brief visit soon after her marriage with some deep new experience of spiritual realities which I a child of four or five years felt in the very tones of her voice and in the expression of her eyes My mother told her of my fondness for the hymn book and she turned to me with a smile and said Won t you learn one hymn for me one hymn that I love very much Would I not She could not guess how happy she made me by wishing me to do anything for her sake The hymn was Whilst Thee I seek protecting Power In a few minutes I repeated the whole to her and its own beauty pervaded with the tenderness of her love for me fixed it at once indelibly in my memory Perhaps I shall repeat it to her again deepened with a lifetime s meaning beyond the sea and beyond the stars I could dream over my patchwork but I could not bring it into conventional shape My sisters whose fingers had been educated called my sewing gobblings I grew disgusted with it myself and gave away all my pieces except the pretty sea moss pattern which I was not willing to see patched up with common calico It was evident that I should never conquer fate with my needle Among other domestic traditions of the old times was the saying that every girl must have a pillow case full of stockings of her own knitting before she was married Here was another mountain before me for I took it for granted that marrying was inevitable one of the things that everybody must do like learning to read or going to meeting I began to knit my own stockings when I ways six or seven years old and kept on until home made stockings went out of fashion The pillow case full however was never attempted any more than the patchwork quilt I heard somebody say one day that there must always be one old maid in every family of girls and I accepted the prophecy of some of my elders that I was to be that one I was rather glad to know that freedom of choice in the matter was possible One day when we younger ones were hanging about my golden haired and golden hearted sister Emilie teasing her with wondering questions about our future she announced to us she had reached the mature age of fifteen years that she intended to be an old maid and that we might all come and live with her Some one listening reproved her but she said Why if they fit themselves to be good helpful cheerful old maids they will certainly be better wives if they ever are married and that maxim I laid by in my memory for future contingencies for I believed in every word she ever uttered She herself however did not carry out her girlish intention Her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her But the little sisters she used to fondle as her babies have never allowed their own years nor her changed relations to cancel their claim upon her motherly sympathies I regard it as a great privilege to have been one of a large family and nearly the youngest We had strong family resemblances and yet no two seemed at all alike It was like rehearsing in a small world each our own part in the great one awaiting us If we little ones occasionally had some severe snubbing mixed with the petting and praising and loving that was wholesome for us and not at all to be regretted Almost every one of my sisters had some distinctive aptitude with her fingers One worked exquisite lace embroidery another had a knack at cutting and fitting her doll s clothing so perfectly that the wooden lady was always a typical specimen of the genteel doll world and another was an expert at fine stitching so delicately done that it was a pleasure to see or to wear anything her needle had touched I had none of these gifts I looked on and admired and sometimes tried to imitate but my efforts usually ended in defeat and mortification I did like to knit however and I could shape a stocking tolerably well My fondness for this kind of work was chiefly because it did not require much thought Except when there was widening or narrowing to be done I did not need to keep my eyes upon it at all So I took a book upon my lap and read and read while the needles clicked on comforting me with the reminder that I was not absolutely unemployed while yet I was having a good time reading I began to know that I liked poetry and to think a good deal about it at my childish work Outside of the hymn book the first rhymes I committed to memory were in the Old Farmer s Almanac files of which hung in the chimney corner and were an inexhaustible source of entertainment to us younger ones My father kept his newspapers also carefully filed away in the garret but we made sad havoc among the Palladiums and other journals that we ought to have kept as antiquarian treasures We valued the anecdote column and the poet s corner only these we clipped unsparingly for our scrap books A tattered copy of Johnson s large Dictionary was a great delight to me on account of the specimens of English versification which I found in the Introduction I learned them as if they were so many poems I used to keep this old volume close to my pillow and I amused myself when I awoke in the morning by reciting its jingling contrasts of iambic and trochaic and dactylic metre and thinking what a charming occupation it must be to make up verses I made my first rhymes when I was about seven years old My brother John proposed writing poetry as a rainy day amusement one afternoon when we two were sent up into the garret to entertain ourselves without disturbing the family He soon grew tired of his unavailing attempts but I produced two stanzas the first of which read thus One summer day said little Jane We were walking down a shady lane When suddenly the wind blew high And the red lightning flashed in the sky The second stanza descended in a dreadfully abrupt anti climax but I was blissfully ignorant of rhetoricians rules and supposed that the rhyme was the only important thing It may amuse my child readers if I give them this verse too The peals of thunder how they rolled And I felt myself a little cooled For I before had been quite warm But now around me was a storm My brother was surprised at my success and I believe I thought my verses quite fine too But I was rather sorry that I had written them for I had to say them over to the family and then they sounded silly The habit was formed however and I went on writing little books of ballads which I illustrated with colors from my toy paintbox and then squeezed down into the cracks of the garret floor for fear that somebody would find them My fame crept out among the neighbors nevertheless I was even invited to write some verses in young lady s album and Aunt Hannah asked me to repeat my verses to her I considered myself greatly honored by both requests My fondness for books began very early At the age of four I had formed the plan of collecting a library Not of limp paper covered picture books such as people give to babies no I wanted books with stiff covers that could stand up side by side on a shelf and maintain their own character as books But I did not know how to make a beginning for mine were all of the kind manufactured for infancy and I thought they deserved no better fate than to be tossed about among my rag babies and playthings One day however I found among some rubbish in a corner a volume with one good stiff cover the other was missing It did not look so very old nor as if it had been much read neither did it look very inviting to me as I turned its leaves On its title page I read The Life of John Calvin I did not know who he was but a book was a book to me and this would do as well as any to begin my library with I looked upon it as a treasure and to make sure of my claim I took it down to my mother and timidly asked if I might have it for my own She gave me in reply a rather amused Yes and I ran back happy and began my library by setting John Calvin upright on a beam under the garret eaves my make believe book case shelf I was proud of my literary property and filled out the shelf in fancy with a row of books every one of which should have two stiff covers But I found no more neglected volumes that I could adopt John Calvin was left to a lonely fate and am afraid that at last the mice devoured him Before I had quite forgotten him however I did pick up one other book of about his size and in the same one covered condition and this attracted me more because it was in verse Rhyme had always a sort of magnetic power over me whether I caught at any idea it contained or not This was written in the measure which I afterwards learned was called Spenserian It was Byron s Vision of Judgment and Southey s also was bound up with it Southey s hexameters were too much of a mouthful for me but Byron s lines jingled and apparently told a story about something saint Peter came into it and King George the Third neither of which names meant anything to me but the scenery seemed to be somewhere up among the clouds and I unsuspicious of the author s irreverence took it for a sort of semi Biblical fairy tale There was on my mother s bed a covering of pink chintz pictured all over with the figure of a man sitting on a cloud holding a bunch of keys I put the two together in my mind imagining the chintz counterpane to be an illustration of the poem or the poem an explanation of the counterpane For the stanza I liked best began with the words saint Peter sat at the celestial gate And nodded o er his keys I invented a pronunciation for the long words and went about the house reciting grandly saint Peter sat at the kelestikal gate And nodded o er his keys That volume swept back to me with the rubbish of Time still reminds me forlorn and half clad of my childish fondness for its mock magnificence John Calvin and Lord Byron were rather a peculiar combination as the foundation of an infant s library but I was not aware of any unfitness or incompatibility To me they were two brother books like each other in their refusal to wear limp covers It is amusing to recall the rapid succession of contrasts in one child s tastes I felt no incongruity between doctor Watts and Mother Goose I supplemented Pibroch of Donuil Dhu and Lochiel Lochiel beware of the day with Yankee Doodle and the Diverting History of John Gilpin and with the glamour of some fairy tale I had just read still haunting me I would run out of doors eating a big piece of bread and butter sweeter than any has tasted since and would jump up towards the crows cawing high above me cawing back to them and half wishing I too were a crow to make the sky ring with my glee After doctor Watts s hymns the first poetry I took great delight in greeted me upon the pages of the American First Class Book handed down from older pupils in the little private school which my sisters and I attended when Aunt Hannah had done all she could for us That book was a collection of excellent literary extracts made by one who was himself an author and a poet It deserved to be called first class in another sense than that which was understood by its title I cannot think that modern reading books have improved upon it much It contained poems from Wordsworth passages from Shakespeare s plays among them the pathetic dialogue between Hubert and little Prince Arthur whose appeal to have his eyes spared brought many a tear to my own Bryant s Waterfowl and Thanatopsis were there also and Neal s There s a fierce gray bird with a bending beak that the boys loved so dearly to declaim and another poem by this last author which we all liked to read partly from a childish love of the tragic and partly for its graphic description of an avalanche s movement Slowly it came in its mountain wrath And the forests vanished before its path And the rude cliffs bowed and the waters fled And the valley of life was the tomb of the dead In reading this Swiss Minstrel s Lament over the Ruins of Goldau I first felt my imagination thrilled with the terrible beauty of the mountains a terror and a sublimity which attracted my thoughts far more than it awed them But the poem in which they burst upon me as real presences unseen yet known in their remote splendor as kingly friends before whom I could bow yet with whom I could aspire for something like this I think mountains must always be to those who truly love them was Coleridge s Mont Blanc before Sunrise in this same First Class Book I believe that poetry really first took possession of me in that poem so that afterwards I could not easily mistake the genuineness of its ring though my ear might not be sufficiently trained to catch its subtler harmonies This great mountain poem struck some hidden key note in my nature and I knew thenceforth something of what it was to live in poetry and to have it live in me Of course I did not consider my own foolish little versifying poetry The child of eight or nine years regarded her rhymes as only one among her many games and pastimes But with this ideal picture of mountain scenery there came to me a revelation of poetry as the one unattainable something which I must reach out after because I could not live without it The thought of it was to me like the thought of God and of truth To leave out poetry would be to lose the real meaning of life I felt this very blindly and vaguely no doubt but the feeling was deep It was as if Mont Blanc stood visibly before me while I murmured to myself in lonely places Motionless torrents silent cataracts Who made you glorious as the gates of heaven Beneath the keen full moon Who bade the sun Clothe you with rainbows Who with lovely flowers Of living blue spread garlands at your feet And then the Pine groves with their soft and soul like sound gave glorious answer with the streams and torrents and my child heart in its trance echoed the poet s invocation Rise like a cloud of incense from the earth And tell the stars and tell the rising sun Earth with her thousand voices calls on GOD I have never visited Switzerland but I surely saw the Alps with Coleridge in my childhood And although I never stood face to face with mountains until I was a mature woman always after this vision of them they were blended with my dream of whatever is pure and lofty in human possibilities like a white ideal beckoning me on Since I am writing these recollections for the young I may say here that I regard a love for poetry as one of the most needful and helpful elements in the life outfit of a human being It was the greatest of blessings to me in the long days of toil to which I was shut in much earlier than most young girls are that the poetry I held in my memory breathed its enchanted atmosphere through me and around me and touched even dull drudgery with its sunshine Hard work however has its own illumination if done as duty which worldliness has not and worldliness seems to be the greatest temptation and danger Of young people in this generation Poetry is one of the angels whose presence will drive out this sordid demon if anything less than the Power of the Highest can But poetry is of the Highest It is the Divine Voice always that we recognize through the poet s whenever he most deeply moves our souls Reason and observation as well as my own experience assure me also that it is great poetry even the greatest which the youngest crave and upon which they may be fed because it is the simplest Nature does not write down her sunsets her starry skies her mountains and her oceans in some smaller style to suit the comprehension of little children they do not need any such dilution So I go back to the American First Class Book and affirm it to have been one of the best of reading books because it gave us children a taste of the finest poetry and prose which had been written in our English tongue by British and by American authors Among the pieces which left a permanent impression upon my mind I recall Wirt s description of the eloquent blind preacher to whom he listened in the forest wilderness of the Blue Ridge a remarkable word portrait in which the very tones of the sightless speaker s voice seemed to be reproduced I believe that the first words I ever remembered of any sermon were those contained in the grand brief sentence Socrates died like a philosopher but Jesus Christ like a God Very vivid too is the recollection of the exquisite little prose idyl of Moss Side from Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life From the few short words with which it began Gilbert Ainslee was a poor man and he had been a poor man all the days of his life to the happy waking of his little daughter Margaret out of her fever sleep with which it ended it was one sweet picture of lowly life and honorable poverty irradiated with sacred home affections and cheerful in its rustic homeliness as the blossoms and wild birds of the moorland and the magic touch of Christopher North could make it I thought as I read How much pleasanter it must be to be poor than to be rich at least in Scotland For I was beginning to be made aware that poverty was a possible visitation to our own household and that in our Cape Ann corner of Massachusetts we might find it neither comfortable nor picturesque After my father s death our way of living never luxurious grew more and more frugal Now and then I heard mysterious allusions to the wolf at the door and it was whispered that to escape him we might all have to turn our backs upon the home where we were born and find our safety in the busy world working among strangers for our daily bread Before I had reached my tenth year I began to have rather disturbed dreams of what it might soon mean for me to earn my own living VII BEGINNING TO WORK A CHILD does not easily comprehend even the plain fact of death Though I had looked upon my father s still pale face in his coffin the impression it left upon me was of sleep more peaceful and sacred than common slumber yet only sleep My dreams of him were for a long time so vivid that I would say to myself He was here yesterday he will be here again to morrow with a feeling that amounted to expectation We missed him we children large and small who made up the yet untrained home crew as a ship misses the man at the helm His grave clear perception of what was best for us his brief words that decided once for all the course we were to take had been far more to us than we knew It was hardest of all for my mother who had been accustomed to depend entirely upon him Left with her eight children the eldest a boy of eighteen years and with no property except the roof that sheltered us and a small strip of land her situation was full of perplexities which we little ones could not at all understand To be fed like the ravens and clothed like the grass of the field seemed to me for one a perfectly natural thing and I often wondered why my mother was so fretted and anxious I knew that she believed in God and in the promises of the Bible and yet she seemed sometimes to forget everything but her troubles and her helplessness I felt almost like preaching to her but I was too small a child to do that I well knew so I did the next best thing I could think of I sang hymns as if singing to myself while I meant them for her Sitting at the window with my book and my knitting while she was preparing dinner or supper with a depressed air because she missed the abundant provision to which she held been accustomed I would go from hymn to hymn selecting those which I thought would be most comforting to her out of the many that my memory book contained and taking care to pronounce the words distinctly I was glad to observe that she listened to Come ye disconsolate and How firm a foundation and that she grew more cheerful though I did not feel sure that my singing cheered her so much as some happier thought that had come to her out of her own heart Nobody but my mother indeed would have called my chirping singing But as she did not seem displeased I went on a little more confidently with some hymns that I loved for their starry suggestions When marshaled on the nightly plain and Brightest and best of the sons of the morning and Watchman tell us of the night The most beautiful picture in the Bible to me certainly the loveliest in the Old Testament had always been that one painted by prophecy of the time when wild and tame creatures should live together in peace and children should be their fearless playmates Even the savage wolf Poverty would be pleasant and neighborly then no doubt A Little Child among them leading them stood looking wistfully down through the soft sunrise of that approaching day into the cold and darkness of the world Oh it would be so much better than the garden of Eden Yes and it would be a great deal better I thought to live in the millennium than even to die and go to heaven although so many people around me talked as if that were the most desirable thing of all But I could never understand why if God sent us here we should be in haste to get away even to go to a pleasanter place I was perplexed by a good many matters besides I had learned to keep most of my thoughts to myself but I did venture to ask about the Ressurrection how it was that those who had died and gone straight to heaven and had been singing there for thousands of years could have any use for the dust to which their bodies had returned Were they not already as alive as they could be I found that there were different ideas of the resurrection among orthodox people even then I was told however that this was too deep a matter for me and so I ceased asking questions But I pondered the matter of death what did it mean The Apostle Paul gave me more light on the subject than any of the ministers did And as usual a poem helped me It was Pope s Ode beginning with Vital spark of heavenly flame which I learned out of a reading book To die was to languish into life That was the meaning of it and I loved to repeat to myself the words Hark they whisper angels say Sister spirit come away The world recedes it disappears Heaven opens on my eyes my ears With sounds seraphic ring A hymn that I learned a little later expressed to me the same satisfying thought For strangers into life we come And dying is but going home The Apostle s words with which the song of The Dying Christian to his Soul ends left the whole cloudy question lit up with sunshine to my childish thoughts O grave where is thy victory O death where is thy sting My father was dead but that only meant that he had gone to a better home than the one be lived in with us and by and by we should go home too Meanwhile the millennium was coming and some people thought it was very near And what was the millennium Why the time when everybody on earth would live just as they do in heaven Nobody would be selfish nobody would be unkind no not so much as in a single thought What a delightful world this would be to live in then Heaven itself could scarcely be much better Perhaps people would not die at all but when the right time came would slip quietly away into heaven just as Enoch did My father had believed in the near millennium His very last writing in his sick room was a penciled computation from the prophets of the time when it would begin The first minister who preached in our church long before I was born had studied the subject much and had written books upon this his favorite theme The thought of it was continually breaking out like bloom and sunshine from the stern doctrines of the period One question in this connection puzzled me a good deal Were people going to be made good in spite of themselves whether they wanted to or not And what would be done with the bad ones if there were any left I did not like to think of their being killed off and yet everybody must be good or it would not be a true millennium It certainly would not matter much who was rich and who was poor if goodness and not money was the thing everybody cared for Oh if the millennium would only begin now I felt as if it were hardly fair to me that I should not be here during those happy thousand years when I wanted to so much But I had not lived even my short life in the world without leading something of my own faults and perversities and when I saw that there was no sign of an approaching millennium in my heart I had to conclude that it might be a great way off after all Yet the very thought of it brought warmth and illumination to my dreams by day and by night It was coming some time And the people who were in heaven would be as glad of it as those who remained on earth That it was a hard world for my mother and her children to live in at present I could not help seeing The older members of the family found occupations by which the domestic burdens were lifted a little but with only the three youngest to clothe and to keep at school there was still much more outgo than income and my mother s discouragement every day increased My eldest brother had gone to sea with a relative who was master of a merchant vessel in the South American trade His inclination led him that way it seemed to open before him a prospect of profitable business and my mother looked upon him as her future stay and support One day she came in among us children looking strangely excited I heard her tell some one afterwards that she had just been to hear Father Taylor preach the sailors minister whose coming to our town must have been a rare occurrence His words had touched her personally for he had spoken to mothers whose first born had left them to venture upon strange seas and to seek unknown lands He had even given to the wanderer he described the name of her own absent son Benjamin As she left the church she met a neighbor who informed her that the brig Mexican had arrived at Salem in trouble It was the vessel in which my brother had sailed only a short time before expecting to be absent for months Pirates was the only word we children caught as she hastened away from the house not knowing whether her son was alive or not Fortunately the news hardly reached the town before my brother himself did She met him in the street and brought him home with her forgetting all her anxieties in her joy at his safety The Mexican had been attacked on the high seas by the piratical craft Panda robbed of twenty thousand dollars in specie set on fire and abandoned to her fate with the crew fastened down in the hold One small skylight had accidentally been overlooked by the freebooters The captain discovered it and making his way through it to the deck succeeded in putting out the fire else vessel and sailors would have sunk together and their fate would never have been known Breathlessly we listened whenever my brother would relate the story which he did not at all enjoy doing for a cutlass had been swung over his head and his life threatened by the pirate s boatswain demanding more money after all had been taken A Genoese messmate Iachimo shortened to plain Jack by the Mexican s crew came to see my brother one day and at the dinner table he went through the whole adventure in pantomime which we children watched with wide eyed terror and amusement For there was some comedy mixed with what had been so nearly a tragedy and Jack made us see the very whites of the black cook s eyes who favored by his color had hidden himself all except that dilated whiteness between two great casks in the bold Jack himself had fallen through a trap door was badly hurt and could not extricate himself It was very ludicrous Jack crept under the table to show us how he and the cook made eyes at each other down there in the darkness not daring to speak The pantomime was necessary for the Genoese had very little English at his command When the pirate crew were brought into Salem for trial my brother had the questionable satisfaction of identifying in the court room the ruffian of a boatswain who had threatened his life This boatswain and several others of the crew were executed in Boston The boy found his brief sailor experience quite enough for him and afterward settled down quietly to the trade of a carpenter Changes thickened in the air around us Not the least among them was the burning of our meeting house in which we had all been baptized One Sunday morning we children were told when we woke that we could not go to meeting that day because the church was a heap of smoking ruins It seemed to me almost like the end of the world During my father s life a few years before my birth his thoughts had been turned towards the new manufacturing town growing up on the banks of the Merrimack He had once taken a journey there with the possibility in his mind of making the place his home his limited income furnishing no adequate promise of a maintenance for his large family of daughters From the beginning Lowell had a high reputation for good order morality piety and all that was dear to the old fashioned New Englander s heart After his death my mother s thoughts naturally followed the direction his had taken and seeing no other opening for herself she sold her small estate and moved to Lowell with the intention of taking a corporation house for mill girl boarders Some of the family objected for the Old World traditions about factory life were anything but attractive and they were current in New England until the experiment at Lowell had shown that independent and intelligent workers invariably give their own character to their occupation My mother had visited Lowell and she was willing and glad knowing all about the place to make it our home The change involved a great deal of work Boarders signified a large house many beds and an indefinite number of people Such piles of sewing accumulated before us A sewing bee volunteered by the neighbors reduced the quantity a little and our child fingers had to take their part But the seams of those sheets did look to me as if they were miles long My sister Lida and I had our stint so much to do every day It was warm weather and that made it the more tedious for we wanted to be running about the fields we were so soon to leave One day in sheer desperation we dragged a sheet up with us into an apple tree in the yard and sat and sewed there through the summer afternoon beguiling the irksomeness of our task by telling stories and guessing riddles It was hardest for me to leave the garret and the garden In the old houses the garret was the children s castle The rough rafters it was always ail unfinished room otherwise not a true garret the music of the rain on the roof the worn sea chests with their miscellaneous treasures the blue roofed cradle that had sheltered ten blue eyed babies the tape looms and reels and spinning wheels the herby smells and the delightful dream corners these could not be taken with us to the new home Wonderful people had looked out upon us from under those garret eaves Sindbad the Sailor and Baron Munchausen had sometimes strayed in and told us their unbelievable stories and we had there made acquaintance with the great Caliph Haroun Alraschid To go away from the little garden was almost as bad Its lilacs and peonies were beautiful to me and in a corner of it was one tiny square of earth that I called my own where I was at liberty to pull up my pinks and lady s delights every day to see whether they had taken root and where I could give my lazy morning glory seeds a poke morning after morning to help them get up and begin their climb Oh I should miss the garden very much indeed It did not take long to turn over the new leaf of our home experience One sunny day three of us children my youngest sister my brother John and I took with my mother the first stage coach journey of our lives across Lynnfield plains and over Andover hills to the banks of the Merrimack We were set down before an empty house in a yet unfinished brick block where we watched for the big wagon that was to bring our household goods It came at last and the novelty of seeing our old furniture settled in new rooms kept us from being homesick One after another they appeared bedsteads chairs tables and to me most welcome of all the old mahogany secretary with brass handled drawers that had always stood in the front room at home With it came the barrel full of books that had filled its shelves and they took their places as naturally as if they had always lived in this strange town There they all stood again side by side on their shelves the dear dull good old volumes that all my life I had tried in vain to take a sincere Sabbath day interest in Scott s Commentaries on the Bible Hervey s Meditations Young s Night Thoughts Edwards on the Affections and the Writings of Baxter and Doddridge Besides these there were bound volumes of the Repository Tracts which I had read and re read and the delightfully miscellaneous Evangelicana containing an account of Gilbert Tennent s wonderful trance also the History of the Spanish Inquisition with some painfully realistic illustrations a German Dictionary whose outlandish letters and words I liked to puzzle myself over and a descriptive History of Hamburg full of fine steel engravings which last two or three volumes my father had brought with him from the countries to which he had sailed in his sea faring days A complete set of the Missionary Herald unbound filled the upper shelves Other familiar articles journeyed with us the brass headed shovel and tongs that it had been my especial task to keep bright the two card tables which were as unacquainted as ourselves with ace face and trump the two china mugs with their eighteenth century lady and gentleman figurines curiosities brought from over the sea and reverently laid away by my mother with her choicest relics in the secretary desk my father s miniature painted in Antwerp a treasure only shown occasionally to us children as a holiday treat and my mother s easy chair I should have felt as if I had lost her had that been left behind The earliest unexpressed ambition of my infancy had been to grow up and wear a cap and sit in an easy chair knitting and look comfortable just as my mother did Filled up with these things the little one windowed sitting room easily caught the home feeling and gave it back to us Inanimate Objects do gather into themselves something of the character of those who live among them through association and this alone makes heirlooms valuable They are family treasures because they are part of the family life full of memories and inspirations Bought or sold they are nothing but old furniture Nobody can buy the old associations and nobody who has really felt how everything that has been in a home makes part of it can willingly bargain away the old things My mother never thought of disposing of her best furniture whatever her need It traveled with her in every change of her abiding place as long as she lived so that to us children home seemed to accompany her wherever she went And remaining yet in the family it often brings back to me pleasant reminders of my childhood No other Bible seems quite so sacred to me as the old Family Bible out of which my father used to read when we were all gathered around him for worship To turn its leaves and look at its pictures was one of our few Sabbath day indulgences and I cannot touch it now except with feelings of profound reverence For the first time in our lives my little sister and I became pupils in a grammar school for both girls and boys taught by a man I was put with her into the sixth class but was sent the very next day into the first I did not belong in either but somewhere between And I was very uncomfortable in my promotion for though the reading and spelling and grammar and geography were perfectly easy I had never studied any thing but mental arithmetic and did not know how to do a sum We had to show when called up to recite a slateful of sums done and proved No explanations were ever asked of us The girl who sat next to me saw my distress and offered to do my sums for me I accepted her proposal feeling however that I was a miserable cheat But I was afraid of the master who was tall and gaunt and used to stalk across the schoolroom right over the desk tops to find out if there was any mischief going on Once having caught a boy annoying a seat mate with a pin he punished the offender by pursuing him around the schoolroom sticking a pin into his shoulder whenever he could overtake him And he had a fearful leather strap which was sometimes used even upon the shrinking palm of a little girl If he should find out that I was a pretender and deceiver as I knew that I was I could not guess what might happen to me He never did however I was left unmolested in the ignorance which I deserved But I never liked the girl who did my sums and I fancied she had a decided contempt for me There was a friendly looking boy always sitting at the master s desk they called him the monitor It was his place to assist scholars who were in trouble about their lessons but I was too bashful to speak to him or to ask assistance of anybody I think that nobody learned much under that regime and the whole school system was soon after entirely reorganized Our house was quickly filled with a large feminine family As a child the gulf between little girlhood and young womanhood had always looked to me very wide I suppose we should get across it by some sudden jump by and by But among these new companions of all ages from fifteen to thirty years we slipped into womanhood without knowing when or how Most of my mother s boarders were from New Hampshire and Vermont and there was a fresh breezy sociability about them which made them seem almost like a different race of beings from any we children had hitherto known We helped a little about the housework before and after school making beds trimming lamps and washing dishes The heaviest work was done by a strong Irish girl my mother always attending to the cooking herself She was however a better caterer than the circumstances required or permitted She liked to make nice things for the table and having been accustomed to an abundant supply could never learn to economize At a dollar and a quarter a week for board the price allowed for mill girls by the corporations great care in expenditure was necessary It was not in my mother s nature closely to calculate costs and in this way there came to be a continually increasing leak in the family purse The older members of the family did everything they could but it was not enough I heard it said one day in a distressed tone The children will have to leave school and go into the mill There were many pros and cons between my mother and sisters before this was positively decided The mill agent did not want to take us two little girls but consented on condition we should be sure to attend school the full number of months prescribed each year I the younger one was then between eleven and twelve years old I listened to all that was said about it very much fearing that I should not be permitted to do the coveted work For the feeling had already frequently come to me that I was the one too many in the overcrowded family nest Once before we left our old home I had heard a neighbor condoling with my mother because there were so many of us and her emphatic reply had been a great relief to my mind There is isn t one more than I want I could not spare a single one of my children But her difficulties were increasing and I thought it would be a pleasure to feel that I was not a trouble or burden or expense to anybody So I went to my first day s work in the mill with a light heart The novelty of it made it seem easy and it really was not hard just to change the bobbins on the spinning frames every three quarters of an hour or so with half a dozen other little girls who were doing the same thing When I came back at night the family began to pity me for my long tiresome day s work but I laughed and said Why it is nothing but fun It is just like play And for a little while it was only a new amusement I liked it better than going to school and making believe I was learning when I was not And there was a great deal of play mixed with it We were not occupied more than half the time The intervals were spent frolicking around around the spinning frames teasing and talking to the older girls or entertaining ourselves with the games and stories in a corner or exploring with the overseer s permission the mysteries of the the carding room the dressing room and the weaving room I never cared much for machinery The buzzing and hissing and whizzing of pulleys and rollers and spindles and flyers around me often grew tiresome I could not see into their complications or feel interested in them But in a room below us we were sometimes allowed to peer in through a sort of blind door at the great water wheel that carried the works of the whole mill It was so huge that we could only watch a few of its spokes at a time and part of its dripping rim moving with a slow measured strength through the darkness that shut it in It impressed me with something of the awe which comes to us in thinking of the great Power which keeps the mechanism of the universe in motion Even now the remembrance of its large mysterious movement in which every little motion of every noisy little wheel was involved brings back to me a verse from one of my favorite hymns Our lives through various scenes are drawn And vexed by trifling cares While Thine eternal thought moves on Thy undisturbed affairs There were compensations for being shut in to daily toil so early The mill itself had its lessons for us But it was not and could not be the right sort of life for a child and we were happy in the knowledge that at the longest our employment was only to be temporary When I took my next three months at the grammar school everything there was changed and I too was changed The teachers were kind and thorough in their instruction and my mind seemed to have been ploughed up during that year of work so that knowledge took root in it easily It was a great delight to me to study and at the end of the three months the master told me that I was prepared for the high school But alas I could not go The little money I could earn one dollar a week besides the price of my board was needed in the family and I must return to the mill It was a severe disappointment to me though I did not say so at home I did not at all accept the conclusion of a neighbor whom I heard talking about it with my mother His daughter was going to the high school and my mother was telling him how sorry she was that I could not Oh he said in a soothing tone my girl hasn t got any such head piece as yours has Your girl doesn t need to go Of course I knew that whatever sort of a head piece I had I did need and want just that very opportunity to study I think the solution was then formed inwardly that I would go to school again some time whatever happened I went back to my work but now without enthusiasm I had looked through an open door that I was not willing to see shut upon me I began to reflect upon life rather seriously for a girl of twelve or thirteen What was I here for What could I make of myself Must I submit to be carried along with the current and do just what everybody else did No I knew I should not do that for there was a certain Myself who was always starting up with her own original plan or aspiration before me and who was quite indifferent as to what people generally thought Well I would find out what this Myself was good for and that she should be It was but the presumption of extreme youth How gladly would I know now after these long years just why I was sent into the world and whether I have in any degree fulfilled the purpose of my being In the older times it was seldom said to little girls as it always has been said to boys that they ought to have some definite plan while they were children what to be and do when they were grown up There was usually but one path open before them to become good wives and housekeepers And the ambition of most girls was to follow their mothers footsteps in this direction a natural and laudable ambition But girls as well as boys must often have been conscious of their own peculiar capabilities must have desired to cultivate and make use of their individual powers When I was growing up they had already begun to be encouraged to do so We were often told that it was our duty to develop any talent we might possess or at least to learn how to do some one thing which the world needed or which would make it a pleasanter world When I thought what I should best like to do my first dream almost a baby s dream about it was that it would be a fine thing to be a schoolteacher like Aunt Hannah Afterward when I heard that there were artists I wished I could some time be one A slate and pencil to draw pictures was my first request whenever a day s ailment kept me at home from school and I rather enjoyed being a little ill for the sake of amusing myself in that way The wish grew up with me but there were no good drawing teachers in those days and if there had been the cost of instruction would have been beyond the family means My sister Emilie however who saw my taste and shared it herself did her best to assist me furnishing me with pencil and paper and paint box If I could only make a rose bloom on paper I thought I should be happy or if I could at last succeed in drawing the outline of winter stripped boughs as I saw them against the sky it seemed to me that I should be willing to spend years in trying I did try a little and very often Jack Frost was my most inspiring teacher His sketches on the bedroom window pane in cold mornings were my ideal studies of Swiss scenery crags and peaks and chalets and fir trees and graceful tracery of ferns like those that grew in the woods where we went huckleberrying all blended together by his touch of enchantment I wondered whether human fingers ever succeeded in imitating that lovely work The taste has followed me all my life through but I could never indulge it except as a recreation I was not to be an artist and I am rather glad that I was hindered for I had even stronger inclinations in other directions and art really noble art requires the entire devotion of a lifetime I seldom thought seriously of becoming an author although it seemed to me that anybody who had written a book would have a right to feel very proud But I believed that a person must be exceedingly wise before presuming to attempt it although now and then I thought I could feel ideas growing in my mind that it might be worth while to put into a book if I lived and studied until I was forty or fifty years old I wrote my little verses to be sure but that was nothing they just grew They were the same as breathing or singing I could not help writing them and I thought and dreamed a great many that were ever put on paper They seemed to fly into my mind and away again like birds with a carol through the air It seemed strange to me that people should notice them or should think my writing verses anything peculiar for I supposed that they were in everybody s mind just as they were in mine and that anybody could write them who chose One day I heard a relative say to my mother Keep what she writes till she grows up and perhaps she will get money for it I have heard of somebody who earned a thousand dollars by writing poetry It sounded so absurd to me Money for writing verses One dollar would be as ridiculous as a thousand I should as soon have thought of being paid for thinking My mother fortunately was sensible enough never to flatter me or let me be flattered about my scribbling It never was allowed to hinder any work I had to do I crept away into a corner to write what came into my head just as I ran away to play and I looked upon it only as my most agreeable amusement never thinking of preserving anything which did not of itself stay in my memory This too was well for the time did lot come when I could afford to look upon verse writing as an occupation Through my life it has only been permitted to me as an aside from other more pressing employments Whether I should have written better verses had circumstances left me free to do what I chose it is impossible now to know All my thoughts about my future sent me back to Aunt Hannah and my first infantile idea of being a teacher I foresaw that I should be that before I could be or do any thing else It had been impressed upon me that I must make myself useful in the world and certainly one could be useful who could keep school as Aunt Hannah did I did not see anything else for a girl to do who wanted to use her brains as well as her hands So the plan of preparing myself to be a teacher gradually and almost unconsciously shaped itself in my mind as the only practicable one I could earn my living in that way all important consideration I liked the thought of self support but I would have chosen some artistic or beautiful work if I could I had no especial aptitude for teaching and no absorbing wish to be a teacher but it seemed to me that I might succeed if I tried What I did like about it was that one must know something first I must acquire knowledge before I could impart it and that was just what I wanted I could be a student wherever I was and whatever else I had to be or do and I would I knew I should write I could not help doing that for my hand seemed instinctively to move towards pen and paper in moments of leisure But to write anything worth while I must have mental cultivation so in preparing myself to teach I could also be preparing myself to write This was the plan that indefinitely shaped itself in my mind as I returned to my work in the spinning room and which I followed out not without many breaks and hindrances and neglects during the next six or seven years to learn all I could so that I should be fit to teach or to write as the way opened And it turned out that fifteen or twenty of my best years were given to teaching VIII BY THE RIVER IT did not take us younger ones long to get acquainted with our new home and to love it To live beside a river had been to me a child s dream of romance Rivers as I pictured them came down from the mountains and were born in the clouds They were bordered by green meadows and graceful trees leaned over to gaze into their bright mirrors Our shallow tidal creek was the only river I had known except as visioned on the pages of the Pilgrim s Progress and in the Book of Revelation And the Merrimack was like a continuation of that dream I soon made myself familiar with the rocky nooks along Pawtucket Falls shaded with hemlocks and white birches Strange new wild flowers grew beside the rushing waters among them Sir Walter Scott s own harebells which I had never thought of except as blossoms of poetry here they were as real to me as to his Lady of the Lake I loved the harebell the first new flower the river gave me as I had never loved a flower before There was but one summers holiday for us who worked in the mills the Fourth of July We made a point of spending it out of doors making excursions down the river to watch the meeting of the slow Concord and the swift Merrimack or around by the old canal path to explore the mysteries of the Guard Locks or across the bridge clambering up Dracut Heights to look away to the dim blue mountains On that morning it was our custom to wake one another at four o clock and start off on a tramp together over some retired road whose chief charm was its unfamiliarity returning to a very late breakfast with draggled gowns and aprons full of dewy wild roses No matter if we must get up at five the next morning and go back to our hum drum toil we should have the roses to take with us for company and the sweet air of the woodland which lingered about them would scent our thoughts all day and make us forget the oily smell of the machinery We were children still whether at school or at work and Nature still held us close to her motherly heart Nature came very close to the mill gates too in those days There was green grass all around them violets and wild geraniums grew by the canals and long stretches of open land between the corporation buildings and the street made the town seem country like The slope behind our mills the Lawrence Mills was a green lawn and in front of some of them the overseers had gay flower gardens we passed in to our work through a splendor of dahlias and hollyhocks The gray stone walls of saint Anne s church and rectory made a picturesque spot in the middle of the town remaining still as a lasting monument to the religious purpose which animated the first manufacturers The church arose close to the oldest corporation the Merrimack and seemed a part of it and a part also of the original idea of the place itself which was always a city of worshipers although it came to be filled with a population which preferred meeting houses to churches I admired the church greatly I had never before seen a real one never anything but a plain frame meeting house and it and its benign apostolic looking rector were like a leaf out of an English story book And so also was the tiny white cottage nearly opposite set in the middle of a pretty flower garden that sloped down to the canal In the garden there was almost always a sweet little girl in a pink gown and white sunbonnet gathering flowers when I passed that way and I often went out of my path to do so These relieved the monotony of the shanty like shops which bordered the main street The town had sprung up with a mushroom rapidity and there was no attempt at veiling the newness of its bricks and mortar its boards and paint But there were buildings that had their own individuality and asserted it One of these was a mud cabin with a thatched roof that looked as if it had emigrated bodily from the bogs of Ireland It had settled itself down into a green hollow by the roadside and it looked as much at home with the lilac tinted crane s bill and yellow buttercups as if it had never lost sight of the shamrocks of Erin Now too my childish desire to see a real beggar was gratified Straggling petitioners for cold victuals hung around our back yard always of Hibernian extraction and a slice of bread was rewarded with a shower of benedictions that lost itself upon us in the flood of its own incomprehensible brogue Some time every summer a fleet of canoes would glide noiselessly up the river and a company of Penobscot Indians would land at a green point almost in sight from our windows Pawtucket Falls had always been one of their favorite camping places Their strange endeavors to combine civilization with savagery were a great source of amusement to us men and women clad alike in loose gowns stove pipe hats and moccasons grotesque relies of aboriginal forest life The sight of these uncouth looking red men made the romance fade entirely out of the Indian stories we had heard Still their wigwam camp was a show we would not willingly have missed The transition from childhood to girlhood when a little girl has had an almost unlimited freedom of out of door life is practically the toning down of a mild sort of barbarianism and is often attended by a painfully awkward self consciousness I had an innate dislike of conventionalities I clung to the child s inalienable privilege of running half wild and when I found that I really was growing up I felt quite rebellious I was as tall as a woman at thirteen and my older sisters insisted upon lengthening my dresses and putting up my mop of hair with a comb I felt injured and almost outraged because my protestations against this treatment were unheeded and when the transformation in my visible appearance was effected I went away by myself and had a good cry which I would not for the world have had them know about as that would have added humiliation to my distress And the greatest pity about it was that I too soon became accustomed to the situation I felt like a child but considered it my duty to think and behave like a woman I began to look upon it as a very serious thing to live The untried burden seemed already to have touched my shoulders For a time I was morbidly self critical and at the same time extremely reserved The associates I chose were usually grave young women ten or fifteen years older than myself but I think I felt older and appeared older than they did Childhood however is not easily defrauded of its birthright and mine soon reasserted itself At home I was among children of my own age for some cousins and other acquaintances had come to live and work with us We had our evening frolics and entertainments together and we always made the most of our brief holiday hours We had also with us now the sister Emilie of my fairy tale memories who had grown into a strong earnest hearted woman We all looked up to her as our model and the ideal of our heroine worship for our deference to her in every way did amount to that She watched over us gave us needed reproof and commendation rarely cosseted us but rather made us laugh at what many would have considered the hardships of our lot She taught us not only to accept the circumstances in which we found ourselves but to win from them courage and strength When we came in shivering from our work through a snowstorm complaining of numb hands and feet she would say cheerily But it doesn t make you any warmer to say you are cold and this was typical of the way she took life generally and tried to have us take it She was constantly denying herself for our sakes without making us feel that she was doing so But she did not let us get into the bad habit of pitying ourselves because we were not as well off as many other children And indeed we considered ourselves pleasantly situated but the best of it all was that we had her Her theories for herself and her practice too were rather severe but we tried to follow them according to our weaker abilities Her custom was for instance to take a full cold bath every morning before she went to her work even though the water was chiefly broken ice and we did the same whenever we could be resolute enough It required both nerve and will to do this at five o clock on a zero morning in a room without a fire but it helped us to harden ourselves while we formed a good habit The working day in winter began at the very earliest daylight and ended at half past seven in the evening Another habit of hers was to keep always beside her at her daily work something to study or to think about At first it was Watts on the Improvement of the Mind arranged as a textbook with questions and answers by the minister of Beverly who had made the thought of the millennium such a reality to his people She quite wore this book out carrying it about with her in her working dress pocket After that Locke on the Understanding was used in the same way She must have known both books through and through by heart Then she read Combe and Abercrombie and discussed their physics and metaphysics with our girl boarders some of whom had remarkably acute and well balanced minds Her own seemed to have turned from its early bent toward the romantic her taste being now for serious and practical though sometimes abstruse themes I remember that Young and Pollock were her favorite poets I could not keep up with her in her studies and readings for many of the books she liked seemed to me very dry I did not easily take to the argumentative or moralizing method which I came to regard as a proof of the weakness of my own intellect in comparison with hers I would gladly have kept pace with her if I could Anything under the heading of Didactick like some of the pieces in the old English Reader used by school children in the generation just before ours always repelled me But I though it necessary to discipline myself by reading such pieces and my first attempt at prose composition On Friendship was stiffly modeled after a certain Didactick Essay in that same English Reader My sister however cared more to watch the natural development of our minds than to make us follow the direction of hers She was really our teacher although she never assumed that position Certainly I learned more from her about my own capabilities and how I might put them to use than I could have done at any school we knew of had it been possible for me to attend one I think she was determined that we should not be mentally defrauded by the circumstances which had made it necessary for us to begin so early to win our daily bread This remark applies especially to me as my older sisters only two or three of them had come to Lowell soon drifted away from us into their own new homes or occupations and she and I were left together amid the whir of spindles and wheels One thing she planned for us her younger housemates a dozen or so of cousins friends and sisters some attending school and some at work in the mill was a little fortnightly paper to be filled with our original contributions she herself acting as editor I do not know where she got the idea unless it was from missus Lydia Maria Child s Juvenile Miscellany which had found its way to us some years before a most delightful guest and I think the first magazine prepared for American children who have had so many since then I have always been glad that I knew that sweet woman with the child s heart and the poet s soul in her later years and could tell her how happy she had helped to make my childhood Our little sheet was called The Diving Bell probably from the sea associations of the name We kept our secrets of authorship very close from everybody except the editor who had to decipher the handwriting and copy the pieces It was indeed an important part of the fun to guess who wrote particular pieces After a little while however our mannerisms betrayed us One of my cousins was known to be the chief story teller and I was recognized as the leading rhymer among the younger contributors the editor sister excelling in her versifying as she did in almost everything It was a cluster of very conscious looking little girls that assembled one evening in the attic room chosen on account of its remoteness from intruders for we did not admit even the family as a public the writers themselves were the only audience to listen to the reading of our first paper We took Saturday evening because that was longer than the other workday evenings the mills being closed earlier Such guessing and wondering and admiring as we had But nobody would acknowledge her own work for that would have spoiled the pleasure Only there were certain wise hints and maxims that we knew never came from any juvenile head among us and those we set down as editorials Some of the stories contained rather remarkable incidents One written to illustrate a little girl s habit of carelessness about her own special belongings told of her rising one morning and after hunting around for her shoes half an hour or so finding them in the book case where she had accidentally locked them up the night before To convince myself that I could write something besides rhymes I had attempted an essay of half a column on a very extensive subject MIND It began loftily What a noble and beautiful thing is mind and it went on in the same high flown strain to no particular end But the editor praised it after having declined the verdict of the audience that she was its author and I felt sufficiently flattered by both judgments I wrote more rhymes than anything else because they came more easily But I always felt that the ability to write good prose was far more desirable and it seems so to me still I will give my little girl readers a single specimen of my twelve year old Diving Bell verses though I feel as if I ought to apologize even for that It is on a common subject Life like a Rose Childhood s like a tender bud That s scarce been formed an hour But which erelong will doubtless be A bright and lovely flower And youth is like a full blown rose Which has not known decay But which must soon alas too soon Wither and fade away And age is like a withered rose That bends beneath the blast But though its beauty all is gone Its fragrance yet may last This and other verses that I wrote then serve to illustrate the child s usual inclination to look forward meditatively rather than to think and write of the simple things that belong to children Our small venture set some of us imagining what larger possibilities might be before us in the far future We talked over the things we should like to do when we should be women out in the active world and the author of the shoe story horrified us by declaring that she meant to be distinguished when she grew up for something even if it was for something bad She did go so far in a bad way as to plagiarize a long poem in a subsequent number of the Diving Bell but the editor found her out and we all thought that a reproof from Emilie was sufficient punishment I do not know whether it was fortunate or unfortunate for me that I had not by nature what is called literary ambition I knew that I had a knack at rhyming and I knew that I enjoyed nothing better than to try to put thoughts and words together in any way But I did it for the pleasure of rhyming and writing indifferent as to what might come of it For any one who could take hold of every day practical work and carry it on successfully I had a profound respect To be what is called capable seemed to me better worth while than merely to have a taste or for writing perhaps because I was conscious of my deficiencies in the former respect But certainly the world needs deeds more than it needs words I should never have been willing to be only a writer without using my hands to some good purpose besides My sister however told me that here was a talent which I had no right to neglect and which I ought to make the most of I believed in her I thought she understood me better than I understood myself and it was a comfort to be assured that my scribbling was not wholly a waste of time So I used pencil and paper in every spare minute I could find Our little home journal went bravely on through twelve numbers Its yellow manuscript pages occasionally meet my eyes when I am rummaging among my old papers with the half conscious look of a waif that knows it has no right to its escape from the waters of oblivion While it was in progress my sister Emilie became acquainted with a family of bright girls near neighbors of ours who proposed that we should join with them and form a little society for writing and discussion to meet fortnightly at their house We met I think I was the youngest of the group prepared a Constitution and By Laws and named ourselves The Improvement Circle If I remember rightly my sister was our first president The older ones talked and wrote on many subjects quite above me I was shrinkingly bashful as half grown girls usually are but I wrote my little essays and read them and listened to the rest and enjoyed it all exceedingly Out of this little Improvement Circle grew the larger one whence issued the Lowell Offering a year or two later At this time I had learned to do a spinner s work and I obtained permission to tend some frames that stood directly in front of the river windows with only them and the wall behind me extending half the length of the mill and one young woman beside me at the farther end of the row She was a sober mature person who scarcely thought it worth her while to speak often to a child like me and I was when with strangers rather a reserved girl so I kept myself occupied with the river my work and my thoughts And the river and my thoughts flowed on together the happiest of companions Like a loitering pilgrim it sparkled up to me in recognition as it glided along and bore away my little frets and fatigues on its bosom When the work went well I sat in the window seat and let my fancies fly whither they would downward to the sea or upward to the hills that hid the mountain cradle of the Merrimack The printed regulations forbade us to bring books into the mill so I made my window seat into a small library of poetry pasting its side all over with newspaper clippings In those days we had only weekly papers and they had always a poet s corner where standard writers were well represented with anonymous ones also I was not of course much of a critic I chose my verses for their sentiment and because I wanted to commit them to memory sometimes it was a long poem sometimes a hymn sometimes only a stray verse missus Hemans sang with me Far away o er the blue hills far away and I learned and loved her Better Land and If thou hast crushed a flower and Kindred Hearts I wonder if Miss Landon really did write that fine poem to Mont Blanc which was printed in her volume but which sounds so entirely unlike everything else she wrote This was one of my window gems It ended with the appeal Alas for thy past mystery For thine untrodden snow Nurse of the tempest hast thou none To guard thine outraged brow and it contained a stanza that I often now repeat to myself We know too much scroll after scroll Weighs down our weary shelves Our only point of ignorance Is centred in ourselves There was one anonymous waif in my collection that I was very fond of I have never seen it since nor ever had the least clue to its authorship It stirred me and haunted me and it often comes back to me now in snatches like these The human mind That lofty thing The palace and the throne Where Reason sits a sceptred king And breathes his judgment tone The human soul That startling thing Mysterious and sublime An angel sleeping on the wing Worn by the scoffs of time From heaven in tears to earth it stole That startling thing the human soul I was just beginning in my questionings as to the meaning of life to get glimpses of its true definition from the poets that it is love service the sacrifice of self for others good The lesson was slowly learned but every hint of it went to my heart and I kept in silent upon my window wall reminders like that of holy George Herbert Be useful where thou livest that they may Both want and wish thy pleasing presence still Find out men s wants and will And meet them there All worldly joys go less To the one joy of doing kindnesses and that well known passage from Talfourd The blessings which the weak and poor can scatter Have their own season It is a little thing to speak a phase Of common comfort which by daily use Has almost lost its sense yet on the ear Of him who thought to die unmourned t will fall Like choicest music A very familiar extract from Carlos Wilcox almost the only quotation made nowadays from his poems was often on my sister Emilie s lips whose heart seemed always to be saying to itself Pour blessings round thee like a shower of gold I had that beside me too and I copy part of it here for her sake and because it will be good for my girl readers to keep in mind one of the noblest utterances of an almost forgotten American poet Rouse to some work of high and holy love And thou an angel s happiness shalt know Shalt bless the earth while in the world above The good begun by thee shall onward flow The pure sweet stream shall deeper wider grow The seed that in these few and fleeting hours Thy hands unsparing and unwearied sow Shall deck thy grave with amaranthine flowers And yield thee fruits divine in heaven s immortal bowers One great advantage which came to these many stranger girls through being brought together away from their own homes was that it taught them to go out of themselves and enter into the lives of others Home life when one always stays at home is necessarily narrowing That is one reason why so many women are petty and unthoughtful of any except their own family s interests We have hardly begun to live until we can take in the idea of the whole human family as the one to which we truly belong To me it was an incalculable help to find myself among so many working girls all of us thrown upon our own resources but thrown much more upon each others sympathies And the stream beside which we toiled added to its own inspirations human suggestions drawn from our acquaintance with each other It blended itself with the flow of our lives Almost the first of my poemlets in the Lowell Offering was entitled The River These are some lines of it Gently flowed a river bright On its path of liquid light Gleaming now soft banks between Winding now through valleys green Cheering with its presence mild Cultured fields and woodlands wild Is not such a pure one s life Ever shunning pride and strife Noiselessly along she goes Known by gentle deeds she does Often wandering far to bless And do others kindnesses Thus by her own virtues shaded While pure thoughts like starbeams lie Mirrored in her heart and eye She content to be unknown All serenely moveth on Till released from Time s commotion Self is lost in Love s wide ocean There was many a young girl near me whose life was like the beautiful course of the river in my ideal of her The Merrimack has blent its music with the onward song of many a lovely soul that clad in plain working clothes moved heavenward beside its waters One of the loveliest persons I ever knew was a young girl who worked opposite to me in the spinning room Our eyes made us friends long before we spoke to each other She was an orphan well bred and well educated about twenty years old and she had brought with her to her place of toil the orphan child of her sister left to her as a death bed legacy They boarded with a relative The factory boarding houses were often managed by families of genuine refinement as in this case and the one comfort of Caroline s life was her beautiful little niece to whom she could go home when the day s work was over Her bereavements had given an appealing sadness to her whole expression but she had accepted them and her changed circumstances with the submission of profound faith which everybody about her felt in everything she said and did I think I first knew through her how character can teach without words To see her and her little niece together was almost like looking at a picture of the Madonna Caroline afterwards became an inmate of my mother s family and we were warm friends until her death a few years ago Some of the girls could not believe that the Bible was meant to be counted among forbidden books We all thought that the Scriptures had a right to go wherever we went and that if we needed them anywhere it was at our work I evaded the law by carrying some leaves from a torn Testament in my pocket The overseer caring more for law than gospel confiscated all he found He had his desk full of Bibles It sounded oddly to hear him say to the most religious girl in the room when he took hers away I did think you had more conscience than to bring that book here But we had some close ethical questions to settle in those days It was a rigid code of morality under which we lived Nobody complained of it however and we were doubtless better off for its strictness in the end The last window in the row behind me was filled with flourishing house plants fragrant leaved geraniums the overseer s pets They gave that corner a bowery look the perfume and freshness tempted me there often Standing before that window I could look across the room and see girls moving backwards and forwards among the spinning frames sometimes stooping sometimes reaching up their arms as their work required with easy and not ungraceful movements On the whole it was far from being a disagreeable place to stay in The girls were bright looking and neat and everything was kept clean and shining The effect of the whole was rather attractive to strangers My grandfather came to see my mother once at about this time and visited the mills When he had entered our room and looked around for a moment he took off his hat and made a low bow to the girls first toward the right and then toward the left We were familiar with his courteous habits partly due to his French descent but we had never seen anybody bow to a room full of mill girls in that polite way and some one of the family afterwards asked him why he did so He looked a little surprised at the question but answered promptly and with dignity I always take off my hat to ladies His courtesy was genuine Still we did not call ourselves ladies We did not forget that we were working girls wearing coarse aprons suitable to our work and that there was some danger of our becoming drudges I know that sometimes the confinement of the mill became very wearisome to me In the sweet June weather I would lean far out of the window and try not to hear the unceasing clash of sound inside Looking away to the hills my whole stifled being would cry out Oh that I had wings Still I was there from choice and The prison unto which we doom ourselves No prison is And I was every day making discoveries about life and about myself I had naturally some elements of the recluse and would never of my own choice have lived in a crowd I loved quietness The noise of machinery was particularly distasteful to me But I found that the crowd was made up of single human lives not one of them wholly uninteresting when separately known I learned also that there are many things which belong to the whole world of us together that no one of us nor any few of us can claim or enjoy for ourselves alone I discovered too that I could so accustom myself to the noise that it became like a silence to me And I defied the machinery to make me its slave Its incessant discords could not drown the music of my thoughts if I would let them fly high enough Even the long hours the early rising and the regularity enforced by the clangor of the bell were good discipline for one who was naturally inclined to dally and to dream and who loved her own personal liberty with a willful rebellion against control Perhaps I could have brought myself into the limitations of order and method in no other way Like a plant that starts up in showers and sunshine and does not know which has best helped it to grow it is difficult to say whether the hard things or the pleasant things did me most good But when I was sincerest with myself as also when I thought least about it I know that I was glad to be alive and to be just where I was It is a conquest when we can lift ourselves above the annoyances of circumstances over which we have no control but it is a greater victory when we can make those circumstances our helpers when we can appreciate the good there is in them It has often seemed to me as if Life stood beside me looking me in the face and saying Child you must learn to like me in the form in which you see me before I can offer myself to you in any other aspect It was so with this disagreeable necessity of living among many people There is nothing more miserable than to lose the feeling of our own distinctiveness since that is our only clue to the Purpose behind us and the End before us But when we have discovered that human beings are not a mere mass but an orderly Whole of which we are a part it is all so different This we working girls might have learned from the webs of cloth we saw woven around us Every little thread must take its place as warp or woof and keep in it steadily Left to itself it would be only a loose useless filament Trying to wander in an independent or a disconnected way among the other threads it would make of the whole web an inextricable snarl Yet each little thread must be as firmly spun as if it were the only one or the result would be a worthless fabric That we are entirely separate while yet we entirely belong to the Whole is a truth that we learn to rejoice in as we come to understand more and more of ourselves and of this human life of ours which seems so complicated and yet is so simple And when we once get a glimpse of the Divine Plan in it all and know that to be just where we are doing just what we are doing just at this hour because it is our appointed hour when we become aware that this is the very best thing possible for us in God s universe the hard task grows easy the tiresome employment welcome and delightful Having fitted ourselves to our present work in such a way as this we are usually prepared for better work and are sent to take a better place Perhaps this is one of the unfailing laws of progress in our being Perhaps the Master of Life always rewards those who do their little faithfully by giving them some greater opportunity for faithfulness Certainly it is a comfort wherever we are to say to ourselves Thou camest not to thy place by accident It is the very place God meant for thee IX MOUNTAIN FRIENDS THE pleasure we found in making new acquaintances among our workmates arose partly from their having come from great distances regions unknown to us as the northern districts of Maine and New Hampshire and Vermont were in those days of stage coach traveling when rail roads had as yet only connected the larger cities with one another It seemed wonderful to me to be talking with anybody who had really seen mountains and lived among them One of the younger girls who worked beside me during my very first days in the mill had come from far up near the sources of the Merrimack and she told me a great deal about her home and about farm life among the hills I listened almost with awe when she said that she lived in a valley where the sun set at four o clock and where the great snowstorms drifted in so that sometimes they did not see a neighbor for weeks To have mountain summits looking down upon one out of the clouds summer and winter by day and by night seemed to me something both delightful and terrible And yet here was this girl to whom it all appeared like the merest commonplace What she felt about it was that it was awful cold sometimes the days were so short and it grew dark so early Then she told me about the spinning and the husking and the sugar making while we sat in a corner together waiting to replace the full spools by empty ones the work usually given to the little girls I had a great admiration for this girl because she had come from those wilderness regions The scent of pine woods and checkerberry leaves seemed to bang about her I believe I liked her all the better because she said daown and haow It was part of the mountain flavor I tried on my part to impress her with stories of the sea but I did not succeed very well Her principal comment was They don t think much of sailors up aour way And I received the impression from her and others and from my own imagination that rural life was far more delightful than the life of towns But there is something in the place where we were born that holds us always by the heartstrings A town that still has a great deal of the country in it one that is rich in beautiful scenery and ancestral associations is almost like a living being with a body and a soul We speak of such a town if our birthplace as of a mother and think of ourselves as her sons and daughters So we felt my sisters and I about our dear native town of Beverly Its miles of sea border almost every sunny cove and rocky headland of which was a part of some near relative s homestead were only half a day s journey distant and the misty ocean spaces beyond still widened out on our imagination from the green inland landscape around us But the hills sometimes shut us in body and soul To those who have been reared by the sea a wide horizon is a necessity both for the mind and for the eye We had many opportunities of escape towards our native shores for the larger part of our large family still remained there and there was a constant coming and going among us The stagedriver looked upon us as his especial charge and we had a sense of personal property in the Salem and Lowell stagecoach which had once like a fairy godmother s coach rumbled down into our own little lane taken possession of us and carried us off to a new home My married sisters had families growing up about them and they liked to have us younger ones come and help take care of their babies One of them sent for me just when the close air and long days work were beginning to tell upon my health and it was decided that I had better go The salt wind soon restored my strength and those months of quiet family life were very good for me Like most young girls I had a motherly fondness for little children and my two baby nephews were my pride and delight The older one had a delicate constitution and there was a thoughtful questioning look in his eyes that seemed to gaze forward almost sadly and foresee that he should never attain to manhood The younger a plump vigorous urchin three or four months old did without doubt feel his life in every limb He was my especial charge for his brother s clinging weakness gave him the first born the place nearest his mother s heart The baby bore the family name mine and his mother s our little Lark we sometimes called him for his wide awakeness and his merry heartedness Alas neither of those beautiful boys grew up to be men One page of my home memories is sadly written over with their elegy the Graves of a Household Father mother and four sons an entire family long since passed away from earthly sight The tie between my lovely baby nephew and myself became very close The first two years of a child s life are its most appealing years and call out all the latent tenderness of the nature on which it leans for protection I think I should have missed one of the best educating influences of my youth if I had not had the care of that baby for a year or more just as I entered my teens I was never so happy as when I held him in my arms sleeping or waking and he happy anywhere was always contented when he was with me I was as fond as ever of reading and somehow I managed to combine baby and book Dickens s Old Curiosity Shop was just then coming out in a Philadelphia weekly paper and I read it with the baby playing at my feet or lying across my lap in an unfinished room given up to sea chests and coffee bags and spicy foreign odors My cherub s papa was a sea captain usually away on his African voyages Little Nell and her grandfather became as real to me as my darling charge and if a tear from his nurse s eyes sometimes dropped upon his cheek as he slept he was not saddened by it When he awoke he was irrepressible clutching at my hair with his stout pink fists and driving all dream people effectually out of my head Like all babies he was something of a tyrant but that brief sweet despotism ends only too soon I put him gratefully down dimpled chubby and imperious upon the list of my girlhood s teachers My sister had no domestic help besides mine so I learned a good deal about general housework A girl s preparation for life was in those days considered quite imperfect who had no practical knowledge of that kind We were taught indeed how to do everything that a woman might be called upon to do under any circumstances for herself or for the household she lived in It was one of the advantages of the old simple way of living that the young daughters of the house were as a matter of course instructed in all these things They acquired the habit of being ready for emergencies and the family that required no outside assistance was delightfully independent A young woman would have been considered a very inefficient being who could not make and mend and wash and iron her own clothing and get three regular meals and clear them away every day besides keeping the house tidy and doing any other needed neighborly service such as sitting all night by a sick bed To be a good watcher was considered one of the most important of womanly attainments People who lived side by side exchanged such services without waiting to be asked and they seemed to be happiest of whom such kindnesses were most expected Every kind of work brings its own compensations and attractions I really began to like plain sewing I enjoyed sitting down for a whole afternoon of it fingers flying and thoughts flying faster still the motion of the hands seeming to set the mind astir Such afternoons used to bring me throngs of poetic suggestions particularly if I sat by an open window and could hear the wind blowing and a bird or two singing Nature is often very generous in opening her heart to those who must keep their hands employed Perhaps it is because she is always quietly at work herself and so sympathizes with her busy human friends And possibly there is no needful occupation which is wholly unbeautiful The beauty of work depends upon the way we meet it whether we arm ourselves each morning to attack it as an enemy that must be vanquished before night comes or whether we open our eyes with the sunrise to welcome it as an approaching friend who will keep us delightful company all day and who will make us feel at evening that the day was well worth its fatigues I found my practical experience of housekeeping and baby tending very useful to me afterwards at the West in my sister Emilie s family when she was disabled by illness I think indeed that every item of real knowledge I ever acquired has come into use somewhere or somehow in the course of the years But these were not the things I had most wished to do The whole world of thought lay unexplored before me a world of which I had already caught large and tempting glimpses and I did not like to feel the horizon shutting me in even to so pleasant a corner as this And the worst of it was that I was getting too easy and contented too indifferent to the higher realities which my work and my thoughtful companions had kept keenly clear before me I felt myself slipping into an inward apathy from which it was hard to rouse myself I could not let it go on so I must be where my life could expand It was hard to leave the dear little fellow I had taught to walk and to talk but I knew he would not be inconsolable So I only said I must go and turned my back upon the sea and my face to the banks of the Merrimack When I returned I found that I enjoyed even the familiar unremitting clatter of the mill because it indicated that something was going on I liked to feel the people around me even those whom I did not know as a wave may like to feel the surrounding waves urging it forward with or against its own will I felt that I belonged to the world that there was something for me to do in it though I had not yet found out what Something to do it might be very little but still it would be my own work And then there was the better something which I had almost forgotten to be Underneath my dull thoughts the old aspirations were smouldering the old ideals rose and beckoned to me through the rekindling light It was always aspiration rather than ambition by which I felt myself stirred I did not care to outstrip others and become what is called distinguished were that a possibility so much as I longed to answer the Voice that invited ever receding up to invisible heights however unattainable they might seem I was conscious of a desire that others should feel something coming to them out of my life like the breath of flowers the whisper of the winds the warmth of the sunshine and the depth of the sky That I felt did not require great gifts or a fine education We might all be that to each other And there was no opportunity for vanity or pride in receiving a beautiful influence and giving it out again I do not suppose that I definitely thought all this though I find that the verses I wrote for our two mill magazines at about this time often expressed these and similar longings They were vague and they were too likely to dissipate themselves in mere dreams But our aspirations come to us from a source far beyond ourselves Happy are they who are not disobedient unto the heavenly vision A girl of sixteen sees the world before her through rose tinted mists a blending of celestial colors and earthly exhalations and she cannot separate their elements if she would they all belong to the landscape of her youth It is the mystery of the meeting horizons the visible beauty seeking to lose and find itself in the Invisible In returning to my daily toil among workmates from the hill country the scenery to which they belonged became also a part of my life They brought the mountains with them a new background and a new hope We shared an uneven path and homely occupations but above us hung glorious summits never wholly out of sight Every blossom and every dewdrop at our feet was touched with some tint of that far off splendor and every pebble by the wayside was a messenger from the peak that our feet would stand upon by and by The true climber knows the delight of trusting his path of following it without seeing a step before him or a glimpse of blue sky above him sometimes only knowing that it is the right path because it is the only one and because it leads upward This our daily duty was to us Though we did not always know it the faithful plodder was sure to win the heights Unconsciously we learned the lesson that only by humble Doing can any of us win the lofty possibilities of Being For indeed what we all want to find is not so much our place as our path The path leads to the place and the place when we have found it is only a clearing by the roadside an opening into another path And no comrades are so dear as those who have broken with us a pioneer road which it will be safe and good for others to follow which will furnish a plain clue for all bewildered travelers hereafter There is no more exhilarating human experience than this and perhaps it is the highest angelic one It may be that some such mutual work is to link us forever with one another in the Infinite Life The girls who toiled together at Lowell were clearing away a few weeds from the overgrown track of independent labor for other women They practically said by numbering themselves among factory girls that in our country no real odium could be attached to any honest toil that any self respecting woman might undertake I regard it as one of the privileges of my youth that I was permitted to grow up among those active interesting girls whose lives were not mere echoes of other lives but had principle and purpose distinctly their own Their vigor of character was a natural development The New Hampshire girls who came to Lowell were descendants of the sturdy backwoodsmen who settled that State scarcely a hundred years before Their grandmothers had suffered the hardships of frontier life had known the horrors of savage warfare when the beautiful valleys of the Connecticut and the Merrimack were threaded with Indian trails from Canada to the white settlements Those young women did justice to their inheritance They were earnest and capable ready to undertake anything that was worth doing My dreamy indolent nature was shamed into activity among them They gave me a larger firmer ideal of womanhood Often during the many summers and autumns that of late years I have spent among the New Hampshire hills sometimes far up the mountainsides where I could listen to the first song of the little brooks setting out on their journey to join the very river that flowed at my feet when I was a working girl on its banks the Merrimack I have felt as if I could also hear the early music of my workmates lives those who were born among these glorious summits Pure strong crystalline natures carrying down with them the light of blue skies and the freshness of free winds to their place of toil broadening and strengthening as they went on who can tell how they have refreshed the world how beautifully they have blended their being with the great ocean of results A brook s life is like the life of a maiden The rivers receive their strength from the rock born hills from the unfailing purity of the mountain streams A girl s place in the world is a very strong one it is a pity that she does not always see it so It is strongest through her natural impulse to steady herself by leaning upon the Eternal Life the only Reality and her weakness comes also from her inclination to lean against something upon an unworthy support rather than none at all She often lets her life get broken into fragments among the flimsy trellises of fashion and conventionality when it might be a perfect thing in the upright beauty of its own consecrated freedom Yet girlhood seldom appreciates itself We often hear a girl wishing that she were a boy That seems so strange God made no mistake in her creation He sent her into the world full of power and will to be a helper and only He knows how much his world needs help She is here to make this great house of humanity a habitable and a beautiful place without and within a true home for every one of his children It matters not if she is poor if she has to toil for her daily bread or even if she is surrounded by coarseness and uncongeniality nothing can deprive her of her natural instinct to help of her birthright as a helper These very hindrances may with faith and patience develop in her a nobler womanhood No let girls be as thankful that they are girls as that they are human beings for they also according to his own loving plan for them were created in the image of God Their real power the divine dowry of womanhood is that of receiving and giving inspiration In this a girl often surpasses her brother and it is for her to hold firmly and faithfully to her holiest instincts so that when he lets his standard droop she may through her spiritual strength be a standard bearer for him Courage and self reliance are now held to be virtues as womanly as they are manly for the world has grown wise enough to see that nothing except a life can really help another life It is strange that it should ever have held any other theory about woman That was a true use of the word help that grew up so naturally in the rendering and receiving of womanly service in the old fashioned New England household A girl came into a family as one of the home group to share its burdens to feel that they were her own The woman who employed her if her nature was at all generous could not feel that money alone was an equivalent for a heart s service she added to it her friendship her gratitude and esteem The domestic problem can never be rightly settled until the old idea of mutual help is in some way restored This is a question for girls of the present generation to consider and she who can bring about a practical solution of it will win the world s gratitude We used sometimes to see it claimed in public prints that it would be better for all of us mill girls to be working in families at domestic service than to be where we were Perhaps the difficulties of modern housekeepers did begin with the opening of the Lowell factories Country girls were naturally independent and the feeling that at this new work the few hours they had of every day leisure were entirely their own was a satisfaction to them They preferred it to going out as hired help It was like a young man s pleasure in entering upon business for himself Girls had never tried that experiment before and they liked it It brought out in them a dormant strength of character which the world did not previously see but now fully acknowledges Of course they had a right to continue at that freer kind of work as long as they chose although their doing so increased the perplexities of the housekeeping problem for themselves even since many of them were to become and did become American house mistresses It would be a step towards the settlement of this vexed and vexing question if girls would decline to classify each other by their occupations which among us are usually only temporary and are continually shifting from one pair of hands to another Changes of fortune come so abruptly that the millionaire s daughter of to day may be glad to earn her living by sewing or sweeping tomorrow It is the first duty of every woman to recognize the mutual bond of universal womanhood Let her ask herself whether she would like to hear herself or little sister spoken of as a shop girl or a factory girl or a servant girl if necessity had compelled her for a time to be employed in either of the ways indicated If she would shrink from it a little then she is a little inhuman when she puts her unknown human sisters who are so occupied into a class by themselves feeling herself to be somewhat their superior She is really the superior person who has accepted her work and is doing it faithfully whatever it is This designating others by their casual employments prevents one from making real distinctions from knowing persons as persons A false standard is set up in the minds of those who classify and of those who are classified Perhaps it is chiefly the fault of ladies themselves that the word lady has nearly lost its original meaning a noble one indicating sympathy and service bread giver to those who are in need The idea that it means something external in dress or circumstances has been too generally adopted by rich and poor and this coupled with the sweeping notion that in our country one person is just as good as another has led to ridiculous results like that of saleswomen calling themselves sales ladies I have even heard a chambermaid at a hotel introduce herself to guests as the chamber lady I do not believe that any Lowell mill girl was ever absurd enough to wish to be known as a factory lady although most of them knew that factory girl did not represent a high type of womanhood in the Old World But they themselves belonged to the New World not to the Old and they were making their own traditions to hand down to their Republican descendants one of which was and is that honest work has no need to assert itself or to humble itself in a nation like ours but simply to take its place as one of the foundation stones of the Republic The young women who worked at Lowell had the advantage of living in a community where character alone commanded respect They never at their work or away from it heard themselves contemptuously spoken of on account of their occupation except by the ignorant or weak minded whose comments they were of course to sensible to heed We may as well acknowledge that one of the unworthy tendencies of womankind is towards petty estimates of other women This classifying habit illustrates the fact If we must classify our sisters let us broaden ourselves by making large classifications We might all place ourselves in one of two ranks the women who do something and the women who do nothing the first being of course the only creditable place to occupy And if we would escape from our pettinesses as we all may and should the way to do it is to find the key to other lives and live in their largeness by sharing their outlook upon life Even poorer people s windows will give us a new horizon and people s windows will give us a new horizon and often a far broader one than our own X MILL GIRLS MAGAZINES THERE was a passage from Cowper that my sister used to quote to us because she said she often repeated it to herself and found that it did her good In such a world so thorny and where none Finds happiness unblighted or if found Without some thistly sorrow at its side It seems the part of wisdom and no sin Against the law of love to measure lots With less distinguished than ourselves that thus We may with patience bear our moderate ills And sympathize with others suffering more I think she made us feel she certainly made me feel that our lot was in many ways an unusually fortunate one and full of responsibilities She herself was always thinking what she could do for others not only immediately about her but in the farthest corners of the earth She had her Sabbath school class and visited all the children in it she sat up all night very often watching by a sick girl s bed in the hospital or in some distant boarding house she gave money to send to missionaries or to help build new churches in the city when she was earning only eight or ten dollars a month clear of her board and could afford herself but one best dress besides her working clothes That best dress was often nothing but a Merrimack print But she insisted that it was a great saving of trouble to have just this one because she was not obliged to think what she should wear if she were invited out to spend an evening And she kept track of all the great philanthropic movements of the day She felt deeply the shame and wrong of American slavery and tried to make her workmates see and feel it too Petitions to Congress for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia were circulated nearly every year among the mill girls and received thousands of signatures Whenever she was not occupied with her work or her reading or with looking after us younger ones two or three hours a day was all the time she could call her own she was sure to be away on some errand of friendliness or mercy Those who do most for others are always those who are called upon continually to do a little more and who find a way to do it People go to them as to a bank that never fails And surely they who have an abundance of life in themselves and who give their life out freely to others are the only really rich Two dollars a week sounds very small but in Emilie s hands it went farther than many a princely fortune of to day because she managed with it to make so many people happy But then she wanted absolutely nothing for herself nothing but the privilege of helping others I seem to be eulogizing my sister though I am simply relating matters of fact I could not however illustrate my own early experience except by the lives around me which most influenced mine And it was true that our smaller and more self centred natures in touching hers caught something of her spirit the contagion of her warm heart and healthy energy For health is more contagious than disease and lives that exhale sweetness around them from the inner heaven of their souls keep the world wholesome I tried to follow her in my faltering way and was gratified when she would send me to look up one of her stray children or would let me watch with her at night by a sick bed I think it was partly for the sake of keeping as close to her as I could though not without a sincere desire to consecrate myself to the Best that I became at about thirteen a member of the church which we attended Our minister was a scholarly man of refined tastes and a sensitive organization fervently spiritual and earnestly devoted to his work It was all education to grow up under his influence I shall never forget the effect left by the tones of his voice when he first spoke to me a child of ten years at a neighborhood prayer meeting in my mother s sitting room He had been inviting his listeners to the friendship of Christ and turning to my little sister and me he said And these little children too won t they come The words and his manner of saving them brought the tears to my eyes Once only before far back in my earlier childhood I have already mentioned the incident had I heard that Name spoken so tenderly and familiarly yet so reverently It was as if he had been gazing into the face of an invisible Friend and bad just turned from Him to look into ours while he gave us his message that He loved us In that moment I again caught a glimpse of One whom I had always known but had often forgotten One who claimed me as his Father s child and would never let me go It was a real Face that I saw a real Voice that I heard a real Person who was calling me I could not mistake the Presence that had so often drawn near me and shone with sunlike eyes into my soul The words Lord lift Thou up the light of thy countenance upon us had always given me the feeling that a beautiful sunrise does It is indeed a sunrise text for is not He the Light of the World And peaceful sunshine seemed pouring in at the windows of my life on the day when I stood in the aisle before the pulpit with a group who though young were all much older than myself and took with them the vows that bound us to his service Of what was then said and read I scarcely remember more than the words of heavenly welcome in the Epistle Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners It was like coming home like stepping a little farther beyond the threshold in at the open door of our Father s house Perhaps I was too young to assume those vows Had I deferred it a few years there would have been serious intellectual hindrances But it was not the Articles of Faith I was thinking of although there was a long list of them to which we all bowed assent as was the custom It was the homecoming to the house not made with hands the gladness of signifying that I belonged to God s spiritual family and was being drawn closer to his heart with whom none of us are held as strangers and foreigners I felt that I was taking up again the clue which had been put into my childish hand at baptism and was being led on by it into the unfolding mysteries of life Should I ever let it slip from me and lose the way to the many mansions that now seemed so open and so near I could not think so It is well that we cannot foresee our falterings and failures At least I could never forget that I had once felt my own and other lives bound together with the Eternal Life by an invisible thread The vague fitful desire I had felt from my childhood to be something to the world I lived in to give it something of the the inexpressible sweetness that often seemed pouring through me I knew not whence now began to shape itself into a definite outreach towards the Source of all spiritual life To draw near to the One All Beautiful Being Christ to know Him as our spirits may know The Spirit to receive the breath of his infinitely loving Life into mine that I might breathe out that fragrance again into the lives around me this was the longing wish that half hidden from myself lay deep beneath all other desires of my soul This was what religion grew to mean to me what it is still growing to mean more simply and more clearly as the years go on The heart must be very humble to which this heavenly approach is permitted It knows that it has nothing in itself nothing for others which it has not received The loving Voice of Him who gives his friends his errands to do whispers through them constantly Ye are not your own There may be those who would think my narrative more entertaining if I omitted these inner experiences and related only lighter incidents But one thing I was aware of from the time I began to think and to wonder about my own life that what I felt and thought was far more real to me than the things that happened Circumstances are only the keys that unlock for us the secret of ourselves and I learned very early that though there is much to enjoy in this beautiful outside world there is much more to love to believe in and to seek in the invisible world out of which it all grows What has best revealed our true selves to ourselves must be most helpful to others and one can willingly sacrifice some natural reserves to such an end Besides if we tell our own story at all we naturally wish to tell the truest part of it Work study and worship were interblended in our life The church was really the home centre to many perhaps to most of us and it was one of the mill regulations that everybody should go to church somewhere There must have been an earnest group of ministers at Lowell since nearly all the girls attended public worship from choice Our minister joined us in our social gatherings often inviting us to his own house visiting us at our work accompanying us on our picnics down the river bank a walk of a mile or so took us into charmingly picturesque scenery and we always walked suggesting books for our reading and assisting us in our studies The two magazines published by the mill girls the Lowell Offering and the Operatives Magazine originated with literary meetings in the vestry of two religious societies the first in the Universalist Church the second in the First Congregational to which my sister and I belonged On account of our belonging there our contributions were given to the Operatives Magazine the first periodical for which I ever wrote issued by the literary society of which our minister took charge He met us on regular evenings read aloud our poems and sketches and made such critical suggestions as he thought desirable This magazine was edited by two young women both of whom had been employed in the mills although at that time the were teachers in the public schools a change which was often made by mill girls after a few months residence at Lowell A great many of them were district school teachers at their homes in the summer spending only the winters at their work The two magazines went on side by side for a year or two and then were united in the Lowell Offering which had made the first experiment of the kind by publishing a trial number or two at irregular intervals My sister had sent some verses of mine on request to be published in one of those specimen numbers But we were not acquainted with the editor of the Offering and we knew only a few of its contributors The Universalist Church in the vestry of which they met was in a distant part of the city Socially the place where we worshiped was the place where we naturally came together in other ways The churches were all filled to overflowing so that the grouping together of the girls by their denominational preferences was almost unavoidable It was in some such way as this that two magazines were started instead of one If the girls who enjoyed writing had not been so many and so scattered they might have made the better arrangement of joining their forces from the beginning I was too young a contributor to be at first of much value to either periodical They began their regular issues I think while I was the nursemaid of my little nephews at Beverly When I returned to Lowell at about sixteen I found my sister Emilie interested in the Operatives Magazine and we both contributed to it regularly until it was merged in the Lowell Offering to which we then transferred our writing efforts It did not occur to us to call these efforts literary I know that I wrote just as I did for our little Diving Bell as a sort of pastime and because my daily toil was mechanical and furnished no occupation for my thoughts Perhaps the fact that most of us wrote in this way accounted for the rather sketchy and fragmentary character of our Magazine It gave evidence that we thought and that we thought upon solid and serious matters but the criticism of one of our superintendents upon it very kindly given was undoubtedly just It has plenty of pith but it lacks point The Offering had always more of the literary spirit and touch It was indeed for the first two years edited by a gentleman of acknowledged literary ability But people seemed to be more interested in it after it passed entirely into the bands of the girls themselves The Operatives Magazine had a decidedly religious tone We who wrote for it were loyal to our Puritanic antecedents and considered it all important that our lightest actions should be moved by some earnest impulse from behind We might write playfully but there must be conscience and reverence somewhere within it all We had been taught and we believed that idle words were a sin whether spoken or written This no doubt gave us a gravity of expression rather unnatural to youth In looking over the bound volume of this magazine I am amused at the grown up style of thought assumed by myself probably its very youngest contributor I wrote a dissertation on Fame quoting from Pollok Cowper and Milton and ending with Diedrich Knickerbocker s definition of immortal fame Half a page of dirty paper For other titles I had Thoughts on Beauty Gentility Sympathy et cetera And in one longish poem entitled My Childhood written when I was about fifteen I find verses like these which would seem to have come out of a mature experience My childhood O those pleasant days when everything seemed free And in the broad and verdant fields I frolicked merrily When joy came to my bounding heart with every wild bird s song And Nature s music in my ears was ringing all day long And yet I would not call them back those blessed times of yore For riper years are fraught with joys I dreamed not of before The labyrinth of Science opes with wonders every day And friendship hath full many a flower to cheer life s dreary way And glancing through the pages of the Lowell Offering a year or two later I see that I continued to dismalize myself at times quite unnecessarily The title of one sting of morbid verses is The Complaint of a Nobody in which I compare myself to a weed growing up in a garden and the conclusion of it all is this stanza When the fierce storms are raging I will not repine Though I m heedlessly crushed in the strife For surely t were better oblivion were mine Than a worthless inglorious life Now I do not suppose that I really considered myself a weed though I did sometimes fancy that a different kind of cultivation would tend to make me a more useful plant I am glad to remember that these discontented fits were only occasional for certainly they were unreasonable I was not unhappy this was an affectation of unhappiness and half conscious that it was I hid it behind a different signature from my usual one How truly Wordsworth describes this phase of undeveloped feeling In youth sad fancies we affect In luxury of disrespect To our own prodigal excess Of too familiar happiness It is a very youthful weakness to exaggerate passing moods into deep experiences and if we put them down on paper we get a fine opportunity of laughing at ourselves if we live to outgrow them as most of us do I think I must have had a frequent fancy that I was not long for this world Perhaps I thought an early death rather picturesque many young people do There is a certain kind of poetry that fosters this idea that delights in imaginary youthful victims and has reciprocally its youthful devotees One of my blank verse poems in the Offering is entitled The Early Doomed It begins And must I die The world is bright to me And everything that looks upon me smiles Another poem is headed Memento Mori and another entitled a Song in June which ought to be cheerful goes off into the doleful request to somebody or anybody to Weave me a shroud in the month of June I was perhaps healthier than the average girl and had no predisposition to a premature decline and in reviewing these absurdities of my pen I feel like saying to any young girl who inclines to rhyme Don t sentimentalize Write more of what you see than of what you feel and let your feelings realize themselves to others in the shape of worthy actions Then they will be natural and will furnish you with something worth writing It is fair to myself to explain however that many of these verses of mine were written chiefly as exercises in rhythmic expression I remember this distinctly about one of my poems with a terrible title The Murderer s Request in which I made an imaginary criminal pose for me telling where he would not and where he would like to be buried I modeled my verses Bury ye me on some storm rifted mountain O erhanging the depths of a yawning abyss upon Byron s Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime and I was only trying to see how near I could approach to his exquisite metre I do not think I felt at all murderous in writing it but a more innocent subject would have been in better taste and would have met the exigencies of the dactyl quite as well It is also only fair to myself to say that my rhyming was usually of a more wholesome kind I loved Nature as I knew her in our stern blustering stimulating New England and I chanted the praises of Winter of snow storms and of March winds I always took pride in my birth month March with hearty delight Flowers had begun to bring me messages from their own world when I was a very small child and they never withdrew their companionship from my thoughts for there came summers when I could only look out of the mill window and dream about them I had one pet window plant of my own a red rosebush almost a perpetual bloomer that I kept beside me at my work for years I parted with it only when I went away to the West and then with regret for it had been to me like a human little friend But the wild flowers had my heart I lived and breathed with them out under the free winds of heaven and when I could not see them I wrote about them Much that I contributed to those mill magazine pages they suggested my mute teachers comforters and inspirers It seems to me that any one who does not care for wild flowers misses half the sweetness of this mortal life Horace Smith s Hymn to the Flowers was a continual delight to me after I made its acquaintance It seemed as if all the wild blossoms of the woods had wandered in and were twining themselves around the whirring spindles as I repeated it verse after verse Better still they drew me out in fancy to their own forest haunts under cloistered boughs where each swinging floral bell was ringing a call to prayer and making Sabbath in the fields Bryant s Forest Hymn did me an equally beautiful service I knew every word of it It seemed to me that Bryant understood the very heart and soul of the flowers as hardly anybody else did He made me feel as if they were really related to us human beings In fancy my feet pressed the turf where they grew and I knew them as my little sisters while my thoughts touched them one by one saying with him That delicate forest flower With scented breath and look so like a smile Seems as it issues from the shapeless mould An emanation of the indwelling Life A visible token of the upholding Love That are the soul of this wide universe I suppose that most of my readers will scarcely be older than I was when I wrote my sermonish little poems under the inspiration of the flowers at my factory work and perhaps they will be interested in reading a specimen or two from the Lowell Offering LIVE LIKE THE FLOWERS Cheerfully wave they o er valley and mountain Gladden the desert and smile by the fountain Pale discontent in no young blossom lowers Live like the flowers Meekly their buds in the heavy rain bending Softly their hues with the mellow light blending Gratefully welcoming sunlight and showers Live like the flowers Freely their sweets on the wild breezes flinging While in their depths are new odors upspringing Blessedness twofold of Love s holy dowers Live like the flowers Gladly they heed Who their brightness has given Blooming on earth look they all up to heaven Humbly look up from their loveliest bowers Live like the flowers Peacefully droop they when autumn is sighing Breathing mild fragrance around them in dying Sleep they in hope of Spring s freshening hours Die like the flowers The prose poem that follows was put into a rhymed version by several unknown hands in periodicals of that day so that at last I also wrote one in self defense to claim my own waif But it was a prose poem that I intended it to be and I think it is better so BRING BACK MY FLOWERS On the bank of a rivulet sat a rosy child Her lap was filled with flowers and a garland of rose buds was twined around her neck Her face was as radiant as the sunshine that fell upon it and her voice was as clear as that of the bird which warbled at her side The little stream went singing on and with every gush of its music the child lifted a flower in her dimpled hand and with a merry laugh threw it upon the water In her glee she forgot that her treasures were growing less and with the swift motion of childhood she flung them upon the sparkling tide until every bud and blossom had disappeared Then seeing her loss she sprang to her feet and bursting into tears called aloud to the stream Bring back my flowers But the stream danced along regardless of her sorrow and as it bore the blooming burden away her words came back in a taunting echo along its reedy margin And long after amid the wailing of the breeze and the fitful bursts of childish grief was heard the fruitless cry Bring back my flowers Merry maiden who art idly wasting the precious moments so bountifully bestowed upon thee see in the thoughtless child an emblem of thyself Each moment is a perfumed flower Let its fragrance be diffused in blessings around thee and ascend as sweet incense to the beneficent Giver Else when thou hast carelessly flung them from thee and seest them receding on the swift waters of Time thou wilt cry in tones more sorrowful than those of the weeping child Bring back my flowers And thy only answer will be an echo from the shadowy Past Bring back my flowers In the above a reminiscence of my German studies comes back to me I was an admirer of Jean Paul and one of my earliest attempts at translation was his New Year s Night of an Unhappy Man with its yet haunting glimpse of a fair long paradise beyond the mountains I am not sure but the idea of trying my hand at a prose poem came to me from Richter though it may have been from Herder or Krummacher whom I also enjoyed and attempted to translate I have a manuscript book still filled with these youthful efforts I even undertook to put German verse into English verse not wincing at the greatest Goethe and Schiller These studies were pursued in the pleasant days of cloth room leisure when my work claimed me only seven or eight hours in a day I suppose I should have tried to write perhaps I could not very well have helped attempting it under any circumstances My early efforts would not probably have found their way into print however but for the coincident publication of the two mill girls magazines just as I entered my teens I fancy that almost everything any of us offered them was published though I never was let in to editorial secrets The editors of both magazines were my seniors and I felt greatly honored by their approval of my contributions One of the Offering editors was a Unitarian clergyman s daughter and had received an excellent education The other was a remarkably brilliant and original young woman who wrote novels that were published by the Harpers of New York while she was employed at Lowell The two had rooms together for a time where the members of the Improvement Circle chiefly composed of Offering writers were hospitably received The Operatives Magazine and the Lowell Offering were united in the year eighteen forty two under the title of the Lowell Offering and Magazine And to correct a mistake which has crept into print I will say that I never attained the honor of being editor of either of these magazines I was only one of their youngest contributors The Lowell Offering closed its existence when I was a little more than twenty years old The only continuous editing I have ever been engaged in was upon Our Young Folks About twenty years ago I was editor in charge of that magazine for a year or more and I had previously been its assistant editor from its beginning These explanatory items however do not quite belong to my narrative and I return to our magazines We did not receive much criticism perhaps it would have been better for us if we had But then we did lot set ourselves up to be literary though we enjoyed the freedom of writing what we pleased and seeing how it looked in print It was good practice for us and that was all that we desired We were complimented and quoted When a Philadelphia paper copied one of my little poems suggesting some verbal improvements and predicting recognition for me in the future I felt for the first time that there might be such a thing as public opinion worth caring for in addition to doing one s best for its own sake Fame indeed never had much attraction for me except as it took the form of friendly recognition and the sympathetic approval of worthy judges I wished to do good and true things but not such as would subject me to the stare of coldly curious eyes I could never imagine a girl feeling any pleasure in placing herself before the public The privilege of seclusion must be the last one a woman can willingly sacrifice And indeed what we wrote was not remarkable perhaps no more so than the usual school compositions of intelligent girls It would hardly be worth while to refer to it particularly had not the Lowell girls and their magazines been so frequently spoken of as something phenomenal But it was a perfectly natural outgrowth of those girls previous life For what were we Girls who were working in a factory for the time to be sure but none of us had the least idea of continuing at that kind of work permanently Our composite photograph had it been taken would have been the representative New England girlhood of those days We had all been fairly educated at public or private schools and many of us were resolutely bent upon obtaining a better education Very few were among us without some distinct plan for bettering the condition of themselves and those they loved For the first time our young women had come forth from their home retirement in a throng each with her own individual purpose For twenty years or so Lowell might have been looked upon as a rather select industrial school for young people The girls there were just such girls as are knocking at the doors of young women s colleges to day They had come to work with their hands but they could not hinder the working of their minds also Their mental activity was overflowing at every possible outlet Many of them were supporting themselves at schools like Bradford Academy or Ipswich Seminary half the year by working in the mills the other half Mount Holyoke Seminary broke upon the thoughts of many of them as a vision of hope I remember being dazzled by it myself for a while and Mary Lyon s name was honored nowhere more than among the Lowell mill girls Meanwhile they were improving themselves and preparing for their future in every possible way by purchasing and reading standard books by attending lectures and evening classes of their own getting up and by meeting each other for reading and conversation That they should write was no more strange than that they should study or read or think And yet there were those to whom it seemed incredible that a girl could in the pauses of her work put together words with her pen that it would do to print and after a while the assertion was circulated through some distant newspaper that our magazine was not written by ourselves at all but by Lowell lawyers This seemed almost too foolish a suggestion to contradict but the editor of the Offering thought it best to give the name and occupation of some of the writers by way of refutation It was for this reason much against my own wish that my real name was first attached to anything I wrote I was then book keeper in the cloth room of the Lawrence Mills We had all used any fanciful signature we chose varying it as we pleased After I began to read and love Wordsworth my favorite nom de plume was Rotha In the later numbers of the magazine the editor more frequently made us of my initials One day I was surprised by seeing my name in full in Griswold s Female Poet s no great distinction however since there were a hundred names or so besides It seemed necessary to give these gossip items about myself but the real interest of every separate life story is involved in the larger life history which is going on around it We do not know ourselves without our companions and surroundings I cannot narrate my workmates separate experiences but I know that because of having lived among them and because of having felt the beauty and power of their lives I am different from what I should otherwise have been and it is my own fault if I am not better for my life with them In recalling those years of my girlhood at Lowell I often think that I knew then what real society is better perhaps than ever since For in that large gathering together of young womanhood there were many choice natures some of the choicest in all our excellent New England and there were no false social standards to hold them apart It is the best society when people meet sincerely on the ground of their deepest sympathies and highest aspirations without conventionality or cliques or affectation and it was in that way that these young girls met and became acquainted with each other almost of necessity There were all varieties of woman nature among them all degrees of refinement and cultivation and of course many sharp contrasts of agreeable and disagreeable It was not always the most cultivated however who were the most companionable There were gentle untaught girls as fresh and simple as wild flowers whose unpretending goodness of heart was better to have than bookishness girls who loved everybody and were loved by everybody Those are the girls that I remember best and their memory is sweet as a breeze from the clover fields As I recall the throngs of unknown girlish forms that used to pass and repass me on the familiar road to the mill gates and also the few that I knew so well those with whom I worked thought read wrote studied and worshiped my thoughts send a heartfelt greeting to them all wherever in God s beautiful busy universe they may now be scattered I am glad I have lived in the world with you XI READING AND STUDYING My return to mill work involved making acquaintance with a new kind of machinery The spinning room was the only one I had hitherto known anything about Now my sister Emilie found a place for me in the dressing room beside herself 
6594-68896-0000	train-other-500	It was more airy and fewer girls were in the room
none	none	 for the dressing frame itself was a large clumsy affair that occupied a great deal of space Mine seemed to me as unmanageable as an overgrown spoilt child 
6594-68896-0001	train-other-500	It had to be watched in a dozen directions every minute and even then it was always getting itself and me into trouble I felt as if the half live creature with its great groaning joints and whizzing fan was aware of my incapacity to manage it and had a fiendish spite against me
6594-68896-0002	train-other-500	I contracted an unconquerable dislike to it indeed I had never liked and never could learn to like any kind of machinery And this machine finally conquered me It was humiliating but I had to acknowledge that there were some things I could not do
6594-68896-0003	train-other-500	and I retired from the field vanquished The two things I had enjoyed in this room were that my sister was with me and that our windows looked toward the west When the work was running smoothly we looked out together and quoted to each other all the sunset poetry we could remember
6594-68896-0004	train-other-500	Our tastes did not quite agree Her favorite description of the clouds was from Pollok They seemed like chariots of saints By fiery coursers drawn as brightly hued As if the glorious bushy golden locks Of thousand cherubim had been shorn off
6594-68896-0005	train-other-500	And on the temples hung of morn and even I liked better a translation from the German beginning Methinks it were no pain to die On such an eve while such a sky O ercanopies the west
none	none	 And she generally had to hear the whole poem for I was very fond of it 
6594-68896-0006	train-other-500	though the especial verse that I contrasted with hers was There s peace and welcome in yon sea Of endless blue tranquillity Those clouds are living things I trace their veins of liquid gold And see them silently unfold Their soft and fleecy wings
6594-68896-0007	train-other-500	Then she would tell me that my nature inclined to quietness and harmony while hers asked for motion and splendor I wondered whether it really were so
6594-68896-0008	train-other-500	But that huge creaking framework beside us would continually intrude upon our meditations and break up our discussions and silence all poetry for us with its dull prose Emilie found more profitable work elsewhere and I found some that was less so
6594-68896-0009	train-other-500	but far more satisfactory as it would give me the openings of leisure which I craved The paymaster asked when I left Going where on can earn more money No I answered I am going where I can have more time
none	none	 Ah yes he said sententiously 
6594-68896-0010	train-other-500	time is money But that was not my thought about it Time is education I said to myself for that was what I meant it should be to me Perhaps I never gave the wage earning element in work its due weight
6594-68896-0011	train-other-500	It always seemed to me that the Apostle s idea about worldly possessions was the only sensible one Having food and raiment let us be therewith content If I could earn enough to furnish that and have time to study besides
6594-68896-0012	train-other-500	of course we always gave away a little however little we had it seemed to me a
none	none	 sufficiency 
6594-68896-0013	train-other-500	At this time I was receiving two dollars a week besides my board Those who were earning much more and were carefully laying it up did not appear to be any happier than I was I never thought that the possession of money would make me feel rich
6594-68896-0014	train-other-500	it often does seem to have an opposite effect But then
none	none	 I have never had the opportunity of knowing by experience how it does make one feel 
6594-68896-0015	train-other-500	It is something to have been spared the responsibility of taking charge of the Lord s silver and gold Let us be thankful for what we have not as well as for what we have
6594-68896-0016	train-other-500	Freedom to live one s life truly is surely more desirable than any earthly acquisition or possession and at my new work I had hours of freedom every day I never went back again to the bondage of machinery and a working day thirteen hours long
6594-68896-0017	train-other-500	The daughter of one of our neighbors who also went to the same church with us told me of a vacant place in the cloth room where she was which I gladly secured This was a low brick building next the counting room and a little apart from the mills
6594-68896-0018	train-other-500	where the cloth was folded stamped and baled for the market There were only half a dozen girls of us who measured the cloth and kept an account of the pieces baled and their length in yards
none	none	 It pleased me much to have something to do which required the use of pen and ink and I think there must be a good many scraps of verse buried among the blank pages of those old account books of that found their way there during the frequent half hours of waiting for the cloth to be brought in from the mills 
6594-68896-0019	train-other-500	The only machinery in the room was a hydraulic arrangement for pressing the cloth into bales managed by two or three men one of whom was quite a poet and a fine singer also His hymns were frequently in request on public occasions
6594-68896-0020	train-other-500	He lent me the first volume of Whittier s poems that I ever saw It was a small book containing mostly Antislavery pieces The Yankee Girl was one of them fully to appreciate the spirit of which it is necessary to have been a working girl in slave labor times
6594-68896-0021	train-other-500	New England Womanhood crowned Whittier as her laureate from the day of his heroine s spirited response to the slaveholder O could ye have seen her that pride of our girls Arise and cast back the dark wealth of her curls
6594-68896-0022	train-other-500	With a scorn in her eye that the gazer could feel And a glance like the sunshine that flashes on steel Go back haughty Southron Go back for thy gold Is red with the blood of the hearts thou hast sold
6594-68896-0023	train-other-500	There was in this volume another poem which is not in any of the later editions the impression of which as it remains to me in broken snatches is very beautiful It began with the lines Bind up thy tresses thou beautiful one
6594-68896-0024	train-other-500	Of brown in the shadow and gold in the sun It was a refreshment and an inspiration to look into this book between my long rows of figures and read such poems as The Angel of Patience Follen
none	none	 Raphael 
6594-68896-0025	train-other-500	and that wonderfully rendered Hymn from Lamartine that used to whisper itself through me after I had read it like the echo of a spirit s voice
6594-68896-0026	train-other-500	When the Breath Divine is flowing Zephyr like o er all things going And as the touch of viewless fingers Softly on my soul it lingers Open to a breath the lightest Conscious of a touch the slightest
6594-68896-0027	train-other-500	Then O Father Thou alone From the shadow of thy throne To the sighing of my breast And its rapture answerest I grew so familiar with this volume that I felt acquainted with the poet long before I met him It remained in my desk drawer for months
6594-68896-0028	train-other-500	I thought it belonged to my poetic friend the baler of cloth But one day he informed me that it was a borrowed book he thought however he should claim it for his own now that he had kept it so long
none	none	 Upon which remark I delivered it up to the custody of his own conscience and saw it no more 
6594-68896-0029	train-other-500	One day towards the last of my stay at Lowell I never changed my work room again this same friendly fellow toiler handed me a poem to read which some one had sent in to us from the counting room with the penciled comment Singularly beautiful
6594-68896-0030	train-other-500	It was Poe s Raven which had just made its first appearance in some magazine It seemed like an apparition in literature indeed the sensation it created among the staid measured lyrics of that day
none	none	 with its flit of spectral wings and its ghostly refrain of Nevermore 
6594-68896-0031	train-other-500	was very noticeable Poe came to Lowell to live awhile but it was after I had gone away Our national poetry was at this time just beginning to be well known and appreciated
6594-68896-0032	train-other-500	Bryant had published two volumes and every school child was familiar with his Death of the Flowers and God s First Temples Some one lent me the Voices of the Night the only collection of Longfellow s verse then issued I think
6594-68896-0033	train-other-500	The Footsteps of Angels glided at once into my memory and took possession of a permanent place there with its tender melody The Last Leaf and Old Ironsides were favorites with everybody who read poetry at all
6594-68896-0034	train-other-500	but I do not think we Lowell girls had a volume of doctor Holmes s poems at that time The Lady s Book and Graham s Magazine were then the popular periodicals and the mill girls took them I remember that the nuggets
none	none	 I used to pick out of one or the other of them when I was quite a child were labeled with the signature of Harriet E Beecher Father Morris and Uncle Tim and others of the delightful May Flower snatches first appeared in this way Irving s Sketch Book all reading people were supposed to have read and I recall the pleasure it was to me when one of my sisters came into possession of Knickerbocker s History of New York 
6594-68896-0035	train-other-500	It was the first humorous book as well as the first history that I ever cared about And I was pleased enough for I was a little girl when my fondness for it began
none	none	 to hear our minister say that he always read Diedrich Knickerbocker for his tired Monday s recreation 
6594-68896-0036	train-other-500	We were allowed to have books in the cloth room The absence of machinery permitted that privilege Our superintendent who was a man of culture and a Christian gentleman of the Puritan school
none	none	 dignified and reserved used often to stop at my desk in his daily round to see what book I was reading 
6594-68896-0037	train-other-500	One day it was Mather s Magnalia which I had brought from the public library with a desire to know something of the early history of New England He looked a little surprised at the archaeological turn my mind had taken but his only comment was
6594-68896-0038	train-other-500	A valuable old book that
none	none	 It was a satisfaction to have a superintendent like him whose granite principles emphasized by his stately figure and bearing 
6594-68896-0039	train-other-500	made him a tower of strength in the church and in the community He kept a silent kindly rigid watch over the corporation life of which he was the head and only those of us who were incidentally admitted to his confidence knew how carefully we were guarded
6594-68896-0040	train-other-500	We had occasional glimpses into his own well ordered home life at social gatherings
none	none	 His little daughter was in my infant Sabbath school class from her fourth to her seventh or eighth year She sometimes visited me at my work 
6594-68896-0041	train-other-500	and we had our frolics among the heaps of cloth as if we were both children
none	none	 She had also the same love of hymns that I had as a child and she would sit by my side and repeat to me one after another that she had learned 
6594-68896-0042	train-other-500	not as a task but because of her delight in them One of my
none	none	 sincerest griefs in going off to the West was that I should see my little pupil Mary as a child no more 
6594-68896-0043	train-other-500	When I came back she was a grown up young woman My friend Anna who had procured for me the place and work beside her which I liked so much was not at all a bookish person but we had perhaps a better time together than if she had been
6594-68896-0044	train-other-500	She was one who found the happiness of her life in doing kindnesses for others and in helping them bear their burdens Family reverses had brought her with her mother and sisters to Lowell and this was one strong point of sympathy between my own family and hers
6594-68896-0045	train-other-500	It was indeed a bond of neighborly union between a great many households in the young manufacturing city
none	none	 Anna s manners and language were those of a lady though she had come from the wilds of Maine somewhere in the vicinity of Mount Desert the very name of which seemed in those days to carry one into a wilderness of mountains and waves We chatted together at our work on all manner of subjects and once she astonished me by saying confidentially in a low tone Do you know I am thirty years old She spoke as if she thought the fact implied something serious My surprise was that she should have taken me into her intimate friendship when I was only seventeen I should hardly have supposed her older than myself if she had not volunteered the information When I lifted my eyes from her tall thin figure to her fair face and somewhat sad blue eyes I saw that she looked a little worn but I knew that it was from care for others strangers as well as her own relatives and it seemed to me as if those thirty loving years were her rose garland I became more attached to her than ever What a foolish dread it is showing unripeness rather than youth the dread of growing old For how can a life be beautified more than by its beautiful years 
6594-68896-0046	train-other-500	A living loving growing spirit can never be old Emerson says Spring still makes spring in the mind When sixty years are told
none	none	 and some of us are thankful to have lived long enough to bear witness with him to that truth 
6594-68896-0047	train-other-500	The few others who measured cloth with us were nice bright girls and some of them remarkably pretty Our work and the room itself were so clean that in summer we could wear fresh muslin dresses sometimes white ones
none	none	 without fear of soiling them This slight difference of apparel and our fewer work hours seemed to give us a slight advantage over the toilers in the mills opposite 
6594-68896-0048	train-other-500	and we occasionally heard ourselves spoken of as the cloth room aristocracy But that was only in fun Most of us had served an apprenticeship in the mills and many of our best friends were still there preferring their work because it brought them more money than we could earn
6594-68896-0049	train-other-500	For myself no amount of money would have been a temptation compared with my precious daytime freedom Whole hours of sunshine for reading for walking for studying for writing for anything that I wanted to do
6594-68896-0050	train-other-500	The days were so lovely and so long and yet how fast they slipped away I had not given up my dream of a better education and as I could not go to school I began to study by myself
6594-68896-0051	train-other-500	I had received a pretty thorough drill in the common English branches at the grammar school and at my employment I only needed a little simple arithmetic A few of my friends were studying algebra in an evening class but I had no fancy for mathematics
6594-68896-0052	train-other-500	My first wish was to learn about English Literature to go back to its very beginnings It was not then studied even in the higher schools and I knew no one who could give me any assistance in it as a teacher Percy s Reliques and
6594-68896-0053	train-other-500	Chambers Cyclopoedia of English Literature were in the city library and I used them making extracts from Chaucer and Spenser to fix their peculiarities in my memory though there was only a taste of them to be had from the Cyclopaedia
none	none	 Shakespeare I had read from childhood 
6594-68896-0054	train-other-500	in a fragmentary way The Tempest and Midsummer Night s Dream and King Lear I had swallowed among my fairy tales Now I discovered that the historical plays notably Julius Caesar and Coriolanus had no less attraction for me though of a different kind
none	none	 But it was easy for me to forget that I was trying to be a literary student and slip off from Belmont to Venice with Portia to witness the discomfiture of Shylock 
6594-68896-0055	train-other-500	although I did pity the miserable Jew
none	none	 and thought he might at least have been allowed the comfort of his paltry ducats I do not think that any of my studying at this time was very severe 
6594-68896-0056	train-other-500	it was pleasure rather than toil
none	none	 for I undertook only the tasks I liked 
6594-68896-0057	train-other-500	But what I learned remained with me nevertheless With Milton I was more familiar than with any other poet and from thirteen years of age to eighteen he was my preference My friend Angeline and I another of my cloth room associates

6594-68896-0062	train-other-500	I copied passages from Jeremy Taylor and the old theologians into my note books and have found them useful even recently in preparing compilations Dryden and the eighteenth century poets generally did not interest me though I tried to read them from a sense of duty
6594-68896-0063	train-other-500	Pope was an exception however Aphorisms from the Essay on Man
none	none	 were in as common use among us as those from the Book of Proverbs 
6594-68896-0064	train-other-500	Some of my choicest extracts were in the first volume of collected poetry I ever owned a little red morocco book called The Young Man s Book of Poetry It was given me by one of my sisters when I was about a dozen years old
none	none	 who rather apologized for the young man on the title page saying that the poetry was just as good as if he were not there 
6594-68896-0065	train-other-500	And indeed no young man could have valued it more than I did It contained selections from standard poets and choice ones from less familiar sources One of the extracts was Wordsworth s Sunset among the Mountains from the Excursion
6594-68896-0066	train-other-500	to read which however often always lifted me into an ecstasy That red morocco book was my treasure It traveled with me to the West and I meant to keep it as long as I lived But alas
none	none	 it was borrowed by a little girl out on the Illinois prairies 
6594-68896-0067	train-other-500	who never brought it back I do not know that I have ever quite forgiven her I have wished I could look into it again often and often through the years But perhaps I ought to be grateful to that little girl for teaching me to be careful about returning borrowed books myself
6594-68896-0068	train-other-500	Only a lover of them can appreciate the loss of one which has been a possession from childhood Young and Cowper were considered religious reading and as such I had always known something of them The songs of Burns were in the air
6594-68896-0069	train-other-500	Through him I best learned to know poetry as song I think that I heard the Cotter s Saturday Night and A man s a man for a that more frequently quoted than any other poems familiar to my girlhood
6594-68896-0070	train-other-500	Some of my work folk acquaintances were regular subscribers to Blackwood s Magazine and the Westminster and Edinburgh reviews and they lent them to me These and Macaulay s Essays were a great help and delight
6594-68896-0071	train-other-500	I had also the reading of the Bibliotheca Sacra and the New Englander and sometimes of the North American Review By the time I had come down to Wordsworth and Coleridge in my readings of English poetry
6594-68896-0072	train-other-500	I was enjoying it all so much that I could not any longer call it study A gift from a friend of Griswold s Poets and Poetry of England gave me my first knowledge of Tennyson It was a great experience to read Locksley Hall
6594-68896-0073	train-other-500	for the first time while it was yet a new poem and while one s own young life was stirred by the prophetic spirit of the age that gave it birth
6594-68896-0074	train-other-500	I had a friend about my own age and between us there was something very much like what is called a school girl friendship a kind of intimacy supposed to be superficial but often as deep and permanent as it is pleasant
none	none	 Eliza and I managed to see each other every day 
6594-68896-0075	train-other-500	we exchanged confidences laughed and cried together read wrote walked visited and studied together Her dress always had an airy touch which I admired although I was rather indifferent as to what I wore myself But she would endeavor to fix me up tastefully
6594-68896-0076	train-other-500	while I would help her to put her compositions for the Offering into proper style She had not begun to go to school at two years old
none	none	 repeating the same routine of study every year of her childhood as I had 
6594-68896-0077	train-other-500	When a child I should have thought it almost as much of a disgrace to spell a word wrong
none	none	 or make a mistake in the multiplication table as to break one of the Ten Commandments I was astonished to find that Eliza and other friends had not been as particularly dealt with in their early education 
6594-68896-0078	train-other-500	But she knew her deficiencies and earned money enough to leave her work and attend a day school part of the year
none	none	 She was an ambitious scholar and she persuaded me into studying the German language with her 
6594-68896-0079	train-other-500	A native professor had formed a class among young women connected with the mills and we joined it
none	none	 We met six or eight of us at the home of two of these young women 
6594-68896-0080	train-other-500	a factory boarding house in a neat little parlor which contained a piano The professor was a music teacher also
none	none	 and he sometimes brought his guitar and let us finish our recitation with a concert More frequently he gave us the songs of Deutschland that we begged for 
6594-68896-0081	train-other-500	He sang the Erl King in his own tongue admirably We went through Follen s German Grammar and Reader what a choice collection of extracts that Reader was We conquered the difficult gutturals like those in the numeral acht und achtzig
6594-68896-0082	train-other-500	the test of our pronouncing abilities so completely that the professor told us a native really would understand us At his request I put some little German songs into English which he published as sheet music with my name
none	none	 To hear my words sung quite gave me the feeling of a successful translator 
6594-68896-0083	train-other-500	The professor had his own distinctive name for each of his pupils Eliza was Naivete from her artless manners and me he called Etheria probably on account of my star gazing and verse writing habits Certainly there was never anything ethereal in my visible presence
none	none	 A botany class was formed in town by a literary lady who was preparing a school text book on the subject 
6594-68896-0084	train-other-500	and Eliza and I joined that also The most I recall about that is the delightful flower hunting rambles we took together
none	none	 The Linnaean system then in use did not give us a very satisfactory key to the science But we made the acquaintance of hitherto unfamiliar wild flowers that grew around us 
6594-68896-0085	train-other-500	and that was the opening to us of another door towards the Beautiful
none	none	 Our minister offered to instruct the young people of his parish in ethics 
6594-68896-0086	train-other-500	and my sister Emilie and myself were among his pupils We came to regard Wayland s Moral Science our text book
none	none	 as most interesting reading and it furnished us with many subjects for thought and for social discussion Carlyle s 
6594-68896-0087	train-other-500	Hero Worship brought us a startling and keen enjoyment It was lent me by a Dartmouth College student the brother of one of my room mates soon after it was first published in this country
none	none	 The young man did not seem to know exactly what to think of it and wanted another reader s opinion Few persons could have welcomed those early writings of Carlyle more enthusiastically than some of us working girls did The very ruggedness of the sentences had a fascination for us like that of climbing over loose bowlders in a mountain scramble to get sight of a wonderful landscape 
6594-68896-0088	train-other-500	My room mate the student s sister was the possessor of an electrifying new poem Festus that we sat up nights to read It does not seem as if it could be more than forty years since Sarah and I looked up into each other s face from the page as the lamplight grew dim and said
6594-68896-0089	train-other-500	quoting from the poem Who can mistake great thoughts She gave me the volume afterwards when we went West together
none	none	 and I have it still Its questions and conjectures were like a glimpse into the chaos of our own dimly developing inner life 
6594-68896-0090	train-other-500	The fascination of Festus was that of wonder doubt and dissent with great outbursts of an overmastering faith sweeping over our minds as we read Some of our friends thought it not quite safe reading but we remember it as one of the inspirations of our workaday youth
6594-68896-0091	train-other-500	We read books also that bore directly upon the condition of humanity in our time The Glory and Shame of England was one of them and it stirred us with a wonderful and painful interest We followed travelers and explorers Layard to Nineveh
6594-68896-0092	train-other-500	and Stephens to Yucatan And we were as fond of good story books as any girls that live in these days of overflowing libraries One book a character picture from history had a wide popularity in those days
6594-68896-0093	train-other-500	It is a pity that it should be unfamiliar to modern girlhood Ware s Zenobia The Queen of Palmyra walked among us and held a lofty place among our ideals of heroic womanhood never yet obliterated from admiring remembrance
6594-68896-0094	train-other-500	We had the delight of reading Frederika Bremer s Home and Neighbors when they were fresh from the fountains of her own heart and some of us must not be blamed for feeling as if no tales of domestic life half so charming have been written since
6594-68896-0095	train-other-500	Perhaps it is partly because the home life of Sweden is in itself so delightfully unique We read George Borrow s Bible in Spain and wandered with him among the gypsies to whom he seemed to belong
none	none	 I have never forgotten a verse that this strange traveler picked up somewhere among the Zincali 
6594-68896-0096	train-other-500	I ll joyfully labor both
none	none	 night and day To aid my unfortunate brothers 
6594-68896-0097	train-other-500	As a laundress tans her own face in the ray To cleanse the garments of others It suggested a somewhat similar verse to my own mind Why should not our washerwoman s work have its touch of poetry also
none	none	 This thought flashed 
6594-68896-0098	train-other-500	by like a ray of light That brightened my homely labor The water is making my own hands white While I wash the robes of my neighbor And how delighted we were with missus Kirkland s A New Home Who ll Follow the first real Western book I ever read
6594-68896-0099	train-other-500	Its genuine pioneer flavor was delicious And moreover it was a prophecy to Sarah Emilie and myself who were one day thankful enough to find an Aunty Parshall s dish kettle in a cabin on an Illinois prairie
6594-68896-0100	train-other-500	So the pleasantly occupied years slipped on I still nursing my purpose of a more systematic course of study though I saw no near possibility of its fulfillment It came in an unexpected way as almost everything worth having does come
6594-68896-0101	train-other-500	I could never have dreamed that I was going to meet my opportunity nearly or quite a thousand miles away on the banks of the Mississippi And yet with that strange delightful consciousness of growth into a comprehension of one s self
6594-68896-0102	train-other-500	and of one s life that most young persons must occasionally have experienced I often vaguely felt heavens opening for my half fledged wings to try themselves in Things about me were good and enjoyable but I could not quite rest in them
none	none	 there was more for me to be to know and to do 
6594-68896-0103	train-other-500	I felt almost surer of the future than of the present
none	none	 If the dream of the millennium which brightened the somewhat sombre close of the first ten years of my life had faded a little 
6594-68896-0104	train-other-500	out of the very roughnesses of the intervening road light had been kindled which made the end of the second ten years glow with enthusiastic hope I had early been saved from a great mistake for it is
6594-68896-0105	train-other-500	the greatest of mistakes to begin life with the expectation that it is going to be easy or with the wish to have it so What a world it would be if there were no hills to climb Our powers were given us that we might conquer obstacles and clear obstructions from the overgrown human path
6594-68896-0106	train-other-500	and grow strong by striving led onward always by an Invisible Guide Life to me as I looked forward was a bright blank of mystery like the broad Western tracts of our continent which in the atlases of those days bore the title of Unexplored Regions
none	none	 It was to be penetrated struggled through and its difficulties were not greatly dreaded for I had not lost The dream of Doing The first bound in the pursuing I knew that there was no joy like the joy of pressing forward XII 
6594-68897-0000	train-other-500	FROM THE MERRIMACK TO THE MISSISSIPPI THE years between eighteen thirty five and eighteen forty five which nearly cover the time I lived at Lowell seem to me as I look back at them singularly interesting years
none	none	 People were guessing and experimenting and wondering and prophesying about a great many things about almost everything 
6594-68897-0001	train-other-500	We were only beginning to get accustomed to steamboats and railroads To travel by either was scarcely less an adventure to us younger ones than going up in a balloon Phrenology was much talked about and numerous professors of it came around lecturing and examining heads
6594-68897-0002	train-other-500	and making charts of cranial bumps This was profitable business to them for a while as almost everybody who invested in a character received a good one while many very commonplace people were flattered into the belief that they were geniuses or might be if they chose
6594-68897-0003	train-other-500	Mesmerism followed close upon phrenology and this too had its lecturers who entertained the stronger portion of their audiences by showing them how easily the weaker ones could be brought under an uncanny influence
6594-68897-0004	train-other-500	The most widespread delusion of the time was Millerism A great many persons and yet not so many that I knew even one of them believed that the end of the world was coming in the year eighteen forty two though the date was postponed from year to year as the prophesy failed of fulfillment
6594-68897-0005	train-other-500	The idea in itself was almost too serious to be jested about and yet its advocates made it so literal a matter that it did look very ridiculous to unbelievers An irreverent little workmate of mine in the spinning room made a string of jingling couplets about it like this
6594-68897-0006	train-other-500	Oh dear oh dear what shall we do In eighteen hundred and forty two Oh dear oh dear where shall we be In eighteen hundred and forty three Oh dear oh dear we shall be no more In eighteen hundred and forty four
6594-68897-0007	train-other-500	Oh dear oh dear we sha n t be alive In eighteen hundred and forty five
none	none	 I thought it audacious in her since surely she and all of us were aware that the world would come to an end some time 
6594-68897-0008	train-other-500	in some way for every one of us I said to myself that I could not have made up those rhymes Nevertheless we all laughed at them together A comet appeared at about the time of the Miller excitement and also a very unusual illumination of sky and earth by the Aurora Borealis
6594-68897-0009	train-other-500	This latter occurred in midwinter The whole heavens were of a deep rose color almost crimson reddest at the zenith and paling as it radiated towards the horizon The snow was fresh on the ground and that too was of a brilliant red
6594-68897-0010	train-other-500	Cold as it was windows were thrown up all around us for people to look out at the wonderful sight I was gazing with the rest and listening to exclamations of wonder from surrounding unseen beholders when somebody shouted from far down the opposite block of buildings with startling effect
6594-68897-0011	train-other-500	You can t stand the fire In that great day It was the refrain of a Millerite hymn The Millerites believed that these signs in the sky were omens of the approaching catastrophe
none	none	 And it was said that some of them did go so far as to put on white ascension robes 
6594-68897-0012	train-other-500	and assemble somewhere to wait for the expected hour When daguerreotypes were first made when we heard that the sun was going to take everybody s portrait it seemed almost too great a marvel to be believed
none	none	 While it was yet only a rumor that such a thing had been done somewhere across the sea I saw some verses about it which impressed me much but which I only partly remember 
6594-68897-0013	train-other-500	These were the opening lines Oh what if thus our evil deeds Are mirrored on the sky And every line of our wild lives Daguerreotyped on high
none	none	 My sister and I considered it quite an event when we went to have our daguerreotypes taken just before we started for the West 
6594-68897-0014	train-other-500	The photograph was still an undeveloped mystery Things that looked miraculous then are commonplace now It almost seems as if the children of to day could not have so good a time as we did science has left them so little to wonder about
6594-68897-0015	train-other-500	Our attitude the attitude of the time was that of children climbing their dooryard fence to watch an approaching show and to conjecture what more remarkable spectacle could be following behind
6594-68897-0016	train-other-500	New England had kept to the quiet old fashioned ways of living for the first fifty years of the Republic Now all was expectancy Changes were coming Things were going to happen nobody could guess what
6594-68897-0017	train-other-500	Things have happened and changes have come The New England that has grown up with the last fifty years is not at all the New England that our fathers knew We speak of having been reared under Puritanic influences
6594-68897-0018	train-other-500	but the traditionary sternness of these was much modified even in the childhood of the generation to which I belong
none	none	 We did not recognize the grim features of the Puritan as we used sometimes to read about him in our parents or relatives And yet we were children of the Puritans Everything that was new or strange came to us at Lowell And most of the remarkable people of the day came also How strange it was to see Mar Yohannan 
6594-68897-0019	train-other-500	a Nestorian bishop walking through the factory yard in his Oriental robes with more than a child s wonder on his face at the stir and rush of everything He came from Boston by railroad and was present at the wedding at the clergyman s house where he visited The rapidity of the simple Congregational service
none	none	 astonished him 
6594-68897-0020	train-other-500	What Marry on railroad too he asked
none	none	 Dickens visited Lowell while I was there and gave a good report of what he saw in his American Notes 
6594-68897-0021	train-other-500	We did not leave work even to gaze at distinguished strangers so I missed seeing him
none	none	 But a friend who did see him sketched his profile in pencil for me as he passed along the street He was then best known as Boz Many of the prominent men of the country were in the habit of giving Lyceum lectures and the Lyceum lecture of that day was a means of education 
6594-68897-0022	train-other-500	conveying to the people the results of study and thought through the best minds At Lowell it was more patronized by the mill people than any mere entertainment We had John Quincy Adams
6594-68897-0023	train-other-500	Edward Everett John Pierpont and Ralph Waldo Emerson among our lecturers with numerous distinguished clergymen of the day Daniel Webster was once in the city trying a law case Some of my girl friends went to the court room and had a glimpse of his face
6594-68897-0024	train-other-500	but I just missed seeing him Sometimes an Englishman who was studying our national institutions would call and have a friendly talk with us at work Sometimes it was a traveler from the South who was interested in some way
6594-68897-0025	train-other-500	I remember one an editor and author from Georgia who visited our Improvement Circle and who sent some of us Offering contributors copies of his book after he had returned home
none	none	 One of the pleasantest visitors that I recall was a young Quaker woman from Philadelphia 
6594-68897-0026	train-other-500	a school teacher who came to see for herself how the Lowell girls lived of whom she had heard so much A deep quiet friendship grew up between us two I wrote some verses for her when we parted and she sent me one cordial charmingly written letter
6594-68897-0027	train-other-500	In a few weeks I answered it but the response was from another person a near relative She was dead
none	none	 But she still remains a real person to me 
6594-68897-0028	train-other-500	I often recall her features and the tone of her voice It was as if a beautiful spirit from an invisible world had slipped in among us and quickly gone back again
6594-68897-0029	train-other-500	It was an event to me and to my immediate friends among the mill girls when the poet Whittier came to Lowell to stay awhile
none	none	 I had not supposed that it would be my good fortune to meet him 
6594-68897-0030	train-other-500	but one evening when we assembled at the Improvement Circle he was there The Offering editor Miss Harriet Farley had lived in the same town with him and they were old acquaintances It was a warm summer evening
6594-68897-0031	train-other-500	I recall the circumstance that a number of us wore white dresses also that I shrank back into myself and felt much abashed when some verses of mine were read by the editor with others so much better however that mine received little attention
6594-68897-0032	train-other-500	I felt relieved for I was not fond of having my productions spoken of for good or ill He commended quite highly a poem by another member of the Circle on Pentucket the Indian name of his native place Haverhill My subject was Sabbath Bells
6594-68897-0033	train-other-500	As the Friends do not believe in steeple houses I was at liberty to imagine that it was my theme and not my verses that failed to interest him Various other papers were read stories sketches et cetera and after the reading there was a little conversation
6594-68897-0034	train-other-500	when he came and spoke to me I let the friend who had accompanied me do my part of the talking for I was too much overawed by the presence of one whose poetry I had so long admired to say a great deal But from that evening we knew each other as friends and of course
6594-68897-0035	train-other-500	the day has a white mark among memories of my Lowell life mister Whittier s visit to Lowell had some political bearing upon the antislavery cause
none	none	 It is strange now to think that a cause like that should not always have been our country s cause 
6594-68897-0036	train-other-500	our country our own free nation But antislavery sentiments were then regarded by many as traitorous heresies and those who held them did not expect to win popularity If the vote of the mill girls had been taken it would doubtless have been unanimous on the antislavery side
6594-68897-0037	train-other-500	But those were also the days when a woman was not expected to give or even to have an opinion on subjects of public interest Occasionally a young girl was attracted to the Lowell mills through her own idealization of the life there
6594-68897-0038	train-other-500	as it had been reported to her Margaret Foley who afterwards became distinguished as a sculptor was one of these She did not remain many months at her occupation which I think was weaving soon changing it for that of teaching and studying art
6594-68897-0039	train-other-500	Those who came as she did were usually disappointed Instead of an Arcadia they found a place of matter of fact toil filled with a company of industrious wide awake girls who were faithfully improving their opportunities
6594-68897-0040	train-other-500	while looking through them into avenues Toward profit and usefulness more desirable yet It has always been the way of the steady minded New Englander to accept the present situation but to accept it without boundaries taking in also the larger prospects
6594-68897-0041	train-other-500	all the heavens above and the earth beneath towards which it opens The movement of New England girls toward Lowell was only an impulse of a larger movement which about that time sent so many people from the Eastern States into the West
none	none	 The needs of the West were constantly kept before us in the churches We were asked for contributions for Home Missions which were willingly given and some of us were appointed collectors of funds for the education of indigent young men to become Western Home Missionary preachers 
6594-68897-0042	train-other-500	There was something almost pathetic in the readiness with which this was done by young girls who were longing to fit themselves for teachers but had not the means Many a girl at Lowell was working to send her brother to college who had far more talent and character than he
6594-68897-0043	train-other-500	but a man could preach and it was not orthodox to think that a woman could And in her devotion to him and her zeal for the spread of Christian truth she was hardly conscious of her own sacrifice
6594-68897-0044	train-other-500	Yet our ministers appreciated the intelligence and piety of their feminine parishioners An agent who came from the West for school teachers was told by our own pastor that five hundred could easily be furnished from among Lowell mill girls
none	none	 Many did go and they made another New England in some of our Western States The missionary spirit was strong among my companions I never thought that I had the right qualifications for that work but I had a desire to see the prairies and the great rivers of the West and to get a taste of free primitive life among pioneers Before the year eighteen forty five several of my friends had emigrated as teachers or missionaries One of the editors of the Operatives Magazine had gone to Arkansas with a mill girl who had worked beside her among the looms They were at an Indian mission to the Cherokees and Choctaws I seemed to breathe the air of that far Southwest in a spray of yellow jessamine which one of those friends sent me pressed in a letter People wrote very long letters then in those days of twenty five cent postage Rachel at whose house our German class had been accustomed to meet had also left her work and had gone to western Virginia to take charge of a school She wrote alluring letters to us about the scenery there it was in the neighborhood of the Natural Bridge My friend Angeline with whom I used to read Paradise Lost went to Ohio as a teacher and returned the following year for a very brief visit however and with a husband Another acquaintance was in Wisconsin teaching a pioneer school Eliza my intimate companion was about to be married to a clergyman She too eventually settled at the West The event which brought most change into my own life was the marriage of my sister Emilie It involved the breaking up of our own little family of which she had really been the houseband the return of my mother to my sisters at Beverly and my going to board among strangers as other girls did I found excellent quarters and kind friends but the home life was ended My sister s husband was a grammar school master in the city and their cottage a mile or more out among the open fields was my frequent refuge from homesickness and the general clatter Our partial separation showed me how much I had depended upon my sister I had really let her do most of my thinking for me Henceforth I was to trust to my own resources I was no longer the little sister who could ask what to do and do as she was told It often brought me a feeling of dismay to find that I must make up my own mind about things small and great And yet I was naturally self reliant I am not sure but self reliance and dependence really belong together They do seem to meet in the same character like other extremes The health of Emilie s husband failing after a year or two it was evident that he must change his employment and his residence He decided to go with his brother to Illinois and settle upon a prairie farm Of course his wife and baby boy must go too and with the announcement of this decision came an invitation to me to accompany them I had no difficulty as to my response It was just what I wanted to do I was to teach a district school but what there was beyond that I could not guess I liked to feel that it was all as vague as the unexplored regions to which I was going My friend and room mate Sarah who was preparing herself to be a teacher was invited to join us and she was glad to do so It was all quickly settled and early in the spring of eighteen forty six we left New England When I came to a realization of what I was leaving when good bys had to be said I began to feel very sorrowful and to wish it was not to be I said positively that I should soon return but underneath my protestations I was afraid that I might not The West was very far off then a full week s journey It would be hard getting back Those I loved might die I might die myself These thoughts passed through my mind though not through my lips My eyes would sometimes tell the story however and I fancy that my tearful farewells must have seemed ridiculous to many of my friends since my going was of my own cheerful choice The last meeting of the Improvement Circle before I went away was a kind of surprise party to me Several original poems were read addressed to me personally I am afraid that I received it all in a dumb undemonstrative way for I could not make it seem real that I was the person meant or that I was going away at all But I treasured those tributes of sympathy afterwards under the strange spacious skies where I sometimes felt so alone The editors of the Offering left with me a testimonial in money accompanied by an acknowledgment of my contributions during several years but I had never dreamed of pay and did not know how to look upon it so I took it gratefully however as a token of their appreciation and twenty dollars was no small help toward my outfit Friends brought me books and other keepsakes Our minister gave me D Aubigne s History of the Reformation as a parting gift It was quite a circumstance to be going out West The exhilaration of starting off on one s first long journey young ignorant buoyant expectant is unlike anything else unless it be youth itself the real beginning of the real journey life Annoyances are overlooked Everything seems romantic and dreamlike We went by a southerly route on account of starting so early in the season there was snow on the ground the day we left On the second day after a moonlight night on Long Island Sound we were floating down the Delaware between shores misty green with budding willows then most of us seasick though I was not we were tossed across Chesapeake Bay then there was a railway ride to the Alleghanies which gave us glimpses of the Potomac and the Blue Ridge and of the lovely scenery around Harper s Ferry then followed a stifling night on the mountains when we were packed like sardines into a stagecoach without a breath of air and the passengers were cross because the baby cried while I felt inwardly glad that one voice among us could give utterance to the general discomfort my own part of which I could have borne if I could only have had an occasional peep out at the mountain side After that it was all river voyaging down the Monongahela into the Ohio and up the Mississippi As I recall this part of it I should say that it was the perfection of a Western journey to travel in early spring by an Ohio River steamboat such steamboats as they had forty years ago comfortable roomy and well ordered The company was social as Western emigrants were wont to be when there were not so very many of them and the shores of the river then only thinly populated were a constantly shifting panorama of wilderness beauty I have never since seen a combination of spring colors so delicate as those shown by the uplifted forests of the Ohio where the pure white of the dogwood and the peach bloom tint of the red bud Judas tree were contrasted with soft shades of green almost endlessly various on the unfolding leafage Contrasted with the Ohio the Mississippi had nothing to show but breadth and muddiness More than one of us glanced at its level shores edged with a monotonous growth of cottonwood and sent back a sigh towards the banks of the Merrimack But we did not let each other know what the sigh was for until long after The breaking up of our little company when the steamboat landed at Saint Louis was like the ending of a pleasant dream We had to wake up to the fact that by striking due east thirty or forty miles across that monotonous Greenness we should reach our destination and must accept whatever we should find there with such grace as we could What we did find and did not find there is not room fully to relate here Ours was at first the roughest kind of pioneering experience such as persons brought up in our well to do New England could not be in the least prepared for though they might imagine they were as we did We were dropped down finally upon a vast green expense extending hundreds of miles north and south through the State of Illinois then known as Looking Glass Prairie The nearest cabin to our own was about a mile away and so small that at that distance it looked like a shingle set up endwise in the grass Nothing else was in sight not even a tree although we could see miles and miles in every direction There were only the hollow blue heavens above us and the level green prairie around us an immensity of intense loneliness We seldom saw a cloud in the sky and never a pebble beneath our feet If we could have picked up the commonest one we should have treasured it like a diamond Nothing in nature now seemed so beautiful to us as rocks We had never dreamed of a world without them it seemed like living on a floor without walls or foundations After a while we became accustomed to the vast sameness and even liked it in a lukewarm way And there were times when it filled us with emotions of grandeur Boundlessness in itself is impressive it makes us feel our littleness and yet releases us from that littleness The grass was always astir blowing one way like the waves of the sea for there was a steady almost an unvarying wind from the south It was like the sea and yet even more wonderful for it was a sea of living and growing things The Spirit of God was moving upon the face of the earth and breathing everything into life We were but specks on the great landscape But God was above it all penetrating it and us with his infinite warmth The distance from human beings made the Invisible One seem so near Only Nature and ourselves now face to face with Him We could scarcely have found in all the world a more complete contrast to the moving crowds and the whir and dust of the City of Spindles than this unpeopled silent prairie For myself I know that I was sent in upon my own thoughts deeper than I had ever been before I began to question things which I had never before doubted I must have reality Nothing but transparent truth would bear the test of this great solitary stillness As the prairies lay open to the sunshine my heart seemed to lie bare beneath the piercing eye of the All Seeing I may say with gratitude that only some superficial rubbish of acquired opinion was scorched away by this searching light and heat The faith of my childhood in its simplest elements took firmer root as it found broader room to grow in I had many peculiar experiences in my log cabin school teaching which was seldom more than three months in one place Only once I found myself among New England people and there I remained a year or more fairly reveling in a return to the familiar thrifty ways that seem to me to shape a more comfortable style of living than any under the sun Vine Lodge so we named the cottage for its embowering honey suckles and its warm hearted inmates with my little white schoolhouse under the oaks make one of the brightest of my Western memories Only a mile or two away from this pretty retreat there was an edifice towards which I often looked with longing It was a seminary for young women probably at that time one of the best in the country certainly second to none in the West It had originated about a dozen years before in a plan for Western collegiate education organized by Yale College graduates It was thought that women as well as men ought to share in the benefits of such a plan and the result was Monticello Seminary The good man whose wealth had made the institution a possibility lived in the neighborhood Its trustees were of the best type of pioneer manhood and its pupils came from all parts of the South and West Its Principal I wonder now that I could have lived so near her for a year without becoming acquainted with her but her high local reputation as an intellectual woman inspired me with awe and I was foolishly diffident One day however upon the persuasion of my friends at Vine Lodge who knew my wishes for a higher education I went with them to call upon her We talked about the matter which had been in my thoughts so long and she gave me not only a cordial but an urgent invitation to come and enroll myself as a student There were arrangements for those who could not incur the current expenses to meet them by doing part of the domestic work and of these I gladly availed myself The stately limestone edifice standing in the midst of an original growth of forest trees two or three miles from the Mississippi River became my home my student home for three years The benefits of those three years I have been reaping ever since I trust not altogether selfishly It was always my desire and my ambition as a teacher to help my pupils as my teachers had helped me The course of study at Monticello Seminary was the broadest the most college like that I have ever known and I have had experience since in several institutions of the kind The study of mediaeval and modern history and of the history of modern philosophy especially opened new vistas to me In these our Principal was also our teacher and her method was to show us the tendencies of thought to put our minds into the great current of human affairs leaving us to collect details as we could then or afterward We came thus to feel that these were life long studies as indeed they are The course was somewhat elective but her advice to me was not to omit anything because I did not like it I had a natural distaste for mathematics and my recollections of my struggles with trigonometry and conic sections are not altogether those of a conquering heroine But my teacher told me that my mind had need of just that exact sort of discipline and I think she was right A habit of indiscriminate unsystematized reading such as I had fallen into is entirely foreign to the scholarly habit of mind Attention is the secret of real acquirement but it was months before I could command my own attention even when I was interested in the subject I was examining It seemed as if all the pages of all the books I had ever read were turning themselves over between me and this one page that I wanted to understand I found that mere reading does not by any means make a student It was more to me to come into communication with my wise teacher as a friend than even to receive the wisdom she had to impart She was dignified and reticent but beneath her reserve as is often the case was a sealed fountain of sympathy which one who had the key could easily unlock Thinking of her nobleness of character her piety her learning her power and her sweetness it seems to me as if I had once had a Christian Zenobia or Hypatia for my teacher We speak with awed tenderness of our unseen guardian angels but have we not all had our guiding angels who came to us in visible form and recognized or unknown kept beside us on our difficult path until they had done for us all they could It seems to me as if one had succeeded another by my side all through the years always some one whose influence made my heart stronger and my way clearer though sometimes it has been only a little child that came and laid its hand into my hand as if I were its guide instead of its being mine My dear and honored Lady Principal was surely one of my strong guiding angels sent to meet me as I went to meet her upon my life road just at the point where I most needed her For the one great thing she gave her pupils scope often quite left out of woman s education I especially thank her The true education is to go on forever But how can there be any hopeful going on without outlook And having an infinite outlook how can progress ever cease It was worth while for me to go to those Western prairies if only for the broader mental view that opened upon me in my pupilage there During my first year at the seminary I was appointed teacher of the Preparatory Department a separate school of thirty or forty girls with the opportunity to go on with my studies at the same time It was a little hard but I was very glad to do it as I was unwilling to receive an education without rendering an equivalent and I did not wish to incur a debt I believe that the postponement of these maturer studies to my early womanhood after I had worked and taught was a benefit to me I had found out some of my special ignorances what the things were which I most needed to know I had learned that the book knowledge I so much craved was not itself education was not even culture but only a help an adjunct to both As I studied more earnestly I cared for fewer books but those few made themselves indispensable It still seems to me that in the Lowell mills and in my log cabin schoolhouse on the Western prairies I received the best part of my early education The great advantage of a seminary course to me was that under my broad minded Principal I learned what education really is the penetrating deeper and rising higher into life as well as making continually wider explorations the rounding of the whole human being out of its nebulous elements into form as planets and suns are rounded until they give out safe and steady light This makes the process an infinite one not possible to be completed at any school Returning from the West immediately after my graduation I was for ten years or so a teacher of young girls in seminaries much like my own Alma Mater The best result to me of that experience has been the friendship of my pupils a happiness which must last as long as life itself A book must end somewhere and the natural boundary of this narrative is drawn with my leaving New England for the West I was to outline the story of my youth for the young though I think many a one among them might tell a story far more interesting than mine The most beautiful lives seldom find their way into print Perhaps the most beautiful part of any life never does I should like to flatter myself so I could not stay at the West It was never really home to me there and my sojourn of six or seven years on the prairies only deepened my love and longing for the dear old State of Massachusetts I came back in the summer of eighteen fifty two and the unwritten remainder of my sketch is chiefly that of a teacher s and writer s experience regarding which latter I will add for the gratification of those who have desired them a few personal particulars While a student and teacher at the West I was still writing and much that I wrote was published A poem printed in Sartain s Magazine sent there at the suggestion of the editor of the Lowell Offering was the first for which I received remuneration five dollars Several poems written for the manuscript school journal at Monticello Seminary are in the Household collection of my verses among them those entitled Eureka Hand in Hand with Angels and Psyche at School These and various others written soon after were printed in the National Era in return for which a copy of the paper was sent me Nothing further was asked or expected The little song Hannah Binding Shoes written immediately after my return from the West was a study from life though not from any one life in my native town It was brought into notice in a peculiar way by my being accused of stealing it by the editor of the magazine to which I had sent it with a request for the usual remuneration if accepted Accidentally or otherwise this editor lost my note and signature and then denounced me by name in a newspaper as a literary thiefess having printed the verses with a nom de plume in his magazine without my knowledge It was awkward to have to come to my own defense But the curious incident gave the song a wide circulation I did not attempt writing for money until it became a necessity when my health failed at teaching although I should long before then have liked to spend my whole time with my pen could I have done so But it was imperative that I should have an assured income however small and every one who has tried it knows how uncertain a support one s pen is unless it has become very famous indeed My life as a teacher however I regard as part of my best preparation for whatever I have since written I do not know but I should recommend five or ten years of teaching as the most profitable apprenticeship for a young person who wished to become an author To be a good teacher implies self discipline and a book written without something of that sort of personal preparation cannot be a very valuable one Success in writing may mean many different things I do not know that I have ever reached it except in the sense of liking better and better to write and of finding expression easier It is something to have won the privilege of going on Sympathy and recognition are worth a great deal the power to touch human beings inwardly and nobly is worth far more The hope of attaining to such results if only occasionally must be a writer s best inspiration So far as successful publication goes perhaps the first I considered so came when a poem of mine was accepted by the Atlantic Monthly Its title was The Rose Enthroned and as the poet Lowell was at that time editing the magazine I felt especially gratified That and another poem The Loyal Woman s No written early in the War of the Rebellion were each attributed to a different person among our prominent poets the Atlantic at that time not giving authors signatures Of course I knew the unlikeness nevertheless those who made the mistake paid me an unintentional compliment Compliments however are very cheap and by no means signify success I have always regarded it as a better ambition to be a true woman than to become a successful writer To be the second would never have seemed to me desirable without also being the first In concluding let me say to you dear girls for whom these pages have been written that if I have learned anything by living it is this that the meaning of life is education not through book knowledge alone sometimes entirely without it Education is growth the development of our best possibilities from within outward and it cannot be carried on as it should be except in a school just such a school as we all find ourselves in this world of human beings by whom we are surrounded The beauty of belonging to this school is that we cannot learn anything in it by ourselves alone but for and with our fellow pupils the wide earth over We can never expect promotion here except by taking our place among the lowest and sharing their difficulties until they are removed and we all become graduates together for a higher school Humility Sympathy Helpfulness and Faith are the best teachers in this great university and none of us are well educated who do not accept their training The real satisfaction of living is and must forever be the education of all for each and of each for all So let us all try together to be good and faithful women and not care too much for what the world may think of us or of our abilities My little story is not a remarkable one for I have never attempted remarkable things In the words of one of our honored elder writers given in reply to a youthful aspirant who had asked for some points
