none	none	a young man of his own age about twenty six a leading figure in the newspaper world whose rise from reporter to managing editor of the morning NEWS ARGUS within the short space of a few years had been almost meteoric They were at coffee and cigars and Jimmie Dale was leaning back in his chair his dark eyes fixed interestedly on his guest Carruthers intently engaged in trimming his cigar ash on the edge of the Limoges china saucer of his coffee set looked up with an abrupt laugh No I wouldn t care to go on record as being an advocate of crime he said whimsically that would never do But I don t mind admitting quite privately that it s been a positive regret to me that he has gone Made too good copy to lose I suppose suggested Jimmie Dale quizzically Too bad too after working up a theatrical name like that for him the Gray Seal rather unique Who stuck that on him you Carruthers laughed then grown serious leaned toward Jimmie Dale You don t mean to say Jimmie that you don t know about that do you he asked incredulously Why up to a year ago the papers were full of him I never read your beastly agony columns said Jimmie Dale with a cheery grin Well said Carruthers you must have skipped everything but the stock reports then Granted said Jimmie Dale So go on Carruthers and tell me about him I dare say I may have heard of him since you are so distressed about it but my memory isn t good enough to contradict anything you may have to say about the estimable gentleman so you re safe Carruthers reverted to the Limoges saucer and the tip of his cigar He was the most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals of crime said Carruthers reminiscently after a moment s silence Jimmie he was the king pin of them all Clever isn t the word for him or dare devil isn t either I used to think sometimes his motive was more than half for the pure deviltry of it to laugh at the police and pull the noses of the rest of us that were after him I used to dream nights about those confounded gray seals of his that s where he got his name he left every job he ever did with a little gray paper affair fashioned diamond shaped stuck somewhere where it would be the first thing your eyes would light upon when you reached the scene and Don t go so fast smiled Jimmie Dale I don t quite get the connection What did you have to do with this er Gray Seal fellow Where do you

none	none	I I had a good deal to do with him said Carruthers grimly I was a reporter when he first broke loose and the ambition of my life after I began really to appreciate what he was was to get him and I nearly did half a dozen times only Only you never quite did eh cut in Jimmie Dale slyly How near did you get old man Come on now no bluffing did the Gray Seal ever even recognise you as a factor in the hare and hound game You re flicking on the raw Jimmie Carruthers answered with a wry grimace He knew me all right confound him He favoured me with several sarcastic notes I ll show em to you some day explaining how I d fallen down and how I could have got him if I d done something else Carruthers fist came suddenly down on the table And I would have got him too if he had lived Lived ejaculated Jimmie Dale He s dead then Yes averted Carruthers he s dead H m said Jimmie Dale facetiously I hope the size of the wreath you sent was an adequate tribute of your appreciation I never sent any wreath returned Carruthers for the very simple reason that I didn t know where to send it or when he died I said he was dead because for over a year now he hasn t lifted a finger Rotten poor evidence even for a newspaper commented Jimmie Dale Why not give him credit for having say reformed Carruthers shook his head You don t get it at all Jimmie he said earnestly The Gray Seal wasn t an ordinary crook he was a classic He was an artist and the art of the thing was in his blood A man like that could no more stop than he could stop breathing and live He s dead there s nothing to it but that he s dead I d bet a year s salary on it Another good man gone wrong then said Jimmie Dale capriciously I suppose though that at least you discovered the woman in the case Carruthers looked up quickly a little startled then laughed shortly What s the matter inquired Jimmie Dale Nothing said Carruthers You kind of got me for a moment that s all That s the way those infernal notes from the Gray Seal used to end up Find the lady old chap and you ll get me He had a damned patronising familiarity that would make you squirm Poor old Carruthers grinned Jimmie Dale You did take it to heart didn t you I d have sold my soul to get him and so would you if you had been in my boots said Carruthers biting nervously at the end of his cigar And been sorry for it afterward supplied Jimmie Dale Yes by Jove you re right admitted Carruthers I suppose I should I actually got to love the fellow it was the GAME really that I wanted to beat Well and how about this woman Keep on the straight and narrow path old man prodded Jimmie Dale The woman Carruthers smiled Nothing doing I don t believe there was one he wouldn t have been likely to egg the police and reporters on to finding her if there had been would he It was a blind of course He worked alone absolutely alone That s the secret of his success according to my way of thinking There was never so much as an indication that he had had an accomplice in anything he ever did Jimmie Dale s eyes travelled around the club s homelike perfectly appointed room He nodded to a fellow member here and there then his eyes rested musingly on his guest again Carruthers was staring thoughtfully at his coffee cup He was the prince of crooks and the father of originality announced Carruthers abruptly following the pause that had ensued Half the time there wasn t any more getting at the motive for the curious things he did than there was getting at the Gray Seal himself Carruthers said Jimmy Dale with a quick little nod of approval you re positively interesting to night But so far you ve been kind of scouting around the outside edges without getting into the thick of it Let s have some of your experiences with the Gray Seal in detail they ought to make ripping fine yarns Not to night Jimmie said Carruthers it would take too long He pulled out his watch mechanically as he spoke glanced at it and pushed back his chair Great Scott he exclaimed It s nearly half past nine I d no idea we had lingered so long over dinner I ll have to hurry we re a morning paper you know Jimmie What Really Is it as late as that Jimmie Dale rose from his chair as Carruthers stood up Well if you must I must said Carruthers with a laugh All right O slave Jimmie Dale laughed back and slipped his hand a trick of their old college days together through Carruthers arm as they left the room He accompanied Carruthers downstairs to the door of the club and saw his guest into a taxi then he returned inside sauntered through the billiard room and from there into one of the cardrooms where pressed into a game he played several rubbers of bridge before going home It was therefore well on toward midnight when Jimmie Dale arrived at his house on Riverside Drive and was admitted by an elderly manservant Hello Jason said Jimmie Dale pleasantly You still up Yes sir replied Jason who had been valet to Jimmie Dale s father before him I was going to bed sir at about ten o clock when a messenger came with a letter Begging your pardon sir a young lady and Jason Jimmie Dale flung out the interruption sudden quick imperative what did she look like Why why I don t exactly know as I could describe her sir stammered Jason taken aback Very ladylike sir in her dress and appearance and what I would call sir a beautiful face Hair and eyes what color demanded Jimmie Dale crisply Nose lips chin what shape Why sir gasped Jason staring at his master I I don t rightly know I wouldn t call her fair or dark something between I didn t take particular notice and it wasn t overlight outside the door It s too bad you weren t a younger man Jason commented Jimmie Dale with a curious tinge of bitterness in his voice I d have given a year s income for your opportunity to night Jason Yes sir said Jason helplessly Well go on prompted Jimmie Dale You told her I wasn t home and she said she knew it didn t she And she left 
2416_152137_000020_000001	train-clean-100	the letter 
none	none	that I was on no account to miss receiving when I got back though there was no need of telephoning me to the club when I returned would do but it was imperative that I should have it then eh Good Lord sir ejaculated Jason his jaw dropped that s exactly what she did say Jason said Jimmie Dale grimly listen to me If ever she comes here again inveigle her in If you can t inveigle her use force capture her pull her in do anything do anything do you hear Only don t let her get away from you until I ve come Jason gazed at his master as though the other had lost his reason Use force sir he repeated weakly and shook his head You you can t mean that sir Can t I inquired Jimmie Dale with a mirthless smile I mean every word of it Jason and if I thought there was the slightest chance of her giving you the opportunity I d be more imperative still As it is where s the letter On the table in your studio sir said Jason mechanically Jimmie Dale started toward the stairs then turned and came back to where Jason still shaking his head heavily had been gazing anxiously after his master Jimmie Dale laid his hand on the old man s shoulder Jason he said kindly with a swift change of mood you ve been a long time in the family first with father and now with me You d do a good deal for me wouldn t you I d do anything in the world for you Master Jim said the old man earnestly Well then remember this said Jimmie Dale slowly looking into the other s eyes remember this keep your mouth shut and your eyes open It s my fault I should have warned you long ago but I never dreamed that she would ever come here herself There have been times when it was practically a matter of life and death to me to know who that woman is that you saw to night That s all Jason Now go to bed Master Jim said the old man simply 
2416_152139_000023_000002	train-clean-100	thank you 
none	none	sir thank you for trusting me I ve dandled you on my knee when you were a baby Master Jim I don t know what it s about and it isn t for me to ask I thought sir that maybe you were having a little fun with me But I know now and you can trust me Master Jim if she ever comes again Thank you Jason said Jimmie Dale his hand closing with an appreciative pressure on the other s shoulder Good night Jason Upstairs on the first landing Jimmie Dale opened a door closed and locked it behind him and the electric switch clicked under his fingers A glow fell softly from a cluster of shaded ceiling lights It was a large room a very large room running the entire depth of the house and the effect of apparent disorder in the arrangement of its appointments seemed to breathe a sense of charm There were great cozy deep leather covered lounging chairs a huge leather covered davenport and an easel or two with half finished sketches upon them the walls were panelled the panels of exquisite grain and matching in the centre of the room stood a flat topped rosewood desk upon the floor was a dark heavy velvet rug and perhaps most inviting of all there was a great old fashioned fireplace at one side of the room For an instant Jimmie Dale remained quietly by the door as though listening Six feet he stood muscular in every line of his body like a well trained athlete with no single ounce of superfluous fat about him the grace and ease of power in his poise His strong clean shaven face as the light fell upon it now was serious a mood that became him well the firm lips closed the dark reliant eyes a little narrowed a frown on the broad forehead the square jaw clamped Then abruptly he walked across the room to the desk picked up an envelope that lay upon it and turning again dropped into the nearest lounging chair There had been no doubt in his mind none to dispel It was precisely what he had expected from almost the first word Jason had spoken It was the same handwriting the same texture of paper and there was the same old haunting rare indefinable fragrance about it Jimmie Dale s hands turned the envelope now this way now that as he looked at it Wonderful hands were Jimmie Dale s with long slim tapering fingers whose sensitive tips seemed now as though they were striving to decipher the message within He laughed suddenly a little harshly and tore open the envelope Five closely written sheets fell into his hand He read them slowly critically read them over again and then his eyes on the rug at his feet he began to tear the paper into minute pieces between his fingers depositing the pieces as he tore them upon the arm of his chair The five sheets demolished his fingers dipped into the heap of shreds on the arm of the chair and tore them over and over again tore them until they were scarcely larger than bits of confetti tore at them absently and mechanically his eyes never shifting from the rug at his feet Then with a shrug of his shoulders as though rousing himself to present reality a curious smile flickering on his lips he brushed the pieces of paper into one hand carried them to the empty fireplace laid them down in a little pile and set them afire Lighting a cigarette he watched them burn until the last glow had gone from the last charred scrap then he crunched and scattered them with the brass handled fender brush and retracing his steps across the room flung back a portiere from where it hung before a little alcove and dropped on his knees in front of a round squat barrel shaped safe one of his own design and planning in the years when he had been with his father His slim sensitive fingers played for an instant among the knobs and dials that studded the door guided it seemed by the sense of touch alone and the door swung open Within was another door with locks and bolts as intricate and massive as the outer one This too he opened and then from the interior took out a short thick rolled up leather bundle tied together with thongs He rose from his knees closed the safe and drew the portiere across the alcove again With the bundle under his arm he glanced sharply around the room listened intently then unlocking the door that gave on the hall he switched off the lights and went to his dressing room that was on the same floor Here divesting himself quickly of his dinner clothes he selected a dark tweed suit with loose fitting sack coat from his wardrobe and began to put it on Dressed all but his coat and vest he turned to the leather bundle that he had placed on a table untied the thongs and carefully opened it out to its full length and again that curious cryptic smile tinged his lips Rolled the opposite away from that in which it had been tied up the leather strip made a wide belt that went on somewhat after the fashion of a life preserver the thongs being used for shoulder straps a belt that once on the vest would hide completely and fitting close left no telltale bulge in the outer garments It was not an ordinary belt it was full of stout sewn up right little pockets all the way around and in the pockets grimly lay an array of fine blued steel highly tempered instruments a compact powerful burglar s kit The slim sensitive fingers passed with almost a caressing touch over the vicious little implements and from one of the pockets extracted a thin flat metal case This Jimmie Dale opened and glanced inside between sheets of oil paper lay little rows of GRAY ADHESIVE DIAMOND SHAPED SEALS Jimmie Dale snapped the case shut returned it to its recess and from another took out a black silk mask He held it up to the light for examination Pretty good shape after a year muttered Jimmie Dale replacing it He put on the belt then his vest and coat From the drawer of his dresser he took an automatic revolver and an electric flashlight slipped them into his pocket and went softly downstairs From the hat stand he chose a black slouch hat pulled it well over his eyes and left the house Jimmie Dale walked down a block then hailed a bus and mounted to the top It was late and he found himself the only passenger He inserted his dime in the conductor s little resonant belled cash receiver and then settled back on the uncomfortable bumping cushionless seat On rattled the bus it turned across town passed the Circle and headed for Fifth Avenue but Jimmie Dale to all appearances was quite oblivious of its movements It was a year since she had written him SHE Jimmie Dale did not smile his lips were pressed hard together Not a very intimate or personal appellation that but he knew her by no other It WAS a woman surely the hand writing was feminine the diction eminently so and had SHE not come herself that night to Jason He remembered the last letter apart from the one to night that he had received from her It was a year ago now and the letter had been hardly more than a note The police had worked themselves into a frenzy over the Gray Seal the papers had grown absolutely maudlin and she had written in her characteristic way Things are a little too warm aren t they Jimmie Let s let them cool for a year Since then until to night he had heard nothing from her It was a strange compact that he had entered into so strange that it could never have known could never know a parallel unique dangerous bizarre it was all that and more It had begun really through his connection with his father s business the business of manufacturing safes that should defy the cleverest criminals when his brains turned into that channel had been pitted against the underworld against the methods of a thousand different crooks from Maine to California the report of whose every operation had reached him in the natural course of business and every one of which he had studied in minutest detail It had begun through that but at the bottom of it was his own restless adventurous spirit He had meant to set the police by the ears using his gray seal device both as an added barb and that no innocent bystander of the underworld innocent for once might be involved he had meant to laugh at them and puzzle them to the verge of madness for in the last analysis they would find only an abortive attempt at crime and he had succeeded And then he had gone too far and he had been caught by HER That string of pearls which to study whose effect facetiously he had so idiotically wrapped around his wrist and which so ironically he had been unable to loosen in time and had been forced to carry with him in his sudden desperate dash to escape from Marx s the big jeweler s in Maiden Lane whose strong room he had toyed with one night had been the lever which AT FIRST she had held over him The bus was on Fifth Avenue now and speeding rapidly down the deserted thoroughfare Jimmie Dale looked up at the lighted windows of the saint James Club as they went by smiled whimsically and shifted in his seat seeking a more comfortable position She had caught him how he did not know he had never seen her did not know who she was though time and again he had devoted all his energies for months at a stretch to a solution of the mystery The morning following the Maiden Lane affair indeed before he had breakfasted Jason had brought him the first letter from her It had started by detailing his every move of the night before and it had ended with an ultimatum The cleverness the originality of the Gray Seal as a crook lacked but one thing she had naively written and that one thing was that his crookedness required a leading string to guide it into channels that were worthy of his genius In a word SHE would plan the coups and he would act at her dictation and execute them or else how did twenty years in Sing Sing for that little Maiden Lane affair appeal to him He was to answer by the next morning a simple yes or no in the personal column of the morning NEWS ARGUS A threat to a man like Jimmie Dale was like flaunting a red rag at a bull and a rage ungovernable had surged upon him Then cold reason had come He was caught there was no question about that she had taken pains to show him that he need make no mistake there Innocent enough in his own conscience as far as actual theft went for the pearls would in due course be restored in some way to the possession of their owner he would have been unable to make even his own father who was alive then believe in his innocence let alone a jury of his peers Dishonour shame ignominy a long prison sentence stared him in the face and there was but one alternative to link hands with this unseen mysterious accomplice Well he could at least temporise he could always queer a game in some specious manner if he were pushed too far And so in the next morning s NEWS ARGUS Jimmie Dale had answered yes And then had followed those years in which there had been NO temporising in which every plan was carried out to the last detail those years of curious unaccountable bewildering affairs that Carruthers had spoken of one on top of another that had shaken the old headquarters on Mulberry Street to its foundations until the Gray Seal had become a name to conjure with And yes it was quite true he had entered into it all gone the limit with an eagerness that was insatiable The bus had reached the lower end of Fifth Avenue passed through Washington Square and stopped at the end of its run Jimmie Dale clambered down from the top threw a pleasant good night to the conductor and headed briskly down the street before him A little later he crossed into West Broadway and his pace slowed to a leisurely stroll Here at the upper end of the street was a conglomerate business section of rather inferior class catering doubtless to the poor foreign element that congregated west of Broadway proper and to the south of Washington Square The street was at first glance deserted it was dark and dreary with stores and lofts on either side An elevated train roared by overhead with a thunderous deafening clamour Jimmie Dale on the right hand side of the street glanced interestedly at the dark store windows as he went by And then a block ahead on the other side his eyes rested on an approaching form As the other reached the corner and paused and the light from the street lamp glinted on brass buttons Jimmie Dale s eyes narrowed a little under his slouch hat The policeman although nonchalantly swinging a nightstick appeared to be watching him Jimmie Dale went on half a block farther stooped to the sidewalk to tie his shoe glanced back over his shoulder the policeman was not in sight and slipped like a shadow into the alleyway beside which he had stopped It was another Jimmie Dale now the professional Jimmie Dale Quick as a cat active lithe he was over a six foot fence in the rear of a building in a flash and crouched a black shape against the back door of an unpretentious unkempt dirty secondhand shop that fronted on West Broadway the last place certainly in all New York that the managing editor of the NEWS ARGUS or any one else for that matter would have picked out as the setting for the second debut of the Gray Seal From the belt around his waist Jimmie Dale took the black silk mask and slipped it on and from the belt too came a little instrument that his deft fingers manipulated in the lock A curious snipping sound followed Jimmie Dale put his weight gradually against the door The door held fast Bolted said Jimmie Dale to himself The sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side of the door seeming to press and feel for the position of the bolt through an inch of plank then from the belt came a tiny saw thin and pointed at the end that fitted into the little handle drawn from another receptacle in the leather girdle beneath the unbuttoned vest Hardly a sound it made as it bit into the door Half a minute passed there was the faint fall of a small piece of wood into the aperture crept the delicate tapering fingers came a slight rasping of metal then the door swung back the dark shadow that had been Jimmie Dale vanished and the door closed again A round white beam of light glowed for an instant and disappeared A miscellaneous lumbering collection of junk and odds and ends blocked the entry leaving no more space than was sufficient for bare passageway Jimmie Dale moved cautiously and once more the flashlight in his hand showed the way for an instant then darkness again The cluttered accumulation of secondhand stuff in the rear gave place to a little more orderly arrangement as he advanced toward the front of the store Like a huge firefly the flashlight twinkled went out twinkled again and went out He passed a sort of crude partitioned off apartment that did duty for the establishment s office a sort of little boxed in place it was about in the middle of the floor Jimmie Dale s light played on it for a moment but he kept on toward the front door without any pause Every movement was quick sure accurate with not a wasted second It had been barely a minute since he had vaulted the back fence It was hardly a quarter of a minute more before the cumbersome lock of the front door was unfastened and the door itself pulled imperceptibly ajar He went swiftly back to the office now and found it even more of a shaky cheap affair than it had at first appeared more like a box stall with windows around the top than anything else the windows doubtless to permit the occupant to overlook the store from the vantage point of the high stool that stood before a long battered wobbly desk There was a door to the place too but the door was open and the key was in the lock The ray of Jimmie Dale s flashlight swept once around the interior and rested on an antique ponderous safe Under the mask Jimmie Dale s lips parted in a smile that seemed almost apologetic as he viewed the helpless iron monstrosity that was little more than an insult to a trained cracksman Then from the belt came the thin metal case and a pair of tweezers He opened the case and with the tweezers lifted out one of the gray coloured diamond shaped seals Holding the seal with the tweezers he moistened the gummed side with his lips then laid it on a handkerchief which he took from his pocket and clapped the handkerchief against the front of the safe sticking the seal conspicuously into place Jimmie Dale s insignia bore no finger prints The microscopes and magnifying glasses at headquarters had many a time regretfully assured the police of that fact And now his hands and fingers seemed to work like lightning Into the soft iron bit a drill bit in and through bit in and through again It was dark pitch black and silent Not a sound save the quick dull rasp of the ratchet like the distant gnawing of a mouse Jimmie Dale worked fast another hole went through the face of the old fashioned safe and then suddenly he straightened up to listen every faculty tense alert and strained his body thrown a little forward WHAT WAS THAT From the alleyway leading from the street without through which he himself had come sounded the stealthy crunch of feet Motionless in the utter darkness Jimmie Dale listened there was a scraping noise in the rear someone was climbing the fence that he had climbed In an instant the tools in Jimmie Dale s hands disappeared into their respective pockets beneath his vest and the sensitive fingers shot to the dial on the safe Too bad muttered Jimmie Dale plaintively to himself I could have made such an artistic job of it I swear I could have cut Carruthers profile in the hole in less than no time to open it like this is really taking the poor old thing at a disadvantage He was on his knees now one ear close to the dial listening as the tumblers fell while the delicate fingers spun the knob unerringly the other ear strained toward the rear of the premises Came a footstep a ray of light a stumble nearer the newcomer was inside the place now and must have found out that the back door had been tampered with Nearer came the steps still nearer and then the safe door swung open under Jimmie Dale s hand and Jimmie Dale that he might not be caught like a rat in a trap darted from the office but he had delayed a little too long From around the cluttered piles of junk and miscellany swept the light full on Jimmie Dale Hesitation for the smallest fraction of a second would have been fatal but hesitation was something that in all his life Jimmie Dale had never known Quick as a panther in its spring he leaped full at the light and the man behind it The rough voice in surprised exclamation at the sudden discovery of the quarry died in a gasp There was a crash as the two men met and the other reeled back before the impact Onto him Jimmie Dale sprang and his hands flew for the other s throat It was an officer in uniform Jimmie Dale had felt the brass buttons as they locked In the darkness there was a queer smile on Jimmie Dale s tight lips It was no doubt THE officer whom he had passed on the other side of the street The other was a smaller man than Jimmie Dale but powerful for his build and he fought now with all his strength This way and that the two men reeled staggered swayed panting and gasping and then they had lurched back close to the office door with a sudden swing every muscle brought into play for a supreme effort Jimmie Dale hurled the other from him sending the man sprawling back to the floor of the office and in the winking of an eye had slammed shut the door and turned the key There was a bull like roar the shrill CHEEP CHEEP CHEEP of the patrolman s whistle and a shattering crash as the officer flung his body against the partition then the bark of a revolver shot the tinkle of breaking glass as the man fired through the office window and past Jimmie Dale speeding now for the front door a bullet hummed viciously Out on the street dashed Jimmie Dale whipping the mask from his face and glanced like a hawk around him For all the racket the neighbourhood had not yet been aroused no one was in sight From just overhead came the rattle of a downtown elevated train In a hundred yard sprint Jimmie Dale raced it a half block to the station tore up the steps and a moment later dropped nonchalantly into a seat and pulled an evening newspaper from his pocket Jimmie Dale got off at the second station down crossed the street mounted the steps of the elevated again and took the next train uptown His movements appeared to be somewhat erratic he alighted at the station next above the one by which he had made his escape Looking down the street it was too dark to see much of anything but a confused noise as of a gathering crowd reached him from what was about the location of the secondhand store He listened appreciatively for a moment Isn t it a perfectly lovely night said Jimmie Dale amiably to himself And to think of that cop running away with the idea that I didn t see him when he hid in a doorway after I passed the corner Well well strange isn t it With another glance down the street a whimsical lift of his shoulders he headed west into the dilapidated tenement quarter that huddled for a handful of blocks near by just south of Washington Square It was a little after one o clock in the morning now and the pedestrians were casual Jimmie Dale read the street signs on the corners as he went along turned abruptly into an intersecting street counted the tenements from the corner as he passed and for the eye of any one who might be watching opened the street door of one of them quite as though he were accustomed and had a perfect right to do so and went inside It was murky and dark within hot unhealthy with lingering smells of garlic and stale cooking He groped for the stairs and started up He climbed one flight then another and one more to the top Here treading softly he made an examination of the landing with a view evidently to obtaining an idea of the location and the number of doors that opened off from it His selection fell on the third door from the head of the stairs there were four all told two apartments of two rooms each He paused for an instant to adjust the black silk mask tried the door quietly found it unlocked opened it with a sudden quick brisk movement and stepping in side leaned with his back against it Good morning said Jimmie Dale pleasantly It was a squalid place a miserable hole in which a single flickering yellow gas jet gave light It was almost bare of furniture there was nothing but a couple of cheap chairs a rickety table unpawnable A boy he was hardly more than that perhaps twenty two from a posture in which he was huddled across the table with head buried in out flung arms sprang with a startled cry to his feet Good morning said Jimmie Dale again Your name s Hagan Bert Hagan isn t it And you work for Isaac Brolsky in the secondhand shop over on West Broadway don t you The boy s lips quivered and the gaunt hollow half starved face white ashen white now was pitiful I I guess you got me he faltered I I suppose you re a plain clothes man though I never knew dicks wore masks They don t generally said Jimmie Dale coolly It s a fad of mine Bert Hagan The lad hanging to the table turned his head away for a moment and there was silence Presently Hagan spoke again I ll go he said numbly I won t make any trouble Would would you mind not speaking loud I I wouldn t like her to know Her said Jimmie Dale softly The boy tiptoed across the room opened a connecting door a little peered inside opened it a little wider and looked over his shoulder at Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale crossed to the boy looked inside the other room and his lip twitched queerly as the sight sent a quick hurt throb through his heart A young woman younger than the boy lay on a tumble down bed a rag of clothing over her her face with a deathlike pallor upon it as she lay in what appeared to be a stupor She was ill critically ill it needed no trained eye to discern a fact all too apparent to the most casual observer The squalor the glaring poverty here was even more pitifully in evidence than in the other room only here upon a chair beside the bed was a cluster of medicine bottles and a little heap of fruit Jimmie Dale drew back silently as the boy closed the door Hagan walked to the table and picked up his hat I m I m ready he said brokenly Let s go Just a minute said Jimmie Dale Tell us about it Twon t take long said Hagan trying to smile She s my wife The sickness took all we had I I kinder got behind in the rent and things They were going to fire us out of here to morrow And there wasn t any money for the medicine and and the things she had to have Maybe you wouldn t have done it but I did I couldn t see her dying there for the want of something a little money d buy and and I couldn t he caught his voice in a little sob I couldn t see her thrown out on the street like that And so said Jimmie Dale instead of putting old Isaac s cash in the safe this evening when you locked up you put it in your pocket instead eh Didn t you know you d get caught What did it matter said the boy He was twirling his misshappen hat between his fingers I knew they d know it was me in the morning when old Isaac found it gone because there wasn t anybody else to do it But I paid the rent for four months ahead to night and I fixed it so s she d have medicine and things to eat I was going to beat it before daylight myself I he brushed his hand hurriedly across his cheek I didn t want to go to leave her till I had to Well say there was wonderment in Jimmie Dale s tones and his English lapsed into ungrammatical reassuring vernacular ain t that queer Say I m no detective Gee kid did you think I was Say listen to this I cracked old Isaac s safe half an hour ago and I guess there won t be any idea going around that you got the money and I pulled a lemon Say I ain t superstitious but it looks like luck meant you to have another chance don t it The hat dropped from Hagan s hands to the floor and he swayed a little You you ain t a dick he stammered Then how d you know about me and my name when you found the safe empty Who told you A wry grimace spread suddenly over Jimmie Dale s face beneath the mask and he swallowed hard Jimmie Dale would have given a good deal to have been able to answer that question himself Oh that said Jimmie Dale That s easy I knew you worked there Say it s the limit ain t it Talk about your luck being in why all you ve got to do is to sit tight and keep your mouth shut and you re safe as a church Only say

none	none	going to do about the money now you ve got a four months start and are kind of landed on your feet Do said the boy I ll pay it back little by little I meant to I ain t no He stopped abruptly Crook supplied Jimmie Dale pleasantly Spit it right out kid you won t hurt my feelings none Well I ll tell you you re talking the way I like to hear you you pay that back slide it in without his knowing it a bit at a time whenever you can and you ll never hear a yip out of me but if you don t why it kind of looks as though I have a right to come down your street and get my share or know the reason why eh Then you never get any share said Hagan with a catch in his voice I pay it back as fast as I can Sure said Jimmie Dale That s right that s what I said Well so long Hagan And Jimmie Dale had opened the door and slipped outside An hour later in his dressing room in his house on Riverside Drive Jimmie Dale was removing his coat as the telephone a hand instrument on the table rang Jimmie Dale glanced at it and leisurely proceeded to remove his vest Again the telephone rang Jimmie Dale took off his curious pocketed leather belt as the telephone repeated its summons He picked out the little drill he had used a short while before and inspected it critically feeling its point with his thumb as one might feel a razor s blade Again the telephone rang insistently He reached languidly for the receiver took it off its hook and held it to his ear Hello said Jimmie Dale with a sleepy yawn Hello Hello Why the deuce don t you yank a man out of bed at two o clock in the morning and have done with it and eh Oh that you Carruthers Yes came Carruthers voice excitedly Jimmie listen listen The Gray Seal s come to life He s just pulled a break on West Broadway Good Lord gasped Jimmie Dale You don t say CHAPTER II BY PROXY The most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals of crime Herman Carruthers the editor of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS had called the Gray Seal and Jimmie Dale smiled a little grimly now as he recalled the occasion of a week ago at the saint James Club over their after dinner coffee That was before his second debut with Isaac Brolsky s poverty stricken premises over on West Broadway as a setting for the break SHE had written Things are a little too warm aren t they Jimmie Let s let them cool for a year Well they had cooled for a year and Carruthers as a result had been complacently satisfied in his own mind that the Gray Seal was dead until that break at Isaac Brolsky s over on West Broadway Jimmie Dale s smile was tinged with whimsicality now The only effect of the year s inaction had been to usher in his renewed activity with a furor compared to which all that had gone before was insignificant Where the newspapers had been maudlin they now raved raved in editorials and raved in headlines It was an impossible untenable unbelievable condition of affairs that this Gray Seal for all his incomparable cleverness should flaunt his crimes in the faces of the citizens of New York One could actually see the editors writhing in their swivel chairs as their fiery denunciations dripped from their pens What was the matter with the police Were the police children or worse still imbeciles or still worse again was there some one higher up who was profiting by this rogue s work New York would not stand for it New York would most decidedly not and the sooner the police realised that fact the better If the police were helpless or tools the citizens of New York were not and it was time the citizens were thoroughly aroused There was a way too to arouse the citizens that was both good business from the newspaper standpoint and efficacious as a method Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS had initiated it The MORNING NEWS ARGUS offered twenty five thousand dollars reward for the capture of the Gray Seal Other papers immediately followed suit in varying amounts The authorities State and municipal goaded to desperation did likewise and the five million men women and children of New York were automatically metamorphosed into embryonic sleuths New York was aroused Jimmie Dale alias the Gray Seal member of the ultra exclusive saint James Club the latter fact sufficient in itself to guarantee his social standing graduate of Harvard inheritor of his deceased father s immense wealth amassed in the manufacture of burglar proof safes some of the most ingenious patents on which were due to Jimmie Dale himself figured with a pencil on the margin of the newspaper he had been reading using the arm of the big luxurious leather upholstered lounging chair as a support for the paper The result of his calculations was eighty five thousand dollars He brushed the paper onto the Turkish rug dove into the pocket of his dinner jacket for his cigarettes and began to smoke as his eyes strayed around the room his own particular den in his fashionable Riverside Drive residence Eighty five thousand dollars reward Jimmie Dale blew meditative rings of cigarette smoke at the fireplace What would she say to that Would she decide it was too hot again and call it off It added quite a little hazard to the game QUITE a little If he only knew who she was It was a strange partnership the strangest partnership that had ever existed between two human beings He turned a little in his chair as a step sounded in the hallway without that is Jimmie Dale caught the sound muffled though it was by the heavy carpet Came then a knock upon the door Come in invited Jimmie Dale It was old Jason the butler The old man was visibly excited as he extended a silver tray on which lay a letter Jimmie Dale s hand reached quickly out the long slim tapering fingers closed upon the envelope but his eyes were on Jason significantly questioningly Yes Master Jim said the old man I recognised it on the instant sir After what you said sir last week honouring me I might say to a certain extent with your confidence though I m sure I don t know what it all means I Who brought it this time Jason inquired Jimmie Dale quietly Not the young person begging your pardon not the young lady sir A shuffer in a big automobile Your master at once he says and shoves the letter into my hand and was off Very good Jason said Jimmie Dale You may go The door closed Yes it was from HER it was the same texture of paper there was the same rare haunting fragrance clinging to it He tore the envelope open and extracted a folded sheet of paper What was it this time To call the partnership off again until the present furor should have subsided once more or the skilfully sketched outline of a new adventure Which He glanced at the few lines written on the sheet and lunged forward from his chair to his feet It was neither one nor the other It was Jimmie Dale s face was set and an angry red surge swept his cheeks His lips moved muttering audibly fragments of the letter as he stared at it incredible that you a heinous thing act instantly this is ruin For an instant a rare occurrence in Jimmie Dale s life he stood like a man stricken still staring at the sheet in his hand Then mechanically his fingers tore the paper into little pieces and the little pieces into tiny shreds Anger fled and a sickening sense of impotent dismay took its place the red left his cheeks and in its stead a grayness came Act instantly The words seemed to leap at him drum at his ears with constant repetition Act instantly But how How Then his brain that keen clear master brain sprang from stunned inaction into virility again Of course Carruthers It was in Carruthers line He stepped to the desk and paused with his hand extended to pick up the telephone How explain to Carruthers that he Jimmie Dale already knew what Carruthers might not yet have heard of even though Carruthers would naturally be among the first to be in touch with such affairs No that would never do Better get there himself at once and trust to The telephone rang Jimmie Dale waited until it rang again then he lifted the receiver from the hook Hello he said Hello Hello Jimmie came a voice This is Carruthers That you Jimmie Yes said Jimmie Dale and sat down limply in the desk chair It s the Gray Seal again I promised you I d let you in on the ground floor next time anything happened so come on down here quick if you want to see some of his work at firsthand Jimmie Dale flirted a bead of sweat from his forehead Carruthers said Jimmie languidly you newspaper chaps make me tired with your Gray Seal I m just going to bed Bed nothing spluttered Carruthers from the other end of the wire Come down I tell you It s worth your while half the population of New York would give the toes off their feet for the chance Come down you blast idiot The Gray Seal has gone the limit this time it s MURDER Jimmie Dale s face was haggard Oh he said peevishly Sounds interesting Where are you I guess maybe I ll jog along I should think you would snapped Carruthers You know the Palace on the Bowery Yes Well meet me on the corner there as soon as you can Hustle Good Oh I say Carruthers interposed Jimmie Dale Yes demanded Carruthers Thanks awfully for letting me know old man Don t mention it returned Carruthers sarcastically You always were a grateful beast Jimmie Hurry up Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver of the city phone and took down the receiver of another a private house installation and rang twice for the garage The light car at once Benson he ordered curtly At once Jimmie Dale worked quickly then In his dressing room he changed from dinner clothes to tweeds spent a second or so over the contents of a locked drawer in the dresser from which he selected a very small but serviceable automatic and a very small but highly powerful magnifying glass whose combination of little round lenses worked on a pivot and closed over one another were of about the compass of a quarter of a dollar In three minutes he was outside the house and stepping into the car just as it drew up at the curb Benson he said tersely to his chauffeur drop me one block this side of the Palace on the Bowery and forget there was ever a speed law enacted Understand Very good sir said Benson touching his cap I ll do my best sir Jimmie Dale in the tonneau stretched out his legs under the front seat and dug his hands into his pockets and inside the pockets his hands were clenched and knotted fists Murder At times it had occurred to him that there was a possibility that some crook of the underworld would attempt to cover his tracks and take refuge from pursuit by foisting himself on the authorities as the Gray Seal That was a possibility a risk always to be run But that MURDER should be laid to the Gray Seal s door Anger merciless and unrestrained surged over Jimmie Dale There was peril here live and imminent Suppose that some day he should be caught in some little affair recognised and identified as the Gray Seal there would be the charge of murder hanging over him and the electric chair to face But the peril was not the only thing Even worse to Jimmie Dale s artistic and sensitive temperament was the vilification the holding up to loathing contumely and abhorrence of the name the stainless name of the Gray Seal It WAS stainless He had guarded it jealously as a man guards the woman s name he loves Affairs that had mystified and driven the police distracted with impotence there had been many of them and on the face of them crimes But no act ever committed had been in reality a crime none without the highest of motives the righting of some outrageous wrong the protection of some poor stumbling fellow human That had been his partnership with her How by what amazing means by what power that smacked almost of the miraculous she came in touch with all these things and supplied him with the data on which to work he did not know only that thanks to her there were happier hearts and happier homes since the Gray Seal had begun to work Dear Philanthropic Crook she often called him in her letters And now it was MURDER Take Carruthers for instance For years as a reporter before he had risen to the editorial desk he had been one of the keenest on the scent of the Gray Seal but always for the sake of the game always filled with admiration as he said himself for the daring the originality of the most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals of crime Carruthers was but an example Carruthers now would hunt the Gray Seal like a mad dog The Gray Seal to Carruthers and every one else would be the vilest name in the land a synonym for murder On the car flew and upon Jimmie Dale s face as though chiselled in marble was a look that was not good to see And a mirthless smile set frozen on his lips I ll get the man that did this gritted Jimmie Dale between his teeth I ll GET him And when I get him I ll wring a confession from him if I have to swing for it The car swept from Broadway into Astor Place on down the Bowery and presently stopped Jimmie Dale stepped out I shall not want you any more Benson he said You may return home Jimmie Dale started down the block a nonchalant Jimmie Dale now if anything bored a little Near the corner a figure back turned was lounging at the edge of the sidewalk Jimmie Dale touched the man on the arm Hello Carruthers he drawled Ah Jimmie Carruthers turned with an excited smile That s the boy You ve made mighty quick time Well you told me to hurry grumbled Jimmie Dale I m doing my best to please you to night Came down in my car and got summoned for three fines to morrow Carruthers laughed Come on he said and linking his arm in Jimmie Dale s turned the corner and headed west along the cross street This is going to make a noise he continued a grim note creeping into his voice The biggest noise the city has ever heard I take back all I said about the Gray Seal I d always pictured his cleverness as being inseparable with at least a decent sort of man even if he was a rogue and a criminal but I m through with that He s a rotter and a hound of the rankest sort I didn t think there was anything more vulgar or brutal than murder but he s shown me that there is A guttersnipe s got more decency To murder a man and then boastfully label the corpse is Say Carruthers said Jimmie Dale plaintively suddenly hanging back I say you know it s it s all right for you to mess up in this sort of thing it s your beastly business and I m awfully damned thankful to you for giving me a look in but isn t it er rather INFRA DIG for me A bit morbid you know and all that sort of thing I d never hear the end of it at the club you know what the saint James is Couldn t I be Merideth Stanley Annstruther or something like that one of your new reporters or something like that you know Carruthers chuckled Sure Jimmie he said You re the latest addition to the staff of the NEWS ARGUS Don t worry the incomparable Jimmie Dale won t figure publicly in this It s awfully good of you said Jimmie gratefully I have to have a notebook or something don t I Carruthers from his pocket handed him one Thanks said Jimmie Dale A little way ahead a crowd had collected on the sidewalk before a doorway and Carruthers pointed with a jerk of his hand It s in Moriarty s place a gambling hell he explained I haven t got the story myself yet though I ve been inside and had a look around Inspector Clayton discovered the crime and reported it at headquarters I was at my desk in the office when the news came and as you know the interest I ve taken in the Gray Seal I decided to cover it myself When I got here Clayton hadn t returned from headquarters so as you seemed so keenly interested last week I telephoned you If Clayton s back now we ll get the details Clayton s a good fellow with the press and he won t hold anything out on us Now here we are Keep close to me and I ll pass you in They shouldered through the crowd and up to an officer at the door The officer nodded stepped aside and Carruthers with Jimmie Dale following entered the house They climbed one flight and then another The card rooms the faro stud and roulette layouts were deserted save for policemen here and there on guard Carruthers led the way to a room at the back of the hall whose door was open and from which issued a hubbub of voices one voice rose above the others heavy and gratingly complacent Clayton s back observed Carruthers They stepped over the threshold and the heavy voice greeted them Ah here s Carruthers now H are you Carruthers They told me you d been here and were coming back so I ve been keeping the boys waiting before handing out the dope You ve had a look at that eh He flung out a fat hand toward the bed The voices rose again all directed at Carruthers now Bubble s burst eh Carruthers What about the Prince of Crooks Artistry in crime wasn t it you said They were quoting from his editorials of bygone days a half dozen reporters of rival papers grinning and joshing him good naturedly seemingly quite unaffected by what lay within arm s reach of them upon the bed Carruthers smiled a little wryly shrugged his shoulders and presented Jimmie Dale to Inspector Clayton mister Matthewson a new man of ours inspector Glad to know you mister Matthewson said the inspector Jimmie Dale found his hand grasped by another that was flabby and unpleasantly moist and found himself looking into a face that was red with heavy rolls of unhealthy fat terminating in a double chin and a thick apoplectic neck a huge round face with rat s eyes Clayton dropped Jimmie Dale s hand and waved his own in the air Jimmie Dale remained modestly on the outside of the circle as the reporters gathered around the police inspector Now then said Clayton coarsely the guy that s croaked there is Metzer Jake Metzer Get that Jimmie Dale scribbling hurriedly in his notebook like all the rest turned a little toward the bed and his lower jaw crept out the fraction of an inch Both gas jets in the room were turned on full giving ample light A man fully dressed a man of perhaps forty lay upon his back on the bed one arm outflung across the bedspread the other dangling with fingers just touching the floor the head at an angle and off the pillow It was as though he had been carried to the bed and flung upon it after the deed had been committed Jimmie Dale s eyes shifted and swept the room Yes everything was in disorder as though there had been a struggle a chair upturned a table canted against the wall broken pieces of crockery from the washstand on the carpet and Metzer was a stool pigeon see went on Clayton and he lived here Moriarty wasn t on to him Metzer stood in thick with a wider circle of crooks than any other snitch in New York Jimmie Dale still scribbling as Clayton talked stepped to the bed and leaned over the murdered man The murder had been done with a blackjack evidently a couple of blows The left side of the temple was crushed in Right in the middle of the forehead pasted there a gray colored diamond shaped paper seal flaunted itself the device of the Gray Seal In Jimmie Dale hand hidden as he turned his back the tiny combination of powerful lenses was focused on the seal Clayton guffawed That s right he called out Take a good look That s a bright young man you ve got Carruthers Jimmie Dale looked up a little sheepishly and got a grin from the assembled reporters and a scowl from Carruthers Now then continued Clayton here s the facts as much of em as I can let you boys print at present You know I m stretching a point to let you in here don t forget that when you come to write up the case honour where s honour s due you know Well me and Metzer there was getting ready to close down on a big piece of game and I was over here in this room talking to him about it early this afternoon We had it framed to get our man to night see I left Metzer say about three o clock and he was to show up over at headquarters with another little bit of evidence we wanted at eight o clock to night Jimmie Dale was listening to every word But he stooped now again over the murdered man s head deliberately though he felt the inspector s rat s eyes upon him stooped and with his finger nail lifted back the right hand point of the diamond shaped seal where it bordered a faint thread of blood on the man s forehead There was a bull like roar from the inspector and he burst through the ring of reporters and grabbed Jimmie Dale by the shoulder Here you what in hell are you doing he spluttered angrily Embarrassed and confused Jimmie Dale drew back glanced around and smiled again a little sheepishly as his eyes rested on the red flushed jowl of the inspector I I wanted to see how it was stuck on he explained inanely Stuck on bellowed Clayton I ll show you how it s STUCK on if you monkey around here Don t you know any better than that Where were you dragged up anyway The coroner hasn t been here yet You re a hot cub of a reporter you are He turned to Carruthers Y ought to get out printed instructions for em before you turn em loose he snapped Carruthers face was red with mortification There was a grin expanded on the faces of the others Stand away from that bed roared Clayton at Jimmie Dale And if you go near it again I ll throw you out of here bodily Jimmie Dale edged away and eyes lowered fumbled nervously with the leaves of his notebook Clayton grunted glared at Jimmie Dale for an instant viciously and resumed his story I was saying he said that Metzer was to come to headquarters at eight o clock this evening Well he didn t show up That looked queer It was mighty important business We was after one of the biggest hauls we d ever pulled off I waited till nine o clock an hour ago and I was getting nervous Then I started over here to find out what was the matter When I got here I asked Moriarty if he d seen Metzer Moriarty said he hadn t since I was here before He was a little suspicious that I had something on Metzer see Well by pumping Moriarty he admitted that Metzer had had a visitor about an hour after I left Who was it Know what his name is inspector asked one of the reporters quickly Inspector Clayton winked heavily Don t be greedy boys he grinned You mean you ve got him burst out another one of the men excitedly Sure Sure I ve got him Inspector Clayton waved his fat hand airily Or I will have before morning but I ain t saying anything more till it s over He smiled significantly Well that s about all You ve got the details right around you I left Moriarty downstairs and came up here and found just what you see Metzer laying on the bed there and the gray seal stuck on his forehead and he ended abruptly I ll have the Gray Seal himself behind the bars by morning A chorus of ejaculations rose from the reporters while their pencils worked furiously Then Jimmie Dale appeared to have an inspiration Jimmie Dale turned a leaf in his notebook and began to sketch rapidly cocking his head now on one side now on the other With a few deft strokes he had outlined the figure of Inspector Clayton The reporter beside Jimmie Dale leaned over to inspect the work and another did likewise Jimmie Dale drew in Clayton s face most excellently if somewhat flatteringly and then with a little flourish of pride wrote under the drawing The Man Who Captured the Gray Seal That s a cracking good sketch pronounced the reporter at his side Let the inspector see it

none	none	demanded Clayton scowling Jimmie Dale handed him the notebook modestly Inspector Clayton took it looked at it looked at Jimmie Dale then his scowl relaxed into a self sufficient and pleased smile and he grunted approvingly That s the stuff to put over he said Mabbe you re not much of a reporter but you can draw Y re all right sport y re all right Forget what I said to you a while ago Jimmie Dale smiled too deprecatingly And put the notebook in his pocket An officer entered the room hurriedly and drawing Clayton aside spoke in an undertone A triumphant and malicious grin settled on Clayton s features and he started with a rush for the door Come around to headquarters in two hours boys he called as he went out and I ll have something more for you The room cleared the reporters tumbling downstairs to make for the nearest telephones to get their copy into their respective offices On the street a few doors up from the house where they were free from the crowd Carruthers halted Jimmie Dale Jimmie he said reproachfully you certainly made a mark of us both There wasn t any need to play the cub so egregiously However I ll forgive you for the sake of the sketch hand it over Jimmie I m going to reproduce it in the first edition It wasn t drawn for reproduction Carruthers at least not yet said Jimmie Dale quietly Carruthers stared at him Eh he asked blankly I ve taken a dislike to Clayton said Jimmie Dale whimsically He s too patently after free advertising and I m not going to help along his boost You can t have it old man so let s think about something else What ll they do with that bit of paper that s on the poor devil s forehead up there for instance Say said Carruthers does it strike you that you re acting queer You haven t been drinking have you Jimmie What ll they do with it persisted Jimmie Dale Well said Carruthers smiling a little tolerantly they ll photograph it and enlarge the photograph and label it Exhibit A or Exhibit B or something like that and file it away in the archives with the fifty or more just like it that are already in their collection That s what I thought observed Jimmie Dale He took Carruthers by the lapel of the coat I d like a photograph of that I d like it so much that I ve got to have it Know the chap that does that work for the police Yes admitted Carruthers Very good said Jimmie Dale crisply Get an extra print of the enlargement from him then for a consideration whatever he asks I ll pay for it But what for demanded Carruthers I don t understand Because said Jimmie Dale very seriously put it down to imagination or whatever you like I think I smell something fishy here You WHAT exclaimed Carruthers in amazement You re not joking are you Jimmie Jimmie Dale laughed shortly It s so far from a joke he said in a low tone that I want your word you ll get that photograph into my hands by to morrow afternoon no matter what transpires in the meantime And look here Carruthers don t think I m playing the silly thickhead and trying to mystify you I m no detective or anything like that I ve just got an idea that apparently hasn t occurred to any one else and of course I may be all wrong If I am I m not going to say a word even to you because it wouldn t be playing fair with some one else if I m right the MORNING NEWS ARGUS gets the biggest scoop of the century Will you go in on that basis Carruthers put out his hand impulsively If you re in earnest Jimmie you bet Good returned Jimmie Dale The photograph by to morrow afternoon then And now And now said Caruthers I ve got to hurry over to the office and get a write up man at work Will you come along or meet me at headquarters later Clayton said in two hours he d Neither said Jimmie Dale I m not interested in headquarters I m going home Well all right then Carruthers returned You can bank on me for to morrow Good night Jimmie Good night old man said Jimmie Dale and turning walked briskly toward the Bowery But Jimmie Dale did not go home He walked down the Bowery for three blocks crossed to the east side and turned down a cross street Two blocks more he walked in this direction and halfway down the next Here he paused an instant the street was dimly lighted almost dark deserted Jimmie Dale edged close to the houses until his shadow blended with the shadows of the walls and slipped suddenly into a pitch black areaway He opened a door stepped into an unlighted hallway where the air was close and evil smelling mounted a stairway and halted before another door on the first landing There was the low clicking of a lock three times repeated and he entered a room closing and fastening the door behind him Jimmie Dale called it his Sanctuary In one of the worst neighbourhoods of New York where no questions were asked as long as the rent was paid it had the further advantage of three separate exits one by the areaway where he had entered one from the street itself and another through a back yard with an entry into a saloon that fronted on the next street It was not often that Jimmie Dale used his Sanctuary but there had been times when it was no more nor less than exactly what he called it a sanctuary He stepped to the window assured himself that the shade was down and lighted the gas blinking a little as the yellow flame illuminated the room It was a rough place dirty uninviting a bedroom furnished in the most scanty fashion Neither apparently was there anything suspicious about it to reward one curious enough to break in during the owner s absence some rather disreputable clothes hanging on the wall and flung untidily across the bed that was all Alone now Jimmie Dale s face was strained and anxious and occasionally as he undressed himself his hands clenched until his knuckles grew white The gray seal on the murdered man s forehead was a GENUINE GRAY SEAL one of Jimmie Dale s own There was no doubt of that he had satisfied himself on that point Where had it come from How had it been obtained Jimmie Dale carefully placed the clothes he had taken off under the mattress pulled a disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head and pulled on a disreputable pair of boots There were only two sources of supply His own and the collection that the police had made which Carruthers had referred to Jimmie Dale lifted a corner of the oilcloth in a corner of the room lifted a piece of the flooring lifted out a little box which he placed upon the rickety table and sat down before a cracked mirror Who was it that would have access to the gray seals in the possession of the police since obviously it was one of those that was on the dead man s forehead The answer came quick enough came with the sudden out thrust of Jimmie Dale s lower jaw ONE OF THE POLICE THEMSELVES no one else Clayton s heavy cunning face Clayton s shifty eyes Clayton s sudden rush when he had touched the dead man s forehead pictured themselves in a red flash of fury before Jimmie Dale There was no mask now no facetiousness no acted part only a merciless rage and the muscles of Jimmie Dale s face quivered and twitched MURDER foisted shifted upon another upon the Gray Seal making of that name a calumny ruining forever the work that she and he might do And then Jimmie Dale smiled mirthlessly with thinning lips The box before him was open His fingers worked quickly a little wax behind the ears in the nostrils under the upper lip deftly placed hands wrists neck throat and face received their quota of stain applied with an artist s touch and then the spruce muscular Jimmie Dale transformed into a slouching vicious featured denizen of the underworld replaced the box under the flooring pulled a slouch hat over his eyes extinguished the gas and went out Jimmie Dale s range of acquaintanceship was wide from the upper strata of the saint James Club to the elite of New York s gangland And adored by the one he was trusted implicitly by the other not understood perhaps by the latter for he had never allied himself with any of their nefarious schemes but trusted implicitly through long years of personal contact It had stood Jimmie Dale in good stead before this association where in a sort of strange carefully guarded exchange the news of the underworld was common property to those without the law To New York in its millions the murder of Metzer the stool pigeon would be unknown until the city rose in the morning to read the sensational details over the breakfast table here it would already be the topic of whispered conversations here it had probably been known long before the police had discovered the crime Especially would it be expected to be known to Pete Lazanis commonly called the Runt who was a power below the dead line and more pertinent still one in whose confidence Jimmie Dale had rejoiced for years Jimmie Dale as Larry the Bat a euphonious monaker bestowed possibly because this particular world knew him only by night began a search for the Runt From one resort to another he hurried talking in the accepted style through one corner of his mouth to hard visaged individuals behind dirty reeking bars that were reared on equally dirty and foul smelling sawdust strewn floors visiting dance halls secretive back rooms and certain Chinese pipe joints But the Runt was decidedly elusive There had been no news of him no one had seen him and this after fully an hour had passed since Jimmie Dale had left Carruthers in front of Moriarty s The possibilities however were still legion numbered only by the numberless dives and dens sheltered by that quarter of the city Jimmie Dale turned into Chatham Square heading for the Pagoda Dance Hall A man loitering at the curb shot a swift searching glance at him as he slouched by Jimmie Dale paused in the doorway of the Pagoda and looked up and down the street The man he had passed had drawn a little closer another man in an apparently aimless fashion lounged a few yards away

none	none	muttered Jimmie Dale to himself Lansing of headquarters and the other looks like Milrae Jimmie Dale pushed in through the door of the Pagoda A bedlam of noise surged out at him a tin pan piano and a mandolin were going furiously from a little raised platform at the rear in the centre of the room a dozen couples were in the throes of the tango and the bunny hug around the sides at little tables men and women laughed and applauded and thumped time on the tabletops with their beer mugs while waiters with beer stained aprons and unshaven faces juggled marvelous handfuls of glasses and mugs from the bar beside the platform to the patrons at the tables Jimmie Dale s eyes swept the room in a swift comprehensive glance fixed on a little fellow loudly dressed who shared a table halfway down the room with a woman in a picture hat and a smile of relief touched his lips The Runt at last He walked down the room caught the Runt s eyes significantly as he passed the table kept on to a door between the platform and the bar opened it and went out into a lighted hallway at one end of which a door opened onto the street and at the other a stairway led above The Runt joined him Wot s de row Larry inquired the Runt Nuthin much said Jimmie Dale Only I t ought I d let youse know I was passin Moriarty s an got de tip Say some guy s croaked Jake Metzer dere Aw ferget it observed the Runt airily Dat s stale Was wise to dat hours ago Jimmie Dale s face fell But I just come from dere he insisted an de harness bulls only just found it out Mabbe grunted the Runt But Metzer got his early in de afternoon see Jimmie Dale looked quickly around him and then leaned toward the Runt Wot s de lay Runt

2416_152137_000031_000006	train-clean-100	a chance 
none	none	to talk to the man even for a minute But there was no possibility of that now Later to morrow perhaps if he was wrong after all Jimmie Dale returned to the Sanctuary removed from his person all evidences of Larry the Bat and from the Sanctuary went home to Riverside Drive In his den there in the morning after breakfast Jason the butler brought him the papers Three inch headlines in red ink screamed exulted and shrieked out the news that the Gray Seal in the person of Stace Morse fence yeggman and murderer had been captured The public if it had held any private admiration for the one time mysterious crook could now once and forever disillusion itself The Gray Seal was Stace Morse and Stace Morse was of the dregs of the city s scum a pariah an outcast with no single redeeming trait to lift him from the ruck of mire and slime that had strewn his life from infancy The face of Inspector Clayton blandly self complacent leaped out from the paper to meet Jimmie Dale s eyes and with it a column and a half of perfervid eulogy Something at first like dismay the dismay of impotency filled Jimmie Dale and then cold leaving him unnaturally calm the old merciless rage took its place There was nothing to do now but wait wait until Carruthers should send that photograph Then if after all he were wrong then he must find some other way But was he wrong The notebook that Carruthers had given him open at the sketch he had made of Clayton lay upon the desk Jimmie Dale picked it up he had already spent quite a little time over it before breakfast and examined it again minutely even resorting to his magnifying glass He put it down as a knock sounded at the door and Jason entered with a silver card tray From Carruthers already Jimmie Dale stepped quickly forward and then Jimmie Dale met the old man s eyes It wasn t from Carruthers it was from HER The same shuffer brought it Master Jim said Jason Jimmie Dale snatched the envelope from the tray and waved the other from the room As the door closed he tore open the letter There was just a single line Jimmie Jimmie you haven t failed have you Jimmie Dale stared at it Failed Failed HER The haggard look was in his face again It was the bond between them that was at stake the Gray Seal the bond that had come he knew for all time in that instant to mean his life God knows he muttered hoarsely and flung himself into a lounging chair still staring at the note The hours dragged by Luncheon time arrived and passed and then by special messenger the little package from Carruthers came Jimmie Dale started to undo the string then laid the package down and held out his hands before him for inspection They were trembling visibly It was a strange condition for Jimmie Dale either to witness or experience unlike him foreign to him This won t do Jimmie he said grimly shaking his head He picked up the package again opened it and from between two pieces of cardboard took out a large photographic print A moment two Jimmie Dale examined it used the magnifying glass again and then a strange gleam came into the dark eyes and his lips moved I ve won said Jimmie Dale with ominous softness I ve WON He was standing beside the rosewood desk and he reached for the phone Carruthers would be at home now he called Carruthers there After a moment or two he got the connection This is Jimmie Carruthers he said Yes I got it Thanks Yes Listen I want you to get Inspector Clayton and bring him up here at once What No no no How Why er tell him you re going to run a full page of him in the Sunday edition and you want him to sit for a sketch He d go anywhere for that Yes Half an hour YES Good bye Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver and hastily now began to write upon a pad that lay before him on the desk The minutes passed As he wrote he scored out words and lines here and there substituting others At the end he had covered three large pages with to any one but himself an indecipherable scrawl These he shoved aside now and very carefully very legibly made a copy on fresh sheets As he finished he heard a car draw up in front of the house Jimmie Dale folded the copied sheets neatly tucked them in his pocket lighted a cigarette and was lolling lazily in his chair as Jason announced mister Carruthers sir and another gentleman to see you Show them up Jason instructed Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale rose from his chair as they came in Jason well trained servant closed the door behind them Hello Carruthers hello inspector said Jimmie Dale pleasantly and waved them to seats Take this chair Carruthers He motioned to one at his elbow Glad to see you inspector try that one in front of the desk you ll find it comfortable Carruthers trying to catch Jimmie Dale s eye for some sort of a cue and failing sat down Inspector Clayton stared at Jimmie Dale Oh it s YOU eh His eyes roved around the room fastened for an instant on some of Jimmie Dale s work on an easel came back finally to Jimmie Dale and he plumped himself down in the chair indicated Thought you was more n a cub reporter he remarked with a grin You were too slick with your pencil Pretty fine studio you got here Carruthers says you re going to draw me Jimmie Dale smiled not pleasantly and leaned suddenly over the desk Yes he said slowly a grim intonation in his voice going to draw you TRUE TO LIFE With an exclamation Clayton slued around in his chair half rose and his shifty eyes small and cunning bored into Jimmie Dale s face What d ye mean by that he snapped out Just exactly what I say replied Jimmie Dale curtly No more no less But first not to be too abrupt I want to join with the newspapers in congratulating you on the remarkable shall I call it celerity or acumen with which you solved the mystery of Metzer s death and placed the murderer behind the bars It is really remarkable inspector so remarkable in fact that it s almost SUSPICIOUS Don t you think so No Well that s what mister Carruthers was good enough to bring you up here to talk over in an intimate and confidential way you know Inspector Clayton surged up from his chair to his feet his fists clenched the red sweeping over his face and then he shook one fist at Carruthers So that s your game is it he stormed Trying to crawl out of that twenty five thousand reward eh And as for you he turned on Jimmie Dale you ve rigged up a nice little plant between you eh Well it won t work and I ll make you squirm for this both of you damn you before I m through He glared from one to the other for a moment then swung on his heel Good afternoon gentlemen he sneered as he started for the door He was halfway across the room before Jimmie Dale spoke Clayton Clayton turned Jimmie Dale was still leaning over the desk but now one elbow was propped upon it and in the most casual way a revolver covered Inspector Clayton If you attempt to leave this room said Jimmie Dale without raising his voice I assure you that I shall fire with as little compunction as though I were aiming at a mad dog and I apologise to all mad dogs for coupling your name with them His voice rang suddenly cold Come back here and sit down in that chair The colour ebbed slowly from Clayton s face He hesitated then sullenly retraced his steps hesitated again as he reached the chair and finally sat down What what d ye mean by this he stammered trying to bluster Just this said Jimmie Dale That I accuse you of the murder of Jake Metzer IT WAS YOU WHO MURDERED METZER Good God burst suddenly from Carruthers You lie yelled Clayton and again he surged up from his chair That is what Stace Morse said said Jimmie Dale coolly Sit down Then Clayton tried to laugh You re you re having a joke ain t you It was Stace I can prove it Come down to headquarters and I can prove it I got the goods on him all the way I tell you his voice rose shrilly it was Stace Morse You are a despicable hound said Jimmie Dale through set lips Here he handed the revolver over to Carruthers keep him covered Carruthers You re going to the CHAIR for this Clayton he said in a fierce monotone The chair You can t send another there in your place this time Shall I draw you now true to life You ve been grafting for years on every disreputable den in your district Metzer was going to show you up and so Metzer being in the road you removed him And you seized on the fact of Stace Morse having paid a visit to him this afternoon to fix the crime on Stace Morse Proofs Oh yes I know you ve manufactured proofs enough to convict him if there weren t stronger proofs to convict YOU Convict ME Clayton s lower jaw hung loosely but still he made an effort at bluster You haven t a thing on me not a thing not a thing Jimmie Dale smiled again unpleasantly You are quite wrong Clayton See here He took a sheet of paper from the drawer of his desk Clayton reached for it quickly What is it he demanded Jimmie Dale drew it back out of reach Just a minute he said softly You remember don t you that in the presence of Carruthers here of myself and of half a dozen reporters you stated that you had been alone with Metzer in his room at three o clock yesterday and that it was you alone who found the body later on at nine o clock Yes I mention this simply to show that from your own lips the evidence is complete that you had an OPPORTUNITY to commit the crime Now you may look at this Clayton He handed over the sheet of paper Clayton took it stared at it turning it over from first one side to the other Then a sort of relief seemed to come to him and he gulped Nothing but a damned piece of blank paper he mumbled Jimmie Dale reached over and took back the sheet You re wrong again Clayton he said calmly It WAS quite blank before I handed it to you but not now I noticed yesterday that your hands were generally moist I am sure they are more so now excitement you know Carruthers see that he doesn t interrupt From a drawer Jimmie Dale took out a little black bottle the notebook he had used the day before and the photograph Carruthers had sent him On the sheet of paper Clayton had just handled Jimmie Dale sprinkled a little powder from the bottle Lampblack explained Jimmie Dale He shook the paper carefully allowing the loose powder to fall on the desk blotter and held out the sheet toward Clayton Rather neat isn t it A very good impression too Your thumb print Clayton Now don t move You may look not touch He laid the paper down on the desk in front of Clayton Beside it he placed the notebook open at the sketch a black thumb print now upon it You recall handling this yesterday I m sure Clayton I tried the same experiment with the lampblack on it this morning you see And this beside the notebook he placed the police photograph that too in its enlargement showed sharply defined a thumb print on a diamond shaped background You will no doubt recognise it as an official photograph enlarged taken of the gray seal on Metzer s forehead AND THE THUMB PRINT OF METZER S MURDERER You have only to glance at the little scar at the edge of the centre loop to satisfy yourself that the three are identical Of course there are a dozen other points of similarity equally indisputable but Jimmie Dale stopped Clayton was on his feet rocking on his feet His face was deathlike in its pallor Moisture was oozing from his forehead I didn t do it I didn t do it he cried out wildly My God I tell you I DIDN T do it and and that would send me to the chair Yes said Jimmie Dale coldly and that s precisely where you re going to the chair The man was beside himself now racked to the soul by a paroxysm of fear I m innocent innocent he screamed out Oh for God s sake don t send an innocent man to his death It WAS Stace Morse Listen Listen I ll tell the truth He was clawing with his hands piteously over the desk at Jimmie Dale When the big rewards came out last week I stole one of the gray seals from the bunch at headquarters to to use it the first time any crime was committed when I was sure I could lay my hands on the man who did it Don t you see Of course he d deny he was the Gray Seal just as he d deny that he was guilty but I d have the proof both ways and and I d collect the rewards and and The man collapsed into the chair Carruthers was up from his seat his hands gripping tight on the edge of the desk as he leaned over it Jimmie Jimmie what does this mean he gasped out Jimmie Dale smiled pleasantly now That he has told the truth said Jimmie Dale quietly It is quite true that Stace Morse committed the murder Shows up the value of circumstantial evidence though doesn t it This would certainly have got him off and convicted Clayton here before any jury in the land But the point is Carruthers that Stace Morse ISN T the Gray Seal and that the Gray Seal is NOT a murderer Clayton looked up You you believe me he stammered eagerly Jimmie Dale whirled on him in a sudden sweep of passion NO you cur he flashed It s not you I believe I simply wanted your confession before witnesses He whipped the three written sheets from his pocket Here substantially is that confession written out He passed it to Carruthers Read it to him Carruthers Carruthers read it aloud Now said Jimmie Dale grimly this spells ruin for you Clayton You don t deserve a chance to escape prison bars but I m going to give you one for you re going to get it pretty stiff anyhow If you refuse to sign this I ll hand you over to the district attorney in half an hour and Carruthers and I will swear to your confession on the other hand if you sign it Carruthers will not be able to print it until to morrow morning and that gives you something like fourteen hours to put distance between yourself and New York Here is a pen if you are quick enough to take us by surprise once you have signed you might succeed in making a dash for that door and effecting your escape without forcing us to compound a felony understand Clayton s hand trembled violently as he seized the pen He scrawled his name looked from one to the other wet his lips and then taking Jimmie Dale at his word rushed for the door and the door slammed behind him Carruthers face was hard What did you let him go for Jimmie he said uncompromisingly Selfishness Pure selfishness said Jimmie Dale softly They d guy me unmercifully if they ever heard of it at the saint James Club The honour is all yours Carruthers I don t appear on the stage That s understood Yes Well then he handed over the signed confession is the scoop big enough Carruthers fingered the sheets but his eyes in a bewildered way searched Jimmie Dale s face Big enough he echoed as though invoking the universe It s the biggest thing the newspaper game has ever known But how did you come to do it What started you Where did you get your lead Why from you I guess Carruthers Jimmie Dale answered thoughtfully with artfully puckered brow I remembered that you had said last week that the Gray Seal never left finger marks on his work and I saw one on the seal on Metzer s forehead Then you know I lifted one corner where the seal overlapped a thread of blood and underneath the thread of blood wasn t in the slightest disturbed so of course I knew the seal had been put on quite a long time after the man was dead not until the blood had dried thoroughly to a crust you know so that even the damp surface of the sticky side of the seal hadn t affected it And then I took a dislike to Clayton somehow and put two and two together and took a flyer in getting him to handle the notebook I guess that s all no other reason on earth Jolly lucky don t you think Carruthers didn t say anything for a moment When he spoke it was irrelevantly You saved me twenty five thousand dollars on that reward Jimmie That s the only thing I regret said Jimmie Dale brightly It wasn t nice of you Carruthers to turn on the Gray Seal that way And it strikes me you owe the chap whoever he is a pretty emphatic exoneration after what you said in this morning s edition Jimmie said Carruthers earnestly You know what I thought of him before It s like a new lease of life to get back one s faith in him You leave it to me I ll put the Gray Seal on a pedestal to morrow that will be worthy of the immortals you leave it to me And Carruthers kept his word Also before the paper had been an hour off the press Carruthers received a letter It thanked Carruthers quite genuinely even if couched in somewhat facetious terms for his sweeping vindication twitted him gently for his backsliding begged to remain his gratefully and in lieu of signature there was a gray coloured piece of paper shaped like this Picture Only there were no fingerprints on it CHAPTER III THE MOTHER LODE It was the following evening and they had dined together again at the saint James Club Jimmie Dale and Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS From Clayton and a discussion of the Metzer murder the conversation had turned not illogically upon the physiognomy of criminals in general Jimmie Dale lazily ensconced now in a lounging chair in one of the club s private library rooms flicked a minute speck of cigar ash from the sleeve of his dinner jacket and smiled whimsically across the table at his friend Oh I dare say there s a lot in physiognomy Carruthers he drawled Never studied the thing you know that is from the standpoint of crime Personally I ve only got one prejudice I distrust on principle the man who wears a perennial and pompous smirk which isn t of course strictly speaking physiognomy at all You see a man can t help his eyes being beady or his nose pronounced but pomposity and a smirk now Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders Carruthers laughed and then glanced ludicrously at Jimmie Dale as the door ajar was pushed open and a man entered Speaking of angels murmured Jimmie Dale and sat up in his chair Hello Markel he observed casually You ve met Carruthers of the NEWS ARGUS haven t you Markel was fat and important he had beady black eyes fastidiously trimmed whiskers and a pronounced smirk Markel blew his nose vigorously coughed asthmatically and held out his hand Of course certainly said he effusively I ve met Carruthers several times used his sheet more than once to advertise a new bond flotation The dominant note in Markel s voice was an ingratiating and unpleasant whine and Carruthers nodded not very cordially and shook hands Markel went back to the door closed it carefully and returned to the table Fact is he smiled confidentially I saw you two come in here a few minutes ago and I ve got something that I thought Carruthers might be glad to have for his society column say in the Sunday edition He dove into the inside pocket of his coat produced a large morocco leather jeweller s case and holding it out over the table between Carruthers and Jimmie Dale suddenly snapped the cover open and then with a complacent little chuckle that terminated in another fit of coughing spilled the contents on the table under the electric reading lamp Like a thing of living pulsing fire it rolled before their eyes a magnificent diamond necklace of wondrous beauty gleaming and scintillating as the light rays shot back from a thousand facets For a moment both men gazed at it without a word Little surprise for my wife volunteered Markel with a debonair wave of his pudgy hand and trying to make his voice sound careless The case lay open patently displaying the name of the most famous jewelry house in America Jimmie Dale s eyes fixed on Markel s whiskers where they were brushed outward in an ornate and fastidious gray black sweep By Jove he commented You don t do things by halves do you Markel Two hundred and ten thousand dollars I paid for that little bunch of gewgaws said Markel waving his hand again Then he clapped Carruthers heartily on the shoulder What do you think of it Carruthers eh Say a photograph of it and one of missus Markel eh Please her you know she s crazy on this society stunt all flubdub to me of course How s it strike you Carruthers Carruthers very evidently liked neither the man nor his manners but Carruthers above everything else was a gentleman To be perfectly frank with you mister Markel he said a little frigidly I don t believe in this sort of thing It s all right from a newspaper standpoint and we do it but it s just in this way that owners of valuable jewelry lay themselves open to theft It simply amounts to advising every crook in the country that you have a quarter of a million at his disposal which he can carry away in his vest pocket once he can get his hands on it and you invite him to try Jimmie Dale laughed What Carruthers means Markel is that you ll have the Gray Seal down your street Carruthers talks of crooks generally but he thinks in terms of only one He can t help it He s been trying so long to catch the chap that it s become an obsession Eh Carruthers Carruthers smiled seriously Perhaps he admitted I hope though for mister Markel s sake that the Gray Seal won t take a fancy to it if he does mister Markel can say good bye to his necklace Pouf coughed Markel arrogantly Overrated His cleverness is all in the newspaper columns If he knows what s good for him he ll know enough to leave this alone Jimmie Dale was leaning over the table poking gingerly with the tip of his forefinger at the centre stone in the setting revolving it gently to and fro in the light a very large stone whose weight would hardly be less than fifteen carats Jimmie Dale lowered his head for a closer examination and to hide a curious mocking little gleam that crept into his dark eyes Yes I should say you re right Markel he agreed judicially He ought to know better than to touch this It it would be too hard to dispose of I m not worrying declared Markel importantly No said Jimmie Dale Two hundred and ten thousand you said Any special er significance to the occasion if the question s not impertinent Birthday wedding anniversary or something like that No nothing like that Markel grinned winked secretively and rubbed his hands together I m feeling good that s all I m going to make the killing of my life to morrow Oh said Jimmie Dale Markel turned to Carruthers I ll let you in on that too Carruthers in a day or two if you ll send a reporter around financial man you know It ll be worth your while And now how about this What do you say to a little article and the photos next Sunday There was a slight hint of rising colour in Carruthers face If you ll send them to the society editor I ve no doubt he ll be able to use them he said brusquely Right said Markel and coughed and patted Carruthers shoulder patronisingly again I ll just do that little thing He picked up the necklace dangled it till it flashed and flashed again under the light then restored it very ostentatiously to its case and the case to his pocket Thanks awfully Carruthers he said as he rose from his chair See you again Dale Good night Carruthers glared at the door as it closed behind the man Say it prodded Jimmie Dale sweetly Don t feel restrained because you are a guest I absolve you in advance Rotter said Carruthers Well said Jimmie Dale softly You see Carruthers Carruthers match crackled savagely as he lighted a cigar Yes I see he growled But I don t see you ll pardon my saying so how vulgarity like that ever acquired membership in the saint James Club Carruthers said Jimmie Dale plaintively you ought to know better than that You know to begin with since it seems he has advertised with you that he runs some sort of brokerage business in Boston He s taken a summer home up here on Long Island and some misguided chap put him on the club s visitor s list His card will NOT be renewed Sleek customer isn t he Trifle familiar I was only introduced to him last night Carruthers grunted broke his burned match into pieces and began to toss the pieces into an ash tray Jimmie Dale became absorbed in an inspection of his hands those wonderful hands with long slim tapering fingers whose clean pink flesh masked a strength and power that was like to a steel vise Jimmie Dale looked up Going to print a nice little story for him about the costliest and most beautiful necklace in America he inquired innocently Carruthers scowled No he said bluntly I am not He ll read the NEWS ARGUS a long time before he reads anything about that Jimmie But therein Carruthers was wrong the NEWS ARGUS carried the story of Markel s diamond necklace in three inch caps in red ink on the front page in the next morning s edition and Carruthers gloated over it because the morning NEWS ARGUS was the ONLY paper in New York that did Carruthers was to hear more of Markel and Markel s necklace than he thought though for the time being the subject dropped between the two men It was still early barely ten o clock when Carruthers left the club and preferring to walk to the newspaper offices refused Jimmie Dale s offer of his limousine It was but five minutes later when Jimmie Dale after chatting for a moment or two with those about in the lobby in turn sought the coat room where Markel was being assisted into his coat Getting home early aren t you Markel remarked Jimmie Dale pleasantly Yes said Markel and ran his fingers fussily comb fashion through his whiskers Quite a little run out to my place you know and with you know what I don t care to be out too late No of course concurred Jimmie Dale getting into his own coat They walked out of the club together and Markel climbed importantly into the tonneau of a big gray touring car Ah home Peters he sniffed at his chauffeur and then with a grandiloquent wave of his hand to Jimmie Dale Night Dale Jimmie Dale smiled with his eyes which were hidden by the brim of his hat Good night Markel he replied and the smile crept curiously to the corners of his mouth as he watched the gray car disappear down the street A limousine drew up and Benson Jimmie Dale s chauffeur opened the door Home mister Dale he asked cheerily touching his cap Yes Benson home said Jimmie Dale absently and stepped into the car It was a luxurious car as everything that belonged to Jimmie Dale was luxurious and he leaned back luxuriously on the cushions extended his legs luxuriously to their full length plunged his hands into his overcoat pockets and then a change stole strangely slowly over Jimmie Dale The sensitive fingers of his right hand in the pocket had touched and now played delicately over a sealed envelope that they had found there played over it as though indeed by the sense of touch alone they could read the contents and he drew his body gradually erect It was another of those mysterious missives from HER The texture of the paper was invariably the same like this one How had it come there Collusion with the coat boy at the club That was hardly probable Perhaps it had been there before he had entered the club for dinner he remembered now that there had been several people passing and that he had been jostled slightly in crossing the sidewalk What however did it matter It was there mysteriously as scores of others had come to him mysteriously with never a clew to her identity to the identity of his he smiled a little grimly accomplice in crime He took the envelope from his pocket and stared at it His fingers had not been at fault it was one of hers The faint elusive exquisite fragrance of some rare perfume came to him as he held it I d give said Jimmie Dale wistfully to himself I d give everything I own to know who you are and some day please God I will know Jimmie Dale tore the envelope very gently as though the tearing almost were an act of desecration and extracted the letter from within He began to read aloud hurriedly and in snatches DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK Charleton Park Manor Markel s house is the second one from the gates on the right hand side library leads off reception hall on left door opposite staircase telephone in reception hall near vestibule entrance left hand side safe is one of your father s make No fourteen thousand three hundred twenty one clothes closet behind the desk probably will be kept in cash box five servants two men three maids quarters on top story Markel and wife occupy room over library French windows to dining room on opposite side of the house opening on the lawn get it TO NIGHT Jimmie TO MORROW WOULD BE TOO LATE dispose of it see fit Henry Wilbur Marshall Building Broadway fifth story Through the glass panelled front of the car Jimmie Dale could see his chauffeur s back and the hand that held the letter dropped now to his side and Jimmie Dale stared at his chauffeur s back Then presently he read the letter again as though committing it to memory now and then tearing the paper into tiny shreds as he did with every one of her communications he reached out of the window and allowed the little pieces to filter gradually from his hand The Gray Seal He smiled in his whimsical way If it were ever known He Jimmie Dale with his social standing his wealth his position the Gray Seal Not a police official not a secret service bureau probably in the civilised world but knew the name not a man woman or child certainly in this great city around him but to whom it was as familiar as their own Danger Yes A battle of wits Yes His against everybody s even against Carruthers his old college chum For even as a reporter before he had risen to the editorial desk and even now that he had Carruthers had been one of the keenest on the scent of the Gray Seal Danger Yes But it was worth it Worth it a thousand times for the very lure of the danger itself but worth it most of all for his association with her who by some amazing means verging indeed on the miraculous came into touch with all these things and supplied him with the data on which to work that always some wrong might be righted or gladness come where there had been gloom before or hope where there had been despair that into some fellow human s heart should come a gleam of sunshine Yes in spite of the howls of the police the virulent diatribes of the press an angry public screaming for his arrest conviction and punishment there were those perhaps who even on their bended knees at night asked God s blessing on the Gray Seal Was it strange then after all that the police seeking a clew through motive should have been driven to frenzy on every occasion in finding themselves forever confronted with what from every angle they were able to view it was quite a purposeless crime On one point only they were right the old dogma the old old cry old as the institution of police older than that old since time immemorial CHERCHEZ LA FEMME Quite right but also quite purposeless Jimmie Dale s eyes grew wistful He had been hunting for the woman in the case himself now for months and years indefatigably using every resource at his command quite purposelessly Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders Why go over all this to night there were other things to do She had come to him again and this time with a matter that entailed more than ordinary difficulty more than usual danger that would tax his wits and his skill to the utmost not only to succeed but to get out of it himself with a whole skin Markel eh Jimmie Dale leaned back in his seat clasped his hands behind his head and his eyes half closed now were studying Benson s back again through the plate glass front He was still sitting in that position as the car approached his residence on Riverside Drive but as it came to a stop and Benson opened the door it was a very alert Jimmie Dale that stepped to the sidewalk Benson he said crisply I am going downtown again later on but I shall drive myself Bring the touring car around and leave it in front of the house I ll run it into the garage when I get back you need not wait up Very good sir said Benson In the hallway Jason the butler who had been butler to Jimmie Dale s father before him took Jimmie Dale s hat and coat It s a fine evening Master Jim said the privileged old man affectionately Jimmie Dale took out his silver cigarette case selected a cigarette tapped it daintily on the cover of the case and accepted the match the old man hastily produced Yes Jason said Jimmie Dale pleasantly facetious it a fine night a glorious night moon and stars and a balmy breeze quite too fine indeed to remain indoors In fact you might lay out my gray ulster I think I will go for a spin presently when I have changed Yes sir said Jason Anything else Master Jim No that s all Jason Don t sit up for me you may go to bed now Thank you sir said the old man Jimmie Dale went upstairs opened the door of his own particular den on the right of the landing stepped inside closed the door switched on the light and Jimmie Dale s debonair nonchalance dropped from him as a mask instantly and it was another Jimmie Dale the professional Jimmie Dale Quick now in every action he swung aside the portiere that curtained off the squat barrel shaped safe in the little alcove opened the safe took out that curious leather girdle with its kit of burglar s tools added to it a flashlight and an automatic revolver closed the safe and passed into his dressing room Here he proceeded to divest himself rapidly of his evening clothes selecting in their stead a suit of dark tweed He heard Jason come up the stairs pass along the hall and mount the second flight to his own quarters and presently came the sound of an automobile without The dressing room fronted on the Drive Jimmie Dale looked out Benson was just getting out of the touring car Slipping the leather girdle then around his waist Jimmie Dale put on his vest then his coat and walked briskly downstairs Jason had laid out a gray ulster on the hall stand Jimmie Dale put it on selected a leather cap with motor goggle attachment that pulled down almost to the tip of his nose tucked a slouch hat into the pocket of the ulster and leaving the house climbed into his car He glanced at his watch as he started it was a quarter of eleven Jimmie Dale s lips pursed a little I guess it ll make a night of it and a tight squeeze at that to get back under cover before daylight he muttered I ll have to do some tall speeding But at first across the city and through Brooklyn for all his impatience it was necessarily slow after that Jimmie Dale took chances and once on the country roads of Long Island the big powerful car tore through the night like a greyhound whose leash is slipped A half hour passed Jimmie Dale s eyes shifting occasionally from the gray thread of road ahead of him under the glare of the dancing lamps to the road map spread out at his feet upon which from time to time he focused his pocket flashlight And then finally he slowed the car to a snail s pace he should be very near his destination that very ultra exclusive subdivision of Charleton Park Manor On either side of the road now was quite a thickly set stretch of wooded land rising slightly on the right and this Jimmie Dale scrutinised sharply In fact he stopped for an instant as he came opposite to a wagon track it seemed to be little more than that that led in through the trees If it s not too far from the seat of war commented Jimmie Dale to himself as he went on again it will do admirably And then a hundred yards farther on Jimmie Dale nodded his head in satisfaction he was passing the rather ornate stone pillars that marked the entrance to Charleton Park Manor and on which the initial promoters of the subdivision the real estate people had evidently deemed it good advertising policy to expend a small fortune Another hundred yards farther on Jimmie Dale turned his car around and returned past the gates to the wagon track again The road was deserted not a car nor a vehicle of any description was in sight Jimmie Dale made sure of that and in another instant Jimmie Dale s own car every light extinguished had vanished he had backed it up the wagon track just far enough in for the trees to screen it thoroughly from the main road Nor did Jimmie Dale himself appear again on the main road until just as he emerged close to the gates of Charleton Park Manor from a short cut through the woods Also he was without his ulster now and the slouch hat had replaced the motor cap Jimmie Dale in the moonlight took stock of his surroundings as he passed in at a businesslike walk through the gates It was a large park if that name could properly be applied to it at all and the houses he caught sight of one set back from the driveway on the right were quite far apart each in its own rather spacious grounds among the trees The second house on the right her letter had said Jimmie Dale had already passed the first one the next would be Markel s then and it loomed ahead of him now black and shadowy and unlighted Jimmie Dale shot a glance around him there was stillness quiet everywhere no sign of life no sound Jimmie Dale s face became tense his lips tight and he stepped suddenly from the sidewalk in among the trees They were not thick here of course the trees and the turf beneath his feet was well kept and therefore soundless He moved quickly now but cautiously from tree to tree for the moonlight flooding the lawn and house threw all objects into bold relief A minute two three went by and a shadow flitted here and there across the light green sward like the moving of the trees swaying in the breeze and then Jimmie Dale was standing close up against one side of the house hidden by the protecting black shadows of the walls But here for a moment Jimmie Dale seemed little occupied with the house itself he was staring down past its length to where the woods made a heavy dark background at the rear Then he turned his head to face directly to the main road then back again slowly as though measuring an angle Jimmie Dale had no intention of making his escape by the roundabout way in which he had been forced to come in order to make certain of locating the right house the second one from the gates and he was getting the bearings of his car and the wagon track now I guess that ll be about right Jimmie Dale muttered finally And now for He slipped along the side of the house and halted where almost on a level with the ground the French windows of the dining room opened on the lawn Jimmie Dale tried them gently They were locked An indulgent smile crept to Jimmie Dale s lips and his hand crept in under his vest It came out again not empty and Jimmie Dale leaned close against the window There was a faint almost inaudible scratching sound then a slight brittle crack and Jimmie Dale laid a neat little four inch square of glass on the ground at his feet Through the aperture he reached in his hand turned the key that was in the lock turned the bolt rod handle pushed the doors silently open wide open left them open and stepped into the room He could see quite well within thanks to the moonlight Jimmie Dale produced a black silk mask from one of the little leather pockets adjusted it carefully over his face and crossed the room to the hall door He opened this wide open left it open and entered the hall Here it was dark a pitch blackness He stood for a moment listening utter silence And then alert strained tense in an instant Jimmie Dale crouched against the wall and then he smiled a little grimly It was only some one coughing upstairs Markel in his sleep perhaps or perhaps in wakefulness I m a fool confided Jimmie Dale to himself as he recognised the cough that he had heard at the club

none	none	I don t know One s nerves get sort of taut Pretty stiff business If I m ever caught the penitentiary sentence I get will be the smallest part of what s to pay A round button of light played along the wall from the flashlight in his hand just for an instant and all was blackness again But in that instant Jimmie Dale was across the hall and his fingers were tracing the telephone connection from the instrument to where the wires disappeared in the baseboard of the floor Another instant and he had severed the wires with a pair of nippers Again the quick firefly gleam of light to locate the stair case and the library door opposite to it and moving without the slightest noise Jimmie Dale s hand was on the door itself Again he paused to listen All was silence now The door swung under his hand and left open behind him he was in the room The flashlight winked once suspiciously Then he snapped its little switch keeping the current on and the ray dodged impudently here and there all over the apartment The safe was set in a sort of clothes closet behind the desk she had said Yes there it was the door at least Jimmie Dale moved toward it and paused as his light swept the top of the intervening desk A mass of papers books and correspondence littered it untidily The yellow sheet of a telegram caught Jimmie Dale s eye He picked it up and glanced at it It read Vein uncovered to day Undoubtedly mother lode Enormously rich Put the screws on at once THURL Under the mask Jimmie Dale s lips twitched I think Markel you miserable hound said he softly that God will forgive me for depriving you of a share of the profits Two hundred and ten thousand I think it was you said the sparklers cost A curious little sound came from Jimmie Dale s lips like a chuckle Jimmie Dale tossed the telegram back on the desk moved on behind the desk opened the door of the closet that had been metamorphosed into a vault and the white light travelled slowly searchingly critically over the shining black enamelled steel the nickelled knobs and dials of a safe that confronted him Jimmie Dale nodded at it familiarly grimly It s number one four three two one all right he murmured And one of the best we ever made Pretty tough But I ve done it before Say half an hour of gentle persuasion It would be too bad to crack it with soup besides that s crude Carruthers would never forgive the Gray Seal for that The light went out blackness fell Jimmie Dale s slim sensitive fingers closed on the dial s knob his head touched the steel front of the safe as he pressed his ear against it for the tumblers fall And then silence It seemed to grow heavier that silence with each second to palpitate through the quiet house to grow pregnant premonitory of dread of fear it seemed to throb in long undulations and the stillness grew LOUD A moonbeam filtered in between the edge of the drawn shade and the edge of the window It struggled across the floor in a wavering path strayed over the desk and died away shadowy and formless against the blackness of the opened recess door against the blackness of the great steel safe the blackness of a huddled form crouched against it Only now and then in a strange projected wraithlike effect the moon ray glinted timidly on the tip of a nickel dial and ghostlike disclosed a human hand Upstairs Markel coughed again Then from the safe a whisper heavy breathed as from great exertion MISSED IT The dial whirled with faint musical little metallic clicks then began to move slowly again very very slowly The moonbeam as though petulant at its own abortive attempt to satisfy its curiosity retreated back across the floor and faded away Blackness

none	none	Then from the safe again but now in a low gasp a pant of relief Ah The ear might barely catch the sound it was as of metal sliding in well oiled grooves of metal meeting metal in a padded thud The massive door swung outward Jimmie Dale stood up easing his cramped muscles and flirted the sweat beads from his forehead After a moment he knelt again There was still the inner door but that was a minor matter to Jimmie Dale compared with what had gone before Stillness once more a long period of it And then again that cough from above a prolonged paroxysm of it this time that went racketing through the house Jimmie Dale in the act of swinging back the inner door of the safe paused to listen and little furrows under his mask gathered on his forehead The coughing stopped Jimmie Dale waited a moment still listening then his flashlight bored into the interior of the safe The cash box probably quoted Jimmie Dale beneath his breath and picked it up from where it lay in the bottom compartment of the safe The lock snipped under the insistent probe of a delicate little blued steel instrument and Jimmie Dale lifted the cover There was a package of papers and documents on top held together with elastic bands Jimmie Dale spent a moment or two examining these then his fingers dived down underneath and the next minute under the flashlight the morocco leather case open the diamond necklace was sparkling and flashing on its white satin bed A tempting little thing isn t it said Jimmie Dale gently It was really thoughtful of you Markel to buy that this afternoon Jimmie Dale replaced the necklace in the cash box set the cash box on the floor closed the inner door of the safe and swung the outer door a little inward but left it flauntingly ajar Then from a pocket of the leather girdle beneath his vest he produced his small thin flat metal case From this from between sheets of oil paper with the aid of a pair of tweezers he lifted out a gray diamond shaped seal Jimmie Dale was apparently fastidious He held the seal with the tweezers as he moistened the adhesive side with his tongue laid the seal on his handkerchief and pressed the handkerchief firmly against the safe as usual Jimmie Dale s insignia bore no finger prints as it lay neatly capping the knob of the dial He reached down picked up the cash box and then for the second time that night held suddenly tense alert listening his every muscle taut A door opened upstairs There came a murmur of voices Then a momentary lull Jimmie Dale listened Like a statue he stood there in the black absolutely motionless his head a little forward and to one side Nothing not a sound Then a very low curious swishing noise and a faint creak SOMEBODY WAS COMING DOWN THE STAIRS Jimmie Dale moved stealthily from the recess and noiselessly to the desk Very faintly but distinctly now came a pad of either slippered or bare feet on the stairway carpet Like a cat soundless in his movements Jimmie Dale crept toward the door of the room Down the stairs came that pad of feet occasionally came that swishing sound Nearer the door crept Jimmie Dale and his lips were thinned now his jaws clamped How near were they together he and this night prowler At times he could not hear the other at all and besides the heavy carpet made the judgment of distance an impossibility If he could gain the hall and in the darkness elude the other the way of escape through the dining room was open And then within a few feet of the door Jimmie Dale halted abruptly as a woman s voice rose querulously from the hallway above You are making a perfect fool of yourself Theodore Markel Come back here to bed Jimmie Dale s face hardened like stone the answer came almost from the very threshold in front of him I can t sleep I tell you it was Markel s voice in a disgruntled snarl I was a fool to bring the confounded thing home I m going to take the library couch for the rest of the night It happened quick then quick as the winking of an eye Two sharp almost simultaneous clicks of the electric light buttons pressed by Markel and the hall and library were a flood of light and Jimmie Dale leaped forward to where in dressing gown and pajamas blankets and bedding over one arm a revolver dangling in the other hand Markel stood full before the door in the hallway without There was a wild yell of terror and surprise from Markel then a deafening roar and a spit of flame from his revolver a bitter smothered exclamation from Jimmie Dale as the cash box crashed to the floor from his left hand and he was upon the other like a tiger With the impact both men went to the floor grappled and rolled over and over Half mad with fear shock and surprise Markel fought like a maniac and his voice in gasping shouts rang through the house A minute two passed and the men rolled about the hall floor Markel over middle age and unheathily fat against Jimmie Dale s six feet of muscle only Jimmie Dale s left hand dripping a red stream now was almost useless From above came wild confusion women s voices in little shrieks men s voices shouting in excitement doors opening running feet And then Jimmie Dale had snatched the revolver from the floor where Markel had dropped it in the scuffle and was pressing it against Markel s forehead and Markel terror stricken had collapsed in a flabby pliant heap Jimmie Dale still covering Markel with the weapon stood up The frightened faces of women protruded over the banisters above The two men servants at best none too enthusiastically on the way down stopped as though stunned as Jimmie Dale swung the revolver upon them Then Jimmie Dale spoke to Markel pointing the weapon at Markel again I don t like you Markel he said with cold impudence The only decent thing you ll ever do will be to die and if those men of yours on the stairs move another step it will be your death warrant Do you understand I would suggest that you request them to stay where they are Cold sweat was on Markel s face as he stared into the muzzle of the revolver and his teeth chattered Go back he screamed hysterically at the servants Go back Sit down Don t move Do what he tells you Thank you said Jimmie Dale grimly Now get up yourself Markel got up Jimmie Dale backed to the library door picked up the cash box tucked it under his left armpit and faced those on the stairs mister Markel and I are going out for a little walk he announced coolly If one of you make a move or raise an alarm before your master comes back I shall be obliged in self defence to shoot mister Markel mister Markel quite understands that I am sure Do you not mister Markel Helen screamed Markel to his wife don t let em move For God s sake do as he says Jimmie Dale s lips just showing beneath the edge of his mask broadened in a pleasant little smile Will you lead the way mister Markel he requested with ironic deference Through the dining room please Yes that s right Markel walked weakly into the dining room and Jimmie Dale followed A prod in the back from the revolver muzzle and Markel stepped through the French windows and out on the lawn Jimmie Dale faced the other toward the woods at the rear of the house Go on Jimmie Dale s voice was curt now uncompromising And step lively They passed on along the side of the house and in among the trees Fifty yards or so more and Jimmie Dale halted He backed Markel up against a large tree not over gently I I say Markel s teeth were going like castanets I You ll oblige me by keeping your mouth shut observed Jimmie Dale politely and he whipped the cord of Markel s dressing gown loose and began to tie the man to the tree You have many unpleasant characteristics Markel your voice is one of them Shall I repeat that I do not like you He stepped to the back of the tree Pardon me if I draw this uncomfortably tight I don t think you can reach around to the knot No The trunk is too large Quite so He stepped around to face Markel again the man was thoroughly frightened his face was livid his jaw sagged weakly and his eyes followed every movement of the revolver in Jimmie Dale s hand in a sort of miserable fascination Jimmie Dale smiled unhappily I am going to do something Markel that I should advise no other man to do I am going to put you on your honour For the next fifteen minutes you are not to utter a sound Do you understand Y yes said Markel hoarsely No said Jimmie Dale sadly I don think you do Let me be painfully explicit If you break your vow of silence by so much as a second then to morrow or the next day or the day after at my convenience Markel you and I will meet again for the LAST time There can be no possible misapprehension on your part now Markel N no Markel could scarcely chatter out the word Quite so said Jimmie Dale in velvet tones He stood for an instant looking at the other with cool insolence then Good night Markel and five minutes later a great touring car was tearing New Yorkward over the Long Island roads at express speed It was one o clock in the morning as Jimmie Dale swung the car into a cross street off lower Broadway and drew up at the curb beside a large office building He got out snuggled the cash box under his ulster went around to the Broadway entrance glanced up to note that a light burned in a fifth story window and entered the building The hallway was practically in darkness one or two incandescents only threw a dim light about Jimmie Dale stopped for a moment at the foot of the stairs beside the elevator well to listen if the watchman was making rounds it was in another part of the building Jimmie Dale began to climb He reached the fifth floor turned down the corridor and halted in front of a door through the ground glass panel of which a light glowed faintly as though coming from an inner office beyond Jimmie Dale drew the black silk mask from his pocket adjusted it tried the door found it unlocked opened it noiselessly and stepped inside Across the room through another door half open the light streamed into the outer office where Jimmie Dale stood Jimmie Dale stole across the room crouched by the door to look into the inner office and his face went suddenly rigid Good God he whispered As bad as that but it was a nonchalant Jimmie Dale to all outward appearances that on the instant stepped unconcernedly over the threshold An elderly man white haired kindly faced kindly eyed save now that the face was drawn and haggard the eyes full of weariness was standing behind a flat topped desk his fingers twitching nervously on a revolver in his hand He whirled with a startled cry at Jimmie Dale s entrance and the revolver clattered from his fingers to the floor I am afraid said Jimmie Dale smiling pleasantly that you were going to shoot yourself Your name is Wilbur Henry Wilbur isn t it Unmanned trembling the other stood and nodded mechanically It s really not a nice thing to do said Jimmie Dale confidentially Makes a mess you see too he was pulling off his motor gauntlet his ulster his jacket and having set the cash box on the desk was rolling back his sleeve as he spoke Had a little experience myself this evening He held out his hand that with the forearm was covered with blood A little above the wrist fortunately only a flesh wound a little memento from a chap named Markel and MARKEL The word burst quivering from the other s lips Yes said Jimmie Dale imperturbably Do you mind if I wash a bit and could you oblige me with a towel or something that would do for a bandage The man seemed dazed In a subconscious way he walked from the desk to a little cupboard and took out two towels Jimmie Dale stooped while the other s back was turned picked up the revolver from the floor and slipped it into his trousers pocket Markel said Wilbur again the same trembling anxiety in his voice as he handed Jimmie Dale the towels and motioned toward a washstand in the corner of the room Did you say Markel Theodore Markel Yes said Jimmie Dale examining his wound critically You had trouble a fight with him Is he he dead No said Jimmie Dale smiling a little grimly He s pretty badly hurt though I imagine but not in a physical way Strange whispered Wilbur in a numbed tone to himself and he went back and sank down in his desk chair Strange that you should speak of Markel strange that you should have come here to night Jimmie Dale did not answer He glanced now and then at the other as he deftly dressed his wrist the man seemed on the verge of collapse on the verge of a nervous breakdown Jimmie Dale swore softly to himself Wilbur was too old a man to be called upon to stand against the trouble and anxiety that was mirrored in the misery in his face that had brought him to the point of taking his own life Jimmie Dale put on his coat again walked over to the desk and picked up the phone If I may he inquired courteously and confided a number to the mouthpiece of the instrument There was a moment s wait during which Wilbur in a desperate sort of way seemed to be trying to rally himself to piece together a puzzle as it were and for the first time he appeared to take a personal interest in the masked figure that leaned against his desk He kept passing his hands across his eyes staring at Jimmie Dale Then Jimmie Dale spoke into the phone MORNING NEWS ARGUS office mister Carruthers please Thank you Another wait then Jimmie Dale s voice changed its pitch and register to a pleasant and natural though quite unrecognisable bass mister Carruthers Yes I thought it might interest you to know that mister Theodore Markel purchased a very valuable diamond necklace this afternoon Oh you knew that did you Well so much the better you ll be all the more keenly interested to know that it is no longer in his possession I beg pardon Oh yes I quite forgot this is the Gray Seal speaking Yes The Gray Seal I have just come from mister Markel s country house and if you hurry a man out there you ought to be able to give the public an exclusive bit of news a scoop I believe you call it you see mister Carruthers I am not ungrateful for I might say the eulogistic manner in which the MORNING NEWS ARGUS treated me in that last affair and I trust I shall be able to do you many more favours I am deeply in your debt And oh yes tell your reporter not to overlook the detail of mister Markel in his pajamas and dressing gown tied to a tree in his park mister Markel might be inclined to be reticent on that point and it would be a pity to deprive the public of any er atmosphere in the story you know What No I am afraid mister Markel s phone is er out of order Yes And by the way speaking of phones mister Carruthers between gentlemen I know you will make no effort under the circumstances to discover the number I am calling from Good night mister Carruthers Jimmie Dale hung the receiver abruptly on the hook You see said Jimmie Dale turning to Wilbur and then he stopped The man was on his feet swaying there his face positively gray My God Wilbur burst out What have you done A thousand times better if I had shot myself as I would have done in another moment if you had not come in I was only ruined then I am disgraced now You have robbed Markel s safe I am the one man in the world who would have a reason above all others for doing that and Markel knows it He will accuse me of it He can prove I had a motive I have not been home to night Nobody knows I am here I cannot prove an alibi What have you done Really said Jimmie Dale almost plaintively swinging himself up on the corner of the desk and taking the cash box on his knee really you are alarming yourself unnecessarily I But Wilbur stopped him You don t know what you are talking about Wilbur cried out in a choked way then his voice steadying he rushed on Listen I am a ruined man absolutely ruined And Markel has ruined me I did not see through his trick until too late Listen For years as a mining engineer I made a good salary and I saved it Two years ago I had nearly seventy thousand dollars it represented my life work I bought an abandoned mine in Alaska for next to nothing I was certain it was rich A man by the name of Thurl Jason T Thurl another mining engineer a steamer acquaintance was out there at the time he was a partner of Markel s though I didn t know it then I started to work the mine It didn t pan out I dropped nearly every cent Then I struck a small vein that temporarily recouped me and supplied the necessary funds with which to go ahead for a while Thurl who had tried to buy the mine out from under my option in the first place repeatedly then tried to buy it from me at a ridiculous figure I refused He persisted I refused I was confident I KNEW I had one of the richest properties in Alaska Wilbur paused A little row of glistening drops had gathered on his forehead Jimmie Dale balancing Markel s cash box on one knee drummed softly with his finger tips on the cover The vein petered out Wilbur went on But I was still confident I sank all the proceeds of the first strike and sank them fast for unaccountable accidents that crippled me both financially and in the progress of the work began to happen Wilbur flung out his hands impotently Oh it s a long story too long to tell Thurl was at the bottom of those accidents He knew as well as I did that the mine was rich better than I did for that matter for we discovered before we ran him out of Alaska that he had made secret borings on the property But what I did not know until a few hours ago was that he had actually uncovered what we uncovered only yesterday the mother lode He was driving me as fast as he could into the last ditch for Markel I didn t know until yesterday that Markel had any thing to do with it I struggled on out there hoping every day to open a new vein I raised money on everything I had except my insurance and the mine and sank it in the mine No one out there would advance me anything on a property that looked like a failure that had once already been abandoned I have always kept an office here and I came back East with the idea of raising something on my insurance Markel quite by haphazard as I then thought was introduced to me just before we left San Francisco on our way to New York On the run across the continent we became very friendly Naturally I told him my story He played sympathetic good fellow and offered to lend me fifty thousand dollars on a demand note I did not want to be involved for a cent more than was necessary and as I said I hoped from day to day to make another strike I refused to take more than ten thousand I remember now that he seemed strangely disappointed Again Wilbur stopped He swept the moisture from his forehead and his fist clenched came down upon the desk You see the game there was bitter anger in his voice now You see the game He wanted to get me in deep enough so that I couldn t wriggle out deeper than ten thousand that I could get at any time on my insurance he wanted me where I couldn t get away and he got me The first ten thousand wasn t enough I went to him for a second a third a fourth a fifth hoping always that each would be the last Each time a new note a demand note for the total amount was made cancelling the former one I didn t know his game didn t suspect it I blessed God for giving me such a friend until this or rather yesterday afternoon when I received a telegram from my manager at the mine saying that he had struck what looked like a very rich vein the mother lode And Wilbur s fist curled until the knuckles were like ivory in their whiteness he added in the telegram that Thurl had wired the news of the strike to a man in New York by the name of Markel Do you see I hadn t had the telegram five minutes when a messenger brought me a letter from Markel curtly informing me that I would have to meet my note to morrow morning I can t meet it He knew I couldn t With wealth in sight I m wiped out A DEMAND note a call loan do you understand and with a few months in which to develop the new vein I could pay it readily As it is I default the note Markel attaches all I have left which is the mine The mine is sold to satisfy my indebtedness Markel buys it in legally upheld by the law and acquires ROBS me of it and And so said Jimmie Dale musingly you were going to shoot yourself Wilbur straightened up and there was something akin to pathetic grandeur in the set of the old shoulders as they squared back Yes he said in a low voice And 
2416_152139_000059_000009	train-clean-100	shall I tell you 
none	none	why Even if which is not likely there was something reverting to me over the purchase price it would be a paltry thing compared with the mine I have a wife and children If I have worked for them all my life could I stand back now at the last and see them robbed of their inheritance by a black hearted scoundrel when I could still lift a hand to prevent it I had one way left What is my life I am too old a man to cling to it where they are concerned I have referred to my insurance several times I have always carried heavy insurance he smiled a little curious mirthless smile THAT HAS NO SUICIDE CLAUSE He swept his hand over the desk indicating the papers scattered there I have worked late to night getting my affairs in order My total insurance is fifty two thousand dollars though I couldn t BORROW anywhere near the full amount on it but at my death paid in full it would satisfy the note My executors by instruction would pay the note and no dollar from the mine no single grain of gold not an ounce of quartz would Markel ever get his hands on and my wife and children would be saved That is His words ended abruptly with a little gasp Jimmie Dale had opened the cash box and was dangling the necklace under the light a stream of fiery flashing sparkling gems Then Wilbur spoke again a hard bitter note in his voice pointing his hand at the necklace But now on top of everything you have brought me disgrace because you broke into his safe to night for THAT He would and will accuse me I have heard of you the Gray Seal you have done a pitiful night s work in your greed for that thing there For this Jimmie Dale smiled ironically holding the necklace up Then he shook his head I didn t break into Markel s safe for this it wouldn t have been worth while It s only paste PASTE exclaimed Wilbur in a slow way Paste said Jimmie Dale placidly dropping the necklace back into its case Quite in keeping with Markel isn t it to make a sensation on the cheap But that doesn t change matters Wilbur cried out sharply after a numbed instant s pause You still broke into the safe even if you didn t know then that the necklace was paste Ah but you see I did know then said Jimmie Dale softly I am really you must take my word for it a very good judge of stones and I had er seen these before Wilbur stared bewildered confused Then why what was it that A paper said Jimmie Dale with a little chuckle and produced it from the cash box It reads like this On demand I promise to pay My note It came in a great surging cry from Wilbur and he strained forward to read it Of course said Jimmie Dale Of course your note Did you think that I had just happened to drop in on you Now then see here you just buck up and er smile There isn t even a possibility of you being accused of the theft In the first place Markel saw quite enough of me to know that it wasn t you Secondly neither Markel nor any one else would ever dream that the break was made for anything else but the necklace with which you have no connection the papers were in the cash box and were just taken along with it Don t you see And besides the police with my very good friend Carruthers at their elbows will see very thoroughly to it that the Gray Seal gets full and ample credit for the crime But Jimmie Dale pulled out his watch and yawned under his mask it s getting to be an unconscionable hour and you ve still a letter to write A letter Wilbur s voice was broken his lips quivering To Markel said Jimmie Dale pleasantly Write him in reply to his letter of the afternoon and post it before you leave here just as though you had written it at once promptly on receipt of his He will still get it on the morning delivery State that you will take up the note immediately on presentation at whatever bank he chooses to name That s all Seeing that he hasn t got it he can t very well present it can he Eventually having er no use for fake diamonds I shall return the necklace together with the papers in his cash box here including your note Eventually Uncomprehendingly stumblingly Wilbur repeated the word In a month or two or three as the case may be explained Jimmie Dale brightly Whenever you insert a personal in the NEWS ARGUS to the effect that the mother lode has given you the cash to meet it He replaced the note in the cash box slipped down to his feet from the desk and then he choked a little Wilbur the tears streaming down his face unable to speak was holding out his hands to Jimmie Dale I er good night said Jimmie Dale hurriedly and stepped quickly from the room Halfway down the first flight of stairs he paused Steps running after him sounded along the corridor above and then Wilbur s voice Don t go not yet cried the old man I don t understand How did you know who told you about the note Jimmie Dale did not answer he went on noiselessly down the stairs His mask was off now and his lips curved into a strange little smile I wish I knew said Jimmie Dale wistfully to himself CHAPTER IV THE COUNTERFEIT FIVE It was still early in the evening but a little after nine o clock The Fifth Avenue bus wended its way jouncing its patrons particularly those on the top seats across town and turned into Riverside Drive A short distance behind the bus a limousine rolled down the cross street leisurely silently As the lights of passing craft on the Hudson and a myriad scintillating luminous points dotting the west shore came into view Jimmie Dale rose impulsively from his seat on the top of the bus descended the little circular iron ladder at the rear and dropped off into the street It was only a few blocks farther to his residence on the Drive and the night was well worth the walk besides restless disturbed and perplexed in mind the walk appealed to him He stepped across to the sidewalk and proceeded slowly along A month had gone by and he had not heard a word from HER The break on West Broadway the murder of Metzer in Moriarty s gambling hell the theft of Markel s diamond necklace had followed each other in quick succession and then this month of utter silence with no sign of her as though indeed she had never existed But it was not this temporary silence on her part that troubled Jimmie Dale now In the years that he had worked with this unknown mysterious accomplice of his whom he had never seen there had been longer intervals than a bare month in which he had heard nothing from her it was not that It was the failure total absolute and complete that was the only result for the month of ceaseless unremitting doggedly expended effort even as it had been the result many times before in an attempt to solve the enigma that was so intimate and vital a factor in his own life If he might lay any claims to cleverness his resourcefulness at least he was forced to admit was no match for hers She came she went without being seen and behind her remained instead of clews to her identity only an amazing intangible mystery that left him at times appalled and dismayed How did she know about those conditions in West Broadway how did she know about Metzer s murder how did she know about Markel and Wilbur how did she know about a hundred other affairs of the same sort that had happened since that night years ago now when out of pure adventure he had tampered with Marx s the jeweller s strong room in Maiden Lane and she had mysteriously then too solved HIS identity discovered him to be the Gray Seal Jimmie Dale wrapped up in his own thoughts entirely oblivious to his surroundings traversed another block There had never been since the world began and there would never be again so singular and bizarre a partnership as this of hers and his He Jimmie Dale with his strange double life one of New York s young bachelor millionaires one whose social status was unquestioned and she who who WHAT That was just it Who what What was she What was her name What one personal intimate thing did he know about her And what was to be the end Not that he would have severed his association with her not for worlds though every time that by some new and curious method one of her letters found its way into his hands outlining some fresh coup for him to execute his peril and danger of discovery was increased in staggering ratio To day the police hunted the Gray Seal as they hunted a mad dog the papers stormed and raved against him in every detective bureau of two continents he was catalogued as the most notorious criminal of the age and yet strange paradox no single crime had ever been committed Jimmie Dale s strong fine featured face lighted up Crime Thanks to her there were those who blessed the name of the Gray Seal those into whose lives had come joy relief from misery escape from death even and their blessings were worth a thousandfold the risk and peril of disaster that threatened him at every minute of the day Thank God for her murmured Jimmie Dale softly But but if I could only find her see her know who she is talk to her and hear her voice Then he smiled a little wanly It s been a pretty tough month and nothing to show for it It had It had been one of the hardest months through which Jimmie Dale had ever lived The saint James that most exclusive club his favourite haunt had seen nothing of him the easel in his den that was his hobby had been untouched there had been days even when he had not crossed the threshold of his home Every resource at his command he had called into play in an effort to solve the mystery For nearly the entire month following first this lead and then that he had lived in the one disguise that he felt confident she knew nothing of that was or rather had become almost a dual personality with him From the Sanctuary that miserable and disreputable room in a tenement on the East Side a tenement that had three separate means of entrance and exit he had emerged day after day as Larry the Bat a character as well known and as well liked in the exclusive circles of the underworld as was Jimmie Dale in the most exclusive strata of New York s society and fashion And it had been useless all useless Through his own endeavours through the help of his friends of the underworld the lives of half a dozen men Bert Hagan s on West Broadway for instance Markel s and others had been laid bare to the last shred but nowhere could be found the one vital point that linked their lives with hers that would account for her intimate knowledge of them and so furnish him with the clew that would then with certainty lead him to a solution of her identity It was baffling puzzling unbelievable bordering indeed on the miraculous herself everything about her her acts her methods her cleverness intangible in one sense were terrifically real in another

none	none	The miraculous and this practical everyday life were wide and far apart There was nothing miraculous about it it was only that the key to it was so far beyond his reach And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders in consonance with a whimsical change in both mood and thought Larry the Bat is a hard taskmaster he muttered facetiously I m afraid I m not very presentable this evening no bath this morning and no shave and after nearly a month of make up that beastly grease paint gets into the skin creases in a most intimate way He chuckled as the thought of old Jason his butler came to him I saw Jason torn between two conflicting emotions shaking his head over the black circles under my eyes last night he didn t know whether to worry over the first signs of a galloping decline or break his heart at witnessing the young master he had dandled on his knees going to the damnation bowwows and turning into a confirmed roue I guess I ll have to mind myself though Even Carruthers detached his mind far enough from his editorial desk and the hope of exclusively publishing the news of the Gray Seal s capture in the MORNING NEWS ARGUS to tell me I was looking seedy It s wonderful the way a little paint will metamorphose a man Well anyway here s for a good hot tub to night and a fresh start He quickened his pace There were still three blocks to go and here was no hurrying jostling crowd to impede his progress indeed as far as he could see up the Drive there was not a pedestrian in sight And then as he walked involuntarily insistently his mind harked back into the old groove again I ve tried to picture her said Jimmie Dale softly to himself I ve tried to picture her a hundred yes a thousand times and A bus rumbling cityward went by him squeaking creaking and rattling in its uneasy joints and out of the noise almost at his elbow it seemed a voice spoke his name and in that instant intuitively he KNEW and it thrilled him stopped the beat of his heart as dulcet soft clear as the note of a silver bell it fell and only one word Jimmie He whirled around A limousine wheels just grazing the curb was gliding slowly and silently past him and from the window a woman s arm white gloved and dainty was extended and from the fingers to the pavement fluttered an envelope and the car leaped forward For the fraction of a second Jimmie Dale stood dazed immovable a gamut of emotions surprise fierce exultation amazement a strange joy a mighty uplift swirling upon him and then snatching up the envelope from the ground he sprang out into the road after the car It was the one chance he had ever had the one chance she had ever given him and he had seen a white gloved arm He could not reach the car it was speeding away from him like an arrow now but there was something else that would do just as well something that with all her cleverness she had overlooked the car s number dangling on the rear axle the rays of the little lamp playing on the enamelled surface of the plate Gasping panting he held his own for a yard or more and there floated back to him a little silvery laugh from the body of the limousine and then Jimmie Dale laughed too and stopped it was No fifteen thousand eight hundred thirty six He stood and watched the car disappear up the Drive What delicious irony A month of gruelling ceaseless toil that had been vain futile useless and the key when he was not looking for it unexpectedly through no effort of his was thrust into his hand No fifteen thousand eight hundred thirty six Jimmie Dale the gently ironic smile still on his lips those slim supersensitive fingers of his subconsciously noting that the texture of the envelope was the same as she always used retraced his steps to the sidewalk Number fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty six said Jimmie Dale aloud and halted at the curb as though rooted to the spot It sounded strangely familiar that number He repeated it over again slowly One five eight three six And the smile left his lips and upon his face came the look of a chastened child She had used a duplicate plate Fifteen thousand eight hundred and thirty six was the number of one of his own cars his own particular runabout For a moment longer he stood there undecided whether to laugh or swear and then his eyes fastened mechanically on the envelope he was twirling in his fingers Here at least was something that was not elusive that on the contrary as a hundred others in the past had done outlined probably a grim night s work ahead for the Gray Seal And if it were as those others had been every minute from the moment of its receipt was precious time He stepped under the nearest street light and tore the envelope open Dear Philanthropic Crook it began and then followed two closely written pages Jimmie Dale read them his lips growing gradually tighter a smouldering light creeping into his dark eyes and once he emitted a short low whistle of consternation that was at the end as he read the post script that was heavily underscored Work quickly They will raid to night Be careful Look out for Kline he is the sharpest man in the United States secret service For a brief instant longer Jimmie Dale stood under the street lamp his mind in a lightning quick way cataloguing every point in her letter viewing every point from a myriad angles constructing devising mapping out a plan to dove tail into them and then Jimmie Dale swung on a downtown bus There was neither time nor occasion to go home now that marvellous little kit of burglar s tools that peeped from their tiny pockets in that curious leather undervest and that reposed now in the safe in his den would be useless to him to night besides in the breast pocket of his coat neatly folded was a black silk mask and relics of his role of Larry the Bat an automatic revolver an electric flashlight a steel jimmy and a bunch of skeleton keys were distributed among the other pockets of his smart tweed suit Jimmie Dale changed from the bus to the subway leaving behind him strewn over many blocks the tiny and minute fragments into which he had torn her letter at Astor Place he left the subway walked to Broadway turned uptown for a block to Eighth Street then along Eighth Street almost to Sixth Avenue and stopped A rather shabby shop a pitiful sort of a place displaying in its window a heterogeneous conglomeration of cheap odds and ends ink bottles candy pencils cigarettes pens toys writing pads marbles and a multitude of other small wares confronted him Within a little old sweet faced gray haired woman stood behind the counter pottering over the rearrangement of some articles on the shelves My word said Jimmie Dale softly to himself You wouldn t believe it would you And I ve always wondered how these little stores managed to make both ends meet Think of that old soul making fifteen or twenty thousand dollars from a layout like this even if it has taken her a lifetime Jimmie Dale had halted nonchalantly and unconcernedly by the curb not too near the window busied apparently in an effort to light a refractory cigarette and then about to enter the store he gazed aimlessly across the street for a moment instead A man came briskly around the corner from Sixth Avenue opened the store door and went in Jimmie Dale drew back a little and turned his head again as the door closed and a sudden quick alert and startled look spread over his face The man who had entered bent over the counter and spoke to the old lady She seemed to listen with a dawning terror creeping over her features and then her hands went piteously to the thin hair behind her ears The man motioned toward a door at the rear of the store She hesitated then came out from behind the counter and swayed a little as though her limbs would not support her weight Jimmie Dale s lips thinned I m afraid he muttered slowly I m afraid that I m too late even now And then as she came to the door and turned the key on the inside Pray Heaven she doesn t turn the light out or somebody might think I was trying to break in But in that respect Jimmie Dale s fears were groundless She did not turn out either of the gas jets that lighted the little shop instead in a faltering reluctant sort of manner she led the way directly through the door in the rear and the man followed her The shop was empty and Jimmie Dale was standing against the door on the outside His position was perfectly natural a hundred passers by would have noted nothing but a most commonplace occurrence a man in the act of entering a store And if he appeared to fumble and have trouble with the latch what of it Jimmie Dale however was not fumbling hidden by his back that was turned to the street those wonderful fingers of his in whose tips seemed embodied and concentrated every one of the human senses were working quickly surely accurately without so much as the wasted movement of a single muscle A faint tinkle and the key within fell from the lock to the floor A faint click and the bolt of the lock slipped back Jimmie Dale restored the skeleton keys and a little steel instrument that accompanied them to his pocket and quietly opened the door He stepped inside picked up the key from the floor inserted it in the lock closed the door behind him and locked it again To guard against interruption observed Jimmie Dale a little quizzically He was perhaps thirty seconds behind the others He crossed the shop noiselessly cautiously and passed through the door at the rear It opened into a short passage that after a few feet gave on a sort of corridor at right angles and down this latter facing him at the end the door of a lighted room was open and he could see the figure of the man who had entered the shop back turned standing on the threshold Voices indistinct came to him The corridor itself was dark and Jimmie Dale satisfied that he was fairly safe from observation stole softly forward He passed two doors on his left and the curious arrangement of the building that had puzzled him for a moment became clear The store made the front of an old tenement building with apartments above and the rear of the store was a sort of apartment too the old lady s living quarters Step by step testing each one against a possible creaking of the floor Jimmie Dale moved forward keeping close up against one wall The man passed on into the room and now Jimmie Dale could distinguish every word that was being spoken and crouched up in the dark corridor in the angle of the wall and the door jamb itself could see plainly enough into the room beyond Jimmie Dale s jaw crept out a little A young man gaunt pale wrapped in blankets half sat half reclined in an invalid s chair the old lady on her knees the tears streaming down her face had her arms around the sick man s neck while the other man apparently upset at the scene tugged vigorously at long gray mustaches Sammy Sammy sobbed the woman piteously Say you didn t do it Sammy say you didn t do it Look here missus Matthews said the man with the gray mustaches gently now don t you go to making things any harder I ve got to do my duty just the same and take your son The young man a hectic flush beginning to burn on his cheeks gazed wildly from one to the other What what is it he cried out The man threw back his coat and displayed a badge on his vest I m Kline of the secret service he said gravely I m sorry Sammy but I want you for that little job in Washington at the bureau before you left on sick leave Sammy Matthews struggled away from his mother s arms pulled himself forward in his chair and his tongue licked dry lips What what job he whispered thickly You know don t you the other answered steadily He took a large flat pocketbook from his pocket opened it and took out a five dollar bill He held this before the sick man s eyes but just out of reach one finger silently indicating the lower left hand corner Matthews stared at it for a moment and the hectic flush faded to a grayish pallor and a queer impotent sound gurgled in his throat I see you recognise it said the other quietly It s open and shut Sammy That little imperfection in the plate s got you my boy Sammy Sammy sobbed the woman again Sammy say you didn t do it It s a lie said Matthews hoarsely It s a lie That plate was condemned in the bureau for that imperfection condemned and destroyed Condemned TO BE destroyed corrected the other without raising his voice There s a little difference there Sammy about twenty years difference in the Federal pen But it wasn t destroyed this note was printed from it by one of the slickest gangs of counterfeiters in the United States but I don t need to tell you that I guess you know who they are I ve been after them a long time and I ve got them now just as tight as I ve got you Instead of destroying that plate you stole it and disposed of it to the gang How much did they give you Matthews face seemed to hold a dumb horror and his fingers picked at the arms of the chair His mother had moved from beside him now and both her hands were patting at the man s sleeve in a pitiful way while again and again she tried to speak but no words would come It s a lie said Matthews again in a colourless mechanical way The man glanced at missus Matthews as he put the five dollar note back into his pocket seemed to choke a little shook his head and all trace of the official sternness that had crept into his voice disappeared It s no good he said in a low tone Don t do that missus Matthews I ve got to do my duty He leaned a little toward the chair It s dead to rights Sammy You might as well make a clean breast of it It was up to you and Al Gregor to see that the plate was destroyed It WASN T destroyed instead it shows up in the hands of a gang of counterfeiters that I ve been watching for months Furthermore I ve got the plate itself And finally though I haven t placed him under arrest yet for fear you might hear of it before I wanted you to and make a get away I ve got Al Gregor where I can put my hands on him and I ve got his confession that you and he worked the game between you to get that plate out of the bureau and dispose of it to the gang Oh my God it came in a wild cry from the sick man and in a desperate lurching way he struggled up to his feet Al Gregor said that Then then I m done He clutched at his temples But it s not true it s not true If the plate was stolen and it must have been stolen or that note wouldn t have been found it was Al Gregor who stole it I didn t I tell you I knew nothing of it except that he and I were responsible for it and and I left it to him that s the only way I m to blame He s caught and he s trying to get out of it with a light sentence by pretending to turn State s evidence but but I ll fight him he can t prove it it s only his word against mine and The other shook his head again It s no good Sammy he said a touch of sternness back in his tones again I told you it was open and shut It s not only Al Gregor One of the gang got weak knees when I got him where I wanted him the other night and he swears that you are the one who DELIVERED the plate to them Between him and Gregor and what I know myself I ve got evidence enough for any jury against every one of the rest of you Horror fear helplessness seemed to mingle in the sick man s staring eyes and he swayed unsteadily upon his feet I m innocent he screamed out But I m caught I m caught in a net and I can t get out they lied to you but no one will believe it any more than you do and and it means twenty years for me oh God twenty years and His hands went wriggling to his temples again and he toppled back in a faint into the chair You ve killed him You ve killed my boy the old lady shrieked out piteously and flung herself toward the senseless figure The man jumped for the table across the room on which was a row of bottles snatched one up drew the cork smelled it and ran back with the bottle He poured a little of the contents into his cupped hand held it under young Matthews nostrils and pushed the bottle into missus Matthews hands Bathe his forehead with this missus Matthews he directed reassuringly He ll be all right again in a moment There see he s coming around now There was a long fluttering sigh and Matthews opened his eyes then a moment s silence and then he spoke with an effort with long pauses between the words Am I to go now The words seemed to ring absolute terror in the old lady s ears She turned and dropped to her knees on the floor mister Kline mister Kline she sobbed out oh for God s love don t take him Let him off let him go He s my boy all I ve got You ve got a mother haven t you You know The tears were streaming down the sweet old face again Oh won t you for God s dear name won t you let him go Won t Stop the man cried huskily He was mopping at his face with his handkerchief I thought I was case hardened I ought to be but I guess I m not But I ve got to do my duty You re only making it worse for Sammy there as well as me Her arms were around his knees now clinging there Why can t you let him off she pleaded hysterically Why can t you Why can t you Nobody would know and I d do anything I d pay anything anything I ll give you ten fifteen thousand dollars My poor woman he said kindly placing his hand on her head you are talking wildly Apart altogether from the question of duty even if I succeeded in hushing the matter up I would probably at least be suspected and certainly discharged and I have a family to support and if I were caught I d get ten years in the Federal prison for it I m sorry for this I believe it s your boy s first offence and if I could let him off I would But you can you can she burst out rocking on her knees clinging tighter still to him as though in a paroxysm of fear that he might somehow elude her It will kill him it will kill my boy And you can save him And even if they discharged you what would that mean against my boy s life You wouldn t suffer your family wouldn t suffer I ll I ll take care of that perhaps I could raise a little more than fifteen thousand but oh have pity have mercy don t take him away The man stared at her a moment stared at the white face on the reclining chair and passed his hand heavily across his eyes You will You will It came in a great surging cry of joy from the old lady You will oh thank God thank God I can see it in your face I I guess I m soft he said huskily and stooped and raised missus Matthews to her feet Don t cry any more It ll be all right it ll be all right I ll I ll fix it up somehow I haven t made any arrests yet and well I ll take my chances I ll get the plate and turn it over to you to morrow only only it s got to be destroyed in my presence Yes yes she cried trying to smile through her tears and then she flung her arms around her son s neck again And when you come to morrow I ll be ready with the money to do my share too and But Sammy Matthews shook his head You re wrong both of you he said weakly You re a white man Kline But destroying that plate won t save me The minute a single note printed from it shows up they ll know back there in Washington that the plate was stolen and No you re safe enough there the other interposed heavily Knowing what was up you don t think I d give the gang a chance to get them into circulation do you I got them all when I got the plate And he smiled a little anxiously I ll bring them here to be destroyed with the plate It would finish me now as well as you if one of them ever showed up Say he said suddenly with a catch in his breath I I don t think I know what I m doing missus Matthews reached out her hands to him What can I say to you she said brokenly What Jimmie Dale drew back along the wall A little way from the door he quickened his pace still moving however with extreme caution They were still talking behind him as he turned from the corridor into the passageway leading to the store and from there into the store itself And then suddenly in spite of caution his foot slipped on the bare floor It was not much just enough to cause his other foot poised tentatively in air to come heavily down and a loud and complaining creak echoed from the floor Jimmie Dale s jaws snapped like a steel trap From down the corridor came a sudden excited exclamation in the little old lady s voice and then her steps sounded running toward the store In the fraction of a second Jimmie Dale was at the front door Clumsy blundering fool he whispered fiercely to himself as he turned the key opened the door noiselessly until it was just ajar and turned the key in the lock again leaving the bolt protruding out One step backward and he was rapping on the counter with his knuckles Isn t anybody here he called out loudly Isn t any oh as missus Matthews appeared in the back doorway A package of cigarettes please She stared at him a little frightened her eyes red and swollen with recent crying How how did you get in here she asked tremendously I beg your pardon inquired Jimmie Dale in polite surprise I I locked the door I m sure I did she said more to herself than to Jimmie Dale and hurried across the floor to the door as she spoke Jimmie Dale still politely curious turned to watch her For a moment bewilderment and a puzzled look were in her face and then a sort of surprised relief I must have turned the key in the lock without shutting the door tight she explained for I knew I turned the key Jimmie Dale bent forward to examine the lock and nodded Yes he agreed with a smile I should say so Then gravely courteous I m sorry to have intruded It is nothing she answered and evidently anxious to be rid of him moved quickly around behind the counter What kind of cigarettes do you want Egyptians any kind said Jimmie Dale laying a bill on the counter He pocketed the cigarettes and his change and turned to the door Good evening he said pleasantly and went out Jimmie Dale smiled a little curiously a little tolerantly As he started along the street he heard the door of the little shop close with a sort of supercareful bang the key turned and the latch rattle to try the door the little old lady was bent on making no mistake a second time And then the smile left Jimmie Dale s lips his face grew strained and serious and he broke into a run down the block to Sixth Avenue Here he paused for an instant there was the elevated the surface cars which would be the quicker He looked up the avenue There was no train coming the nearest surface car was blocks away He bit his lips in vexation and then with a jump he was across the street and hailing a passing taxicab that his eyes had just lighted on Got a fare called Jimmie Dale No sir answered the chauffeur bumping his car to an abrupt halt Good Jimmie Dale ran alongside and yanked the door open Do you know where the Palace Saloon on the Bowery is Yes sir replied the man Jimmie Dale held a ten dollar bank note up before the chauffeur s eyes Earn that in four minutes then he snapped and sprang into the cab The taxicab swerved around on little better than two wheels started on a mad dash down the Avenue and Jimmie Dale braced himself grimly in his seat The cab swerved again tore across Waverly Place circuited Washington Square crossed Broadway and whirled finally into the upper end of the Bowery Jimmie Dale spoke once to himself plaintively It s too bad I can t let old Carruthers in on this for a scoop with his precious MORNING NEWS ARGUS but if I get out of it alive myself I ll do well Wonder if the day ll ever come when he finds out that his very dear friend and old college pal Jimmie Dale is the Gray Seal that he s turned himself inside out for about four years now to catch and that he d trade his soul with the devil any time to lay hands on Good old Carruthers The most puzzling bewildering delightful crook in the annals of crime am I The cab drew up at the curb Jimmie Dale sprang out shoved the bill into the chauffeur s hand stepped quickly across the sidewalk and pushed his way through the swinging doors of the Palace Saloon Inside leisurely and nonchalantly he walked down past the length of the bar to a door at the rear This opened into a passageway that led to the side entrance of the saloon on the cross street Jimmie Dale emerged from the side entrance crossed the street retraced his steps to the Bowery crossed over and walked rapidly down that thoroughfare for two blocks Here he turned east into the cross street and here once more his pace became leisurely and unhurried It s a strange coincidence though possibly a very happy one said Jimmie Dale as he walked along that it should be on the same street as the Sanctuary ah this ought to be the place An alleyway corresponding to the one that flanked the tenement where as Larry the Bat he had paid room rent as a tenant for several years in fact the alleyway next above it and but a short block away intersected the street narrow black and uninviting Jimmie Dale as he passed peered down its length No light that s good commented Jimmie Dale to himself Then Window opens on alleyway ten feet from ground shoe store Russian Jew in basement go in front door straight hallway room at end Russian Jew probably accomplice be careful that he does not hear you moving overhead Jimmie Dale s mind with that curious faculty of his was subconsciously repeating snatches from her letter word for word even as he noted the dimly lighted untidy and disorderly interior of what from strings of leather slippers that decorated the cellarlike entrance was evidently a cheap and shoddy shoe store in the basement of the building The building itself was rickety and tumble down three stories high and given over undoubtedly to gregarious foreigners of the poorer class a rabbit burrow as it were having a multitude of roomers and lodgers There was nothing ominous or even secretive about it up the short flight of steps to the entrance even the door hung carelessly half open Jimmie Dale s slouch hat was pulled a little farther down over his eyes as he mounted the steps and entered the hallway He listened a moment A sort of subdued querulous hubbub seemed to hum through the place as voices men s women s and children s echoing out from their various rooms above mingled together and floated down the stairways in a discordant medley Jimmie Dale stepped lightly down the length of the hall and listened again this time intently with his ear to the keyhole of the door that made the end of the passage There was not a sound from within He tried the door smiled a little as he reached for his keys worked over the lock and straightened up suddenly as his ear caught a descending step on the stairs It was two flights up however and the door was unlocked now Jimmie Dale opened it and like a shadow slipped inside and as he locked the door behind him smiled once more the door lock was but a paltry makeshift at best but INSIDE his fingers had touched a massive steel bolt that when shot home would yield when the door itself yielded and not before Without moving the bolt he turned and his flashlight for a moment swept the room Not much like the way they describe this sort of place in storybooks murmured Jimmie Dale capriciously But I get the idea mister Russian Jew downstairs makes a bluff at using it for a storeroom Again the flashlight made a circuit Here there and everywhere seemingly without any attempt at order were piles of wooden shipping cases Only the centre of the room was clear and empty that and a vacant space against the wall by the window Jimmie Dale moving without sound went to the window There was a shade on it and it was pulled down He reached up underneath it felt for the window fastening and unlocked it then cautiously tested the window itself by lifting it an inch or two it slid easily in its grooves He stood then for a moment hardfaced a frown gathering his forehead into heavy furrows as the flashlight s ray again and again darted hither and thither There was nothing absolutely nothing in the room but wooden packing cases He lifted the cover of the one nearest to him and looked inside It was quite empty except for some pieces of heavy cord and a few cardboard shoe boxes that in turn were empty too It s here of course said Jimmie Dale thoughtfully to himself Clever work too But I can t move half a hundred packing cases without that chap below hearing me and I can t do it in ten minutes either which I imagine is the outside limit of time Fortunately though these cases are not without their compensation a dozen men could hide here He began to move about the room And now he stooped before one pile of boxes and then another curiously attempting to lift up the entire pile from the bottom Some he could not move others by exerting all his strength gave a little and then finally over in one corner he found a pile that appeared to answer his purpose These are certainly empty he muttered There was just room to squeeze through between them and the next stack of cases alongside but once through by the simple expedient of moving the cases out a little to take advantage of the angle made by the corner of the room he obtained ample space to stand comfortably upright against the wall But Jimmie Dale was not satisfied yet Could he see out into the room He experimented with his flashlight and carefully shifted the screen of cases before him a little to one side And yet still he was not satisfied With a sort of ironical droop at the corners of his lips as though suddenly there had flashed upon him the inspiration that fathered one of those whimsical ideas and fancies that were so essentially a characteristic of Jimmie Dale he came out from behind the cases went across the room to the case he had opened when he first entered took out the cord and the cover of one of the cardboard shoe boxes and with these returned to his hiding place once more The sounds from the upper stories of the tenement now reached him hardly at all but from below directly under his feet almost he could hear some one the proprietor of the shoe store probably walking about Tense every faculty now on the alert his head turned in a strained attentive attitude Jimmie Dale threw on the flashlight s tiny switch took that intimate and thin metal case from his pocket extracted a diamond shaped gray paper seal with the little tweezers moistened the adhesive side and stuck it in the centre of the white cardboard box cover then tore the edges of the cardboard down until the whole was just small enough to slip into his pocket Through the cardboard he looped a piece of cord placard fashion and with his pencil printed the four words with the compliments of above the gray seal He surveyed the result with a grim mirthless chuckle and put the piece of cardboard in his pocket I m taking the longest chances I ever took in my life said Jimmie Dale very seriously to himself as his fingers twisted and doubled and tied the remaining pieces of cord together and finally fashioned a running noose in one end I don t The cord and the flashlight went into his pocket the room was in darkness the black mask was whipped from his breast pocket and adjusted to his face and his automatic was in his hand Came the creak of a footstep as though on a ladder exactly below him another and another receding curiously in its direction yet at the same time growing louder in sound as if nearer the floor then a crack of light showed in the floor in the centre of the room This held for an instant then expanded suddenly into a great luminous square and through a trapdoor opened wide now a man s head appeared Jimmie Dale s eyes fixed through the space between the piles of cases narrowed there was indeed little doubt but that the shoe store proprietor below was an accomplice The store served a most convenient purpose in every respect as a secret means of entry into the room as a sort of guarantee of innocence for the room itself Why not To the superficial observer to the man who might by some chance blunder into the room it was but an adjunct of the store itself The man in the trap doorway paused with his shoulders above the floor looked around listened then drew himself up walked across the floor and shot the heavy bolt on the door that led into the hallway of the house He returned then to the trapdoor bent over it and whistled softly Two more men in answer to the summons came up into the room The Cap ll be along in a minute one of them said Turn on the light A switch clicked flooding the room with sudden brilliancy from half a dozen electric bulbs Too many grunted the same voice again We ain t working to night turn out half of em The sudden transition from the darkness for a moment dazzled Jimmie Dale s eyes but the next moment he was searching the faces of the three men There were few crooks few denizens of the crime world below the now obsolete but still famous dead line that as Larry the Bat he did not know at least by sight Moulton Whitie Burns and Marty Dean confided Jimmie Dale softly to himself And I don t know of any worse except the Cap And gun fighters every one of them too nice odds to say nothing of Here s the Cap now announced one of the three Hello Cap where d you raise the mustache Jimmie Dale s eyes shifted to the trapdoor and into them crept a contemptuous and sardonic smile the man who was coming up now and hoisting himself to the floor was the man who half an hour before had threatened young Sammy Matthews with arrest The Cap alias Bert Malone alias a score of other names closed the trapdoor after him pulled off his mustache and gray wig tucked them in his pocket and faced his companions brusquely Never mind about the mustache he said curtly Get busy the lot of you Stir around and get the works out What for inquired Whitie Burns a sharp ferret faced little man We got enough of the old stuff on hand now and that bum break Gregor made when he pinched the cracked plate put the finish on that Say Cap Close your face Whitie and get the works out Malone cut in shortly We ve only got the whole night ahead of us but we ll need it all We re going to run the queer off that cracked plate One of the others Marty Dean this time a certain brutal aggressiveness in both features and physique edged forward Say what s the lay he demanded A joke We printed one fiver off that plate and then we knew enough to quit With that crack along the corner you couldn t pass em on a blind man And Gregor saying he thought we could patch the plate up enough to get by with gives me a pain he s got jingles in his dome factory Run them fivers eh say are you cracked too Aw forget it observed Malone caustically Who s running this gang Then with a malicious grin I got a customer for those fivers fifteen thousand dollars for all we can turn out to night See The others stared at him for a moment incredulity and greed mingling in a curious half hesitant half expectant look on their faces Then Whitie Burns spoke circling his lips with the tip of his tongue D ye mean it Cap honest What s the lay How d you work it Malone unbending with the sensation he had created grinned again Easy enough he said offhandedly It was like falling off a log Gregor said didn t he that the only way he had been able to get his claws on that plate was on account of young Matthews going away sick eh Well the old Matthews woman his mother has got money about fifteen thousand I guess she ain t got any more than that or I d have raised the ante Aw it was easy She threw it at me I framed one up on them that s all I m Kline of the secret service see I don t suppose they d ever seen him though they d know his name fast enough but I made up something like him I showed them where I had a case against Sammy for pinching the plate that was strong enough to put a hundred innocent men behind the bars Of course he knew well enough he was innocent but he could see the twenty years I showed him with both eyes Say he mussed all over the place and went and fainted like a girl And then the old woman came across with an offer of fifteen thousand for the plate and corrupted me Malone s cunning vicious face now that the softening effects of the gray hair and mustache were gone seemed accentuated diabolically by the grin broadening into a laugh as he guffawed Marty Dean s hand swung with a bang to Malone s shoulder Say Cap say you re all right he exclaimed excitedly You re the boy But what s the good of running anything off the plate before turning it over to em the stuff s no good to us You got a wooden nut with sawdust for brains said Malone sarcastically If he d thought the gang of counterfeiters that was supposed to have bought the plate from him had run off only one fiver and then stopped because they say it wouldn t get by and weren t going to run any more and just destroy the plate like it was supposed to have been destroyed to begin with and it all end up with no one the wiser where d ye think we d have banked that fifteen thousand I told him I had the whole run confiscated and that the queer went with the plate so we ll just make that little run to night that s why I sent word around to you this morning By the jumping ejaculated Whitie Burns heavy with admiration You got a head on you Cap It s a good thing for some of you that I have returned Malone complacently But don t stand jawing all night Go on now get busy There was no surprise in Jimmie Dale s face he had chosen his position behind a pile of cases that he had been extremely careful as a man is careful when his life hangs in the balance to assure himself were empty None of the four came near or touched the pile behind which he stood but here and there about the room they pulled this one and that one out from various stacks In scarcely more than a moment the room was completely transformed It was no longer a storeroom for surplus stock for the storage of bulky and empty packing cases From the cases the men had picked out like a touch of magic appeared a veritable printing plant an elaborate engraver s outfit a highly efficient foot power press rapidly being assembled by Whitie Burns an electric dryer inks a pile of white silk threaded bank note paper a cutter and a score of other appurtenances Yes said Jimmie Dale very gently to himself Yes quite so but the plate Ah Malone was taking it out from the middle of a bundle of old newspapers loosely tied together that he had lifted from one of the cases Jimmie Dale s eyes fastened on it and from that instant never left it A minute passed two three of them the four men were silently busy about the room Malone was carefully cleaning the plate They will raid to night Look out for Kline he is the sharpest man in the United State secret service the warning in her letter was running through Jimmie Dale s mind Kline the real Kline was going to raid the place to night When At what time It must be nearly eleven o clock already and It came sudden quick as the crack of doom a terrific crash against the bolted door but the door undoubtedly to the surprise of those without held fast thanks to the bolt The four men white faced seemed for an instant turned to statues Came another crash against the door and a sharp imperative order to those within to open it and surrender We re pinched Beat it whispered Whitie Burns wildly and dashed for the trapdoor Like a rat for its hole Marty Dean followed Malone farther away dropped the plate on the floor and rushed with Moulton beside him after the others but he never reached the trapdoor Over the crashing blows raining now in quick succession on the door of the room over a startled commotion as lodgers roomers and tenants on the floor above awoke into frightened activity with shouts and cries came the louder crash of a pile of packing boxes hurled to the floor And over them vaulting those scattered in his way Jimmie Dale sprang at Malone The man reeled back with a cry Moulton dashed through the trapdoor and disappeared The short ugly barrel of Jimmie Dale s automatic was between Malone s eyes You make a move said Jimmie Dale in a low sibilant way and I ll drop you where you stand Put your hands behind your back palms together Malone dazed cowed obeyed A panel of the door split and rent down its length the hinges were sagging Jimmie Dale worked like lightning The cord with the slip noose from his pocket went around Malone s wrists jerked tight and knotted the placard his lips grim with no sign of humour Jimmie Dale dangled around the man s neck An introduction for you to mister Kline out there that you seem so fond of gritted Jimmie Dale Then working as he talked I ve got no time to tell you what I think of you you pitiful hound he snatched up the plate from the floor and put it in his pocket Twenty years I think you said didn t you his hand shot into Malone s pocket book and extracted the five dollar note If you can open this with your toes maybe you can get a way he wrenched the trapdoor over and slammed it shut good night Malone and he leaped for the window The door tottered inward from the top ripping tearing smashing hinges panels and jamb Jimmie Dale got a blurred vision of brass buttons blue coats and helmets and in the forefront of a stocky gray mustached gray haired man in plain clothes Jimmie Dale threw up the window swung out as with a rush the officers burst through into the room and a revolver bullet hummed viciously past his ear and dropped to the ground into encircling arms Ah no you don t my bucko snapped a hoarse voice in his ear Keep quiet now or I ll crack your bean understand But the officer too heavy to be muscular was no match for Jimmie Dale who even as he had dropped from the sill had caught sight of the lurking form below and now with a quick sudden lithe movement he wriggled loose his fist from a short arm jab smashed upon the point of the other s jaw sending the man staggering backward and Jimmie Dale ran A crowd was already collecting at the mouth of the alleyway mostly occupants of the house itself and into these scattering them in all directions eluding dexterously another officer who made a grab for him Jimmie Dale charged at top speed burst through and headed down the street running like a deer Yells went up a revolver spat venomously behind him came the shrill CHEEP CHEEP of the police whistle and heavy boots pounding the pavement in pursuit Down the block Jimmie Dale raced The yells augmented in his rear Another shot and this time he heard the bullet buzz And then he swerved into the next alleyway that flanked the Sanctuary He had perhaps a ten yards lead just a little more than the distance from the street to the side door of the Sanctuary that opened on the alleyway And as he ran now his fingers tore at his clothing loosening his tie unbuttoning coat vest collar shirt and undershirt He leaped at the door swung it open flung himself inside and then sacrificing speed to silence went up the stairs like a cat cramming his mask now into his pocket His room was on the first landing In an instant he had unlocked the door entered and locked it again behind him From outside an excited street urchin s voice shrilled up to him He went in that door I seen him The police whistle chirped again and then an authoritative voice Get around and watch the saloon back of this Heeney there s a way out through there from this joint Jimmie Dale divested of every stitch of clothing that he had worn pulled a disreputable collarless flannel shirt over his head pulled on a dirty and patched pair of trousers and slipped into a threadbare and filthy coat Jimmie Dale was working against seconds They were at the lower door now He lifted the oilcloth in the corner of the room lifted up the loose piece of the flooring shoved his discarded garments inside and from a little box that was there smeared the hollow of his hand with some black substance possessed himself of two little articles replaced the flooring replaced the oilcloth and in bare feet stole across the room to the door Against the door without a sound Jimmie Dale placed a chair and on the chair seat he laid the two little articles he had been carrying in his hand It was intensely black in the room but Jimmie Dale needed no light here From under the bed he pulled out a pair of woolen socks and a pair of congress boots both as disreputable as the rest of his attire put them on and very quietly softly cautiously stretched himself out on the bed The officers were at the top of the stairs A voice barked out Stand guard on this landing Peters Higgins you take the one above We ll start from the top of the house and work down Allow no one to pass you Yes sir Very good mister Kline was the response Kline the sharpest man in the United States secret service she had said Jimmie Dale s lips set I m glad I had no shave this morning said Jimmie Dale grimly to himself His fingers were working with the black substance in the hollow of his hand and the long slim tapering fingers the shapely well cared for hands grew unkempt and grimy black beneath the finger nails and a little too played its part on the day s growth of beard a little around the throat and at the nape of the neck a little across the forehead to meet the locks of straggling and disordered hair Jimmie Dale wiped the residue from the hollow of his hand on the knee of his trousers and lay still An officer paced outside Upstairs doors opened and closed Gruff harsh tones in commands echoed through the house The search party descended to the second floor and again the same sounds were repeated And then thumping down the creaking stairs they stopped before Jimmie Dale s room Some one tried the door and finding it locked rattled it violently Open the door It was Kline s voice Jimmie Dale s eyes were closed and he was breathing regularly though just a little slower than in natural respiration Break it down ordered Kline tersely There was a rush at it and it gave It surged inward knocked against the chair upset the latter something tinkled to the floor and four officers with Kline at their head jumped into the room Jimmie Dale never moved A flashlight played around the room and focused upon him and then he was shaken roughly only to fall inertly back on the bed again I guess this is all right mister Kline said one of the officers It s Larry the Bat and he s doped to the eyes There s the stuff on the floor we knocked off the chair Light the gas directed Kline curtly and being obeyed stooped to the floor and picked up a hypodermic syringe and a small bottle He held the bottle to the light and read the label LIQUOR MORPHINAE Shake him again he commanded None too gently a policeman caught Jimmie Dale by the shoulder and shook him vigorously again Jimmie Dale once the other let go his hold fell back limply on the bed breathing in that same slightly slowed way Larry the Bat eh grunted Kline then to the officer who had volunteered the information Who s Larry the Bat What is he And how long have you known him I don t know who he is any more than what you can see there for yourself replied the officer He s a dope fiend and I guess a pretty tough case though we ve never had him up for anything He s lived here ever since I ve been on the beat and that s three years or All right interrupted Kline crisply He s no good to us You say there s an exit from this house into that saloon at the back Yes sir but the fellow whoever he is couldn t get away from there Heeney s been over on guard from the start Then he s still inside there said Kline clipping off his words We ll search the saloon Nice night s work this is One out of the whole gang and that one with the compliments of the Gray Seal The men went out and began to descend the stairs One said Jimmie Dale to himself still motionless still breathing in that slow way so characteristic of the drug Two Three Four The minutes went by a quarter of an hour a half hour Still Jimmie Dale lay there still motionless still breathing with slow regularity His muscles began to cramp to give him exquisite torture Around him all was silence only distant sounds from the street reached him muffled and at intervals Another quarter of an hour passed an eternity of torment It seemed to Jimmie Dale for all his will power that he could not hold himself in check that he must move scream out even in the torture that was passing all endurance It was silent now utterly silent and then out of the silence just outside his door a footstep creaked and a man walked to the stairs and went down Five said Jimmie Dale to himself The sharpest man in the United States secret service And then for the first time Jimmie Dale moved to wipe away the beads of sweat that had sprung out upon his forehead CHAPTER V THE AFFAIR OF THE PUSHCART MAN Larry the Bat shambled out of the side door of the tenement into the back alleyway shambled along the black alleyway to the street and smiled a little grimly as a shadow across the roadway suddenly shifted its position The game was growing acute critical desperate even and it was his move Larry the Bat disreputable denizen of the underworld alias Jimmie Dale millionaires clubman alias the Gray Seal whom Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS called the master criminal of the age shuffled along in the direction of the Bowery his hands plunged deep in the pockets of his frayed and tattered trousers where his fingers in a curious wistful way fondled the keys of his own magnificent residence on Riverside Drive It was his move and it was an impasse ironical sardonic and it was worse it was full of peril True he had outwitted Kline of the secret service two nights before when Kline had raided the counterfeiters den true he had no reason to believe that Kline suspected HIM specifically but the man Kline wanted HAD entered the tenement that night and since then the house had been shadowed day and night The result was both simple and disastrous to Jimmie Dale Larry the Bat a known inmate of the house might come and go as he pleased but to emerge from the Sanctuary in the person of Jimmie Dale would be fatal Kline had been outwitted but Kline had not acknowledged final defeat The tenement had been searched from top to bottom unostentatiously His own room on the first landing had been searched the previous afternoon when he was out but they had failed to find the cunningly contrived opening in the floor under the oilcloth in the corner an impromptu wardrobe that would proclaim Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale to be one and the same person that would inevitably lead further to the establishment of his identity as the Gray Seal In time of course the surveillance would cease but he could not wait That was the monumental irony of it the factor that all unknown to Kline was forcing the issue hard now It was his move Since years ago now as the Gray Seal he had begun to work with HER that unknown mysterious accomplice of his and the police stung to madness both by the virulent and constant attacks of the press and by the humiliating prod of their own failures sought daily high and low with every resource at their command for the Gray Seal he had never been in quite so strange and perilous a plight as he found himself at that moment To preserve inviolate the identity of Larry the Bat was absolutely vital to his safety It was the one secret that even she who so strangely appeared to know all else about him he was sure had not discovered and it was just that in a way that had brought the present impossible situation to pass In the month previous in a lull between those letters of hers he had set himself doggedly and determinedly to the renewed task of what had become so dominantly now a part of his very existence the solving of HER identity And for that month as the best means to the end means however that only resulted as futilely as the attempts that had gone before he had lived mostly as Larry the Bat returning to his home in his proper person only when occasion and necessity demanded it He had been going home that evening two nights before walking along Riverside Drive when from the window of the limousine she had dropped the letter at his feet that had plunged him into the affair of the Counterfeit Five and he had not gone home Eventually to save himself he had in the Sanctuary performing the transformation in desperate haste again been forced to assume the role of Larry the Bat That was really the gist of it And yesterday morning he had remembered to his dismay that he had had little or no money left the night before He had intended of course to replenish his supply when he got home Only he hadn t gone home And now he needed money needed it badly desperately With thousands in the bank with abundance even in his safe in his own den at home a supply kept there always for an emergency he was facing actual want he rattled two dimes a nickel and a few odd pennies thoughtfully against the keys in his pocket To a certain extent old Jason his butler could be trusted Jason even knew that mysterious letters of tremendous secretive importance came to the house and the old man always meant well but he dared not trust even Jason with the secret of his dual personality What was he to do He needed money imperatively at once Thanks to Kline for the time being at least he could not rid himself of the personality of Larry the Bat by the simple expedient or slipping into the clothes of Jimmie Dale he must live act and remain Larry the Bat until the secret service officer gave up the hunt How bridge the gulf between Jimmie Dale and Larry the Bat in old Jason s eyes Nor was that all There was still another matter and one that in order to counteract it demanded at once a serious inroad to the extent of a telephone call upon his slender capital A too prolonged and unaccounted for absence from home and old Jason in his anxious blundering solicitude would have the fat in the fire at that end and the city and the social firmament thereof would be humming with the startling news of the disappearance of a well known millionaire The complications that would then ensue with himself powerless to lift a finger Jimmie Dale did not care to think about such a contretemps must at all hazards be prevented Jimmie Dale reached the corner of the street where it intersected the Bowery and paused languidly by the curb No one appeared to be following He had not expected that there would be but it was as well to be sure He walked then a few steps along the Bowery and slipped suddenly into a doorway from where he could command a view of the street corner that he had just left At the end of ten minutes satisfied that no one had any concern in his immediate movements he shambled on again down the Bowery There was a saloon two blocks away that boasted a private telephone booth Jimmie Dale made that his destination Larry the Bat was a very well known character in that resort and the bullet headed dispenser of drinks behind the bar nodded unctuously to him over the heads of those clustered at the rail as he entered Larry the Bat as befitted one of the elite of the underworld was graciously pleased to acknowledge the proletariat salutation with a curt nod He walked down to the end of the room entered the telephone booth and was carelessly careful to close the door tightly behind him He gave the number of his residence on Riverside Drive and waited for the connection After some delay Jason s voice answered him Jason said Jimmie Dale in matter of fact tones I shall be out of the city for another three or four days possibly a week and he stopped abruptly as a sort of gasp came to him over the wire Thank God that s you sir exclaimed the old butler wildly I ve been near mad sir all day Don t get excited Jason said Jimmie Dale a little sharply The mere matter of my absence for the last two days is nothing to cause you any concern And while I am on the subject Jason let me say now that I shall be glad if you will bear that fact in mind in future Yes sir stammered Jason But sir it ain t that good Lord Master Jim it ain t that sir It s it s one of them letters Something like a galvanic shock seemed to jerk the disreputable loose jointed frame of Larry the Bat suddenly erect and a strained whiteness crept over the dirty unwashed face Go on Jason said Jimmie Dale without a quiver in his voice It came this morning sir that shuffer with his automobile left it I had just time to say you weren t at home sir and he was gone And then sir there ain t been an hour gone by all through the day that a woman sir a lady begging your pardon Master Jim hasn t rung up on the telephone asking if you were back and if I could get you and where you were and half frantic sir half sobbing sometimes sir and saying there was a life hanging on it Master Jim Larry the Bat staring into the mouthpiece of the instrument subconsciously passed his hand across his forehead and subconsciously noted that his fingers as he drew them away were damp Where is the letter now Jason inquired Jimmie Dale coolly Here on your desk Master Jim Shall I bring it to you Bring it to him How When Where Bring it to him The ghastly irony of it Jimmie Dale tried to think prodding spurring desperately that keen lightning brain of his that had never failed him yet How bridge the gulf between Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale in Jason s eyes not just for the replenishing of funds now but with a life at stake No I think not Jason said Jimmie Dale calmly Just leave it where it is And if she telephones again say that you have told me that will be sufficient to satisfy any further inquiries And Jason Yes sir If she telephones again try and find out where the call comes from I haven t forgotten what you said once Master Jim sir said the old man eagerly And I ve been trying that sir all day They ve all come from different pay stations sir A mirthless little smile tinged Jimmie Dale s lips Of course He might have known It was always that way always the same He was as near to the solution of her identity at that moment as he had been years ago when she in some mysterious way alone of all the world had identified him as the Gray Seal Very good Jason he said quietly Don t bother about it any more It will be all right You can expect me when you see me Good night He hung the receiver on the hook walked out of the booth and mechanically reached the street All right It was far from all right very far from it It was no trivial thing that letter they never had been trivial things those letters of hers that involved so often a matter of life and death as this one now perhaps as her actions would seem to indicate involved life and death more urgently than any that had gone before It was far from all right at a moment when his own position his own safety was at best but a desperate chance when his every energy brain wit and cunning were taxed to the utmost to save himself And yet somehow some way at any cost he must get that letter and at any cost he must act upon it To fail her was to fail utterly in everything that failure in its most miserable its widest sense implied failure in that which rose paramount to every other consideration in life Fail her Jimmie Dale s lips thinned into a hard drawn line and then parted slowly in a curiously whimsical smile It would be a strange burglary that he had decided upon in order that he might not fail her stranger than any the Gray Seal had ever committed and in some respects even more perilous He started along the Bowery walking briskly now toward the nearest subway station at Astor Place his mind for the moment electing to face the situation in a humour as whimsical as his smile Supposing that as Larry the Bat he were caught and arrested during the next hour in Jimmie s Dale s residence on Riverside Drive With his arrest as Larry the Bat Jimmie s Dale would automatically disappear Would follow then the suspicion that

none	none	had met with foul play and as time went on and Jimmie Dale being then in prison as Larry the Bat did not reappear the assurance of it then the certainty that suspicion would focus on Larry the Bat as being connected with the millionaire s death since Larry the Bat had been caught in Jimmie Dale s home and he would be accused of his own murder It was quite humourous of course quite grotesquely bizarre but it was equally an exceedingly grim possibility There were drawbacks to a dual personality In a word confided Jimmie Dale softly to himself and a serious light crept into the dark steady eyes I m in a bit of a nasty mess At Astor Place he entered the subway at Fourteenth Street he changed to an express and at Ninety sixth Street he got out It was but a short walk west to Riverside Drive and from there his house was only a few blocks farther on Jimmie Dale did not slouch now And for all his disreputable attire incongruous as it was in that neighbourhood few people that he passed paid any attention to him none gave him more than a casual glance Jimmie Dale swung along upright with no attempt to make himself inconspicuous hurrying a little as one intent upon a definite errand As he neared his house he slowed his pace a little until a couple who were passing in front of it had gone on then he went up the steps but noiselessly as a shadow now to the front door opened it softly closed it softly behind him and crouched for a moment in the vestibule Through the monogrammed lace on the plate glass of the inner doors he could see a little indistinctly into the reception hall beyond The hall was empty Jason for that matter would be the only one likely to be about the other servants would have no business there in any case and whether in their quarters above or below they had their own stairs at the rear Jimmie Dale inserted the key in the spring lock and opened the door a cautious fraction of an inch to listen There was no sound yes a subdued murmured the servants were downstairs in the basement He slipped inside slipped in a flash across the hall and treading like a cat went up the stairs He scarcely seemed to breathe until with a little sigh of relief he stood inside his den on the first floor with the door shut behind him I must speak to Jason about being a little more watchful muttered Jimmie Dale facetiously Here s all my property at the mercy of Larry the Bat An instant he stood by the door looking about him in the bright moonlight streaming in through the side windows the room s appointments stood out in soft shadows the huge davenport the great luxurious easy chairs an easel with a half finished canvas as he had left it the big flat topped rosewood desk the open fireplace and then his steps silent on the thick velvet rug under foot he walked quickly to the desk Yes there it was the letter He placed it hurriedly in his pocket the moonlight was not strong enough to read by and he dared not turn on the lights And now money funds In the alcove behind the portiere Jimmie Dale dropped on his knees before the squat barrel shaped safe and opened it He reached inside took out a package of banknotes placed the bills in his pocket and hesitated a moment What else would he require What act did that letter call upon the Gray Seal to perform in the next few hours Jimmie Dale stared thoughtfully into the interior of the safe Whatever it was it must be performed in the role of Larry the Bat for though he could get into his dressing room now and become Jimmie Dale again there were still those watchers outside the Sanctuary THEY must not become suspicious and if Larry the Bat disappeared mysteriously Larry the Bat would be the man that Kline and the secret service of the United States would never cease hunting for and that would mean that he could never reassume a character that was as necessary for his protection as breath was to life so long as the Gray Seal worked True he could change now to Jimmie Dale but he would have to change back again and return to the Sanctuary before morning as Larry the Bat and remain there until Kline beaten called off his human bloodhounds No a change was not to be thought of 
2416_152137_000053_000001	train-clean-100	What then 
none	none	would he require that compact little kit of burglar tools rolled in its leather jacket that unrolled slipped about his body like a close fitting undervest As well to take it anyway He removed his coat and vest took out the leather bundle from the safe untied the thongs that bound it together unrolled it passed it around his body life belt fashion secured the thongs over his shoulders and put on his coat and vest again A revolver a flashlight He had both at the Sanctuary under the flooring but there were duplicates here He slipped them into his pockets Anything else to forestall and provide for any possible contingency He hesitated again for a moment thinking then slowly closed the inner door of the safe locked it swung the outer door shut and in the act of twirling the knobs sprang suddenly to his feet Sharp shrill in the stillness of the room the telephone bell on the desk rang out clamourously Jimmie Dale s face set hard as he leaped out from behind the curtain had Jason heard it It rang again before he could reach the desk was ringing as he snatched the receiver from the hook Yes yes he called in a low guarded hasty way into the mouthpiece Hello What is it And then one hand resting on the desk closed around the edge and tightened until the skin over the knuckles grew ivory white It was SHE She It was HER voice he had only heard it once in all his life that night two nights before in a silvery laugh from the limousine as it had sped away from him down the road but he knew It thrilled him now with a mad rhapsody robbing him for the moment of every thought save that she was living real existent that it was HER voice It s you YOU he said hoarsely Oh Jimmie you at last it came in a little gasping cry of relief The letter Yes I ve got it it s all right it s all right the words would not seem to come fast enough in his desperate haste But it s you now Listen Listen he pleaded Tell me who you are My God how I ve tried to find you and That rippling silvery laugh again but now too it seemed to his eager ear with just the faintest note of wistfulness in it Some day Jimmie That letter now It Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenly Jason s steps running sounded outside the room along the corridor there was not an instant to lose Hang up Good bye Danger Don t ring again he whispered hurriedly and with a miserable smile replacing the receiver bitterly on the hook he jumped for the curtain He reached it none too soon The door opened an electric light switch clicked and the room was flooded with light Jason still running headed for the desk It ll be her again Jimmie Dale heard the old man mutter as from the edge of the portiere he watched the other s actions Jason picked up the telephone Hello Hello he called then began to click impatiently with the receiver hook Hello Who Central I don t want any number somebody was calling here What Nobody on the wire He set the telephone back on the desk with a bewildered air That s queer he exclaimed I could have sworn I heard it ring twice and He stopped abruptly and leaning across the desk hung there wide eyed staring while a sickly pallor began to steal into his face The letter he mumbled wildly The letter Master Jim s letter the letter it s GONE Trembling excited the old man began to search the desk then down on his knees on the floor under it and then growing more frantic with every instant rose and began to hunt around the room in an agitated aimless fashion Jason s distress was very real he was almost beside himself now with fear and anxiety A whimsical affectionate smile played over Jimmie Dale s lips at the old man s antics and changed suddenly into one of consternation Jason was making directly now for the curtain behind which he stood Perhaps though he would pass it by and Jason s hand reached out and grasped the portiere Jason said Jimmie Dale sharply The old man staggered back as though he had been struck tried to speak choked and gazed at the curtain with distended eyes Is is that you sir Master Jim behind the curtain there he finally blurted out I sir you gave me a start and the letter Master Jim Don t lose your head Jason said Jimmie Dale coolly I ve got the letter Now do as I bid you Yes Master Jim faltered the old man Pull down the window shades and draw the portiere together directed Jimmie Dale Jason still overwrought and excited obeyed a little awkwardly Now the lights Jason instructed Jimmie Dale Turn them off and go and sit down in that chair at the desk Again Jason obeyed stumbling in the darkness as he returned from the electric light switch at the farther end of the room He sat down in the chair Larry the Bat stepped out from behind the curtain I came for that letter Jason he explained quietly I am going out again now I may be back to morrow I may not be back for a week You will say nothing not a word of my having been here to night Do you understand Jason Yes sir said Jason then hesitantly Would you mind saying sir when you came in It s of no consequence Jason is it No sir said Jason Jimmie Dale smiled in the darkness Jason Yes sir I wish you to remain where you are without leaving that chair for the next ten minutes He moved across the room to the door Good night Jason he said Good night Master Jim good night sir oh Lord Jimmie Dale did not require that ten minutes it was a very wide margin of safety to obviate the possibility of Jason from a window detecting the exit of a disreputable character from the house in three minutes he was turning the corner of the first cross street and walking rapidly away from Riverside Drive In the subway station Jimmie Dale read the letter read it twice over as he always read those strange epistles of hers that opened the door to new peril new danger to the Gray Seal but too that seemed somehow to draw tighter in a glad big way the unseen bond between them read it as he always read those letters almost subconsciously committing the very words to memory with that keen faculty of brain of his But now as he began to tear the sheet and envelope into minute particles a strained hard look was on his face and in his eyes and his lips half parted moved a little It s a death warrant muttered Jimmie Dale I I guess to night will see the end of the Gray Seal She says I needn t do it but I guess it s worth the risk a human life A downtown express roared into the station What time is it Jimmie Dale asked the guard as he stepped aboard Bout midnight the man answered tersely The forward car was almost empty and Jimmie Dale chose a seat by himself How did she know How did she know not only this but the hundred other affairs that she had outlined in those letters of hers By what means superhuman indeed it seemed did she Jimmie Dale jerked himself erect suddenly What good did it do to speculate on that now when every minute was priceless What was HE to do how was he to act what plan could he formulate and carry out and WIN against odds that at the outset were desperate enough even to forecast almost certain failure and death Who would ever have suspected old Tom Ludgate known for years throughout the squalour of the East Side as old Luddy the pushcart man of having a bag of unset diamonds under his pillow or under the sack rather that he probably used for a pillow What a queer thing to do But then old Luddy was a character apparently always in the most poverty stricken condition apparently hardly more than keeping body and soul together trusting no one and obsessed by the dread that by depositing in a bank some one would discover that he had money and attempt to force it from him he had put his savings year after year for twenty years twenty five years perhaps into unset stone diamonds How had she found that out Jimmie Dale sank into a deeper reverie He could steal them all right and they would be well worth the stealing old Luddy had done well and lived and existed on next to nothing the stones she said were worth about fifteen thousand dollars Not so bad even for twenty five years of vegetable selling from a pushcart He could steal them all right it would tax the Gray Seal s ingenuity little to do so simple a thing as that but that was not all nor indeed hardly a factor in it it was vital that if he were to succeed at all he must steal them PUBLICLY as it were And after that WHAT His own chances were pretty slim at best Jimmie Dale staring at the grayness of the subway wall through the window shook his head slowly then with a queer little philosophical shrug of his shoulders he smiled gravely seriously It was all a part of the game all a part of the life of the Gray Seal It was half past twelve or a little later as nearly as he could judge for Larry the Bat carried no such ornate thing in evidence as a watch as he halted at the corner of a dark squalid street in the lower East Side It was a miserable locality in daylight humming with a cosmopolitan hive of pitiful humans dragging out as best they could an intolerable existence a locality peopled with every nationality on earth their community of interest the struggle to maintain life at the lowest possible expenditure where necessity even was pared and shaved down to a minimum but now at night time or rather in the early morning hours the darkness in very mercy it seemed covered it with a veil as it were and in the quiet that hung over it now hid the bald the hideous aye and the piteous too from view It was a narrow street and the row of tenement houses each house almost identical with its neighbour that flanked the pavement on either side seemed from where Jimmie Dale stood looking down its length from the corner to converge together at a point a little way beyond giving it an unreal ominous cavernlike effect And too there seemed something ominous even in its quiet It was as though one sensed acutely the crouching of some Thing in its lair waiting silently viciously with sullen patience A footstep sounded another Jimmie Dale drew quickly back around the corner into an areaway Two men passed in helmets swinging their nightsticks that beat was always policed in pairs They passed on turned the corner and went down the narrow cross street that Jimmie Dale had just been inspecting He started to follow and drew back again abruptly A form flitted suddenly across the road and disappeared in the darkness in the officers wake ten yards behind the first another followed at the same interval of distance still another and yet still one more four in all The darkness hid all six the two policemen the four men behind them the only sounds were the OFFICERS footsteps dying away in the distance Jimmie Dale s fingers were mechanically testing the mechanism of the automatic in his pocket The Skeeter s gang he muttered to himself Red Mose the Midget Harve Thoms and the Skeeter The Worst apaches in the city of New York death contractors the lowest bidders Professional assassins and a man s life any time for twenty five dollars I wonder I ve never done it yet but I wonder if it would be a crime in God s sight if one shot to KILL Jimmie Dale was at the corner again again the street before him was black deserted empty He chose the right hand side and well in the shadow of the houses as an extra precaution stole along silently He stopped finally before one where in the doorway hung a little sign Jimmie Dale mounted the porch and with his eyes close to the sign could just make out the larger words in the big printed type ROOM TO RENT TOP FLOOR Jimmie Dale nodded That was right The first house on the right hand side with the room to rent sign her letter had said His fingers were testing the doorknob The door was not locked Naturally it wouldn t be locked Jimmie Dale told himself grimly and stepped inside He stood for an instant without movement every faculty on the alert Far up above him a step guarded though his trained ear made it out to be creaked faintly upon the stairs there was no other sound The creaking almost inaudible at its loudest receded farther up and silence fell In the darkness noiselessly Jimmie Dale groped for the stairway found it and began to ascend The minutes passed it seemed a minute even from step to step and there were three flights to the top There must be no creaking this time the slightest sound he knew well enough would be not only fatal to the work he had to do but probably fatal to himself as well He had been near death many times the consciousness that he was nearer to it now possibly than he had ever been before seemed to stimulate his senses into acute and abnormal energy And too the physical effort as step by step the flexed muscles relaxing so slowly little by little gradually each time as he found foothold on the step higher up was a terrific strain At the top his face was bathed in perspiration and he wiped it off with his coat sleeve It was still dark here intensely dark and his eyes though grown accustomed to it could make out nothing but the deeper shadow of the walls But thanks to her always a mistress of accurate and minute detail he possessed a mental plan of his surroundings The head of the stairs gave on the middle of the hallway the hallway ran to his right and left To his right on the opposite side of the hall was the door of old Luddy s squalid two room apartment For a moment Jimmie Dale stood hesitant a sudden perplexity and anxiety growing upon him It was strange What did it mean He had nerved himself to a quick desperate attempt trusting to surprise and his own wit and agility for victory there had seemed no other way than that since he had seen those four men at the corner since they were AHEAD of him True they were not much ahead of him not enough to have accomplished their purpose and furthermore they were not in that room He knew that absolutely beyond question of doubt He had listened for just that all the nerve racking way up the stairs But where were they There was no sound not a sound just blackness dark impenetrable utter that began to palpitate now It came in a whisper wavering sibilant from his left A sort of relief fierce in the breaking of the tense expectancy premonitory in the possibilities that it held swept Jimmie Dale He crept along the hall The whisper had come from that room presumably empty that was for rent By the door he crouched his sensitive fingers eyes to Jimmie Dale so often feeling over jamb and panels with a delicate soundless touch The door was just ajar The fingers crept inside and touched the knob and lock there was no key within The whispering still went on but it seemed like a screaming of vultures now in Jimmie Dale s ears as the words came to him Aw say Skeeter dis high brow stunt gives me de pip Me fer goin in dere an croakin de geezer reg lar widout de frills Who s to know Say just about two minutes an we re beatin it wid de sparklers An inch a half inch at a time the knob slowly very very slowly turning the door was being closed by the crouched form on the threshold Close yer trap Mose came a fierce response We ain t fixed the lay all day for nothin There ain t a soul on earth knows he s got any sparklers cept us If there was it would be different then they d know that was what whoever did it was after see The door was closed the knob slowly very very slowly being released again From one of the leather pockets under Jimmie Dale s vest came a tiny steel instrument that he inserted in the key hole The same voice spoke on That s what we re croaking him for cause nobody knows about them diamonds and so s he can t TELL anybody afterward that any were pinched An that s why it s got to look like he just got tired of living and did it himself I guess that ll hold the police when they find the poor old duck hanging from the ceiling with a bit of cord around his neck and a chair kicked out from under his feet on the floor Ain t you got the brains of a louse to see that Sure the whisper came dully in grudging intonation through the panels the door was locked Sure but it s de hangin round waitin to get busy that s gettin me goat an Jimmie Dale straightened up and began to retreat along the corridor A merciless rage was upon him now every fiber of his being seemed to tingle and quiver with it the damnable hellish ingenuity of it all seemed to choke and suffocate him Luck muttered Jimmie Dale between his clenched teeth Oh the blessed luck to get that door locked I ve got time now to set the stage for my own get away before the showdown He stole on along the corridor Excerpts from her letter were running through his brain It would do no good to warn him Jimmie the Skeeter and his gang would never let up on him until they got the stones It would do no good for you to steal them first for they would only take that as a ruse of old Luddy s and murder the man first and hunt afterward In some way you must let the Skeeter SEE you steal them make them think make them certain that it is a bona fide theft so that they will no longer have any interest or any desire to do old Luddy harm And for it to appear real to them it must appear real to old Luddy himself do not take any chances there Jimmie Dale s eyes narrowed Yes it was simple enough now with that pack of hell s wolves guarded for the moment by a locked door forced to give him warning by breaking the door before they could get out It was simple enough now to enter old Luddy s room steal the stones at the revolver point then make enough disturbance when he was ready to set the gang in motion and as they rushed in open him to make his escape with the stones to the roof through Luddy s room That was simple enough there was an opening to the roof in Luddy s room she had said and there was a ladder kept there in place On hot nights it seemed the old man used to go up there and sleep on the roof not now of course It was too late in the year for that but the opening in the roof was there and the ladder remained there too Yes it was simple enough now And the next morning the papers would rave with execrations against the Gray Seal for the robbery of the life savings of a poor defenseless old man for committing as vile and pitiful a crime as had ever stirred New York Even Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS would be moved to bitter attack Good old Carruthers who little thought that the Gray Seal was his old college pal his present most intimate friend Jimmie Dale And afterward after the next morning Well that at least had never been in doubt Old Luddy could be made to leave New York and once away with the Skeeter and his gang robbed of incentive to pay any further attention to him the stones could be secretly returned to the old man And it would to the public to the police be just another of the Gray Seal s crimes that was all Jimmie Dale had reached old Luddy s door The Gray Seal Oh yes they would know it was the Gray Seal the insignia was familiar enough familiar to the crooks of the underworld who held it in awe familiar to the police to whom it was an added barb of ridicule He was placing it now that insignia a diamond shaped gray paper seal on the panel of the door and now a black silk mask adjusted over his face Jimmie Dale bent to insert the little steel instrument in the lock a pitiful paltry thing a cheap lock to fingers that could play so intimately with twirling knobs and dials masters of the intricate mechanism of vaults and safes And then about to open the door a sort of sudden dismay fell upon him He had not thought of that somehow it had not occurred to him WHAT WAS IT THEY WERE WAITING FOR Why had they not struck at once as when he had first entered the house he had supposed they would do What was it Why was it Was old Luddy out Were they waiting for his return or what The door without sound moved gradually under his hand A faint odor assailed his nostrils It was dark very dark Across the room in a direct line was the doorway of the inner room she had explained that in her letter It was slow progress to cross that room without sound in silence it was a snail s movement for fear that even a muscle might crack And now he stood in the inner doorway It was dark here to and yet how bizarre a star seemed to twinkle through the very roof of the room itself The odour was pungent now There was a long drawn sigh then a low indescribable sound of movement SOMEBODY APART FROM OLD LUDDY WAS IN THE ROOM It swept the full consciousness of it upon Jimmie Dale in an instantaneous flash Chloroform the open scuttle in the roof the waiting of those others all fused into a compact logical whole They had loosened the scuttle during the day probably when old Luddy was away one of them had crept down there now to chloroform the old man into insensibility the others would complete the ghastly work presently by stringing their victim up to the ceiling and it would be suicide for long before morning came long before the old man would be discovered the fumes of the chloroform would be gone It seemed like a cold hand deathlike clutching at his heart Was he too late after all Chloroform alone could kill To the right just a little to the right he must make no mistake his ear placed the sound He whipped his hands from the side pockets of his coat the ray of his flashlight cut across the room and fell upon an aged face upon a bed upon a hand clutching a wad of cloth the cloth pressed horribly against the nose and mouth of the upturned face and then roaring in the stillness spitting a vicious lane of fire that paralleled the flashlight s ray came the tongue flame of his automatic There was a yell a scream that echoed out reverberated and went racketing through the house and Jimmie Dale leaped forward over a table sending it crashing to the floor The man had reeled back against the wall clutching at a shattered wrist staring into the flashlight s eye white faced jaw dropped lips working in mingled pain and fear Harve Thoms you eh gritted Jimmie Dale A cunning look swept the distorted face Here apparently was only one man there were pals three of them only a few yards away You ain t got nothing on me he snarled sparring for time You police are too damned fresh with your guns I ll take yours snapped Jimmie Dale and snatched it deftly from the other s pocket This ain t any police job my bucko and you make a move and I ll drop you for keeps if what you ve got already ain t enough to teach you to keep your hands off jobs that belong to your betters He was working with mad haste as he spoke One minute at the outside was perhaps all he could count upon Already he had caught the rattle of the locked door down the hall He lit a match and turned on the gas over the bed it was the most dangerous thing he could do he knew that well enough none knew it better it was offering himself as a fair mark when the others rushed in as they would in a moment now but the Skeeter and his gang and this man here must have no misconception of his purpose his reason for being there the same as their own the theft of the stones and no misconception as to his SUCCESS Y ain t the police it came in a choked gasp from the other as he blinked in the sudden light Say then Shut up ordered Jimmie Dale curtly And mind what I told you about moving He leaned over the bed Old Luddy though under the influence of the chloroform was moving restlessly Thoms had evidently only begun to apply the chloroform old Luddy was safe Jimmie Dale ran his hand in under the pillow If you ain t swiped them already they ought to be here he growled and if you have I ll ah A little chamois bag was in his hand He laughed sneeringly at Thoms opened the bag allowed a few stones to trickle into his hand and then without stopping to replace them dashed stones and bag into his pocket The door along the corridor crashed open What s that he gasped out in well simulated fright and sprang for the ladder that led up to the roof It had all taken perhaps the minute that he had counted on no more Noises came from the floors below now a confusion of them the shot the scream had been heard by others save those who had been in the locked room And the latter were outside now in the corridor running to their accomplice s aid There was a pause at the outer door then an oath and coupled with the oath an exclamation The Gray Seal They had swept a flashlight over the door panel Jimmie Dale halfway up the ladder smiled grimly The door opened there was a rush of feet The man with the shattered wrist yelled cursing wildly Here he is on the ladder Let him have it Fill him full of holes Jimmie Dale was in the light they were in the dark of the outer room He fired at the threshold checking their rush as a hail of bullets chipped and tore at the ladder and spat wickedly against the wall He swung through to the roof trying as he did so to kick the ladder loose behind him It was fastened The three gunmen jumped into the room from the roof Jimmie Dale got a glimpse of them below as he flung himself clear of the opening Bullets whistled through the aperture a voice roared up as he gained his feet Come on After him The whole place is alive but this lets us out We can frame up how we came to be here easy enough Never mind the old geezer there any more Get the Gray Seal the reward that s out for him is worth twice the sparklers and Jimmie Dale hurled the cover over the scuttle He could have stood them off from above and kept the ladder clear with his revolver but the alarm seemed general now windows were opening voices were calling to one another from the windows across the street he must stand out in sharp outline against the sky Yes he was seen now A woman s voice from a top story window across the street screamed out high pitched in excitement There he is There he is On the roof there Jimmie Dale started on the run along the roof The houses built wall to wall flat roofed seemed to offer an open course ahead of him until a lane or an intersecting street should bar his way But they were not quite all on the same level though the wall of the next house rose suddenly breast high in front of him He flung himself up regained his feet and ducked instantly behind a chimney The crack of a revolver echoed through the night a bullet drummed through the air the Skeeter and his gang were on the roof now dashing forward firing as they ran Two shots from Jimmie Dale s automatic in quick succession cooled the ardour of their rush and they broke black flitting forms for the shelter of chimneys too And now the whole neighbourhood seemed awakened A dull toned roar as from some great gulf below rolled up from the street a medley of slamming windows the rush of feet as people poured from the houses cries shouts and yells and high over all the shrill call of the police patrol whistle and the CRACK CRACK CRACK of the Skeeter s revolver shots the Skeeter and his hellhounds for once self appointed allies of the law Twice again Jimmie Dale fired then crouching running low he zigzagged his way across the next roof The bullets followed him once more his pursuers dashed forward And again Jimmie Dale his face set like stone now his breath coming in hard gasps dodged behind a chimney and with his gun checked their rush for the third time He glanced about him and with a growing sense of disaster saw that two houses farther on the stretch of roof appeared to end There would be a lane or a street there And in another minute or two if it were not already the case others would be following the gunmen to the roof and then he would be he caught his breath suddenly in a queer little strangled cry of relief Just back of him a few yards away his eyes made out what in the darkness seemed to be a glass skylight A dark form sped like a deeper shadow across the black in front of him making for a chimney nearer by closing in the range Jimmie Dale fired wide Tight as was the corner he was in little as was the mercy deserved at his hands he could not after all bring himself to shoot to kill A voice the Skeeter s bawled out raucously Rush him all together from different sides at once A backward leap Jimmie Dale s boot was crashing glass and frame stamping at it desperately making a hole for his body through the skylight A yell a chorus of them answered this then the crunch of racing feet on the gravel roof He emptied his revolver sweeping the darkness with a semicircle of vicious flashes It seemed an hour it was barely the fraction of a second as he hung by his hands from the side of the skylight frame his body swinging back and forth in the unknown blackness below The skylight might be probably was directly over the stair well and open clear to the basement of the house but it was his only chance He swung his body well out let go and dropped With the impetus he smashed against a wall was flung back from it in a sort of rebound and his hands closed gripping fiercely on banisters It had been the stair well beyond any question of doubt but his swing had sent him clear of it Above they had not yet reached the skylight Jimmie Dale snatched a precious moment to listen as he rose and found himself apart from bruises perhaps unhurt There was commotion too in this house below the alarm had extended and spread along the block but the commotion was all in the FRONT of the house the street was the lure Jimmie Dale started down the stairs and in an instant he had gained the landing In another he had slipped to the rear of the hall somewhere there from the hall itself from one of the rear rooms there must be an exit to the fire escape To attempt to leave by the front way was certain capture They were yelling shouting down now through the sky light above as Jimmie Dale softly raised the window sash at the rear of the hall The fire escape was there Shouts from along the corridor from the tenement dwellers who had been crowding their neighbours rooms craning their necks probably from the front windows answered the shouts now from the roof and the skylight doors opened forms rushed out but it was dark in the corridor only a murky yellow at the upper end from the opened doors Jimmie Dale slipped through the window to the fire escape and working cautiously silently but with the speed of a trained athlete made his way down At the bottom he dropped from the iron platform into the back yard ran for the fence and climbed over into a lane on the other side And then as he ran Jimmie Dale snatched the mask from his face and put it in his pocket He was safe now He swept the sweat drops from his forehead with the back of his hand noticing them for the first time It had been close almost as close for him as it had been for old Luddy And to morrow the papers would execrate the Gray Seal He smiled a little wanly His breath was still coming hard Presently they would scour the lane when they found that their quarry was not in the house What a racket they were making The whole district seemed roused like a swarm of angry bees He kept on along the lane and dodged suddenly into a cross street where the two intersected The clang of a bell dinned discordantly in his ears a patrol wagon swept by him racing for the scene of the disturbance the riot call was out Again Jimmie Dale smiled wearily passing his hand across his eyes I guess said Jimmie Dale I m pretty near all in And I guess it s time that Larry the Bat went home And a little later a figure turned from the Bowery and shambled down the cross street a disreputable figure with hands plunged deep in his pockets and a shadow across the roadway suddenly shifted its position as the shambling figure slouched into the black alleyway and entered the tenement s side door And Larry the Bat smiled softly to himself Kline s men were still on guard CHAPTER VI DEVIL S WORK 
2416_152137_000007_000000	train-clean-100	A white gloved arm a voice and a silvery laugh 
none	none	Just that no more Jimmie Dale in his favourite seat an aisle seat some seven or eight rows back from the orchestra stared at the stage to all outward appearances absorbed in the last act of the play inwardly quite oblivious to the fact that even a play was going on A white gloved arm a voice and a silvery laugh 
2416_152137_000008_000001	train-clean-100	The words had formed themselves into a sort of singsong refrain that for the last few days had been running through his head 
none	none	A strange enough guiding star to mould and dictate every action in his life 
2416_152137_000008_000003	train-clean-100	And that was all he had ever seen of her all that he had ever heard of her except those letters of course each of which had outlined the details of some affair for the Gray Seal to execute 
2416_152137_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Indeed it seemed a great length of time now since he had heard from her even in that way though it was not so many days ago after all 
none	none	Perhaps it was the calm as it were that by contrast had given place to the strenuous months and weeks just past The storm raised by the newspapers at the theft of Old Luddy s diamonds had subsided into sporadic diatribes aimed at the police Kline of the secret service had finally admitted defeat and a shadow no longer skulked day and night at the entrance to the Sanctuary and Larry the Bat bore the government indorsement so to speak of being no more suspicious a character than that of a disreputable but harmless dope fiend of the underworld Larry the Bat The Gray Seal Jimmie Dale the millionaire What if it were ever known that that strange three were one 
2416_152137_000010_000004	train-clean-100	What if Jimmie Dale smiled whimsically 
2416_152137_000010_000005	train-clean-100	A burst of applause echoed through the house the orchestra was playing the lights were on seats banged there was the bustle of the rising audience the play was at an end and for the life of him he could not have remembered a single line of the last act 
2416_152137_000011_000000	train-clean-100	The aisle at his elbow was already crowded with people on their way out Jimmie Dale stooped down mechanically to reach for his hat beneath his seat and the next instant he was standing up staring wildly into the faces around him 
2416_152137_000012_000000	train-clean-100	It had fallen at his feet a white envelope 
none	none	Hers 
2416_152137_000012_000002	train-clean-100	It was in his hand now those slim tapering wonderfully sensitive fingers of Jimmie Dale that were an open sesame to locks and safes subconsciously telegraphing to his mind the fact that the texture of the paper was hers 
none	none	Hers 
2416_152137_000012_000004	train-clean-100	And she must be one of those around him one of those crowding either the row of seats in front or behind or one of those just passing in the aisle 
2416_152137_000012_000005	train-clean-100	It had fallen at his feet as he had stooped over for his hat but from just exactly what direction he could not tell 
2416_152137_000012_000006	train-clean-100	His eyes eagerly hungrily critically swept face after face Which one was hers 
2416_152137_000012_000007	train-clean-100	What irony 
2416_152137_000012_000008	train-clean-100	She whom he would have given his life to know for whom indeed he risked his life every hour of the twenty four was close to him now within reach and as far removed as though a thousand miles separated them 
2416_152137_000012_000009	train-clean-100	She was there but he could not recognise a face that he had never seen 
2416_152137_000013_000000	train-clean-100	With an effort he choked back the bitter impotent laugh that rose to his lips 
2416_152137_000013_000001	train-clean-100	They were talking laughing around him 
none	none	Her VOICE yes he had once heard that and that he would recognise again 
2416_152137_000013_000003	train-clean-100	He strained to catch to individualise the tone sounds that floated in a medley about him 
2416_152137_000013_000004	train-clean-100	It was useless of course every effort that he had ever made to find her had been useless 
2416_152137_000013_000005	train-clean-100	She was too clever far too clever for that she too would know that he could and would recognise her voice where he could recognise nothing else 
2416_152137_000014_000000	train-clean-100	And then suddenly he realised that he was attracting attention 
none	none	Level stares from the women returned his gaze and they edged away a little from his vicinity as they passed their escorts crowding somewhat belligerently into their places 
2416_152137_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Others in the same row of seats as his own were impatiently waiting to get by him 
2416_152137_000014_000003	train-clean-100	With a muttered apology Jimmie Dale raised the seat of his chair allowing these latter to pass him and then slipping the letter into his pocketbook he snatched up his hat from the seat rack 
none	none	There was still a chance 
2416_152137_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Knowing he was there she would be on her guard but in the lobby among the crowd and unaware of his presence there was the possibility that if he could reach the entrance ahead of her she too might be talking and laughing as she left the theatre Just a single word just a tone that was all he asked 
2416_152137_000016_000000	train-clean-100	The row of seats at whose end he stood was empty now and instead of stepping into the thronged aisle he made his way across to the opposite side of the theatre 
none	none	Here the far aisle was less crowded and in a minute he had gained the foyer confident that he was now in advance of her 
2416_152137_000016_000002	train-clean-100	The next moment he was lost in a jam of people in the lobby 
none	none	He moved slowly now very slowly allowing those behind to press by him on the way to the entrance A babel of voices rose about him as tight packed the mass of people jostled elbowed and pushed good naturedly 
2416_152137_000017_000002	train-clean-100	It was a voice now her voice that he was listening for but though it seemed that every faculty was strained and intent upon that one effort his eyes too had in no degree relaxed their vigilance and once half grimly half sardonically he smiled to himself 
2416_152137_000017_000003	train-clean-100	There would be an unexpected aftermath to this exodus of expensively gowned and bejewelled women with their prosperous well groomed escorts 
2416_152137_000028_000000	train-clean-100	aftermath 
none	none	to this exodus of expensively gowned and bejewelled women with their prosperous well groomed escorts 
2416_152137_000017_000004	train-clean-100	There was the Wowzer over there sleek dapper squirming in and out of the throng with the agility and stealth of a cat 
none	none	As Larry the Bat he had met the Wowzer many times as indeed he had met and was acquainted with most of the elite of the underworld The Wowzer beyond a shadow of doubt in his own profession stood upon a plane entirely by himself among those qualified to speak no one yet had ever questioned the Wowzer s claim to the distinction of being the most dexterous and finished poke getter in the United States The crowd thinned in the lobby thinned down to the last few belated stragglers who passed him as he still loitered in the entrance and then Jimmie Dale with a shrug of his shoulders that was a great deal more philosophical than the maddening sense of chagrin and disappointment that burned within him stepped out to the pavement and headed down Broadway 
2416_152137_000018_000001	train-clean-100	After all he had known it in his heart of hearts all the time it had always been the same it was only one more occasion added to the innumerable ones that had gone before in which she had eluded him 
2416_152137_000019_000000	train-clean-100	And now there was the letter 
none	none	Automatically he quickened his steps a little 
2416_152137_000019_000002	train-clean-100	It was useless futile profitless for the moment at least to disturb himself over his failure there was the letter 
none	none	His lips parted in a strange half serious half speculative smile 
2416_152137_000019_000004	train-clean-100	The letter that was paramount now 
2416_152137_000019_000005	train-clean-100	What new venture did the night hold in store for him 
2416_152137_000019_000006	train-clean-100	What sudden emergency was the Gray Seal called upon to face this time what role unrehearsed without warning must he play 
none	none	What story of grim desperate rascality would the papers credit him with when daylight came 
2416_152137_000019_000008	train-clean-100	Or would they carry in screaming headlines the announcement that the Gray Seal was caged and caught at last and in three inch type tell the world that the Gray Seal was Jimmie Dale 
2416_152137_000020_000000	train-clean-100	A block down he turned from Broadway out of the theatre crowds that streamed in both directions past him 
none	none	The letter 
2416_152137_000020_000002	train-clean-100	Almost feverishly now he was seeking an opportunity to open and read it unobserved an eagerness upon him that mingled exhilaration at the lure of danger with a sense of premonition that irritably inevitably was with him at moments such as these 
none	none	It seemed it always seemed that with an unopened letter of hers in his possession it was as though he were about to open a page in the Book of Fate and read as it were a pronouncement upon himself that might mean life or death He hurried on 
2416_152137_000021_000001	train-clean-100	People still passed by him too many 
2416_152137_000021_000002	train-clean-100	And then a cafe just ahead making a corner gave him the opportunity that he sought Away from the entrance on the side street the brilliant lights from the windows shone out on a comparatively deserted pavement 
none	none	There was ample light to read by even as far away from the window as the curb and Jimmie Dale with an approving nod turned the corner and walked along a few steps until opposite the farthest window but as he halted here at the edge of the street he glanced quickly behind him at a man whom he had just passed 
2416_152137_000021_000004	train-clean-100	The other had paused at the corner and was staring down the street 
none	none	Jimmie Dale instantly and nonchalantly produced his cigarette case selected a cigarette and fastidiously tapped its end on his thumb nail Inspector Burton in plain clothes he observed musingly to himself
2416_152137_000022_000001	train-clean-100	 I wonder if it s just a fluke or something else 
none	none	We ll see 
2416_152137_000023_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale took a box of matches from his pocket 
2416_152137_000023_000001	train-clean-100	The first would not light 
2416_152137_000023_000002	train-clean-100	The second broke and with an exclamation of annoyance he flung it away 
none	none	The third was making a fitful effort at life as another man emerged hastily from the cafe s side door hurried to the corner joined the man who was still loitering there and both together disappeared at a rapid pace down the street 
2416_152137_000024_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale whistled softly to himself 
2416_152137_000024_000001	train-clean-100	The second man was even better known than the first there was not a crook in New York but would side step Lannigan of headquarters and do it with amazing celerity if he could 
none	none	Something up But it s not my hunt muttered Jimmie Dale then with a shrug of his shoulders Queer the way those headquarters chaps fascinate and give me a thrill every time I see them even if I haven t a ghost of a reason for imagining that 
2416_152137_000026_000000	train-clean-100	The sentence was never finished 
none	none	Jimmie Dale s face was gray 
2416_152137_000026_000002	train-clean-100	The street seemed to rock about him and he stared like a man stricken white to the lips ahead of him 
2416_152137_000026_000003	train-clean-100	THE LETTER WAS GONE 
none	none	His hand wriggling from his empty pocket swept away the sweat beads that were bursting from his forehead 
2416_152137_000026_000005	train-clean-100	It had come at last the pitcher had gone once too often to the well 
none	none	Numbed for an instant his brain cleared now working with lightning speed leaping from premise to conclusion 
2416_152137_000027_000001	train-clean-100	The crush in the theatre lobby the pushing the jostling the close contact the Wowzer the slickest cleverest pickpocket in the United States 
2416_152137_000027_000002	train-clean-100	For a moment he could have laughed aloud in a sort of ghastly defiant mockery he himself had predicted an unexpected aftermath had he not 
none	none	Aftermath It was the END 
2416_152137_000028_000002	train-clean-100	An hour two hours and New York would be metamorphosed into a seething caldron of humanity bubbling with the news 
2416_152137_000028_000003	train-clean-100	It seemed that he could hear the screams of the newsboys now shouting their extras it seemed that he could see the people roused to frenzy swarming in excited crowds snatching at the papers he seemed to hear the mob s shouts swell in execration in exultation it seemed as though all around him had gone mad 
2416_152137_000028_000004	train-clean-100	The mystery of the Gray Seal was solved 
2416_152137_000028_000005	train-clean-100	It was Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale the millionaire the lion of society and there was ignominy for an honoured name and shame and disaster and convict stripes and sullen penitentiary walls or death 
2416_152137_000028_000006	train-clean-100	A felon s death the chair 
2416_152137_000029_000000	train-clean-100	He was running now his hands clenched at his sides his mind working subconsciously urging him onward in a blind as yet unrealised objectless way 
2416_152137_000029_000001	train-clean-100	And then gradually impulse gave way to calmer reason and he slowed his pace to a quick less noticeable walk 
2416_152137_000029_000002	train-clean-100	The Wowzer That was it 
2416_152137_000031_000000	train-clean-100	There was yet a chance 
none	none	the Wowzer 
2416_152137_000029_000004	train-clean-100	A merciless rage cold deadly settled upon him 
none	none	It was the Wowzer who had stolen his pocketbook and with it the letter 
2416_152137_000029_000006	train-clean-100	There could be no doubt of that Well there would be a reckoning at least before the end 
none	none	He was in a downtown subway train now the roar in his ears in consonance it seemed with the turmoil in his brain 
2416_152137_000030_000001	train-clean-100	But now too he was Jimmie Dale again and apart from the slightly outthrust jaw the tight closed lips impassive debonair composed 
none	none	There was yet a chance 
2416_152137_000031_000001	train-clean-100	As Larry the Bat he knew every den and lair below the dead line and he knew too the Wowzer s favourite haunts There was yet a chance only one in a thousand it was true almost too pitiful to be depended upon but yet a chance 
2416_152137_000031_000002	train-clean-100	The Wowzer had probably not worked alone and he and his pal or pals would certainly not remain uptown either to examine or divide their spoils they would wait until they were safe somewhere in one of their hell holes on the East Side 
2416_152139_000043_000002	train-clean-100	his pal 
none	none	or pals would certainly not remain uptown either to examine or divide their spoils they would wait until they were safe somewhere in one of their hell holes on the East Side 
2416_152137_000031_000003	train-clean-100	If he could find the Wowzer reach the man BEFORE THE LETTER WAS OPENED Jimmie Dale s lips grew tighter 
2416_152137_000031_000004	train-clean-100	THAT was the chance 
none	none	It he failed in that Jimmie Dale s lips drooped downward in grim curves at the corners A chance Already the Wowzer had at least a half hour s lead and worse still there was no telling which one of a dozen places the man might have chosen to retreat to with his loot Time passed 
2416_152137_000032_000001	train-clean-100	His mind obsessed Jimmie Dale s physical acts were almost wholly mechanical 
2416_152137_000032_000002	train-clean-100	It was perhaps fifteen minutes since he had discovered the loss of the letter and he was walking now through the heart of the Bowery 
2416_152137_000032_000003	train-clean-100	Exactly how he had got there he could not have told he had only a vague realisation that following an intuitive sense of direction he had lost not a second of time in making his way downtown 
2416_152137_000033_000000	train-clean-100	And now he found himself hesitating at the corner of a cross street 
2416_152137_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Two blocks east was that dark narrow alleyway that side door that made the entrance to the Sanctuary 
none	none	It would be safer a hundred times safer to go there change his clothes and his personality and emerge again as Larry the Bat infinitely safer in that role to explore the dens of the underworld many of them indeed unknown and undreamed of by the police themselves than to trust himself there in well cut fashionable tweeds but that would take time Time When with every second the one chance he had desperate as that already was was slipping away from him 
2416_152137_000033_000005	train-clean-100	No what was apparently the greater risk at least held out the only hope 
2416_152137_000034_000000	train-clean-100	He went on again his brain incessantly at work 
2416_152137_000034_000001	train-clean-100	At the worst there was one mitigating factor in it all 
2416_152137_000034_000002	train-clean-100	He had no need to think of her Whatever the ruin and disaster that faced him in the next few hours she in any case was safe 
2416_152137_000034_000003	train-clean-100	There was no clew to HER identity in the letter and where he for months on end with even more to work upon had failed at every turn to trace her there was little fear that any one else would have any better success 
2416_152137_000034_000004	train-clean-100	She was safe 
2416_152137_000034_000005	train-clean-100	As for himself that was different 
none	none	The Gray Seal would be referred to in the letter there would be the outline the data for the crime she had planned for that night and the letter though unaddressed being found in his pocketbook where cards and notes and a dozen different things among its contents proclaimed him Jimmie Dale needed no further evidence as to its ownership nor the identity of the Gray Seal Jimmie Dale s fingers crept inside his vest and fumbled there for a moment and a diamond stud extracted from his shirt front glistened sportively in the necktie that was now tucked jauntily in at one side of his shirt bosom He had reached the Blue Dragon one of Wowzer s usual hang outs and swerving from the sidewalk entered the place There was wild tumult within a constant storm of applause derision and hilarity that was hurled from the tables around the room at the turkey trotting tango writhing couples on the somewhat restricted space of polished hardwood flooring in the centre Jimmie Dale swaggered down the room a cigar tilted up at an angle between his teeth his soft felt hat a little rakishly on one side of his head and well over his nose At the end of the room at the bar Jimmie Dale leaned toward the barkeeper and talked out of the corner of his mouth There were private rooms upstairs and he jerked his head surreptitiously ceilingward Say is de Wowzer up dere he inquired in a cautious whisper The man behind the bar well known to Jimmie Dale as one of the Wowzer s particular pals favoured him with a blank stare Never heard of de guy he announced brusquely Wot s yours
2416_152137_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Gimme a mug of suds said Jimmie Dale reaching for a match 
none	none	He puffed at his cigar blew out the match and after a moment flung the charred end away but on his hand as palm outward he raised it to take his glass the match had traced a small black cross The barkeeper put down the beer he had just drawn wiped his hand hurriedly and with sudden enthusiasm thrust it across the bar
2416_152137_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 Glad to know youse cull he exclaimed 
none	none	Wot s de lay Jimmie Dale smiled
2416_152137_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Nix said Jimmie Dale 
2416_152137_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 I just blew in from Chicago 
2416_152137_000044_000002	train-clean-100	Used to know de Wowzer dere 
none	none	He said dis place was on de level an I could always find him here dat s all
2416_152137_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 Sure youse can returned the barkeeper heartily 
none	none	Only he ain t here now 
2416_152137_000045_000002	train-clean-100	He beat it about fifteen minutes ago him an Dago Jim 
none	none	I guess youse ll find him at Chang s I heard him an Dago say dey was goin dere 
2416_152137_000045_000004	train-clean-100	Know de place 
none	none	Jimmie Dale shook his head
2416_152137_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 I ain t much wise to New York he explained 
none	none	Aw dat s easy whispered the barkeeper Go down to Chatham Square an den any guy ll show youse 
2416_152137_000052_000000	train-clean-100	Chang Foo s 
none	none	He winked confidentially
2416_152137_000048_000002	train-clean-100	 I guess youse won t bump yer head none gettin around inside 
2416_152137_000049_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale nodded grinned back emptied his glass and dug for a coin 
2416_152137_000050_000000	train-clean-100	 Forget it observed the barkeeper cordially 
none	none	Dis is on me Any friend of de Wowzer s gets de glad hand here any time
2416_152137_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 T anks said Jimmie Dale gratefully as he turned away 
none	none	So long then see youse later Chang Foo s Jimmie Dale s face set even a little harder than it had before as he swung on again down the Bowery 
2416_152137_000052_000002	train-clean-100	Yes he knew Chang Foo s too well 
2416_152137_000052_000003	train-clean-100	Underground Chinatown where a man s life was worth the price of an opium pill or less 
2416_152137_000052_000004	train-clean-100	Mechanically his hand slipped into his pocket and closed over the automatic that nestled there 
2416_152137_000052_000005	train-clean-100	Once in where he had to go and the chances were even just even that was all that he would ever get out 
2416_152137_000052_000006	train-clean-100	Again he was tempted to return to the Sanctuary and make the attempt as Larry the Bat 
2416_152137_000052_000007	train-clean-100	Larry the Bat was well enough known to enter Chang Foo s unquestioned and but again he shook his head and went on 
2416_152137_000052_000008	train-clean-100	There was not time 
none	none	The Wowzer and his pal it was Dago Jim it seemed had evidently been drinking and loitering their way downtown from the theatre and he had gained that much on them but by now they would be smugly tucked away somewhere in that maze of dens below the ground and at that moment probably were gloating over the biggest night s haul they had ever made in their lives And if they were What then 
2416_152137_000053_000002	train-clean-100	Once they knew the contents of that letter what then 
2416_152137_000053_000003	train-clean-100	Buy them off for a larger amount than the many thousands offered for the capture of the Gray Seal 
2416_152137_000053_000004	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale gritted his teeth 
2416_152137_000053_000005	train-clean-100	That meant blackmail from them all his life an intolerable existence impossible a hell on earth the slave at the beck and call of two of the worst criminals in New York 
none	none	The moisture oozed again to Jimmie Dale s forehead 
2416_152137_000053_000007	train-clean-100	God if he could get that letter before it was opened before they KNEW 
2416_152137_000053_000008	train-clean-100	If he could only get the chance to fight for it against ANY odds 
none	none	Life Life was a pitiful consideration against the alternative that faced him now From the Blue Dragon to Chang Foo s was not far and Jimmie Dale covered the distance in well under five minutes Chang Foo s was just a tea merchant s shop innocuous and innocent enough in its appearance blandly so indeed and that was all outwardly but Jimmie Dale as he reached his destination experienced the first sensation of uplift he had known that night and this from what apparently did not in the least seem like a contributing cause Luck The blessed luck of it he muttered grimly as he surveyed the sight seeing car drawn up at the curb and watched the passengers crowding out of it to the ground It wouldn t have been as easy to fool old Chang as it was that fellow back at the Dragon and besides if I can work it there s a better chance this way of getting out alive The guide was marshalling his gapers some two dozen in all men and women Jimmie Dale unostentatiously fell in at the rear and the guide leading the little crowd passed into the tea merchant s shop Chang Foo a wizened wrinkled faced little Celestial oily suave greeted them with profuse bows chattering the while volubly in Chinese The guide made the introduction with an all embracing sweep of his hand Chang Foo ladies and gentlemen he announced then held up his hand for silence Ladies and gentlemen he said impressively this is one of the most notorious if not THE most notorious dive in Chinatown and it is only through special arrangement with the authorities and at great expense that the company is able exclusively to gain an entree here for its patrons You will see here the real life of the Chinese and in half an hour you will get what few would get in a lifetime spent in China itself You will see the Chinese children dance and perform the Chinese women at their household tasks the joss the shrine of his hallowed ancestors at which Chang Foo here worships and you will enter the most famous opium den in the United States Now if you will all keep close together we will make a start In spite of his desperate situation Jimmie Dale smiled a little whimsically Yes they would see it all UPSTAIRS The same old bunk dished out night after night at so much a head and the nervous little schoolma am of uncertain age who fidgeted now beside him would go back somewhere down in Maine and shiver while she related her wider experiences in tremulous whispers into the shocked ears of envious other maiden ladies of equally uncertain age The same old bunk and a profitable one for Chang Foo for more reasons than one It was dust in the eyes of the police The police smiled knowingly at mention of Chang Foo Who should know if they didn t that it was all harmless fake all bunk And so it was UPSTAIRS They were passing out of the shop now bowed out through a side door by the obsequious and oily Chang Foo And now they massed again in a sort of little hallway and Chang Foo closing the door upon Jimmie Dale who was the last in the line shuffled back behind the counter in his shop to resume his guard duty over customers of quite another ilk With the door closed it was dark pitch dark And this too like everything else connected with Chang Foo s establishment for more reasons than one for effect and for security Nervous little twitters began to emanate from the women the guide s voice rose reassuringly Keep close together ladies and gentlemen We are going upstairs now to Jimmie Dale hugged back against the wall sidled along it and like a shadow slipped down to the end of the hall The scuffling of two dozen pairs of feet mounting the creaky staircase drowned the slight sound as he cautiously opened a door the darkness lay black impenetrable along the hall And then as cautiously as he had opened it he closed the door behind him and stood for an instant listening at the head of a ladder like stairway his automatic in his hand now It was familiar ground to Larry the Bat The steps led down to a cellar and diagonally across from the foot of the steps was an opening ingeniously hidden by a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends boxes cases and rubbish from the pseudo tea shop above a low opening in the wall to a passage that led on through the cellars of perhaps half a dozen adjoining houses each of which latter was leased in one name or another by Chang Foo Jimmie Dale crept down the steps and in another moment had gained the farther side of the cellar then skirting around the ruck of cases he stooped suddenly and passed in through the opening in the wall And now he halted once more He was straining his eyes down a long narrow passage whose blackness was accentuated rather than relieved by curious wavering gossamer threads of yellow light that showed here and there from under makeshift thresholds from doors slightly ajar Faint noises came to him a muffled intermittent clink of coin a low continuous droning hum of voices the sickly sweet smell of opium pricked at his nostrils Jimmie Dale s face set rigidly It was the resort not only of the most depraved Chinese element but of the worst white thugs that made New York their headquarters here in the succession of cellars roughly partitioned off to make a dozen rooms on either side of the passage dope fiends sucked at the drug and Chinese gamblers spent the greater part of their lives here murder was hatched and played too often to its hellish end here the scum of the underworld sought refuge from the police to the profit of Chang Foo and here somewhere in one of these rooms was the Wowzer The Wowzer Jimmie Dale stole forward silently without a sound swiftly pausing only to listen for a second s space at the doors as he passed From this one came that clink of coin from another that jabber of Chinese from still another that overpowering stench of opium and once iron nerved as he was a cold thrill passed over him Let this lair of hell s wolves so intent now on their own affairs be once roused as they certainly must be roused before he could hope to finish the Wowzer and his chances of escape were He straightened suddenly alert tense strained Voices raised in a furious quarrel came from a door just beyond him on the other side of the passage where a film of light streamed out through a cracked panel it was the Wowzer and Dago Jim And drunk both of them and both in a blind fury It happened quick then almost instantaneously it seemed to Jimmie Dale He was crouched now close against the door his eye to the crack in the panel There was only one figure in sight Dago Jim standing beside a table on which burned a lamp the table top littered with watches purses and small chatelaine bags The man was lurching unsteadily on his feet a vicious sneer of triumph on his face waving tauntingly an open letter and Jimmie Dale s pocket book in his hands waving them presumably in the face of the Wowzer whom from the restrictions of the crack Jimmie Dale could not see He was conscious of a sickening sense of disaster His hope against hope had been in vain the letter had been opened and read THE IDENTITY OF THE GRAY SEAL WAS SOLVED Dago Jim s voice roared out hoarse blasphemous in drunken rage De Gray Seal see Youse betcher life I knows I been waitin fer somet ing like dis damn youse Youse been stallin on me fer a year every time it came to a divvy Youse ve got a pocketful now youse snitched to night dat youse are tryin to do me out of Well keep em he shoved his face forward I keeps dis see Keep em Wowzer youse cross eyed Everyt ing I pinched to night s on de table dere wid wot youse pinched yerself cut in the Wowzer in a sullen threatening growl Youse lie an youse knows it retorted Dago Jim Youse have given me de short end every time we ve pulled a deal Dat letter s

billy doo eh Well t anks Wowzer dat s wot it is Say he mocked dere s a guy ll cash a t ousand century notes fer dis an if he don t say dere s SOME reward out fer the Gray Seal Wouldn t youse like to know who it is Well when I m ridin in me private buzz wagon Wowzer youse stick around an mabbe I ll tell youse an mabbe I won t By God the Wowzer s voice rose in a scream youse hand over dat letter Youse go to Red lurid red a stream of flame seemed to cut across Jimmie Dale s line of vision came the roar of a revolver shot and like a madman Jimmie Dale flung his body at the door Rickety at best it crashed inward half wrenched from its hinges precipitating him inside He recovered himself and leaped forward The room was swirling with blue eddies of smoke Dago Jim hands flung up still grasping letter and pocketbook pawed at the air and plunged with a sagging lurch face downward to the floor There was a yell and an oath from the Wowzer the crack of another revolver shot the hum of the bullet past Jimmie Dale s ear the scorch of the tongue flame in his face and he was upon the other Screeching profanity the Wowzer grappled and for an instant the two men rocked reeled and swayed in each other s embrace then both men losing their balance they shot suddenly backward the Wowzer undermost striking his head against the table s edge and men table and lamp crashed downward in a heap to the floor It had been no more at most than a matter of seconds since Jimmie Dale had hurled himself into the room and now with a gurgling sigh the Wowzer s arms that had been wound around Jimmie Dale s back and shoulders relaxed and from the blow on his head the man lay back inert and stunned And then it seemed to Jimmie Dale as though pandemonium unreality and chaos at the touch of some devil s hand reigned around him It was dark no not dark a spurt of flame was leaping along the line of trickling oil from the broken lamp on the floor It threw into ghastly relief the sprawled form of Dago Jim Outside from along the passageway came a confused jangle of commotion whispering voices shuffling feet the swish of Chinese garments And the room itself began to spring into weird flickering shadows that mounted and crept up the walls with the spreading fire There was not a second to lose before the room would be swarming with that rush from the passageway and there was still the letter the pocketbook The table had fallen half over Dago Jim Jimmie Dale pushed it aside tore the crushed letter and the pocketbook from the man s hands and felt with a grim horrible sort of anxiety for the other s heartbeat for the verdict that meant life or death to himself There was no sign of life the man was dead Jimmie Dale was on his feet now A face another and another showed in the doorway the Wowzer was regaining his senses stumbling to his knees There was one chance just one to take those crowding figures by surprise And with a yell of Fire Jimmie Dale sprang for the doorway They gave way before his rush tumbling back in their surprise against the opposite wall and turning Jimmie Dale raced down the passageway Doors were opening everywhere now forms were pushing out into the semi darkness only to duck hastily back again as Jimmie Dale s automatic barked and spat a running fire of warning ahead of him And then behind the Wowzer s voice shrieked out Soak him Kill de guy He s croaked Dago Jim Put a hole in him de Yells a chorus of them took up the refrain then the rush of following feet and the passageway seemed to racket as though a Gatling gun were in play with the fusillade of revolver shots But Jimmie Dale was at the opening now and like a base runner plunging for the bag he flung himself in a low dive through and into the open cellar beyond He was on his feet over the boxes and dashing up the stairs in a second The door above opened as he reached the top Jimmie Dale s right hand shot out with clubbed revolver and with a grunt Chang Foo went down before the blow and the headlong rush The next instant Jimmie Dale had sprung through the tea shop and was out on the street A minute two minutes more and Chinatown would be in an uproar Chang Foo would see to that and the Wowzer would prod him on The danger was far from over yet And then as he ran Jimmie Dale gave a little gasp of relief Just ahead drawn up at the curb stood a taxicab waiting probably for a private slumming party Jimmie Dale put on a spurt reached it and wrenched the door open Quick he flung at the startled chauffeur The nearest subway station there s a ten spot in it for you Quick man QUICK Here they come A crowd of Chinese pouring like angry hornets from Chang Foo s shop came yelling down the street and the taxi took the corner on two wheels and Jimmie Dale panting choking for his breath like a man spent sank back against the cushions But five minutes later it was quite another Jimmie Dale composed nonchalant imperturbable who entered an up town subway train and choosing a seat alone near the centre of the car which at that hour of night in the downtown district was almost deserted took the crushed letter from his pocket For a moment he made no attempt to read it his dark eyes now that he was free from observation full of troubled retrospect fixed on the window at his side It was not a pleasant thought that it had cost a man his life nor yet that that life was also the price of his own freedom True if there were two men in the city of New York whose crimes merited neither sympathy nor mercy those two men were the Wowzer and Dago Jim but yet after all it was a human life and even if his own had been in the balance thank God it had been through no act of his that Dago Jim had gone out The Wowzer cute and cunning had been quick enough to say so to clear himself but Jimmie Dale smiled a little now neither the Wowzer nor Chang Foo nor Chinatown would ever be in a position to recognise their uninvited guest Jimmie Dale s eyes shifted to the letter speculatively gravely It seemed as though the night had already held a year of happenings and the night was not over yet there was the letter It had already cost one life was it to cost another or what It began as it always did He read it through once in amazement a second time with a flush of bitter anger creeping to his cheeks and a third time curiously memorising as it were snatches of it here and there DEAR

and Lannigan of headquarters trailing him now robbery not yet made public There was a great deal more four sheets of closely written data With an exclamation almost of dismay Jimmie Dale pulled out his watch So that was what Burton and Lannigan were up to And he had actually run into them Lord the irony of it The And then Jimmie Dale stared at the dial of his watch incredulously It was still but barely midnight It seemed impossible that since leaving the theatre at a few minutes before eleven he had lived through but a single hour Jimmie Dale s fingers began to pluck at the letter tearing it into pieces tearing the pieces over and over again into tiny shreds The train stopped at station after station people got on and off Jimmie Dale s hat was over his eyes and his eyes were glued again to the window Had Bookkeeper Bob returned to his flat in Harlem with the detectives at his heels or were Burton and Lannigan still trailing the man downtown somewhere around the cafe s If the former the theft of the letter and its incident loss of time had been an irreparable disaster if the latter well who knew The risk was the Gray Seal s At One Hundred and Twenty Fifth Street Jimmie Dale left the train and at the end of a sharp four minutes walk during which he had dodged in and out from street to street stopped on a corner to survey the block ahead of him It was a block devoted exclusively to flats and apartment houses and apart from a few belated pedestrians was deserted Jimmie Dale strolled leisurely down one side crossed the street at the end of the block and strolled leisurely back on the other side there was no sign of either Burton or Lannigan It was a fairly safe presumption then that Bookkeeper Bob had not returned yet or one of the detectives at least would have been shadowing the house Jimmie Dale smiling a little grimly retraced his steps again and turned deliberately into a doorway whose number he had noted as he had passed a moment or so before So after all there was time yet This was the house Number eighteen she had said in her letter A flat three stories Moyne lives on ground floor Jimmie Dale leaned against the vestibule door there was a faint click a little steel instrument was withdrawn from the lock and Jimmie Dale stepped into the hall where a gas jet turned down burned dimly The door of the ground floor apartment was at his right Jimmie Dale reached up and turned off the light Again those slim tapering wonderfully sensitive fingers worked with the little steel instrument this time in the lock of the apartment door again there was that almost inaudible click and then cautiously inch by inch the door opened under his hand He peered inside down a hallway lighted if it could be called lighted at all by a subdued glow from two open doors that gave upon it peered intently listening intently as he drew a black silk mask from his pocket and slipped it over his face And then silent as a shadow in his movements the door left just ajar behind him he stole down the carpeted hallway Opposite the first of the open doorways Jimmie Dale paused a curiously hard expression creeping over his face his lips beginning to droop ominously downward at the corners It was a little sitting room cheaply but tastefully furnished and a young woman Bookkeeper Bob s wife evidently and evidently sitting up for her husband had fallen sound asleep in a chair her head pillowed on her arms that were outstretched across the table For a moment Jimmie Dale held there his eyes on the scene and the next moment his hand curved into a clenched fist he had passed on and entered the adjoining room It was a child s bedroom A night lamp burned on a table beside the bed and the soft rays seemed to play and linger in caress on the tousled golden hair of a little girl of perhaps two years of age and something seemed to choke suddenly in Jimmie Dale s throat the sweet innocent little face upturned to his was smiling at him as she slept Jimmie Dale turned away his head his eyelashes wet under his mask BENEATH THE MATTRESS OF THE CHILD S BED the letter had said His face like stone his lips a thin line now Jimmie Dale s hand reached deftly in without disturbing the child and took out a package and then another He straightened up a bundle of crisp new hundred dollar notes in each hand and on the top of one slipped under the elastic band that held the bills together an unsealed envelope He drew out the latter and opened it it was a second class steamship passage to Vera Cruz made out in a fictitious name of course to John Davies the booking for next day s sailing From the ticket from the stolen money Jimmie Dale s eyes lifted to rest again on the little golden head the smiling lips and then dropping the packages into his pockets his own lips moving queerly he turned abruptly to the door My God the shame of it he whispered to himself He crept down the corridor past the open door of the room where the young woman still sat fast asleep and his mask in his pocket again stepped softly into the vestibule and from there to the street Jimmie Dale hurried now spurred on it seemed by a hot insensate fury that raged within him there was still one other call to make that night still those remaining and minute details in the latter part of her letter grim and ugly in their portent 
2416_152139_000001_000000	train-clean-100	It was close upon one o clock in the morning when Jimmie Dale stopped again this time before a fashionable dwelling just off Central Park And here for perhaps the space of a minute he surveyed the house from the sidewalk watching with a sort of speculative satisfaction a man s shadow that passed constantly to and fro across the drawn blinds of one of the lower windows 
2416_152139_000001_000001	train-clean-100	The rest of the house was in darkness 
2416_152139_000002_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes said Jimmie Dale nodding his head I rather thought so 
2416_152139_000002_000001	train-clean-100	The servants will have retired hours ago 
2416_152139_000002_000002	train-clean-100	It s safe enough 
2416_152139_000003_000000	train-clean-100	He ran quickly up the steps and rang the bell 
2416_152139_000003_000001	train-clean-100	A door opened almost instantly sending a faint glow into the hall from the lighted room a hurried step crossed the hall and the outer door was thrown back 
2416_152139_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Well what is it demanded a voice brusquely 
2416_152139_000005_000000	train-clean-100	It was quite dark too dark for either to distinguish the other s features and Jimmie Dale s hat was drawn far down over his eyes 
2416_152139_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 I want to see mister Thomas H Carling cashier of the Hudson Mercantile National Bank it s very important said Jimmie Dale earnestly 
2416_152139_000085_000000	train-clean-100	 Thomas H Carling 
none	none	cashier of the Hudson Mercantile National Bank it s very important said Jimmie Dale earnestly
2416_152139_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 I am mister Carling replied the other 
none	none	What is it Jimmie Dale leaned forward
2416_152139_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 From headquarters with a report he said in a low tone 
none	none	Ah exclaimed the bank official sharply
2416_152139_000010_000001	train-clean-100	 Well it s about time 
2416_152139_000010_000002	train-clean-100	I ve been waiting up for it though I expected you would telephone rather than this 
none	none	Come in
2416_152139_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Thank you said Jimmie Dale courteously and stepped into the hall 
2416_152139_000012_000000	train-clean-100	The other closed the front door 
2416_152139_000012_000001	train-clean-100	 The servants are in bed of course he explained as he led the way toward the lighted room 
2416_152139_000012_000002	train-clean-100	 This way please 
2416_152139_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Behind the other across the hall Jimmie Dale followed and close at Carling s heels entered the room which was fitted up quite evidently regardless of cost as a combination library and study 
2416_152139_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Carling in a somewhat pompous fashion walked straight ahead toward the carved mahogany flat topped desk and as he reached it waved his hand 
2416_152139_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Take a chair he said over his shoulder and then turning in the act of dropping into his own chair grasped suddenly at the edge of the desk instead and with a low startled cry stared across the room 
2416_152139_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale was leaning back against the door that was closed now behind him and on Jimmie Dale s face was a black silk mask 
2416_152139_000016_000000	train-clean-100	For an instant neither man spoke nor moved then Carling spare built dapper in evening clothes edged back from the desk and laughed a little uncertainly 
2416_152139_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 Quite neat 
2416_152139_000017_000001	train-clean-100	I compliment you 
2416_152139_000017_000002	train-clean-100	From headquarters with a report I think you said 
2416_152139_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Which I neglected to add said Jimmie Dale was to be made in private 
2416_152139_000020_000001	train-clean-100	 in private 
none	none	Carling as though to put as much distance between them as possible continued to edge back across the room but his small black eyes black now to the pupils themselves never left Jimmie Dale s face
2416_152139_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 In private eh he seemed to be sparring for time as he smiled 
none	none	In private 
2416_152139_000020_000002	train-clean-100	You ve a strange method of securing privacy haven t you 
2416_152139_000020_000003	train-clean-100	A bit melodramatic isn t it 
2416_152139_000020_000004	train-clean-100	Perhaps you ll be good enough to tell me who you are 
2416_152139_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale smiled indulgently 
none	none	My mask is only for effect he said
2416_152139_000022_000001	train-clean-100	 My name is Smith 
2416_152139_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes said Carling 
2416_152139_000023_000001	train-clean-100	 I am very stupid 
none	none	Thank you 
2416_152139_000023_000003	train-clean-100	I he had reached the other side of the room now and with a quick sudden movement jerked his hand to the dial of the safe that stood against the wall 
none	none	But Jimmie Dale was quicker without shifting his position his automatic whipped from his pocket held a disconcerting bead on Carling s forehead
2416_152139_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 Please don t do that said Jimmie Dale softly 
2416_152139_000025_000001	train-clean-100	 It s rather a good make that safe 
2416_152139_000025_000002	train-clean-100	I dare say it would take me half an hour to open it 
2416_152139_000025_000003	train-clean-100	I was rather curious to know whether it was locked or not 
2416_152139_000026_000000	train-clean-100	Carling s hand dropped to his side 
2416_152139_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 So he sneered 
2416_152139_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 That s it is it 
none	none	The ordinary variety of sneak thief His voice was rising gradually Well sir let me tell you that
2416_152139_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 mister Carling said Jimmie Dale in a low even tone unless you moderate your voice some one in the house might hear you I am quite well aware of that 
2416_152139_000028_000001	train-clean-100	But if that happens if any one enters this room if you make a move to touch a button or in any other way attempt to attract attention I ll drop you where you stand His hand behind his back extracted the key from the door lock held it up for the other to see then dropped it into his pocket and his voice cold before rang peremptorily now 
2416_152139_000028_000002	train-clean-100	 Come back to the desk and sit down in that chair he ordered 
2416_152139_000029_000000	train-clean-100	For a moment Carling hesitated then with a half muttered oath obeyed 
2416_152139_000030_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale moved over and stood in front of Carling on the other side of the desk and stared silently at the immaculate fashionably groomed figure before him 
2416_152139_000031_000000	train-clean-100	Under the prolonged gaze Carling s composure in a measure at least seemed to forsake him 
2416_152139_000031_000001	train-clean-100	He began to drum nervously with his fingers on the desk and shift uneasily in his chair 
2416_152139_000032_000000	train-clean-100	And then from first one pocket and then the other Jimmie Dale took the two packages of banknotes and still with out a word pushed them across the desk until they lay under the other s eyes 
2416_152139_000033_000000	train-clean-100	Carling s fingers stopped their drumming slid to the desk edge tightened there and a whiteness crept into his face 
2416_152139_000033_000001	train-clean-100	Then with an effort he jerked himself erect in his chair 
2416_152139_000034_000000	train-clean-100	 What s this he demanded hoarsely 
2416_152139_000035_000000	train-clean-100	 About ten thousand dollars I should say said Jimmie Dale slowly 
2416_152139_000035_000001	train-clean-100	 I haven t counted it 
2416_152139_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Your bank was robbed this evening at closing time I understand 
2416_152139_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes Carling s voice was excited now the colour back in his face But you how do you mean that you are returning the money to the bank 
2416_152139_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 Exactly said Jimmie Dale 
2416_152139_000038_000000	train-clean-100	Carling was once more the pompous bank official 
2416_152139_000038_000001	train-clean-100	He leaned back and surveyed Jimmie Dale critically with his little black eyes 
2416_152139_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah quite so he observed 
2416_152139_000039_000001	train-clean-100	 That accounts for the mask 
none	none	But I am still a little in the dark 
2416_152139_000039_000003	train-clean-100	Under the circumstances it is quite impossible that you should have stolen the money yourself and 
2416_152139_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 I didn t said Jimmie Dale 
none	none	I found it hidden in the home of one of your employees
2416_152139_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 You found it WHERE 
2416_152139_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 In Moyne s home up in Harlem 
2416_152139_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Moyne eh Carling was alert quick now jerking out his words 
none	none	How did you come to get into this then His pal 
2416_152139_000043_000003	train-clean-100	Double crossing him eh 
2416_152139_000043_000004	train-clean-100	I suppose you want a reward we ll attend to that of course 
none	none	You re wiser than you know my man 
2416_152139_000043_000006	train-clean-100	That s what we suspected 
none	none	We ve had the detectives trailing Moyne all evening He reached forward over the desk for the telephone
2416_152139_000043_000008	train-clean-100	 I ll telephone headquarters to make the arrest at once 
2416_152139_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Just a minute interposed Jimmie Dale gravely 
2416_152139_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 I want you to listen to a little story first 
2416_152139_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 A story 
2416_152139_000045_000001	train-clean-100	What has a story got to do with this snapped Carling 
none	none	The man has got a home said Jimmie Dale softly A home and a wife and a little baby girl
2416_152139_000047_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh that s the game then eh 
none	none	You want to plead for him Carling flung out gruffly
2416_152139_000047_000002	train-clean-100	 Well he should have thought of all that before 
2416_152139_000047_000003	train-clean-100	It s quite useless for you to bring it up 
2416_152139_000047_000004	train-clean-100	The man has had his chance already a better chance than any one with his record ever had before We took him into the bank knowing that he was an ex convict but believing that we could make an honest man of him and this is the result 
none	none	And yet NO said Carling icily You refuse absolutely Jimmie Dale s voice had a lingering wistful note in it I refuse said Carling bluntly
2416_152139_000051_000001	train-clean-100	 I won t have anything to do with it 
2416_152139_000052_000000	train-clean-100	There was just an instant s silence and then with a strange slow creeping motion as a panther creeps when about to spring Jimmie Dale projected his body across the desk far across it toward the other 
none	none	And the muscles of his jaw were quivering his words rasping choked with the sweep of fury that held back so long broke now in a passionate surge And shall I tell you why you won t 
2416_152139_000053_000001	train-clean-100	Your bank was robbed to night of one hundred thousand dollars 
2416_152139_000053_000002	train-clean-100	There are ten thousand here 
none	none	THE OTHER NINETY THOUSAND ARE IN YOUR SAFE
2416_152139_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 You lie Ashen to the lips Carling had risen in his chair 
2416_152139_000054_000001	train-clean-100	 You lie he cried 
none	none	Do you hear You lie 
2416_152139_000054_000004	train-clean-100	I tell you you lie 
2416_152139_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale s lips parted ominously 
2416_152139_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Sit down he gritted between his teeth 
2416_152139_000057_000000	train-clean-100	The white in Carling s face had turned to gray his lips were working mechanically he sank down again in his chair 
2416_152139_000058_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale still leaned over the desk resting his weight on his right elbow the automatic in his right hand covering Carling 
none	none	You cur whispered Jimmie Dale
2416_152139_000059_000001	train-clean-100	 There s just one reason only one that keeps me from putting a bullet through you while you sit there We ll get to that in a moment 
none	none	There is that little story first shall I tell it to you now 
2416_152139_000059_000003	train-clean-100	For the past four years and God knows how many before that you ve gone the pace 
2416_152139_000059_000004	train-clean-100	The lavishness of this bachelor establishment of yours is common talk in New York far in excess of a bank cashier s salary 
2416_152139_000059_000005	train-clean-100	But you were supposed to be a wealthy man in your own right and so in reality you were once 
none	none	But you went through your fortune two years ago Counted a model citizen an upright man an honour to the community what were you Carling What ARE you Shall I tell you Roue gambler leading a double life of the fastest kind You did it cleverly Carling hid it well but your game is up To night for instance you are at the end of your tether swamped with debts exposure threatening you at any moment 
2416_152139_000059_000013	train-clean-100	Why don t you tell me again that I lie Carling 
2416_152139_000060_000000	train-clean-100	But now the man made no answer 
2416_152139_000060_000001	train-clean-100	He had sunk a little deeper in his chair a dawning look of terror in the eyes that held fascinated on Jimmie Dale 
2416_152139_000061_000000	train-clean-100	 You cur said Jimmie Dale again 
2416_152139_000061_000001	train-clean-100	 You cur with your devil s work 
2416_152139_000061_000002	train-clean-100	A year ago you saw this night coming when you must have money or face ruin and exposure 
none	none	You saw it then a year ago the day that Moyne concealing nothing of his prison record applied through friends for a position in the bank 
2416_152139_000061_000004	train-clean-100	Your company officials were opposed to his appointment but you do you remember how you pleaded to give the man his chance and in your hellish ingenuity saw your way then out of the trap 
2416_152139_000061_000005	train-clean-100	An ex convict from Sing Sing 
2416_152139_000061_000006	train-clean-100	It was enough wasn t it 
2416_152139_000061_000007	train-clean-100	What chance had he Jimmie Dale paused his left hand clenched until the skin formed whitish knobs over the knuckles 
2416_152139_000062_000000	train-clean-100	Carling s tongue sought his lips made a circuit of them and he tried to speak but his voice was an incoherent muttering 
none	none	I ll not waste words said Jimmie Dale in his grim monotone
2416_152139_000063_000001	train-clean-100	 I m not sure enough myself that I could keep my hands off you much longer 
2416_152139_000063_000002	train-clean-100	The actual details of how you stole the money to day do not matter NOW 
2416_152139_000063_000003	train-clean-100	A little later perhaps in court but not now 
none	none	You were the last to leave the bank but before leaving you pretended to discover the theft of a hundred thousand dollars that done up in a paper parcel was even then reposing in your desk 
2416_152139_000063_000005	train-clean-100	You brought the parcel home put it in that safe there and notified the president of the bank by telephone from here of the robbery suggesting that police headquarters be advised at once 
2416_152139_000063_000006	train-clean-100	He told you to go ahead and act as you saw best 
none	none	You notified the police speciously directing suspicion to the ex convict in the bank s employ You knew Moyne was dining out to night you knew where and at a hint from you the police took up the trail 
2416_152139_000063_000008	train-clean-100	A little later in the evening you took these two packages of banknotes from the rest and with this steamship ticket which you obtained yesterday while out at lunch by sending a district messenger boy with the money and instructions in a sealed envelope to purchase for you you went up to the Moynes flat in Harlem for the purpose of secreting them somewhere there 
2416_152139_000063_000009	train-clean-100	You pretended to be much disappointed at finding Moyne out you had just come for a little social visit to get better acquainted with the home life of your employees 
none	none	missus Moyne was genuinely pleased and grateful She took you in to see their little girl who was already asleep in bed 
2416_152139_000063_000012	train-clean-100	She left you there for a moment to answer the door and you you Jimmie Dale s voice choked again you blot on God s earth you slipped the money and ticket under the child s mattress 
none	none	Carling came forward with a lurch in his chair and his hands went out pawing in a wild pleading fashion over Jimmie Dale s arm Jimmie Dale flung him away
2416_152139_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 You were safe enough he rasped on 
none	none	The police could only construe your visit to Moyne s flat as zeal on behalf of the bank 
2416_152139_000066_000002	train-clean-100	And it was safer much more circumspect on your part not to order the flat searched at once but only as a last resort as it were after you had led the police to trail him all evening and still remain without a clew and besides of course not until you had planted the evidence that was to damn him and wreck his life and home 
2416_152139_000066_000003	train-clean-100	You were even generous in the amount you deprived yourself of out of the hundred thousand dollars for less would have been enough 
none	none	Caught with ten thousand dollars of the bank s money and a steamship ticket made out in a fictitious name it was prima facie evidence that he had done the job and had the balance somewhere What would his denials his protestations of innocence count for 
2416_152139_000066_000006	train-clean-100	He was an ex convict a hardened criminal caught red handed with a portion of the proceeds of robbery he had succeeded in hiding the remainder of it too cleverly that was all

2416_152139_000067_000001	train-clean-100	His hands went out again again his tongue moistened his dry lips 
none	none	He whispered

2416_152139_000069_000000	train-clean-100	And then Jimmie Dale laughed not pleasantly 
2416_152139_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes there s a way Carling he said grimly 
2416_152139_000070_000001	train-clean-100	 That s why I m here He picked up a sheet of writing paper and pushed it across the desk then a pen which he dipped into the inkstand and extended to the other 
2416_152139_000070_000002	train-clean-100	 The way you ll fix it will be to write out a confession exonerating Moyne

none	none	NO he cried I won t I can t my God I I WON T 
2416_152139_000073_000000	train-clean-100	The automatic in Jimmie Dale s hand edged forward the fraction of an inch 
2416_152139_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 I have not used this yet 
2416_152139_000074_000001	train-clean-100	You understand now why don t you he said under his breath 
none	none	No no Carling pushed away the pen
2416_152139_000075_000001	train-clean-100	 I m ruined ruined as it is 
none	none	But this would mean the penitentiary too Where you tried to send an innocent man in your place you hound where you
2416_152139_000077_000000	train-clean-100	 Some other way some other way Carling was babbling 
2416_152139_000077_000001	train-clean-100	 Let me out of this for God s sake let me out of this 
2416_152139_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 Carling said Jimmie Dale hoarsely I stood beside a little bed to night and looked at a baby girl a little baby girl with golden hair who smiled as she slept 
2416_152139_000079_000000	train-clean-100	Carling shivered and passed a shaking hand across his face 
none	none	Take this pen said Jimmie Dale monotonously or THIS 
2416_152139_000080_000001	train-clean-100	The automatic lifted until the muzzle was on a line with Carling s eyes 
2416_152139_000081_000000	train-clean-100	Carling s hand reached out still shaking and took the pen and his body dragged limply forward hung over the desk 
2416_152139_000081_000001	train-clean-100	The pen spluttered on the paper a bead of sweat spurting from the man s forehead dropped to the sheet 
none	none	There was silence in the room 
2416_152139_000082_000001	train-clean-100	A minute passed another 
2416_152139_000082_000002	train-clean-100	Carling s pen travelled haltingly across the paper then with a queer low cry as he signed his name he dropped the pen from his fingers and rising unsteadily from his chair stumbled away from the desk toward a couch across the room 
2416_152139_000083_000000	train-clean-100	An instant Jimmie Dale watched the other then he picked up the sheet of paper 
none	none	It was a miserable document miserably scrawled
2416_152139_000084_000000	train-clean-100	 I guess it s all up 
none	none	I guess I knew it would be some day 
2416_152139_000084_000002	train-clean-100	Moyne hadn t anything to do with it 
2416_152139_000084_000003	train-clean-100	I stole the money myself from the bank to night I guess it s all up 
none	none	THOMAS H CARLING 
2416_152139_000086_000000	train-clean-100	From the paper Jimmie Dale s eyes shifted to the figure by the couch and the paper fluttered suddenly from his fingers to the desk Carling was reeling clutching at his throat a small glass vial rolled upon the carpet 
2416_152139_000086_000001	train-clean-100	And then even as Jimmie Dale sprang forward the other pitched head long over the couch and in a moment it was over 
2416_152139_000087_000000	train-clean-100	Presently Jimmie Dale picked up the vial and dropped it back on the floor again 
2416_152139_000087_000001	train-clean-100	There was no label on it but it needed none the strong penetrating odor of bitter almonds was telltale evidence enough 
2416_152139_000087_000002	train-clean-100	It was prussic or hydrocyanic acid probably the most deadly poison and the swiftest in its action that was known to science Carling had provided against that some day in his confession 
none	none	For a little space motionless Jimmie Dale stood looking down at the silent outstretched form then he walked slowly back to the desk and slowly deliberately picked up the signed confession and the steamship ticket 
2416_152139_000088_000001	train-clean-100	He held them an instant staring at them then methodically began to tear them into little pieces a strange tired smile hovering on his lips 
2416_152139_000088_000002	train-clean-100	The man was dead now there would be disgrace enough for some one to bear a mother perhaps who knew 
none	none	And there was another way now since the man was dead Jimmie Dale put the pieces in his pocket went to the safe opened it and took out a parcel locked the safe carefully and carried the parcel to the desk 
2416_152139_000089_000001	train-clean-100	He opened it there 
2416_152139_000089_000002	train-clean-100	Inside were nearly two dozen little packages of hundred dollar bills 
2416_152139_000089_000003	train-clean-100	The other two packages that he had brought with him he added to the rest 
2416_152139_000089_000004	train-clean-100	From his pocket he took out the thin metal insignia case and with the tiny tweezers lifted up one of the gray coloured diamond shaped paper seals 
2416_152139_000089_000005	train-clean-100	He moistened the adhesive side and still holding it by the tweezers dropped it on his handkerchief and pressed the seal down on the face of the topmost package of banknotes 
none	none	He tied the parcel up then and picking up the pen addressed it in printed characters HUDSON MERCANTILE NATIONAL BANK NEW YORK CITY
2416_152139_000092_000000	train-clean-100	 District messenger some way in the morning he murmured 
2416_152139_000093_000000	train-clean-100	Jimmie Dale slipped his mask into his pocket and with the parcel under his arm stepped to the door and unlocked it 
2416_152139_000093_000001	train-clean-100	He paused for an instant on the threshold for a single quick comprehensive glance around the room then passed on out into the street 
2416_152139_000094_000000	train-clean-100	At the corner he stopped to light a cigarette and the flame of the match spurting up disclosed a face that was worn and haggard 
none	none	He threw the match away smiled a little wearily and went on The Gray Seal had committed another crime CHAPTER VII THE THIEF Choosing between the snowy napery the sparkling glass and silver the cozy shaded table lamps the famous French chef of the ultra exclusive saint James Club his own home on Riverside Drive where a dinner fit for an epicure and served by Jason that most perfect of butlers awaited him and Marlianne s Jimmie Dale driving in alone in his touring car from an afternoon s golf had chosen Marlianne s Marlianne s if such a thing as Bohemianism or rather a concrete expression of it exists was Bohemian A two piece string orchestra played valiantly to the accompaniment of a hoarse throated piano and between courses the diners took up the refrain and as it was always between courses with some one the place was a bedlam of noisy riot Nevertheless it was Marlianne s and Jimmie Dale liked Marlianne s He had dined there many times before as he had just dined in the person of Jimmie Dale the millionaire his high priced imported car at the curb of the shabby street outside and he had dined there disreputable in attire seedy in appearance with the police yelping at his heels as Larry the Bat In either character Marlianne s had welcomed him with equal courtesy to its spotted linen and most excellent table d hote with VIN ORDINAIRE for fifty cents And now in the act of reaching into his pocket for the change to pay his bill Jimmie Dale seemed suddenly to experience some difficulty in finding what he sought and his fingers went fumbling from one pocket to another Two men at the table in front of him were talking their voices over a momentary lull in violin squeaks talk laughter singing and the clatter of dishes reached him Carling commit suicide Not on your life No of course he didn t It was that cursed Gray Seal croaked him just as sure as you sit in that chair The other grunted Yes but what d the Gray Seal want to pinch a hundred thousand out of the bank for and then give it back again the next morning What s he done a hundred other things for to cover up the real object of what he s after retorted the first speaker with a short vicious laugh then with a thump of his fist on the table The man s a devil a fiend and anywhere else but New York he d have been caught and sent to the chair where he belongs long ago and A burst of ragtime drowned out the man s words Jimmie Dale placed a fifty cent piece and a tip beside it on his dinner check pushed back his chair and rose from the table There was a half tolerantly satirical half angry glint in his dark steady eyes It was not only the police who yelped at his heels but every man woman and child in the city The man had not voiced his own sentiments he had voiced the sentiments of New York And it was quite on the cards that if he Jimmie Dale were ever caught his destination would not even be the death cell and the chair at Sing Sing his fellow citizens had reached a pitch where they would be quite capable of literally tearing him to pieces if they ever got their hands on him And yet there were a few a very few a handful out of five millions who sometimes remembered perhaps to thank God that the Gray Seal lived that was his reward That and SHE whose mysterious letters prompted and impelled his the Gray Seal s acts She nameless fascinating in her brilliant resourcefulness amazing in her power a woman whose life was bound up with his and yet held apart from him in the most inexplicable absorbing way a woman he had never seen save for her gloved arm in the limousine that night who at one unexpected moment projected a dazzling impersonal existence across his path and the next leaving him battling for his life where greed and passion and crime swirled about him was gone Jimmie Dale threaded the small crowded rooms the interior of Marlianne s had never been altered from the days when the place had been a family residence of some pretension and reaching the hall received his hat from the frowsy looking boy in attendance He passed outside and at the top of the steps paused as he took his cigarette case from his pocket It was nearly a week since Carling the cashier of the Hudson Mercantile National Bank had been found dead in his home a bottle that had contained hydrocyanic acid on the floor beside him nearly a week since Bookkeeper Bob unaware that he had ever been under temporary suspicion for the robbery of the bank had equally unknown to himself been cleared of any complicity in that affair and yet as witness the conversation of a moment ago it was still the topic of New York still the vital issue that filled the maw of the newspapers with ravings threats and execrations against the Gray Seal snarling virulently the while at the police for the latter s ineptitude inefficiency and impotence Jimmie Dale closed his cigarette case with a snap that was almost human in its irony dropped it back into his pocket and lighted a match but the flame was arrested halfway to the tip of his cigarette as his eyes fixed suddenly and curiously on a woman s form hurrying down the street She had turned the corner before he took his eyes from her and the match between his fingers had gone out Not that there was anything very strange in a woman walking or even half running along the street nor that there was anything particularly attractive or unusual about her and if there had been the street was too dark for him to have distinguished it It was not that it was the fact that she had neither passed by the house on whose steps he stood nor come out of any of the adjoining houses It was as though she had suddenly and miraculously appeared out of thin air and taken form on a sidewalk a little way down from Marlianne s That s queer commented Jimmie Dale to himself However He took out another match lighted his cigarette jerked the match stub away from him and with a lift of his shoulders went down the steps He crossed the pavement walked around the front of his machine since the steering wheel was on the side next to the curb and with his hand out to open the car door stopped Some one had been tampering with it it was not quite closed There was no mistake Jimmie Dale made no mistakes of that kind a man whose life hung a dozen times a day on little things could not afford to make them He had closed it firmly even with a bang when he had got out Instantly suspicious he wrenched the door wide open switched on the light under the hood and with a sharp exclamation bent quickly forward A glove a woman s glove a white glove lay on the floor of the car Jimmie Dale s pulse leaped suddenly into fierce pounding beats It was HERS He KNEW that intuitively knew it as he knew that he breathed And that woman he had so leisurely watched as she had disappeared from sight was must have been she He sprang from the car with a jump his first impulse to dash after her and checked himself laughing a little bitterly It was too late for that now he had already let his chance slip through his fingers Around the corner was Sixth Avenue surface cars the elevated taxicabs a multitude of people any one of a hundred ways in which she could and would already have discounted pursuit from him and besides he would not even have been able to recognise her if he saw her Jimmie Dale s smile was mirthless as he turned back to the car and picked up the glove Why had she dropped it there It could not have been intentional Why had he began to tear suddenly at the glove s little finger and in another second kneeling on the car s step his shoulders inside he was holding a ring close under the little electric bulb It was a gold seal ring a small dainty thing that bore a crest a bell surmounted by a bishop s mitre the bell quaint in design harking the imagination back to some old time belfry tower And underneath in the scroll a motto It was a full minute before Jimmie Dale could decipher it for the lettering was minute and the words of course reversed It was in French SONNEZ LE TOCSIN He straightened up the glove and ring in his hand a puzzled expression on his face It was strange Had she after all dropped the glove there intentionally had she at last let down the barriers just a little between them and given him this little intimate sign that she And then Jimmie Dale laughed abruptly self mockingly He was only trying to deceive himself to argue himself into believing what with heart and soul he wanted to believe It was not like her and neither was it so His eyes had fixed on the seat beside the wheel He had not used the lap rug all that day he couldn t use a rug and drive he had left it folded and hanging on the rack in the tonneau it was now neatly folded and reposing on the front seat Yes said Jimmie Dale a sort of self pity in his tones I might have known He lifted the rug Beneath it on the leather seat lay a white envelope Her letter The letter that never came save with the plan of some grim desperate work outlined ahead the call to arms for the Gray Seal SONNEZ LE TOCSIN Ring the Tocsin Sound the alarm The Tocsin The words were running through his brain A strange motto on that crest that seemed so strangely apt The Tocsin Never once in all the times that he had heard from her never once in the years that had gone since that initial letter of hers had struck its first warning note had any communication from her been but to sound again a new alarm the Toscin The Tocsin the word seemed to visualise her to give her a concrete form and being to breathe her very personality The Tocsin Jimmie Dale whispered the word softly a little wistfully Yes I shall call you that the Tocsin He folded the glove very carefully placed it with the ring in his pocketbook picked up the letter and with a sharp exclamation turned it quickly over in his fingers then bent hurriedly with it to the light Strange things were happening that night For the first time the letter was not even SEALED That was not like her either What did it mean Quick alert now anxious even he pulled the double folded sheets from the envelope glanced rapidly through them and after a moment a smile whimsical came slowly to his lips It was quite plain now all of it The glove the ring and the unsealed letter and the postscript held the secret or rather what had been intended for a postscript did for it comprised only a few words ending abruptly unfinished Look in the cupboard at the rear of the room The man with the red wig is That was all and the words written in ink were badly blurred as though the paper had been hastily folded before the ink was dry It was quite plain and in view of the real explanation of it all eminently characteristic of her With the letter already written she had come there meaning to place it on the seat and cover it with the rug as indeed she had done then deciding to add the postscript and because she would attract less attention that way than in any other she had climbed into the car as though it belonged to her and had seated herself there to write it She would have been hurried in her movements of course and in pulling off her glove to use the fountain pen the ring had come with it The rest was obvious She had but just begun to write when he had appeared on the steps She had slipped instantly down to the floor of the car probably dropping the glove from her lap hastily inclosed the letter in the envelope which she had no time to seal thrust the envelope under the rug and forgetting her glove and fearful of risking his attention by attempting to close the door firmly had stolen along the body of the car only to be noticed by him too late when she was well down the street And at that latter thought once more chagrin seized Jimmie Dale then he turned impulsively to the letter All this was extraneous apart for another time when every moment was not a priceless asset as it very probably was now Dear Philanthropic Crook it always began that way never any other way He read on more and more intently crouched there close to the light on the floor of his car lips thinning as he proceeded read it to the end absorbing memorising it and then the abortive postscript Look in the cupboard at the rear of the room The man with the red wig is For an instant as mechanically he tore the letter into little shreds he held there hesitant and the next slamming the door tight he flung himself into the seat behind the wheel and the big sixty horse power self starting machine was roaring down the street The Tocsin There was a grim smile on Jimmie Dale s lips now The alarm Yes it was always an alarm quick sudden an emergency to face on the instant plans decisions to be made with no time to ponder them with only that one fact to consider staggering enough in itself that a mistake meant disaster and ruin to some one else and to himself if the courts were merciful where he had little hope for mercy the penitentiary for life And now to night again as it almost always was when these mysterious letters came every moment of inaction was piling up the odds against him And too the same problem confronted him How in what way in what role must he play the night s game to its end As Larry the Bat The car was speeding forward He was heading down Broadway now lower Broadway that stretched before him deserted like some dark narrow canyon where far below like towering walls the buildings closed together and seemed to converge into some black impassable barrier The street lights flashed by him a patrolman stopped the swinging of his night stick and turned to gaze at the car that rushed by at a rate perilously near to contempt of speed laws street cars passed at indifferent intervals pedestrians were few and far between it was the lower Broadway of night Larry the Bat Jimmie Dale shook his head impatiently over the steering wheel No that would not do It would be well enough for this young Burton perhaps but not for old Isaac the East Side fence for Isaac knew him in the character of Larry the Bat His quick keen brain weaving eliminating devising scheming discarded that idea The final coup of the night as yet but sensed in an indefinite unshaped way if enacted in the person of Larry the Bat would therefore stamp Larry the Bat and the Gray Seal as one a contretemps but little less fatal in view of old Issac than to bracket the Gray Seal and Jimmie Dale Larry the Bat was not a character to be assumed with impunity nor one to jeopardize it was a bulwark of safety at it were to which more than once he owed escape from capture and discovery He lifted his shoulders with a sudden jerk of decision as the car swerved to the left and headed for the East Side There was only one alternative then the black silk mask that folded into such tiny compass and that together with an automatic and the curious thin metal case that looked so like a cigarette case was always in his pocket for an emergency The car turned again and approaching its destination Jimmie Dale slowed down the speed perceptibly It was a strange case not a pleasant one and the raw edges where they showed were ugly in their nakedness Old Isaac Pelina young Burton and Maddon K Wilmington Maddon the wall paper magnate Curious that of the three he should already know two old Isaac and Maddon Everybody in the East Side every denizen of the underworld and many who posed on a far higher plane knew old Isaac fence to the most select clientele of thieves in New York unscrupulous hand in glove with any rascality or crime that promised profit a money lender a Shylock without even a Shylock s humanity as a saving grace Yes as Larry the Bat he knew old Isaac and he knew him not only personally but by firsthand reputation he had heard the man cursed in blasphemous whole souled abandon by more than one crook who was in the old fence s toils They dealt with him the crooks while they swore to get him because he was safe but Jimmie Dale s lips parted in a mirthless smile some day old Isaac would be found in that spiders den of his back of the dingy loan office with a knife in his heart or a bullet through his head And K Wilmington Maddon Jimmie Dale s smile grew whimsical he had known Maddon quite intimately for years had even dined with him at the saint James Club only a few nights before Maddon was a man in his own set and Maddon interfered with was likely to prove none too tractable a customer to handle And young Burton the letter had said was Maddon s private and confidential secretary Jimmie Dale s lips thinned again Well Burton s acquaintance was still to be made It was a curious trio and it was dirty work more raw than cunning more devilish than ingenious blackmail in its most hellish form the stake at the least calculation a cool half million A heavy price for a single slip in a man s life He brought the car abruptly to a halt at the edge of the curb and sprang out to the ground He was in front of The Budapest restaurant a garish establishment most popular of all resorts for the moment on the East Side where Fifth Avenue in the fond belief that it was seeing the real thing in seamy life engaged its table a week in advance Jimmie Dale pushed a bill into the door attendant s hand accompanied by an injunction to keep an eye on the machine and entered the cafe But for a sort of tinselled ostentation the place might well have been the Marlianne s that he had just left it was crowded and riot was at its height a stringed orchestra in Hungarian costume played what purported to be Hungarian airs shouts laughter clatter of dishes and thump of steins added to the din He made his way between the close packed tables to the stairs and descended to the lower floor Here if anything the confusion was greater than above but here too was an exit through to the rear street and a moment later he was sauntering past the front of an unkempt little pawnshop closed for the night over whose door in the murk of a distant street lamp three balls hung in sagging disarray tawny with age and across whose dirty unwashed windows letters missing ran the legend IS AC PELINA Pawn brok r The pawnshop made the corner of a very dark and narrow lane and with a quick glance around him to assure himself that he was unobserved Jimmie Dale stepped into the alleyway and lost instantly in the blacker shadows stole along by the wall of the pawnshop Old Isaac s business was not all done through the front door And then suddenly Jimmie Dale shrank still closer against the wall Was it intuition premonition or reality There seemed an uncanny feeling of PRESENCE around him as though perhaps he were watched as though others beside himself were in the lane Yes ahead of him a shadow moved he could just barely distinguish it now that his eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness It like himself was close against the wall and now it slunk noiselessly down the length of the lane until he lost sight of it AND WHAT WAS THAT He strained his ears to listen It seemed like a window being opened or closed cautiously stealthily the fraction of an inch at a time And then he located the sound it came from the other side of the lane and very nearly opposite to where on the second floor a dull yellow glow shone out from old Isaac s private den in the rear of the pawnshop s office Jimmie Dale s brows were gathered in sharp furrows There was evidently something afoot to night of which the Tocsin had NOT sounded the alarm And then the frown relaxed and he smiled a little Miraculous as was the means through which she obtained the knowledge that was the basis of their strange partnership it was no more miraculous than her unerring accuracy in the minutest details The Tocsin had never failed him yet It was possible that something was afoot around him quite probable indeed since he was in the most vicious part of the city in the heart of gangland but whatever it might be it was certainly extraneous to his mission or she would have mentioned it The lane was empty now he was quite sure of that and there was no further sound from the window opposite He started forward once more only to halt again for the second time as abruptly as before squeezing if possible even more closely against the wall Some one had turned into the lane from the sidewalk and walking hurriedly choosing with evident precaution the exact centre of the alleyway came toward him The man passed his hurried stride a half run and a few feet beyond halted at old Isaac s side door From somewhere inside the old building Jimmie Dale s ears caught the faint ringing of an electric bell a long ring followed in quick succession by three short ones then the repeated clicking of a latch as though pulled by a cord from above and the man passed in through the door closing it behind him Jimmie Dale nodded to himself in the darkness It was a spring lock the signal was one long ring and three short ones the Tocsin had not missed even those small details Also Burton was late for his appointment for that must have been Burton business such as old Isaac had in hand that night would have permitted the entrance of no other visitor but K Wilmington Maddon s private secretary He moved down the lane to the door and tried it softly It was locked of course The slim tapering sensitive fingers whose tips were eyes and ears to Jimmie Dale felt over the lock and a slender little steel instrument slipped into the keyhole A moment more and the catch was released and the door under his hand began to open With it ajar he paused his eyes searching intently up and down the lane There was nothing no sign of any one no moving shadows now His gaze shifted to the window opposite Directly facing it now with the dull reflection upon it from the lighted window of old Isaac s den above his head he could make out that it was open but that was all Once more he smiled a little tolerantly at himself this time Some one had been in the lane some one had opened the window of his or her room in that tenement house across from him surely there was nothing surprising unnatural or even out of the commonplace in that He had been a little bit on edge himself perhaps and the sudden movement of that shadow unexpected had startled him for the moment as in all probability the opening of the window had startled the skulking figure itself into action The door was open now He stepped noiselessly inside and closed it noiselessly behind him He was in a narrow hall where a few yards away a light shone down a stairway at right angles to the hall itself Rear door of pawnshop opens into hall and exactly opposite very short flight of stairs leading directly to doorway of Isaac s den above Ramshackle old place low ceilings Isaac when sitting in his den can look down and by means of a transom over the rear door of the shop see the customers as they enter from the street while he also keeps an eye on his assistant Latter always locks up and leaves promptly at six o clock Jimmie Dale was subconsciously repeating to himself snatches from the Tocsin s letter which as subconsciously in reading he had memorised almost word for word And now voices reached him one excited nervous as though the speaker were labouring under mental strain that bordered closely on the hysterical the other curiously mingling a querulousness with an attempt to pacify but dominantly contemptuous sneering cold Jimmie Dale moved along the hall very slowly without a sound testing each step before he threw his body weight from one leg to the other He reached the foot of the stairs The Tocsin had been right it was a very short flight He counted the steps there were eight Above facing him a door was open The voices were louder now It was a sordid looking room what he could see of it poverty stricken in its appearance intentionally so probably for effect with no attempt whatever at furnishing He could see through the doorway to the window that opened on the alleyway or rather just glimpse the top of the window at an angle across the room that and a bare stretch of floor The two men were not in the line of vision Burton s voice it was unquestionably Burton speaking came to Jimmie Dale now distinctly No I didn t I tell you I didn t I I hadn t the nerve Jimmie Dale slipped his black silk mask over his face and with extreme caution on hands and knees began to climb the stairs So It was old Isaac now in a half purr half sneer And I was so sure my young friend that you had I was so sure that you were not such a fool Yes I could even have sworn that they were in your pocket now what It is too bad too bad It is not a pleasant thing to think of that little chair up the river in its horrible little room where For God s sake Isaac not that Do you hear not that My God I didn t mean to I didn t know what I was doing Jimmie Dale crept up another step another and another There was silence for a moment in the room then Burton again hoarse voiced Isaac I ll make good to you some other way I swear I will I swear it If I m caught at this I ll I ll get fifteen years for it And which would you rather have Jimmie Dale could picture the oily smirk the shrug of his shoulders the outthrust hands palms upward elbows in at the hips the fingers curved and wide apart fifteen years or what you get for murder Eh my friend you have thought of that eh It is a very little price I ask yes Damn you Burton s voice was shrill then dropped to a half sob No no Isaac I didn t mean that Only for God s sake be merciful It is not only the risk of the penitentiary it s more than that I I tried to play white all my life and until that cursed night there s no man living could say I haven t You know that you know that Isaac I tell you I couldn t do it this afternoon I tell you I couldn t I tried to and and I couldn t Jimmie Dale was lying flat on the little landing now peering into the room Back a short distance from the doorway a repulsive looking little man in unkempt clothes and soiled linen with yellowish skinned parchment face out of which small black eyes shone cunningly and shrewdly sat at a bare deal table in a rickety chair facing him across the table stood a young man of not more than twenty five clean cut well dressed but whose face was unnaturally white now and whose hand as he extended it in a pleading gesture toward the other trembled visibly Jimmie Dale s hand made its way quietly to his side pocket and extracted his automatic Old Isaac humped his shoulders and leered at his visitor We talk a great deal my young friend What is the use A bargain is a bargain A few rubies in exchange for your life A few rubies and my mouth is shut Otherwise he humped his shoulders again Well Burton drew back swept his hand in a dazed way across his eyes and laughed out suddenly in bitter mirth A few rubies he cried The most magnificent stones on this side of the water a FEW rubies It s been Maddon s life hobby Every child in New York knows that A few yes there s only a few but those few are worth a fortune He trusts me the man has been like a father to me and So you are the very last to be suspected observed old Isaac suavely Have I not told you that There is nothing to fear Did we not arrange everything so nicely eh my young friend See it was to night that Maddon gives a little reception to his friends and did you not say that the rubies would be taken from the safe deposit vault this afternoon since his friends always clamoured to see them as a very fitting conclusion to an evening s entertainment And did you not say that you very naturally had access to the safe in the library where you worked and that he would not notice they were gone until he came to look for them some time this evening I think you said all that And what suspicion let alone proof would attach itself to you You were out of the room once when he too was absent for perhaps half an hour It is very simple In that half hour some one somehow abstracted them Certainly it was not you You see how little I ask and I pay well do I not And so I gave you until to night Three days have gone and I have said nothing and the body has not been found eh But to night eh it was understood The rubies or the chair Burton s lips moved but it was a moment before he could speak You wouldn t dare he whispered thickly You wouldn t dare I d tell the story of of what you tried to make me do and they d send you up for it Old Isaac shrugged with pitying contempt Is it after all a fool I am dealing with he sneered And I what should I say That you had stolen the stones from your employer and offered them as a bribe to silence me and that I had refused The very act of handing you over to the police would prove the truth of what I said and rob you of even a chance of leniency FOR THAT OTHER THING Is it not so eh And why did I not hand you over at once three nights ago Believe me my young friend I should have a very good reason ready a dozen if necessary if it came to that But we are borrowing trouble are we not We shall not come to that eh For a moment it seemed to Jimmie Dale as he watched that Burton would hurl himself upon the other White to the lips the muscles of his face twitching Burton clenched his fists and leaned over the table and then with sudden revulsion of emotion he drew back once more and once more came that choked sob You ll pay for this Isaac your turn will come for this I have been threatened very often snapped the other contemptuously Bah what are threats I laugh at them as I always will Then with a quick change of front his voice a sudden snarl Well we have talked enough You have your choice The stones or eh And it is to night NOW The old pawnbroker sprawled back in his chair a cunning leer on his vicious face a gleam of triumph greed in the beady ratlike eyes that never wavered from the other Burton moisture oozing from his forehead stood there hesitant staring back at old Isaac half in a fascinated gaze half as though trying to read some sign of weakness in the bestial countenance that confronted him And then very slowly in an automatic machine like way his hand groped into the inside pocket of his vest and old Isaac cackled out in derision So You thought you could bluff me eh you thought you could fool old Isaac Bah I read you like a book Did I not tell you a while back that you had them in your pocket I know your kind my young friend I know your kind very well indeed it is my business You would not have dared to come here to night without the price So You took them this afternoon as we agreed Yes yes you did well You will not regret it And now let me see them his voice rose eagerly let me see them now my young friend Yes I took them Burton spoke listlessly God help me Old Isaac quivering excited like a different creature now sprang from his chair and as Burton drew a long flat leather case from his pocket snatched it from the other s hand His fingers in their rapacious haste could not at first manipulate the catch and then finally with the case open he bent over the table feverishly The light reflected back as from some living mass of crimson fire now shading darkly now glowing into wondrous colourful transparency as he moved the case to and fro with jerky motions of his hands and he was babbling crooning to himself like one possessed Ah the little beauties Ah the pretty little things Yes yes these are the ones This is the great Aracon see see the six sided prism terminated by the six sided pyramid But it must be cut it must be cut to sell it eh Ah it is too bad too bad And this this one here I know them all this is But his sentence was never finished it was Jimmie Dale on his feet now leaning against the jamb of the door his automatic covering the two men at the table who spoke Quite so Isaac he said coolly you know them all Quite so Isaac but be good enough to DROP them The case fell from Isaac s hand the flush on his cheeks died to a sickly pallor and his mouth half open he stood like a man turned to stone his hands with curved fingers still outstretched over the table over the crimson gems that spilled from the case lay scattered now on the tabletop Burton neither spoke nor moved a little whiter the misery in his face almost apathetic he moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue Jimmie Dale walked across the room halted at the end of the table and surveyed the two men grimly And then while one hand with revolver extended rested easily on the table the other gathered up the stones placed them in the case and the case in his pocket Jimmie Dale s lips parted in an uninviting smile I guess I m in luck to night eh Isaac he drawled Between you and your young friend as I believe you call him it would appear as though I had fallen on my feet That Aracon s worth what would you say a hundred two hundred thousand alone eh A very famous stone that had your eye on it for quite a time Isaac you miserable blood leech eh Isaac did not answer but while he still held back from the table he seemed to be regaining a little of his composure burglars of whatever sort were no novelty to him and was staring fixedly at Jimmie Dale Can t place me though there s not many in the profession you don t know Is that it inquired Jimmie Dale softly Well don t try Isaac it s hardly worth your while I VE got the stones now and Wait Wait Listen It was Burton speaking for the first time his words coming in a quick nervous rush Listen You don t Hold your tongue cried old Isaac with sudden fierceness You are a fool He leaned toward Jimmie Dale a crafty smile on his face quite in control of himself once more Don t listen to him listen to me You re right I can t place you and it doesn t make any difference he took a step forward but Not too close Isaac snapped Jimmie Dale sharply I know YOU So ejaculated old Isaac rubbing his hands together So That is good That is what I want Listen we will make a bargain We are birds of a feather eh All thieves eh You ve got the drop on us who did all the work but you ll give us our share eh Listen You couldn t get rid of those stones alone You know that you re not so green at the game eh You d have to go to some one You know me you know old Isaac you say Well then you know there isn t another man in New York could dispose of those rubies and play SAFE doing it except me I ll make a good bargain with you Isaac said Jimmie Dale pensively you ve made a good many good bargains I wonder when you ll make your last There s more than one looking for interest on those bargains in a pretty grim sort of way Bah ejaculated old Isaac It is an old story They are all alike I am afraid of none of them I hold them all like THAT His hand opened and closed like a taloned claw And you d add me to the lot eh said Jimmie Dale He lifted the revolver its muzzle on old Isaac examined the mechanism thoughtfully and lowered it again Very well I ll make a bargain with you providing it is agreeable to your young friend here Ah exclaimed old Isaac shrilly So That is good It is done then He chuckled hoarsely Any bargain I make he will agree to Is it not so He fixed his eyes on Burton Well is it not so Speak up Say He stopped the words cut short off on his lips It came without warning a crash a pound on the door below another Burton shrank back against the wall My God The police he gasped Maddon s found out We re we re caught Jimmie Dale s eyes on old Isaac narrowed The pounding in the alleyway grew louder more insistent And then his first suspicion passed it was no game of Isaac s Crafty though the old fox was the other s surprise and agitation was too genuine to be questioned Still the pounding continued some one was kicking viciously at the door and banging a tattoo on the panels with his fists Old Isaac s clawlike hands doubled suddenly It is some drunken sot he snarled out that knows no better than to come here and rouse the whole neighbourhood It is true in a moment we will have the police running in from the street But wait wait I ll teach the fool a lesson He dashed around the table ran for the window wrenched the catch up flung the window open and snarling again leaned out and instantly the knocking ceased And instantly then with a sharp cry as the whole ghastly meaning of it swept upon him Jimmie sprang after the other too late Came the roar of a revolver shot a stream of flame cutting the darkness of the alleyway from the window in the house opposite and without a sound old Isaac crumpled up hung limply for a moment over the sill and slid in a heap to the floor On his hands and knees protected from the possibility of another bullet by the height of the sill Jimmie Dale quick in every movement now dragged the inert form toward the table away from the window and bent hurriedly over the other A minute perhaps he stayed there and then rose slowly Burton horror stricken unmanned beside himself was hanging clutching with both hands at the table edge He s dead said Jimmie Dale laconically Burton flung out his hands Dead he whispered hoarsely I I think I m going mad Three days of hell and now this We d we d better get out of here quick they ll get us if Jimmie Dale s hand fell with a tight grip on Burton s shoulder There won t be any more shots fired pull yourself together Burton stared at him in a demented way What s what s it mean he stammered It means that I didn t put two and two together said Jimmie Dale a little bitterly It means that there s a dozen crooks been dancing old Isaac s tune for a long time and that some of them have got him at last Burton reached out suddenly and clutched Jimmie Dale s arm Then I m safe He mumbled the words but there was dawning hope relief in his white face Safe I m safe if you ll only give me back those stones Give them back to me for God s sake give them back to me You don t know you don t understand I stole them because because he made me because I it was the only chance I had Oh my God you don t know what the last three days have been Give them back to me won t you won t you You you don t know Don t lose your nerve said Jimmie Dale sharply Sit down He pushed the other into the chair There s no one will disturb us here for some time at least What is it that I don t know That three nights ago you were in a gambling hell Sagosto s to be exact one of the most disreputable in New York and you went there on the invitation of a stray acquaintance a man named Perley shall I describe him for you A short slim built man black eyes red hair beard and YOU know that The misery the hopelessness was back in Burton s face again and suddenly he bent over the table and buried his head in his outflung arms There was silence for a moment Tight lipped Jimmie Dale s eyes travelled from Burton s shaking shoulders to the motionless form on the floor Then he spoke again You re a bit of a rounder Burton but I think you ve had a lesson that will last you all your life You were half drunk when you and Perley began to hobnob over a downtown bar He said he d show you some real life and you went with him to Sagosto s He gave you a revolver before you went in and told you the place wasn t safe for an unarmed man He introduced you to Sagosto the proprietor and you were shown to a back room You drank quite a little there You and Perley were alone throwing dice You got into a quarrel Perley tried to draw his revolver You were quicker You drew the one he had given you and fired He fell to the floor you saw the blood gush from his breast just above the heart he was dead In a panic you rushed from the place and out into the street I don t think you went home that night Burton raised his head showing his haggard face I guess it s no use he said dully If you know others must I thought only Isaac and Sagosto knew Why haven t I been arrested I wish to God I had I wouldn t have had to day to answer for I am not through yet said Jimmie Dale gravely The next day old Isaac here sent for you He said Sagosto had told him of the murder and had offered to dispose of the corpse and keep his mouth shut for fifty thousand dollars that no one in his place knew of it except himself Isaac for his share wanted considerably more You told him you had no such sums that you had no money He told you how you could get it you had access to Maddon s safe you were Maddon s confidential secretary fully in your employer s trust the last man on earth to be suspected and there were Maddon s famous priceless rubies Jimmie Dale paused Burton made no answer And so said Jimmie Dale presently to save yourself from the death penalty you took them Yes said Burton scarcely above his breath Are you an officer If you are take me have done with it Only for Heaven s sake end it If you re not Jimmie Dale was not listening The cupboard at the rear of the room she had said He walked across to it now opened it and after a little search found a small bundle He returned with it in his hand and kneeling beside the dead man on the floor his back to Burton untied it took out a red wig and beard and slipped them on to old Isaac s head and face I wonder he said grimly as he stood up if you ever saw this man before My God PERLEY With a wild cry Burton was on his feet straining forward like a man crazed Yes said Jimmie Dale Perley Sort of an ironic justice in his end as far as you are concerned isn t there I think we ll leave him like that as Perley It will provide the police with an interesting little problem which they will never solve and STEADY Burton was rocking on his feet the tears were streaming down his face He lurched heavily and Jimmie Dale caught him and pushed him back into the chair again I thought I thought there was blood on my hands said Burton brokenly that that I had taken a man s life It was horrible horrible I ve lived through three days that I thought would drive me mad while I I tried to do my work and and talk to people just as if nothing had happened And every one that spoke to me seemed so carefree and happy and I would have sold my soul to have changed places with them He stared at the form on the floor and shivered suddenly It it was like that I saw him last he whispered But but I do not understand Jimmie Dale smiled a little wearily It was simple enough he said Old Isaac had had his eyes on those rubies for a long time The easiest way of getting them was through you The revolver he gave you before you entered Sagosto s was loaded with blank cartridges the blood you saw was the old old trick a punctured bladder of red pigment concealed under the vest Let us get out of here Burton shuddered again Let us get out of here at once now If we re found here we ll be accused of THAT There is no hurry Jimmie Dale answered quietly I have told you that no one is liable to come here to night and whoever did this certainly will not raise an alarm And besides there is still the matter of the rubies Burton Yes said Burton with a quick intake of his breath Yes the rubies what are you going to do with them I I had forgotten them You ll He stopped stared at Jimmie Dale and burst into a miserable laugh I m a fool a blind fool he moaned It does not matter what you do with them I forgot Sagosto When they find Isaac here Sagosto will either tell his story which will be enough to convict me of this night s work the REAL murder even though I m innocent or else he ll blackmail me just as Isaac did Jimmie Dale shook his head You are doing Isaac s cunning an injustice he said grimly Sagosto was only a tool one of many that old Isaac had in his power and for that matter as likely as any one else to have had a hand in Isaac s murder to night Sagosto saw you once when Isaac brought you into his place not because Isaac wanted Sagosto to see you but because he wanted YOU to see Sagosto Do you understand It would make the story that Sagosto came to him with the tale of the murder the next day ring true Sagosto however did not go to old Isaac the next day to tell about any fake murder naturally Sagosto would not know you again from Adam neither does he know anything about the rubies nor what old Isaac s ulterior motives were He was paid for his share in the game in old Isaac s usual manner of payment probably by a threat of exposure for some old time offence that Isaac held over him if he didn t keep his mouth shut Burton s hand brushed his eyes Yes he muttered Yes I see it now Jimmie Dale stooped down picked up the paper from the floor in which the wig and beard had been wrapped walked back with it and replaced it in the cupboard And then with his back to Burton again he took the case of gems from his pocket opened it and laid it on the cupboard shelf Also from his pocket came that thin metal case and from the case with a pair of tweezers that obviated the possibility of telltale finger prints a gray diamond shaped piece of paper adhesive on one side that cursed by the distracted authorities in every police headquarters on both sides of the Atlantic and raved at by a virulent press whose printed reproductions had made it familiar in every household in the land was the insignia of the Gray Seal He moistened the adhesive side dropped it from the tweezers to his handkerchief and pressed it down firmly on the inside of the cover of the jewel case He put both cases back in his pockets and returned to Burton Burton he said a little sharply while I was outside that doorway there I heard you beg old Isaac to let you keep the rubies and three times already you have asked the same of me What would you do with them if I gave them back to you Burton did not reply for a moment he was gazing at the masked face in a half eager half doubtful way You you mean you will give them back he burst out finally Answer my question prompted Jimmie Dale Do with them Burton repeated slowly Why I ve told you They d go back to mister Maddon I d take them back Would you Jimmie Dale s voice was quizzical A puzzled expression came to Burton s face I don t know what you mean by that he said Of course I would How asked Jimmie Dale Do you know the combination of mister Maddon s safe No said Burton And the safe would be locked wouldn t it Yes Quite so said Jimmie Dale musingly Then granted that mister Maddon has not already discovered the theft how would you replace the stones before he does discover it And if he already knows that they are gone how would you get them back into his hands Yes I know Burton answered a little listlessly I ve thought of that There s only one way to take them back to him myself and make a clean breast of it and He hesitated And tell him you stole them supplied Jimmie Dale Burton nodded his head Yes he said And then prodded Jimmie Dale What will Maddon do From what I ve heard of him he s not a man to trifle with nor a man to take an overly complacent view of things not the man whose philosophy is all s well that ends well What does it matter Burton s voice was low It isn t that so much I m ready for that It s the fact that he trusted me implicitly and I well I played the fool or I d never have got into a mess like this For an instant Jimmie Dale looked at the other searchingly and then smiling strangely he shook his head There s a better way than that Burton he said quietly I think as I said before you ve had a lesson to night that will last you all your life I m going to give you another chance with Maddon Here are the stones He reached into his pocket and laid the case on the table But now Burton made no effort to take the case his eyes in that puzzled way again were on Jimmie Dale A better way he repeated tensely What do you mean What way Well say at the expense of another man s reputation of mine suggested Jimmie Dale with his whimsical smile You need only say that a man came to you this evening told you that he stole these rubies from mister Maddon during the afternoon and asked you as mister Maddon s private secretary to restore them with his compliments to their owner A slow flush of disappointment deepening to one of anger dyed Burton s cheeks Are you trying to make a fool of me he cried out Go to Maddon with a childish tale like that There s no man living would believe such a cock and bull story No inquired Jimmie Dale softly And yet I am inclined to think there are a good many that even Maddon would hard headed as he is You might say that when the man handed you the case you thought it was some practical joke being foisted on you until you opened the case Jimmie Dale pushed it a little farther across the table and Burton mechanically his eyes still on Jimme Dale loosened the catch with his thumb nail until you opened the case saw the rubies and The Gray Seal Burton had snatched the case toward him and was straining his eyes at the inside cover You the Gray Seal Well said Jimmie Dale whimsically Motionless the case held open in his hands Burton stood there The Gray Seal he whispered Then with a catch in his voice You mean this You mean to let me have these back you mean you mean all you ve said For God s sake don t play with me the Gray Seal the most notorious criminal in the country to give back a fortune like this You you Dog with a bad name said Jimmie Dale with a wry smile then a little gruffly Put it in your pocket Slowly almost as though he expected the case to be snatched back from him the next instant Burton obeyed I don t understand I CAN T understand he murmured They say that you and yet I believe you now you ve saved me from a ruined life to night The Gray Seal If if every one knew what you had done they But every one won t Jimmie Dale broke in bluntly Who is to tell them You You couldn t very well when you come to think of it could you Well who knows perhaps there have been others like you You mean said Burton excitedly you mean that all these crimes of yours that have seemed without motive that have been so inexplicable have really been like to night to I don t mean anything at all interposed Jimmie Dale a little hurriedly Nothing Burton except that there is still one little thing more to do to bolster up that childish story of mine and then get out of here He glanced sharply critically around the room his eyes resting for a moment at the last on the form on the floor Then tersely I am going to turn out the light we will have to pass the window to get to the door and we will invite no chances Are you ready No not yet said Burton eagerly I haven t said what I d like to say to you what I Walk straight to the door said Jimmie Dale curtly There was the click of an electric light switch and the room was in darkness Now no noise he instructed And Burton perforce made his way across the room and at the door Jimmie Dale joined him and led him down the short flight of stairs At the bottom he opened the door leading into the rear of the pawnshop itself and bidding Burton follow entered We can t risk even a match it could be seen from the street he said brusquely as he fumbled around for a moment in the darkness Ah here it is He lifted a telephone receiver from its hook and gave a number Burton caught him quickly by the arm Good Lord man what are you doing he protested anxiously That s mister Maddon s house So I believe said Jimmie Dale complacently Hello Is mister Maddon there I beg pardon Personally yes if you please There was a moment s wait Burton s hand was still nervously clutching at Jimmie Dale s sleeve Then mister Maddon asked Jimmie Dale pleasantly Yes I am very sorry to trouble you but I called you up to inquire if you were aware that your rubies and among them your Aracon had been stolen I beg pardon Rubies yes You weren t Oh no I am quite in my right mind if you will take the trouble to open your safe you will find they are gone shall I hold the line while you investigate What Don t shout please and stand a little farther away from the mouthpiece Jimmie Dale s tone was one of insolent composure now There is really no use in getting excited I beg pardon Certainly this is the Gray Seal speaking What Jimmie Dale s voice grew plaintive I really can t make out a word when you yell like that Yes I had occasion to use them this afternoon and I took the liberty of borrowing them temporarily are you still there mister Maddon Oh quite so Yes I hear you NOW No that is all only I am returning them through your private secretary a very estimable young man though I fear somewhat excitable and shaky who is on his way to you with them now WHAT S THAT YOU SAY You repeat that snapped Jimmie Dale suddenly icily and I ll take them from under your nose again before morning Ah That is better Good night mister Maddon Jimmie Dale hung up the receiver and shoved Burton toward the door Now then Burton we ll get out of her and the sooner you reach Fifth Avenue and mister Maddon s house the better No not that way They had reached the hall and Burton had turned toward the side door that opened on the alleyway Whoever they were who settled their last account with Isaac may still be watching They ve nothing against any one else but they know some one was in here at the time and if the police are clever enough ever to get on their track they might find it very convenient to be able to say WHO was in the room when Isaac was murdered there s nothing to show since Isaac so obligingly opened the window for them that the shot was fired THROUGH the window and not from the inside of the room And even if they have already taken to their heels Jimmie Dale was leading Burton up the stairs again as he talked it might prove exceedingly inconvenient for us if some passer by should happen to recollect that he saw two men of our general appearance leaving the premises Now keep close and follow me They passed the door of Isaac s den turned down a narrow corridor that led to the rear of the house Jimmie Dale guiding unerringly working from the mental map of the house that the Tocsin had drawn for him descended another short flight of stairs that gave on the kitchen crossed the kitchen and Jimmie Dale opened a back door He paused here for a moment to listen then cautioning Burton to be silent moved on again across a small back yard and through a gate into a lane that ran at right angles to the alleyway by which both had entered the house and a minute later they were crouched against a building a half block away where the lane intersected the cross street Here Jimmie Dale peered out cautiously There was no one in sight He touched Burton s shoulder and pointed down the street That s your way Burton mine s the other Hurry while you ve got the chance Good night Burton s hand reached out caught Jimmie Dale s and wrung it God bless you he said huskily I And Jimmie Dale pushed him out on to the street Burton s steps receded down the sidewalk Jimmie Dale still crouched against the wall The steps grew fainter in the distance and died finally away Jimmie Dale straightened up slipped the mask from his face to his pocket stepped out on the street and five minutes later was passing through the noisy bedlam of the Hungarian restaurant on his way to the front door and his car SONNEZ LE TOCSIN Jimmie Dale was saying softly to himself I wonder what she ll do when she finds I ve got the ring CHAPTER VIII THE MAN HIGHER UP The Tocsin By neither act sign nor word had she evidenced the slightest interest in that ring and yet she must know she certainly must know that it was now in his possession Jimmie Dale was disappointed Somehow he had counted more than he had cared to admit on developments from that ring He pulled a little viciously at his cigarette as he stared out of the saint James Club window That was how long ago Ten days Yes this would be the eleventh Eleven days now and no word from her eleven days since that night at old Isaac s since she had last called him the Gray Seal to arms It was a long while so long a while even that what had come to be his prerogative in the newspapers the front page with three inch type recounting some new exploit of that mysterious criminal the Gray Seal was being usurped The papers were howling now about what they for the lack of a better term were pleased to call a wave of crime that had inundated New York and of which for once the Gray Seal was not the storm centre but rather for the moment forgotten He drew back from the window and settling himself again in the big leather lounging chair resumed the perusal of the evening paper His eye fell on what was common to every edition now a crime editorial and the paper crackled suddenly under the long slim tapering fingers so carefully nurtured whose sensitive tips a hundred times had made mockery of the human ingenuity squandered on the intricate mechanism of safes and vaults No he was wrong the Gray Seal had not been forgotten We should not be surprised wrote the editor virulently to discover at the bottom of these abominable atrocities that the guiding spirit in fact was the Gray Seal they are quite worthy even of his diabolical disregard for the laws of God and man Jimmie Dale s lips straightened ominously and an angry glint crept into his dark steady eyes There was nothing then nothing too vile that in the public s eyes could not logically be associated with the Gray Seal even this A series of the most cold blooded callous murders and robberies the work on the face of it of a well organized band of thugs brutal insensate little better than fiends though clever enough so far to have evaded capture clever enough indeed to have kept the police still staggering and gasping after a clew for one murder while another was in the very act of being committed The Gray Seal What exquisite irony And yet after all the papers were not wholly to blame for what they said he had invited much of it Seeming crimes of the Gray Seal had apparently been genuine beyond any question of doubt as he had intended them to appear as in the very essence of their purpose they had to be Yes he had invited much he and she together the Tocsin and himself He Jimmie Dale millionaire clubman whose name for generations in New York had been the family pride was wanted as the Gray Seal for so many crimes that he had lost track of them himself but from any one of which let the identity of the Gray Seal be once solved there was and could be no escape What exquisite irony yet full too of the most deadly consequences Once more Jimmie Dale s eyes sought the paper and this time scanned the headlines of the first page BRUTAL MURDER OF MILL PAYMASTER THE CRIME WAVE STILL AT ITS HEIGHT HERMAN ROESSLE FOUND DEAD NEAR HIS CAR ASSASSINS ESCAPE WITH twenty thousand dollars Jimmie Dale read on and as he read there came again that angry set to his lips The details were not pleasant Herman Roessle the paymaster of the Martindale Kensington Mills whose plant was on the Hudson had gone that morning in his runabout to the nearest town three miles away for the monthly pay roll had secured the money from the bank a sum of twenty odd thousand dollars and had started back with it for the mill At first it being broad daylight and a well frequented road his nonappearance caused no apprehension but as early afternoon came and there was still no sign of Roessle the mill management took alarm Discovering that he had left the bank for the return journey at a few minutes before eleven and that nothing had been seen of him at his home the police were notified Followed then several hours of fruitless search until finally with the whole countryside aroused and the efforts of the police augumented by private search parties the car was found in a thicket at the edge of a crossroad some four miles back from the river and a little way from the car the body of Roessle dead the man s head crushed in where it had been fiendishly battered by some blunt heavy object There was no clew no one could be found who had seen the car on the crossroad the murderer or murderers and the twenty odd thousand dollars in cash had disappeared leaving no trace behind There were several columns of this which Jimmie Dale skimmed through quickly but at the end he stared for a long time at the last paragraph Somehow strange to relate the paper had neglected to turn its sob artist loose and the few words added almost as though they were an afterthought for once rang true and full of pathos in their very simplicity at the Roessle home where missus Roessle was prostrated two little tots of five and seven too young to understand had gravely received the reporter and told him that some bad man had hurt their daddy mister Dale sir Jimmie Dale lowered his paper A club attendant was standing before him respectfully extending a silver card tray From the man Jimmie Dale s eyes fixed on a white envelope on the tray One glance was enough it was HERS that letter The Tocsin again His brain seemed suddenly to be afire and he could feel his pulse quicken the blood begin to pound in fierce throbs at his heart Life and death lay in that white innocent looking unaddressed envelope danger peril it was always life and death for those were the stakes for which the Tocsin played But master of many things Jimmie Dale was most of all master of himself Not a muscle of his face moved He reached nonchalantly for the letter Thank you said Jimmie Dale The man bowed and started away Jimmie Dale laid the envelope on the arm of the lounging chair The man had reached the door when Jimmie Dale stopped him Oh by the way said Jimmie Dale languidly where did this come from Your chauffeur sir replied the other Your chauffeur gave it to the hall porter a moment ago sir Thank you said Jimmie Dale again The door closed Jimmie Dale glanced around the room It was the caution of habit that glance the habit of years in which his life had hung on little things He was alone in one of the club s private library rooms He picked up the envelope tore it open took out the folded sheets inside and began to read At the first words he leaned forward suddenly tense in his chair He read on turning the pages hurriedly incredulity amazement and finally a strange menace mirroring itself in turn upon his face He stood up the letter in his hand My God whispered Jimmie Dale It was a call to arms such as the Gray Seal had never received before such as the Tocsin had never made before And if it were true it True He laughed aloud a little gratingly True Had the Tocsin astounding unbelievable mystifying as were the means by which she acquired her knowledge not only of this but of countless other affairs ever by so much as the smallest detail been astray If it were true He pulled out his watch It was half past nine Benson his chauffeur had sent the letter into the club Benson had been waiting outside there ever since dinner Jimmie Dale for the first time since the first communication that he had ever received from the Tocsin did not immediately destroy her letter now He slipped it into his pocket and stepped quickly from the room In the cloakroom downstairs he secured his hat and overcoat and though it was a warm evening put on the latter since he was in evening clothes then walked leisurely out of the club At the curb Benson the chauffeur sprang from his seat and touching his cap opened the door of a luxurious limousine Jimmie Dale shook his head I shall not keep you waiting any longer Benson he said You may take the car home and put it up I shall probably be late to night Very good sir replied the chauffeur You sent in a letter a moment or so ago Benson observed Jimmie Dale casually opening his cigarette case Yes sir said Benson I hope I didn t do wrong sir He said it was important and that you were to have it at once He Jimmie Dale was lighting his cigarette now A boy sir Benson amplified I couldn t get anything out of him He just said he d been told to give it to me and tell me to see that you got it at once I hope sir I haven t Not at all Benson said Jimmie Dale pleasantly It s quite all right Good night Benson Good night sir Benson answered climbing back to his seat There was a queer little smile on Jimmie Dale s lips as he watched the great car swing around in the street and glide noiselessly away a queer little smile that still held there even after he himself had started briskly along the avenue in a downtown direction It was invariably the same always the same the letters came unexpectedly when least looked for now by this means now by that but always in a manner that precluded the slightest possibility of tracing them to their source Was there anything in his intimate surroundings in his intimate life that she did not know about him who knew absolutely nothing about her Benson for instance that the man was absolutely trustworthy or else she would never for an instant have risked the letter in his possession Was there anything that she did not yes one thing she did not know him in the role he was going to play to night That at least was one thing that surely she did not know about him the role in which many times for weeks on end he had devoted himself body and soul in an attempt to solve the mystery with which she surrounded herself the role too that often enough had been a bulwark of safety to him when hard pressed by the police the role out of which he had so carefully so painstakingly created a now recognised and well known character of the underworld the role of Larry the Bat Jimmie Dale turned from Fifth Avenue into Broadway continued on down Broadway across to the Bowery kept along the Bowery for several more blocks and finally headed east into the dimly lighted cross street on which the Sanctuary was located And now Jimmie Dale became cautious in his movements As he approached the black alleyway that flanked the miserable tenement he glanced sharply behind and about him and at the alleyway itself without pause but with a curious lightning like side step no longer Jimmie Dale now but the Gray Seal he disappeared from the street and was lost in the deep shadows of the building In a moment he was at the side door listening for any sound from within none had ever seen or met the lodger or the first floor either ascending or descending except in the familiar character of Larry the Bat He opened the door closed it behind him and in the utter blackness went noiselessly up the stairs stairs so rickety that it seemed a mouse s tread alone would have set them creaking There seemed an art in the play of Jimmie Dale s every muscle in the movements lithe balanced quick absolutely silent On the first landing he stopped before another door there was the faint click of a key turning in the lock and then this door too closed behind him Sounded the faint click of the key as it turned again and Jimmie Dale drew a long breath stepped across the room to assure himself that the window blind was down and lighted the gas jet A yellow murky flame spurted up pitifully weak almost as though it were ashamed of its disreputable surroundings Dirt disorder squalour the evidence of low living testified eloquently enough to any one the police for instance in times past inquisitive until they were fatuously content with the belief that they knew the occupant for what he was that the place was quite in keeping with its tenant a mute prototype as it were of Larry the Bat the dope fiend For a little space Jimmie Dale immaculate in his evening clothes stood in the centre of the miserable room his dark eyes keen alert critical sweeping comprehensively over every object about him the position of a chair of a cracked drinking glass on the broken legged table of an old coat thrown with apparent carelessness on the floor at the foot of the bed of a broken bottle that had innocently strewn some sort of white powder close to the threshold inviting unwary foot tracks across the floor And then taking out the Tocsin s letter he laid it upon the table placed what money he had in his pockets beside it and began rapidly to remove his clothes The Sanctuary had not been invaded since his last visit there He turned back the oilcloth in the far corner of the room took up the piece of loose flooring which however strangely enough fitted so closely as to give no sign of its existence even should it inadvertently by some curious visitor again be trod upon and from the aperture beneath lifted out a bundle of clothes and a small box Undressed now he carefully folded the clothes he had taken off laid them under the flooring and began to dress again his wardrobe supplied by the bundle he had taken out in exchange an old pair of shoes the laces broken mismated socks patched trousers frayed at the bottoms a soiled shirt collarless open at the neck Attired to his satisfaction he placed the box upon the table propped up a cracked mirror sat down in front of it and with a deft artist s touch began to apply stain to his hands wrists neck throat and face but the hardness the grim menace that now grew into the dominant characteristic of his features was not due to the stain alone Dear Philanthropic Crook his eyes were on the Tocsin s letter that lay before him He read on for once even to Jimmie Dale s keen facile mind a first reading had failed to convey the full significance of what she had written It was too amazing almost beyond belief the series of crimes rampant for the past few weeks at which the community had stood aghast the brutal murder of Roessle but a few hours old lay bare before his eyes It was all there all of it the details the hellish cleverness the personnel even of the thugs all everything except the proof Get him Jimmie the man higher up Get him Jimmie before another pays forfeit with his life the words seemed to leap out at him from the white page in red dancing lines Get him Jimmie the man higher up Jimmie Dale finished the second reading of the letter read it again for the third time then tore it into tiny fragments His fingers delved into the box again and the transformation of Jimmie Dale member of New York s most exclusive social set into a low vicious featured denizen of the underworld went on a little wax applied skilfully behind the ears in the nostrils and under the upper lip It was all there all except the proof And the proof he laughed aloud suddenly unpleasantly There seemed something sardonic in it ay more than that all that was grim in irony The proof in Stangeist s own writing sworn to before witnesses in the presence of a notary the text of the document of course unknown to both witnesses and notary evidence absolute and final that would be admitted in any court for Stangeist was a lawyer and would see to that was in Stangeist s own safe for Stangeist s own protection Stangeist who was himself the head and brains of this murder gang Stangeist who was the man higher up It was amazing without parallel in the history of crime and yet ingenious clever full of the craft and cunning that had built up the shyster lawyer s reputation below the dead line Jimmie Dale s lips were curiously thin now So it was Stangeist A Doctor Jekyll and mister Hyde with a vengeance He knew Stangeist not personally not by the reputation Stangeist held low even as that was among his brother members of the profession but as the man was known for what he really was among the crooks and criminals of the underworld where in that strange underground exchange whispered confidences passed between those whose common enemy was the law where Larry the Bat himself was trusted in the innermost circles Stangeist was a power in the Bad Lands There were few among that unholy community that Stangeist at one time or another in one way or another had not rescued from the clutches of the law resorting to any trick or cunning but with perjury that he could handle like the master of it that he was employed as the most common weapon of defence for his clients provided he were paid well enough for it The man had become more than the attorney for the crime world he had become part of it Cunning shrewd crafty conscienceless cold blooded that was Stangeist The form and features of the man pictured themselves in Jimmie Dale s mind the six foot muscular frame that was invariably clothed in attire of the most fashionable cut the thin lips with their oily plausible smile the straight black hair that straggled into pin point little black eyes the dark face with its high cheek bones which with the pronounced aquiline nose and the persistent rumour that he was a quarter caste had led the underworld prejudiced always in favour of a monaker to dub the man the Indian Chief Jimmie Dale laughed again still unpleasantly So Stangeist had taken the plunge at last and branched out into a wider field had he Well there was nothing surprising in that except that he had not done it before The irony of it lay in the fact that at last he had been TOO clever overstepped himself in his own cleverness that was all It was Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane that Stangeist had gathered around him the Tocsin had said and there were none worse in Larry the Bat s wide range of acquaintanceship than those three Stangeist had made himself master of Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane and he had driven them a little too hard on the division of the spoils and laughed at them and cracked the whip much after the fashion that the trainer in the cage handles the growling beasts around him A dozen of the crimes that had appalled and staggered New York they had committed under his leadership and then it seemed they had quarrelled furiously the three pitted against Stangeist threatening him demanding a more equitable share of the proceeds None was better aware than Stangeist that threats from men of their calibre were likely to result in a grim aftermath and Stangeist yesterday the Tocsin said had answered them as no other man than Stangeist would either have thought of or have dared to do One by one at separate times covering the other with a revolver Stangeist had permitted them to read a document that was addressed to the district attorney It was a confession complete in every detail of every crime the four together had committed implicating Stangeist as fully and unreservedly as it did the other three It required no commentary If anything happened to Stangeist a stab in the dark for instance a bullet from some dark alleyway a blackjack deftly wielded as only Australian Ike The Mope or Clarie Deane knew how to wield it the document automatically became a DEATH SENTENCE for Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane It was very simple and evidently it had been effective as witness the renewal of their operations in the murder of Roessle that afternoon Fear and avarice had both probably played their part fear of the man who would with such consummate nerve fling his life into the balance to turn the tables upon them while he jeered at them avarice that prompted them to get what they could out of Stangeist s brains and leadership and to be satisfied with what they COULD get since they could get no more Satisfied Jimmie Dale shook his head No that was hardly the word cowed perhaps for the moment would be better But afterward with a document like that in existence when they would never be safe for an instant well beasts in the cages had been known to get the better of the man with the whip and beasts were gentle things compared with Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane Some day they would reverse the tables on the Indian Chief if they could And if they couldn t it would not be for the lack of trying There would be another act in that drama of the House Divided before the curtain fell And there would be a sort of grim poetic justice in it a temptation almost to let the play work itself out to its own inevitable conclusion only Jimmie Dale the final touches given to his features stood up and his hands clenched suddenly fiercely it was not just the man higher up alone there were the other three as well the whole four of them all of them crimes without number at their door brutal fiendish acts damnable outrages murder to answer for with which the public now was beginning to connect the name of the Gray Seal The Gray Seal Jimmie Dale s hands whose delicate fingers were artfully grimed and blackened now beneath the nails clenched still tighter and then with a quick shrug of his shoulders a thinning of the firmly compressed lips he picked up the coat from where it lay upon the floor put it on put the money that was on the table in his pocket and replaced the box under the flooring In quick succession from the same hiding place an automatic a black silk mask an electric flashlight that thin metal box like a cigarette case and a half dozen vicious looking little blued steel burglar s tools were stowed away in his pockets the flooring carefully replaced the oilcloth spread back again and then pulling a slouch hat well down over his eyes he reached up to turn off the gas For an instant his hand held there while his eyes sweeping around the apartment took in every single detail about him in that same alert comprehensive way as when he had entered then the room was in darkness and the Gray Seal as Larry the Bat a shuffling unkempt creature of the underworld alias Jimmie Dale the lionised of clubs the matrimonial target of exclusive drawing rooms closed the door of the Sanctuary behind him shuffled down the stairs shuffled out into the lane and shuffled along the street toward the Bowery A policeman on the corner accosted him familiarly Hello Larry grinned the officer Ello returned Jimmie Dale affably through the side of his mouth Fine night ain t it and shuffled on along the street And now Jimmie Dale began to hurry still with that shuffling tread but covering the ground nevertheless with amazing celerity He had lost no time since receiving the Tocsin s letter it was true but for all that it was now after ten o clock Stangeist s house was dark that evening she had said meaning that the occupants Stangeist as well as whatever servants there might be for Stangeist had no family were out the servants in town for a theatre or picture show probably and Stangeist himself as yet not back presumably from that Roessle affair The stub of an old cigar unlighted shifted with a sudden savage twist of the lips from one side of Jimmie Dale s mouth to the other There was need for haste There was no telling when Stangeist might get back as for the servants that did not matter so much servants in suburban homes had a marked affinity for last trains Jimmie Dale boarded a cross town car effected a transfer and in a quarter of an hour after leaving the Sanctuary was huddled an inoffensive heap like a tired out workingman in a corner seat of a Long Island train From here there was only a short run ahead of him and twenty minutes later descending from the train at Forest Hills he had passed through the more thickly settled portion of the little place and was walking briskly out along the country road Stangeist s house lay approximately a mile and a half from the station quite by itself and set well back from the road Jimmie Dale could have found it with his eyes blindfolded the Tocsin s directions had lacked none of their usual explicit minuteness The road was quite deserted Jimmie Dale met no one Even in the houses that he passed the lights were in nearly every instance already out Something merciless in its rage swept suddenly over Jimmie Dale as unbidden of its own volition the last paragraph he had read in that evening s paper began to repeat itself over and over again in his mind The two little kiddies it seemed as though he could see them standing there and from Jimmie Dale s lips not given to profanity there came a bitter oath It might possibly be that even if he were successful in what was before him to night the authors of the Roessle murder would never be known That confession of Stangeist s was written prior to what had happened that afternoon and there would be no mention naturally of Roessle And for a moment that seemed to Jimmie Dale the one thing paramount to all others the one thing that was vital then he shook his head and laughed out shortly After all it did not matter whether Stangeist and the blood wolves he had gathered around him paid the penalty specifically for one particular crime or for another could make little difference they would PAY just as surely just as certainly once that paper was in his possession Jimmie Dale was counting the houses as he passed they were more infrequent now farther apart Stangeist was no fool not the fool that he would appear to be for keeping a document like that once he had had the temerity to execute it in his own safe for in a day or two the Tocsin had hinted at this after holding it over the heads of Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane again to drive the force of it a little deeper home he would undoubtedly destroy it and the SUPPOSITION that it was still in existence would have equally the same effect on the minds of the other three Stangeist was certainly alive to the peril that he ran with such a thing in his possession only the peril had not appealed to him as imminent either from the three thugs with whom he had allied himself or much less from any one else that was all Jimmie Dale halted by a low ornamental stone fence some three feet high and stood there for a moment glancing about him This was Stangeist s house he could just make out the building as it loomed up a shadowy irregular shape perhaps two hundred yards back from the fence The house was quite dark not a light showed in any window Jimmie Dale sat down casually on the fence looked carefully again up and down the road then swinging his legs over quick now in every action he dropped to the other side and stole silently across the grass to the rear of the house Here he stopped again reached up to a window that was about on a level with his shoulders and tested its fastenings The window it was the window of Stangeist s private sanctum according to the plan in her letter was securely locked Jimmie Dale s hands went into his pocket and the black silk mask was slipped over his face He listened intently then a little steel instrument began to gnaw like a rat A minute passed two of them Again Jimmie Dale listened There was not a sound save the night sounds the light breeze whispering through the branches of the trees the far off rumble of a train the whir of insects the hoarse croaking of a frog from some near by creek or pond The window sash was raised an inch another and gradually to the top Like a shadow Jimmie Dale pulled himself up to the sill and poised there his hand parted the heavy portieres that hung within It was too dark to distinguish even a single object in the room He lowered himself to the floor and slipped cautiously between the portieres From somewhere in the house a clock began to strike Jimmie Dale counted the strokes Eleven o clock It was getting late TOO late Stangeist was likely to be back at any moment The flashlight in Jimmie Dale s hand now circled the room with its little round white ray lingering an instant in a queer inquisitive sort of way here and there on this object and that and went out Jimmie Dale nodded the flat desk in the centre of the floor the safe in the corner by the rear wall the position of everything in the room even to the chairs was photographed on his mind He stepped from the portieres to the safe and the flashlight played again this time reflecting back from the glistening nickelled knobs Jimmie Dale s lips tightened It was a small safe almost ludicrously small but to such height as the art of safe design had been carried that design was embodied in the one before him Type K four two eight Colby muttered Jimmie Dale A nasty little beggar and it s eleven o clock now I d use soup for once if it weren t that it would put Stangeist wise and give him a chance to make his get away before the district attorney got the nippers on the four of them The light went out Jimmie Dale dropped to his knees and while his left hand passed swiftly tentatively over dials and handle he rubbed the fingers of his right hand rapidly to and fro over the carpet Wonderful finger tips were those of Jimmie Dale sensitive to an abnormal degree and now tingling with the friction the nerves throbbing at the skin surface they closed in a light delicate touch upon the knob of the dial and Jimmie Dale s ear pressed close against the face of the safe Time passed The silence grew heavy seemed to palpitate through the room Then a deep breath half like a sigh half like a fluttering sob as of a strong man taxed to the uttermost of his endurance came from Jimmie Dale and his left hand swept away the sweat beads that had spurted to his forehead Eight thirteen twenty two whispered Jimmie Dale There was a click a low metallic thud as the bolts slid back and the door swung open And now the flashlight again searching the mechanism of the inner door then darkness once more Five minutes ten minutes went by The clock struck again and the single stroke seemed to boom out through the house in a weird raucous threatening note and seemed to linger throbbing in the air The inner door was open the flashlight s ray was flooding a nest of pigeonholes and little drawers The pigeonholes were crammed with papers as presumably too were the drawers Jimmie Dale sucked in his breath He had already been there well over half an hour every minute now every second was counting against him and to search that mass of papers before Stangeist returned was Ah it came in a fierce little ejaculation from Jimmie Dale From the centre pigeonhole almost the first paper he had touched he drew a long sealed envelope and at a single swift glance had read the inscription upon it written in longhand TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY NEW YORK CITY IMPORTANT URGENT The words in the corners were underscored three times Swiftly deftly Jimmie Dale s hands rolled the rounded end of one of his collection of the legal instruments under the flap of the envelope turned the sheets over and drew out the folded document inside There were eight sheets of legal foolscap neatly fastened together at the top left hand corner with green tape He opened them out read a few words here and there and turned the pages hurriedly over to scrutinise the last one and nodded grimly Three witnesses had testified to the signature of Stangeist and a notary s seal accompanied by the usual legal formula was duly affixed Jimmie Dale slipped the document into his pocket and with the envelope in his hand moved to the desk He opened first one drawer and then another and finally discovering a pile of blank foolscap took out four sheets folded them and placed them in the envelope sealing the flap of the latter again That it did not seal very well now brought a quizzical twitch to Jimmie Dale s lips Sealed or unsealed perhaps it made little difference but for all that he was not through with it yet Apart from bringing the four to justice there was after all a chance to vindicate the Gray Seal in this matter at least and repudiate the newspaper theory which the public to whom the Gray Seal was already a monster of iniquity would seize upon with avidity There was no further need of light now Jimmie Dale replaced the flashlight in his pocket took out the thin metal case opened it and with the tiny pair of tweezers that likewise nestled there lifted out one of the gray diamond shaped paper seals There was no question but that once under arrest Stangeist s effects would be immediately and thoroughly searched by the authorities Jimmie Dale s smile from quizzical became ironic It would afford the police another little bewildering reminder of the Gray Seal and give Carruthers good old Carruthers of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS so innocently ignorant that the Gray Seal was his old college pal yet the one editor of them all who was not forever barking and yelping at the Gray Seal s heels a chance to vindicate himself a little too Jimmie Dale moistened the adhesive side of the gray seal and still mindful of tell tale finger prints laid it with the tweezers on the flap of the envelope and pressed it firmly into place with his elbow And then suddenly every faculty instantly on the alert he snatched up the envelope from the desk and listened Was it imagination a trick of nerves or no there it was again a footfall on the gravel walk at the front of the house The sound became louder clearer two footfalls instead of one It was Stangeist and somebody was with him In an instant Jimmie Dale was across the room and kneeling again before the safe His fingers were flying now The envelope shot back into the pigeonhole from which he had taken it the inner door of the safe closed silently and swiftly A dry chuckle came from Jimmie Dale s lips It was just like fiction just precisely time enough to have accomplished what he had come for before he was interrupted not a second more or less the villain foiled at the psychological moment The key was rattling in the front door now they were in the hall he could hear Stangeist s voice there came a dull glow from the hallway following the click of an electric light switch The outer door of the safe swung shut the bolts slid into place the dial whirled under Jimmie Dale s fingers It was only a step to the portieres the open window and escape He straightened up stepped back the portieres closed behind him and the chuckle died on Jimmie Dale s lips He was trapped caught without so much as a corner in which to turn Stangeist was even then coming into the room and OUTSIDE darkly outlined two forms stood just beneath the window Instinctively quick as a flash Jimmie Dale crouched below the sill Who were they What did it mean Questions swept in swift sequence through his brain Had they seen him It would be very dark against the background of the portieres but yet if they were watching he drew a breath of relief He had not been seen Their voices reached him in low guarded whispers Say youse Ike pipe it Dere s a window open in the snitch s room Come on we ll get in dere It ll make the hair stand up on the back of his neck fer a starter Aw ferget it replied another voice Can the tee ayter stunt Clarie leaves the front door unfastened don t he An dey ll be in dere in a minute now Wotcher want ter do Crab the game He might hear us an fix Clarie before we had a chanst the skinny old fox An dere s the light now see Beat it on yer toes fer the front of the house The room was flooded with light Through the portieres that Jimmie Dale parted by the barest fraction of an inch he could see Stangeist and another man a thick set ugly faced looking customer Clarie Deane according to that brief whispered colloquy that he had heard outside He looked again through the window The two dark forms had disappeared now but they had disappeared just a few seconds too late with the two other men now in the room and one of them so close that Jimmie Dale could almost have reached out and touched him it was impossible to get through the window without being detected when the slightest sound would attract instant attention and equally instant suspicion It was a chance to be taken only as a last resort Jimmie Dale s face grew hard as his fingers closed around his automatic and drew the weapon from his pocket It was all plain enough That last act in the drama which he had speculatively anticipated was being staged with little loss of time and in a grim sort of way the thought flashed across his mind that perilous as his own position was Stangeist at that moment was in even greater peril than himself Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane given the chance and they seemed to have made that chance now were not likely to deal in half measures Clarie Deane had dropped into a chair beside the desk and The Mope and Australian Ike were creeping around to the front door The parting in the portieres widened a little more a very little more slowly imperceptibly until Jimmie Dale by the simple expedient of moving his head could obtain an unobstructed view of the entire room Stangeist tossed a bag he had been carrying on the desk pulled up a chair opposite to Clarie Deane and sat down Both men were side face to Jimmie Dale You tell the boys said Stangeist abruptly to fade away after this for a while Things are getting too hot And you tell The Mope I dock him five hundred for that extra crunch on Roessle s skull That sort of thing isn t necessary That s the kind of stunt that gets the public sore the man was dead enough as it was See Sure Clarie Deane s ejaculation was a grunt Stangeist opened the bag and dumped the contents on the desk pile after pile of banknotes the pay roll of the Martindale Kensington Mills Some haul observed Clarie Deane with a hoarse chuckle The papers said over twenty thousand You can t always believe what the papers say returned Stangeist curtly and taking a scribbling pad from the desk began to check up the packages Clarie Deane s cigar had gone out He rolled the short stub in his mouth and leaned forward The bills were evidently just as they had been delivered to the murdered paymaster at the bank done up with little narrow paper bands in packages of one hundred notes each save for a small bundle of loose bills which latter with the rolls of silver Stangeist swept to one side of the desk Package by package Stangeist went on jotting the amounts down on the pad Nix growled Clarie Deane suddenly Cut that out Them s fivers in that wad Make that five hundred instead of one I m onter yer Mistake said Stangeist suavely changing the figures with his pencil You re pretty wide awake for this time of night aren t you Clarie Oh I dunno responded Clarie Deane gruffly Not so very Stangeist finished with the packages picked up the loose bills and with a short laugh tossed them into the bag and followed them with the rolls of silver He pushed the bag toward Clarie Deane That s a little extra for you he said The trouble with you fellows is that you don t know when you re well off but the sooner you find it out the better unless you want another lesson like yesterday He made the addition on the pad Fifteen thousand eight hundred dollars he announced softly That s seven thousand nine hundred for the three of you to divide less five hundred from The Mope Clarie Deane s eyes narrowed His hands were on his knees hidden by the desk There s more n twenty there he said sullenly and drew a match across the under edge of the desk with a long crackling noise Stangeist s face lost its suavity a snarl curled his lips but about to reply he sprang suddenly to his feet instead his head turned sharply toward the door What s that he said hoarsely It s not the servants they wouldn t dare to Stangeist s words ended in a gulp He was staring into the muzzle of a heavy calibered revolver that Clarie Deane had jerked up from under the desk You sit down or I ll blow your block off said Clarie Deane with a sudden leer It happened then almost before Jimmie Dale could grasp the details before even Clarie Deane himself could interfere The door burst open two men rushed in and one with a bound flung himself at Stangeist The man s hand grasping a clubbed revolver rose in the air descended on Stangeist s head and Stangeist went down in a limp heap crashed into the chair and slid from the chair with a thud to the floor There was an oath from Clarie Deane He jumped from his seat and with a violent shove sent the man reeling half across the room Blast you Mope he snarled You re too blamed fly D ye wanter queer the whole biz Aw wot s the matter wid youse The Mope purple faced with rage little black eyes glittering mouth working under a flattened nose that some previous encounter had broken and bent over the side of his face advanced belligerently Australian Ike who had entered the room with him pulled him back Ferget it he flung out Clarie s dealin the deck Ferget it The Mope glared from one to the other then shook his fist at Stangeist on the floor Youse two make me sick he sneered Wot s the use of waitin all night We was to bump him off anyway wasn t we Dat s wot youse said yerselves cause wot was ter stop him writin out another paper if we didn t fix him fer keeps That s all right rejoined Clarie Deane but that s the second act you bonehead see We ain t got the paper yet have we Say take a look at that safe It s easier ter scare him inter openin it than ter crack it ain t it Jimmie Dale from his crouched position began to rise to his feet slowly making but the slightest movement at a time cautious of the least sound His lips were like a thin line his fingers tightly pressed over the automatic in his hand There was not room for him between the portieres and the window and do what he could the hangings bulged a little Let one of the three notice that or inadvertently brush against the portieres and his life would not be worth an instant s purchase They were lifting Stangeist up now propping him up in the chair Stangeist moaned opened his eyes stared in a dazed way at the three faces that leered into his then dawning intelligence came and his face that had been white before took on a pasty grayish pallor You the three of you he mumbled What s this mean And then Clarie Deane laughed in a low brutal way Wot d ye think it means We want that paper an we want it damn quick see D ye think we was goin ter stand fer havin a trip ter Sing Sing an the wire chair danglin over our heads Stangeist closed his eyes When he opened them again something of the old time craftiness was in his face Well what are you going to do about it he inquired almost sharply You know what will happen to you if anything happens to me Don t youse kid yerself retorted Clarie Deane D ye think we re fools This ain t like it was yesterday see We GETS the paper this time so there won t nothin happen to us You come across with it blasted quick now or The Mope ll give you another on the bean that ll put you to sleep fer keeps The blood was running down Stangeist s face He wiped it away from his eyes It s not here he said innocently It s in my box in the safety deposit vaults Aw blurted out Australian Ike pushing suddenly forward youse can t work dat crawl on Cut it out Ike snapped Clarie Dane I m runnin this So it s in the vaults eh He shoved his face toward Stangeist s Yes said Stangeist easily You see I was looking for something like this Clarie Deane s fist clenched You lie he choked The Mope here was the last of us you showed the paper to yesterday afternoon an the vaults was closed then an you ain t been there to day cause you ve been watched That s why we fixed it fer to night after the divvy that you ve just tried ter do us on again cause we knew you had it here I tell you it s not here said Stangeist evenly You lie said Clarie Deane again It s in that safe The Mope heard you tell the girl in yer office that if anything happened to you she was ter wise up the district attorney that there was a paper in your safe at home fer him that was important Now then you beat it over ter that safe an open it up we ll give you a minute ter do it in The paper s not there I tell you said Stangeist once more That s all right submitted Clarle Deane grimly There s a quarter of that minute gone I won t Stangeist flashed out violently That s all right repeated Clarie Deane There s half of that minute gone Jimmie Dale s eyes in a fascinated sort of way were on Stangeist The man s face was twitching now moisture began to ooze from his forehead as the callous brutality of the scowling faces seemed to get him and then he lurched suddenly forward in his chair My God he cried out a ring of terror in his voice What do you mean to do You ll pay for it They ll get you The servants will be back in a minute Two skirts jeered Clarie Deane We ain t goin ter run away from them If they comes before we goes we ll fix em That minute s up Stangeist licked his lips with his tongue Suppose suppose I refuse he said hoarsely You can suit yerself said Clarie Deane with a vicious grin We know the paper s there an we gets it before we leaves here see You can take yer choice Either you goes over ter the safe an opens it yerself or else he paused and produced a small bottle from his pocket this is nitro glycerin an we opens it fer you with this Only if we does the job we does it proper We ties you up and sets you against the door of the safe before we touches off the soup an mabbe if yer a good guesser you can guess the rest There was a short raucous guffaw from The Mope Stangeist turned a drawn face toward the man stared at him and stared in a miserable way at the other two in turn He licked his lips again none was in a better position than himself to know that there would be neither scruples nor hesitancy to interfere with carrying out the threat Suppose he said trying to keep his voice steady suppose I open the safe what then afterward We ain t got the safe open yet countered Clarie Deane uncompromisingly An we ain t got no more time ter fool over it either You get a move on before I counts five or The Mope an Ike ties you up One Stangeist staggered to his feet wiped the blood out of his eyes for the second time and with lips working went unsteadily across the room to the safe He knelt before it and began to manipulate the dial while the others crowded around behind him The Mope was fingering his revolver again club fashion Australian Ike s elbow just grazed the portieres and Jimmie Dale flattened himself against the window holding his breath a smile on his lips that was mirthless deadly cold The end was not far off now and then WHAT Stangeist had the outer door of the safe open now and now the inner door swung back He reached in his hand to the pigeonhole drew out the envelope and with a sudden wild cry reeled to his feet My God he screamed out What s what s this Clarie Deane snatched the envelope from him THE GRAY SEAL the words came with a jerk from his lips He ripped the envelope open frantically and like a man stunned gazed at the four blank sheets while the colour left his face IT S GONE he cried out hoarsely Gone There was a burst of oaths from Australian Ike Gone Den we re nipped de lot of us The Mope s face was like a maniac s as he whirled on Stangeist Sure he croaked But youse gets yers first youse With a cry Stangeist to elude the blow ducked blindly backward into the portieres and with a rip and tear the hangings were wrenched apart It came instantaneously a yell of mingled surprise and fury from the three the crash and spit of Jimmie Dale s revolver as he fired one shot at the floor to stop their rush then he flung himself at the window through it and dropped sprawling to the ground A stream of flame cut the darkness above him a bullet whistled by his head another and another He was on his feet quick as a cat and running close alongside of the wall of the house He heard a thud behind him still another and yet a third they were dropping through the window after him Came another shot an angry hum of the bullet closer than before then the pound of racing feet Jimmie Dale swung around the corner of the house running at top speed Something that was like a hot iron suddenly burned and seared along the side of his head just above the ear He reeled staggered recovered himself and dashed on It nauseated him that stinging in his head and all at once seemed to be draining his strength away The shouts the shots the running feet became like a curious buzzing in his ears It seemed strange that they should have hit him that he should be wounded If he could only reach the low stone wall by the road he could at least make a fight for his life on the other side Red streaks swam before Jimmie Dale s eyes The wall was such a long way off a yard or two was a very long way more to go the weakness seemed to be creeping up now even to numb his brain No here was the wall they hadn t hit him again he laughed in a demented way and rolled his body over and fell to the other side JIMMIE The cry seemed to reach some inner consciousness revive him send the blood whipping through his veins That voice It was her HERS The Tocsin There was an automobile engine racing standing there in the road He won to his feet dark rushing forms were almost at the wall He fired once twice fired again and turned staggering for the car Jimmie Jimmie QUICK Panting gasping he half fell into the tonneau The car leaped forward yells filled the air but only one thing was dominant in Jimmie Dale s reeling brain now He pulled himself up to his feet and leaned over the back of the seat reaching for the slim figure that was bent over the wheel It s you you at last he cried Your face let me lee your face A bullet split the back panel of the car little spurting flames were dancing out from the roadway behind Are you mad she shouted back at him Let me steer do you want them to hit me No o said Jimmie Dale in a queer singsong sort of way and his head seemed to spin dizzily around No I guess He choked The paper it s in my pocket and he went down unconscious on the floor of the car When he recovered his senses he was lying on a couch in a plainly furnished room and a man a stranger red jovial faced farmerish looking was bending over him Where am I he demanded finally propping himself up on his elbow You re all right replied the man She said you d come around in a little while Who said so inquired Jimmie Dale She did The woman who brought you here about five minutes ago She said she ran you down with her car Oh said Jimmie Dale He felt his head it was bandaged and it was bandaged he was quite sure with a piece of torn underskirt He looked at the man again You haven t told me yet where I am Long Island the other answered My name s Hanson I keep a bit of a truck garden here Oh said Jimmie Dale again The man crossed the room picked up an envelope from the table and came back to Jimmie Dale She said to give you this as soon as you got your senses and asked us to put you up for a while as long as you wanted to stay and paid us for it too She s all right she is You don t want to hold the accident up against her she was mighty sorry about it And now I ll go and see if the old lady s got your room ready while you re readin your letter The man left the room Jimmie Dale sat up on the couch and tore the envelope open The note scrawled in pencil began abruptly You were quite a problem I couldn t take you HOME could I I couldn t take you to what you call the Sanctuary could I I couldn t take you to a hospital nor call in a doctor the stain you use wouldn t stand it But thank God I know it s only a flesh wound and you are all right where you are for the day or two that you must keep quiet and take care of yourself By the time you read this the paper will be on the way to the proper hands and by morning the four where they should be There were a few articles in your clothes I thought it better to take charge of in case well in case of ACCIDENT Jimmie Dale tore the note up and smiled wryly at the door He felt in his pockets Mask revolver burglar s tools and the thin metal insignia case were gone And I had the sublime optimism murmured Jimmie Dale to spend months trying to find her as Larry the Bat CHAPTER IX TWO CROOKS AND A KNAVE The bullet wound along the side of his head and just above his ear would have been a very awkward thing indeed in more ways than one for Jimmie Dale the millionaire to have explained at his club in his social set or even to his servants and of these latter to Jason the Solicitous in particular but for Jimmie Dale as Larry the Bat it was a matter of little moment There was none to question Larry the Bat save in a most casual and indifferent way and a bandage of any description primarily and above all one that he could arrange himself with only himself to take note of the incongruous hues of skin where the stain the grease paint and the make up was washed off would excite little attention in that world where daily affrays were common place happenings and a wound for whatever reason had long since lost the tang of novelty Why then should it arouse even a passing interest if Larry the Bat credited as the most confirmed of dope fiends should have fallen down the dark rickety stairs of the tenement in one of his orgies and in the expressive language of the Bad Lands cracked his bean And so Jimmie Dale had been forced to maintain the role of Larry the Bat for a far longer period than he had anticipated when ten days before he had assumed it for the night s work that had so nearly resulted fatally for himself though it had placed Roessle s murderers behind the bars For the next day unwilling to court the risk of remaining in that neighbourhood he had left Hanson s the farmer s house on Long Island where the Tocsin had carried him in an unconscious state telephoned Jason that he had been unexpectedly called out of town for a few days and returned to the Sanctuary in New York And here to his grim dismay he had found the underworld in a state of furious angry unrest like a nest of hornets stirred up seeking to wreak vengeance on an unseen assailant For years as the Gray Seal Jimmie Dale had lived with the slogan of the police The Gray Seal dead or alive but the Gray Seal sounding in his ears with the newspapers screaming their diatribes arousing the people against him nagging the authorities into sleepless frenzied efforts to trap him with a price upon his head that was large enough to make a man not too pretentious rich for life but in the underworld until then the name of the Gray Seal had been one to conjure with for the underworld had sworn by the unknown master criminal and had spoken his name with a reverence that was none the less genuine even if pungently tainted with unholiness But now it was different Up and down through the Bad Lands in gambling hells in vicious resorts in the hiding places where thugs and crooks burrowed themselves away from the daylight through the heart and the outskirts of the underworld travelled the fiat whispered out of mouths crooked to one side DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL Gangland differences were forgotten in the larger issue of the common weal The gang spirit became the spirit of a united whole and the crime fraternity buzzed and hummed poisonously spurred on by hatred thirst for revenge fear and perhaps most potent of all a hideous suspicion now of each other The underworld had received a shock at which it stood aghast and which with its terrifying possibilities struck consternation into the soul of every individual of that brotherhood whose bond was crime who was already wanted for some offence or other whether it ranged from murder in the first degree to some petty piece of sneak thievery Stangeist the Indian chief the lawyer whose cunning brain had stood as a rampart between the underworld and a prison cell was himself now in the Tombs with the certainty of the electric chair before him and with him the same fate equally assured were Australian Ike The Mope and Clarie Deane Aristocrats of the Bad Lands peers of that inglorious realm were those four and the blow had fallen with stunning force a blow that in itself would have been enough to have stirred the underworld to its depths But that was not all from the cells in the Tombs from the four came the word and passed from mouth to mouth in that strange underground exchange until all had heard it that the Gray Seal had SQUEALED The Gray Seal who though unknown they had counted the most eminent among themselves had squealed Who was the Gray Seal It he had held the secrets of Stangeist and his band what else might he not know Who else might not fall next The Gray Seal had become a snitch a menace a source of danger that stalked among them like a ghastly spectre Who was the Gray Seal None knew Death to the Gray Seal Run him to earth went the whisper from lip to lip and with the whisper men stared uncertainly into each other s faces fearful that the one to whom they spoke might even be the Gray Seal Jimmie Dale s lips twisted queerly as he looked around him at the squalid appointments of the Sanctuary The police were bad enough the papers were worse but this was a still graver peril With every denizen of the underworld below the dead line suspicious of each other their lives the penitentiary or a prison sentence the stakes against which each one played the role of Larry the Bat clever as was the make up and disguise was fraught now more than ever before with danger and peril It seemed as though slowly the net was beginning at last to tighten around him The murky yellow flame of the gas jet flickered suddenly as though in acquiescence with the quick impulsive shrug of Jimmie Dale s shoulders and Jimmie Dale bending to peer into the cracked mirror that was propped up on the broken legged table knotted his dress tie almost fastidiously The hair if just a trifle too long covered the scar on his head now the wound no longer required a bandage and Larry the Bat for the time being at least had disappeared Across the foot of the bed neatly folded lay his dress coat and overcoat but little creased for all that they had lain in that hiding place under the flooring since the night when hurrying from the club he had placed them there to assume instead the tatters of Larry the Bat It was Jimmie Dale in his own person again who stood there now in Larry the Bat s disreputable den an incongruous figure enough against the background of his miserable surroundings in perfect fitting shoes and trousers the broad expanse of spotless white shirt bosom glistening even in the poverty stricken flare from the single sputtering gas jet Jimmie Dale took the watch from his pocket that had not been wound for many days wound it mechanically set it by guesswork it was not far from eight o clock and replaced it in his pocket Carefully then one at a time he examined his fingers long slim sensitive tapering fingers magical masters of safes and locks and vaults of the most intricate and modern mechanism no single trace of grime remained they were metamorphosed hands from the filthy paws of Larry the Bat He nodded in satisfaction and picked up the mirror for a final inspection of himself that this time did not miss a single line in his face or neck Again Jimmie Dale nodded As though he had vanished into thin air as though he had never existed not a trace of Larry the Bat remained except the heap of rags upon the floor the battered slouch hat the frayed trousers the patched boots with their broken laces the mismated socks the grimy flannel shirt and the old coat that he had just discarded The mirror was replaced on the table and pushing the heap of clothes before him with his foot Jimmie Dale knelt down in the corner of the room where the oilcloth had been turned up and the loose planking of the floor removed and began to pack the articles away in the hole Jimmie Dale rolled the trousers of Larry the Bat into a compact little bundle and stuffed them under the flooring The gas jet seemed to blink again in a sort of confidential approval as though the secret lay inviolate between itself and Jimmie Dale Through the closed window shade tightly drawn came low and muffled the sound of distant life from the Bowery a few blocks away The gas jet suffering from air somewhere within the pipes hissed angrily the yellow flame died to a little blue forked spurt and Jimmie Dale was on his feet his face suddenly hard and white as marble SOME ONE WAS KNOCKING AT THE DOOR For the fraction of a second Jimmie Dale stood motionless Found as Jimmie Dale in the den of Larry the Bat and the consequences required no effort of the imagination to picture them police or denizen of the underworld who was knocking there it was all the same the method of death would be a little different that was all one legalised the other not Jimmie Dale Larry the Bat the Gray Seal once uncovered could expect as much quarter as would be given to a cornered rat His eyes swept the room with a swift critical glance evidences of Larry the Bat the clothes were still about even if he in the person of Jimmie Dale alone damning enough were not standing there himself And he was even weaponless the Tocsin had taken the revolver from his pocket together with those other telltale articles the mask the flashlight the little blued steel tools before she had intrusted him that night wounded and unconscious to Hanson s care Jimmie Dale slipped his feet out of his low evening pumps snatched up the old coat and hat from the pile put them on and without a sound reached the gas jet and turned it off A second had gone by no more the knocking still sounded insistently on the door It was dark now perfectly black He started across the room his tread absolutely silent as the trained muscles relaxing threw the body weight gradually upon one foot before the next step was taken It was like a shadow a little blacker in outline than the surrounding blackness stealing across the floor Halfway to the door he paused The knocking had ceased He listened intently It was not repeated Instead his ear caught a guarded step retreating outside in the hall Jimmie Dale drew a breath of relief He went on again to the door still listening Was it a trap that step outside At the door now tense alert he lowered his ear to the keyhole There came the faintest creak from the stairs Jimmie Dale s brows gathered It was strange The knocking had not lasted long Whoever it was was going away but it required the utmost caution to descend those stairs rickety and tumble down as they were with no more sound than that Why such caution Why not a more determined and prolonged effort at his door the visitor had been easily satisfied that Larry the Bat was not within TOO easily satisfied Jimmie Dale turned the key noiselessly in the lock He opened the door cautiously half inch an inch there was no sound of footsteps now Occasionally a lodger moved about on the floor above occasionally from somewhere in the tenement came the murmur of voices as from behind closed door that was all All else was silence and darkness now The door on its well oiled hinges swung wide open Jimmie Dale thrust out his head into the hall and something fell upon the threshold with a little thud but for a moment Jimmie Dale did not move Listening trying to pierce the darkness he was as still as the silence around him then he stooped and groped along the threshold His hand closed upon what seemed like a small box wrapped in paper He picked it up closed and locked the door again and retreated back across the room It was strange unpleasantly strange a box propped stealthily against the door so that it would fall to the threshold when the door was opened And why the stealth What did it mean Had the underworld with its thousand eyes and ears already succeeded in a few days where the police had failed signally for years had they sent him this whatever it was as some grim token that they had run Larry the Bat to earth He shook his head No gangland struck more swiftly with less finesse than that the cat and mouse act was never one it favoured for the mouse had been known to get away Jimmie Dale lighted the gas again and turned the package over in his hands It was as he had surmised a small cardboard box and it was wrapped in plain paper and tied with a string He untied the string and still suspicious as a man is suspicious in the knowledge that he is stalked by peril at every turn removed the wrapper a little gingerly It was still without sign or marking upon it just an ordinary cardboard box He lifted off the cover and with a short sudden laugh stared a little out of countenance at the contents On the top lay a white unaddressed envelope HERS Beneath he emptied the box on the table his black silk mask his automatic revolver the kit of fine small blued steel burglar s tools his pocket flashlight and the thin metal insignia case The Tocsin Impulsively Jimmie Dale turned toward the door and stopped His shoulders lifted in a shrug that meant to be philosophical was far from philosophical He could not dared not venture far through the tenement dressed as he was and even if he could there were three exits to the Sanctuary a fact that now for the first time was not wholly a source of unmixed satisfaction to him and besides she was gone Jimmie Dale opened the letter a grim smile playing on his lips He had forgotten for the moment that the illusion he had cherished for years in the belief that she did not know Larry the Bat as an alias of Jimmie Dale was no more than an illusion Well it had been a piece of consummate egotism on his part that was all But after all what did it matter He had had his innings tried in the role of Larry the Bat to solve her identity devoted weeks on end to the attempt and failed Some day perhaps his turn would come some day perhaps she would no longer be able to elude him unless the letter crackled suddenly in his fingers unless the house that they had built on such strange and perilous foundations crashed at some moment without an instant s warning in disaster and ruin to the ground Who knew but that this letter now another call to the Gray Seal to act another peril invited would be the LAST There must be an end some day luck and nerve had their limitations it had almost ended last week Dear Philanthropic Crook it was the same inevitable beginning You are well enough again aren t you Jimmie I am sending these little things back to you for you will need them to night Jimmie Dale read on muttering snatches of the letter aloud Michael Breen prospecting in Alaska map of location of rich mining claim Hamvert his former partner had previously fleeced him of fifteen thousand dollars his share of a deal together Breen was always a very poor man Breen later struck a claim alone but taking sick came back home died on arrival in New York after giving map to his wife wife in very needy circumstances lives with little daughter of seven in New Rochelle works out by the day at Henry Mittel s house on the Sound near by wife intrusted map for safe keeping and advice to Mittel Hamvert after map telephone wires cut room one hundred and forty eight corner right first floor Palais Metropole Hotel unoccupied connecting doors quarter past nine to night the Weasel Mittel s house later the police look out for both the Weasel and the police Jimmie There was more several pages of it explanations specific details down to a minute description of the locality and plan of the house on the Sound Jimmie Dale too intent now to mutter read on silently At the end he shuffled the sheets a little abstractedly as his face hardened Then his fingers began to tear the letter into little shreds tearing it over and over again tearing the shreds into tiny particles He had not been far wrong From what the night promised now this might well be the last letter Who knew There would be need of all the wit and luck and nerve to night that the Gray Seal had ever had before With a jerk Jimmie Dale roused himself from the momentary reverie into which he had fallen and all action now stuffed the torn pieces of the letter into his trousers pocket to be disposed of later in the street took off the old coat and slouch hat again and resumed the disposal of Larry the Bat s effects under the flooring This accomplished he replaced the planking and oilcloth stood up put on his dress coat and light overcoat and from the table stowed the black silk mask the automatic the little kit of tools the flashlight and the thin metal case away in his pockets Jimmie Dale raised his hand to the gas fixture circled the room with a glance that missed no single detail then the light went out the door closed behind him locked a dark shadow crept silently down the stairs out through the side door into the alleyway along the alleyway close to the wall of the tenement where it was blackest and satisfied that for the moment there were no passers by emerged on the street walking leisurely toward the Bowery Once well away from the Sanctuary however Jimmie Dale quickened his steps and twenty minutes later having stopped but once to telephone to his home on Riverside Drive for his touring car he was briskly mounting the steps of the saint James Club on Fifth Avenue Another twenty minutes after that and he had dismissed Benson his chauffeur and at the wheel of his big powerful machine was speeding uptown for the Palais Metropole Hotel It was twelve minutes after nine when he drew up at the curb in front of the side entrance of the hotel his watch set by guesswork had been a little slow and he had corrected it at the club He was replacing the watch in his pocket as he sauntered around the corner and passed in through the main entrance to the big lobby Jimmie Dale avoided the elevators it was only one flight up and elevator boys on occasions had been known to be observant At the top of the first landing a long wide heavily carpeted corridor was before him Number one hundred and forty eight the corner room on the right the Tocsin had said Jimmie Dale walked nonchalantly along past No one hundred forty eight At the lower end of the hall a group of people were gathered around the elevator doors halfway down the corridor a bell boy came out of a room and went ahead of Jimmie Dale And then Jimmie Dale stopped suddenly and began to retrace his steps The group had entered the elevator the bell boy had disappeared around the farther end of the hall into the wing of the hotel the corridor was empty In a moment he was standing before the door of No one hundred forty eight in another under the persuasion of a little steel instrument deftly manipulated by Jimmie Dale s slim tapering fingers the lock clicked back the door opened and he stepped inside closing and locking the door again behind him It was already a quarter past nine but no one was as yet in the connecting room the fanlight next door had been dark as he passed His flashlight swept about him located the connecting door and went out He moved to the door tried it and found it locked Again the little steel instrument came into play released the lock and Jimmie Dale opened the door Again the flashlight winked The door opened into a bathroom that obviously at will was either common to the two rooms or could by the simple expedient of locking one door or the other be used by one of the rooms alone In the present instance the occupant of the adjoining apartment had taken a room with a bath Jimmie Dale passed through the bathroom to the opposite door This was already three quarters open and swung outward into the bedroom near the lower end of the room by the window Through the crack of the door by the hinges Jimmie Dale flashed his light testing the radius of vision pushed the door a few inches wider open tested it again with the flashlight and retreated back into No one hundred forty eight closing the door on his side until it was just ajar He stood there then silently waiting It was Hamvert s room next door and Hamvert and the Weasel were already late A step sounded outside in the corridor Jimmie Dale straightened intently The step passed on down the hallway and died away A false alarm Jimmie Dale smiled whimsically It was a strange adventure this that confronted him quite the strangest in a way that the Tocsin had ever planned and the night lay before him full of peril in its extraordinary complications To win the hand he must block Hamvert and the Weasel without allowing them an inkling that his interference was anything more than say the luck of a hotel sneak thief at most The Weasel was a dangerous man one of the slickest second story workers in the country with safe cracking as one of his favourite pursuits a man most earnestly desired by the police provided the latter could catch him with the goods As for Hamvert he did not know Hamvert who was a stranger in New York except that Hamvert had fleeced a man named Michael Breen out of his share in a claim they had had together when Breen had first gone to Alaska to try his luck and now having discovered that Breen when prospecting alone somewhere in the interior a month or so ago had found a rich vein and had made a map or diagram of its location he Hamvert had followed the other to New York for the purpose of getting it by hook or crook Breen s find had been too late taken sick he had never worked his claim had barely got back home before he died and only in time to hand his wife the strange legacy of a roughly scrawled little piece of paper and Jimmie Dale straightened up alertly once more Steps again and this time coming from the direction of the elevator then voices then the opening of the door of the next room then a voice distinctly audible Pull up a chair and we ll get down to business You re late as it is We haven t any time to waste if we re going to wash pay dirt to night Aw dat s all right responded another voice quite evidently the Weasel s Don t youse worry de game s cinched to a fadeaway There was the sound of chairs being moved across the floor Jimmie Dale slipped the black silk mask over his face opened the door on his side of the bathroom cautiously and without a sound stepped into the bathroom that was lighted now of course by the light streaming in through the partially opened door of Hamvert s room The two were talking earnestly now in lower tones Jimmie Dale only caught a word here and there his faculties for the moment were concentrated on traversing the bathroom silently He reached the farther door crouched there peered through the crack and the old whimsical smile flickered across his lips again The Palais Metropole was high class and exclusive and the Weasel for once looked quite the gentleman and for all his sharp ferret face not entirely out of keeping with his surroundings else he would never have got farther than the lobby The other was a short thickset heavy jowled man with a great shock of sandy hair and small black eyes that looked furtively out from overhanging bushy eyebrows Well Hamvert was saying the details are your concern What I want is results We won t waste time You re to be back here by daylight only see that there s no come back Leave it to me returned the Weasel with assurance How s dere goin ter be any come back Mittel keeps it in his safe don t he Well gentlemen s houses has been robbed before an dis job ll be a good one De geographfy stunt youse wants gets pinched wid de rest dat s all It disappears see Who s ter know youse gets yer claws on it It s just lost in de shuffle Right agreed Hamvert briskly and from his inside pocket produced a package of crisp new bills yellow backs and evidently of large denominations Half down and half on delivery that s our deal Dat s wot assented the Weasel curtly Hamvert began to count the bills Jimmie Dale s hand stole into his pocket and came out with his handkerchief and the thin metal insignia case From the latter with its little pair of tweezers he took out one of the adhesive gray seals His eyes warily on the two men he dropped the seal on his handkerchief restored the thin metal case to his pocket and in its stead the blue black ugly muzzle of his automatic peeped from between his fingers Five thousand down said Hamvert pushing a pile of notes across the table and tucking the remainder back into his pocket and the other five s here for you when you get back with the map Ordinarily I wouldn t pay a penny in advance but since you want it that way and the map s no good to you while the rest of the long green is I He swallowed his words with a startled gulp clutched hastily at the money on the table and began to struggle up from his chair to his feet With a swift noiseless side step through the open door Jimmie Dale was standing in the room Jimmie Dale s tones were conversational Don t get up said Jimmie Dale coolly And take your hand off that money The Weasel whose back had been to the door squirmed around in his chair and in his turn stared into the muzzle of Jimmie Dale s revolver while his jaw dropped and sagged Good evening Weasel observed Jimmie Dale casually I seem to be in luck to night I got into that room next door but an empty room is slim picking And then it seemed to me I heard some one in here mention five thousand dollars twice which makes ten thousand and which happens to be just exactly the sum I need at the present moment if I can t get any more I haven t the honour of your wealthy friend s acquaintance but I am really charmed to meet him You er understand both of you that the slightest sound might prove extremely embarrassing Hamvert s face was white and he stirred uneasily in his chair but into the Weasel s face the first shock of surprised dismay past came a dull angry red and into the eyes a vicious gleam and suddenly he laughed shortly Why youse damned fool jeered the Weasel d youse t ink youse can get away wid dat Say take it from me youse are a piker Say youse make me tired Wot d youse t ink youse are D youse t ink dis is a tee ayter an dat youse are a cheap skate actor strollin acrost de stage Aw beat it youse make me sick Why say youse pinch dat money an youse have got de same chanst of gettin outer dis hotel as a guy has of breakin outer Sing Sing By de time youse gets five feet from de door of dis room we has de whole works on yer neck Do you think so Weasel inquired Jimmie Dale politely He carried his handkerchief to his mouth to cloak a cough and his tongue touched the adhesive side of the little diamond shaped gray seal Hand and handkerchief came back to the table and Jimmie Dale leaned his weight carelessly upon it while the automatic in his right hand still covered the two men Do you think so Weasel he repeated softly Well perhaps you are right and yet somehow I am inclined to disagree with you Let me see Weasel it was Tuesday night two nights ago wasn t it that a trifling break in Maiden Lane at Thorold and Sons disturbed the police It was a three year job for even a first offender ten for one already on nodding terms with the police and fifteen to twenty for well say for a man like you Weasel IF HE WERE CAUGHT Am I making myself quite plain The colour in the Weasel s cheeks faded a little his eyes were holding in sudden fascination upon Jimmie Dale I see that I am observed Jimmie Dale pleasantly I said if he were caught you will remember I am going to leave this room in a moment Weasel and leave it entirely to your discretion as to whether you will think it wise or not to stir from that chair for ten minutes after I shut the door And now Jimmie Dale nonchalantly replaced his handkerchief in his pocket nonchalantly followed it with the banknotes which he picked up from the table and smiled With a gasp both men had strained forward and were staring wild eyed at the gray seal stuck between them on the tabletop The Gray Seal whispered the Weasel and his tongue circled his lips Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders That WAS a bit theatrical Weasel he said apologetically and yet not wholly unnecessary You will recall Stangeist The Mope Australian Ike and Clarie Deane and can draw your own inference as to what might happen in the Thorold affair if you should be so ill advised as to force my hand Permit me the slim deft fingers like a streak of lightning were inside Hamvert s coat pocket and out again with the remainder of the banknotes and Jimmie Dale was backing for the door not the door of the bathroom by which he had entered but the door of the room itself that opened on the corridor There he stopped and his hand swept around behind his back and turned the key in the locked door He nodded at the two men whose faces were working with incongruously mingled expressions of impotent rage bewilderment fear and fury and opened the door a little Ten minutes Weasel he said gently I trust you will not have to use heroic measures to restrain your friend for that length of time though if it is necessary I should advise you for your own sake to resort almost to murder I wish you good evening gentlemen The door opened farther Jimmie Dale still facing inward slipped between it and the jamb whipped the mask from his face closed the door softly stepped briskly but without any appearance of haste along the corridor to the stairs descended the stairs mingled with a crowd in the lobby for an instant walked seemingly a part of it with a group of ladies and gentlemen down the hall to the side entrance passed out and a moment later after drawing on a linen dust coat which he took from under the seat and exchanging his hat for a tweed cap the car glided from the curb and was lost in a press of traffic around the corner Jimmie Dale laughed a little harshly to himself So far so good but the game was not ended yet for all the crackle of the crisp notes in his pocket There was still the map still the robbery at Mittel s house the ten thousand dollar theft would not in any way change that and it was a question of time now to forestall any move the Weasel might make Through the city Jimmie Dale alternately dodged spurted and dragged his way fuming with impatience but once out on the country roads and headed toward New Rochelle the big machine speed limits thrown to the winds roared through the night a gray streak of road jumping under the powerful lamps a village a town a cluster of lights flashing by him the steady purr of his sixty horse power engines the gray thread of open road again It was just eleven o clock when Jimmie Dale the road to himself for the moment at a spot a little beyond New Rochelle extinguished his lights and very carefully ran his car off the road backing it in behind a small clump of trees He tossed the linen dust coat back into the car and set off toward where a little distance away the slap of waves from the stiff breeze that was blowing indicated the shore line of the Sound There was no moon and while it was not particularly dark objects and surroundings at best were blurred and indistinct but that after all was a matter of little concern to Jimmie Dale the first house beyond was Mittel s He reached the water s edge and kept along the shore There should be a little wharf she had said Yes there it was and there too was a gleam of light from the house itself Jimmie Dale began to make an accurate mental note of his surroundings From the little wharf on which he now stood a path led straight to the house bisecting what appeared to be a lawn trees to the right the house to the left At the wharf beside him two motor boats were moored one on each side Jimmie Dale glanced at them and suddenly attracted by the familiar appearance of one inspected it a little more closely His momentarily awakened interest passed as he nodded his head It had caught his attention that was all it was the same type and design quite a popular make of which there were hundreds around New York as the one he had bought that year as a tender for his yacht He moved forward now toward the house the rear of which faced him the light that flooded the lawn came from a side window Jimmie Dale was figuring the time and distance from New York as he crept cautiously along How quickly could the Weasel make the journey The Weasel would undoubtedly come and if there was a convenient train it might prove a close race but in his own favour was the fact that it would probably take the Weasel quite some little time to recover his equilibrium from his encounter with the Gray Seal in the Palais Metropole also the further fact that from the Weasel s viewpoint there was no desperate need of haste Jimmie Dale crossed the lawn and edged along in the shadows of the house to where the light streamed out from what now proved to be open French windows It was a fair presumption that he would have an hour to the good on the Weasel The sill was little more than a couple of feet from the ground and from a crouched position on his knees below the window Jimmie Dale raised himself slowly and peered guardedly inside The room was empty He listened a moment the black silk mask was on his face again and with a quick agile silent spring he was in the room And then in the centre of the room Jimmie Dale stood motionless staring around him an expression ironical sardonic creeping into his face THE ROBBERY HAD ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED At the lower end of the room everything was in confusion the door of a safe swung wide the drawers of a desk had been wrenched out even a liqueur stand on which were well filled decanters had been broken open and the contents of safe and desk the thief s discards as it were littered the floor in all directions For an instant Jimmie Dale his eyes narrowed ominously surveyed the scene then with a sort of professional instinct aroused he stepped forward to examine the safe and suddenly darted behind the desk instead Steps sounded in the hall The door opened a voice reached him The master said I was to shut the windows and I haven t dast to go in And he ll be back with the police in a minute now Come on in with me Minnie Lord exclaimed another voice Ain t it a good thing the missus is away She d have highsteericks Steps came somewhat hesitantly across the floor from behind the desk Jimmie Dale could see that it was a maid accompanied by a big rawboned woman sleeves rolled to the elbows over brawny arms presumably the Mittels cook The maid closed the French windows there were no others in the room and bolted them and having gained a little confidence gazed about her My but wasn t he cute she ejaculated Cut the telephone wires he did And ain t he made an awful mess But the master said we wasn t to touch nothing till the police saw it And to think of it happening in OUR house observed the cook heavily her hands on her hips her arms akimbo It ll all be in the papers and mabbe they ll put our pictures in too I won t get over it as long as I live declared the maid The yell mister Mittel gave when he came downstairs and put his head in here and then him shouting and using the most terrible language into the telephone and then finding the wires cut And me following him downstairs half dead with fright And he shouts at me Bella he shouts shut those windows but don t you touch a thing in that room I m going for the police And then he rushes out of the house I was going to bed said the cook picking up her cue for what was probably the twentieth rehearsal of the scene when I heard mister Mittel yell and Lord Bella there he is now Jimmie Dale s hands clenched He too had caught the scuffle of footsteps those of three or four men at least on the front porch There was one way only one of escape through the French windows It was a matter of seconds only before Mittel with the police at his heels would be in the room and Jimmie Dale sprang to his feet There was a wild scream of terror from the maid echoed by another from the cook and still screaming both women fled for the door mister Mittel mister Mittel shrieked the maid she had flung herself out into the hall He s he s back again Jimmie Dale was at the French windows tearing at the bolts They stuck Shouts came from the front entryway He wrenched viciously at the fastenings They gave now The windows flew open He glanced over his shoulder A man Mittel presumably since he was the only one not in uniform was springing into the room There was a blur of forms and brass buttons behind Mittel and Jimmie Dale leaped to the lawn speeding across it like a deer But quick as he ran Jimmie Dale s brain was quicker pointing the single chance that seemed open to him The motor boat It seemed like a God given piece of luck that he had noticed it was like his own there would be no blind and that meant fatal blunders in the dark over its mechanism and he could start it up in a moment just the time to cast her off that was all he needed The shouts swelled behind him Jimmie Dale was running for his life He flung a glance backward One form Mittel he was certain was perhaps a hundred yards in the rear The others were just emerging from the French windows grotesque leaping things they looked in the light that streamed out behind them from the room Jimmie Dale s feet pounded the planking of the wharf He stooped and snatched at the mooring line Mittel was almost at the wharf It seemed an age a year to Jimmie Dale before the line was clear Shouts rang still louder across the lawn the police racing in a pack were more than halfway from the house He flung the line into the boat sprang in after it and Mittel looming over him grasped at the boat s gunwhale Both men were panting from their exertions Let go snarled Jimmie Dale between clenched teeth Mittel s answer was a hoarse gasping shout to the police to hurry and then Mittel reeled back measuring his length upon the wharf from a blow with a boat hook full across the face driven with a sudden untamed savagery that seemed for the moment to have mastered Jimmie Dale There was no time not a second not the fraction of a second Desperately frantically he shoved the boat clear of the wharf Once twice three times he turned the engine over without success and then the boat leaped forward Jimmie Dale snatched the mask from his face and jumped for the steering wheel The police were rushing out along the wharf He could just faintly discern Mittel now the man was staggering about his hands clapped to his face A peremptory order to halt coupled with a threat to fire rang out sharply and Jimmie Dale flung himself flat in the bottom of the boat The wharf edge seemed to open in little crackling jets of flame came the roar of reports like a miniature battery in action then the FLOP FLOP FLOP as the lead tore up the water around him the duller thud as a bullet buried its nose in the boat s side and the curious rip and squeak as a splinter flew Then Mittel s voice high pitched as though in pain Can t any of you run a motor boat He s got me bad I m afraid That other one there is twice as fast Sure another voice responded promptly And if that s right he s run his head into a trap Cast loose there MacVeay and pile in all of you You go back to the house mister Mittel and fix yourself up We ll get him Jimmie Dale s lips thinned It was true If the other boat had any speed at all it was only a question of time before he would be overtaken The only point at issue was how much time It was dark that was in his favour but it was not so dark but that a boat could be distinguished on the water for quite a distance for a longer distance than he could hope to put between them There was no chance of eluding the police that way The keen facile brain that had saved the Gray Seal a hundred times before was weaving planning discarding eliminating scheming a way out with death ruin disaster the price of failure His eyes swept the dim irregular outline of the shore To his right in the opposite direction from where he had left his car and perhaps a mile ahead as well as he could judge the land seemed to run out into a point Jimmie Dale headed for it instantly If he could reach it with a little lead to the good there was a chance It would take say six minutes granting the boat a speed of ten miles an hour and she could do that The others could hardly overtake him in that time they hadn t got started yet He could hear them still shouting and talking at the wharf And Mittel s twice as fast was undoubtedly an exaggeration anyhow A minute more passed another and then astern Jimmie Dale caught the racket from the exhaust of a high powered engine and a white streak seemed to shoot out upon the surface of the water from where obscured now he placed the wharf A quarter mile lead roughly four hundred yards yes he had as much as that but that too was very little He bent over his engine coaxing it nursing it to its highest efficiency his eyes strained now upon the point ahead now upon his pursuers behind He was running with the wind thank Heaven or the small boat would have had a further handicap it was rolling up quite a sea The steering gear he found was corded along the side of the boat permitting its manipulation from almost any position and abruptly now Jimmie Dale left the engine to rummage through the little locker in the stern of the boat But as he rummaged his eyes held speculatively on the boat astern She was gaining unquestionably steadily but not as fast as he had feared He would still have a hundred yards lead at least abreast the point and he was smiling grimly now a hundred yards there meant life to the Gray Seal The locker was full of a heterogeneous collection of odds and ends a suit of oilskins tools tins and cans of various sizes and descriptions Jimmie Dale emptied the contents some sort of powder of a small round tin box overboard and from his pocket took out the banknotes crammed them into the box crammed his watch in on top of them and screwed the cover on tightly His fingers were flying now A long strip torn from the trousers leg of the oilskins was wrapped again and again around the box and the box was stuffed into his pocket The flash of a revolver shot cut the blackness behind him then another and another They were firing in a continuous stream again It was fairly long range but there was always the chance of a stray bullet finding its mark Jimmie Dale crouching low made his way to the bow of the boat again The point was looming almost abreast now He edged in nearer to hug it as closely as he dared risk the depth of the water Behind remorselessly the other boat was steadily closing the gap and the shots were not all wild one struck with a curious singing sound on some piece of metal a foot from his elbow Closer to the shore running now parallel with the head of the point Jimmie Dale again edged in the boat his jaws clamped working in little twitches And then suddenly with a swift appraising glance behind him he swerved the boat from her course and headed for the shore not directly but diagonally across the little bay that on the farther side of the point had now opened out before him He was close in with the edge of the point ten yards from it sweeping past it the point itself came between the two boats hiding them from each other and Jimmie Dale with a long spring dove from the boat s side to the water The momentum from the boat as he sank robbed him for an instant of all control over himself and he twisted doubled up and rolled over and over beneath the water but the next moment his head was above the surface again and he was striking out swiftly for the shore It was only a few yards but in a few SECONDS the pursuing boat too would have rounded the point His feet touched bottom It was haste now nothing else that counted The drum of the racing engines the crackling roar of the exhaust from the oncoming boat was in his ears He flung himself upon the shore and down behind a rock Around the point past him tore the police boat dark forms standing clustered in the bow and then a sudden shout There she is See her She s heading into the bay for the shore Jimmie Dale s lips relaxed There was no doubt that they had sighted their quarry again a perfect fusillade of revolver shots directed at the now empty boat was quite sufficient proof of that With something that was almost a chuckle Jimmie Dale straightened up from behind the rock and began to run back along the shore The little motor boat would have grounded long before they overtook her and thinking naturally enough that he had leaped ashore from her they would go thrashing through the woods and fields searching for him It was a longer way back by the shore a good deal longer now over rough rocky stretches where he stumbled in the darkness now through marshy sodden ground where he sank as in a quagmire time and again over his ankles It was even longer than he had counted on and time with the Weasel on one hand and the return of the police on the other was a factor to be reckoned with again as a half hour later Jimmie Dale stole across the lawn of Mittel s house for the second time that night and for the second time crouched beneath the open French windows Masked again the water still dripping from what were once immaculate evening clothes but which now sagged limply about him his collar a pasty string around his neck the mud and dirt splashed to his knees Jimmie Dale was a disreputable and incongruous looking object as he crouched there shivering uncomfortably from his immersion in spite of his exertions Inside the room Mittel passed the windows pacing the floor one side of his face badly cut and bruised from the blow with the boat hook and as he passed his back turned for an instant Jimmie Dale stepped into the room Mittel whirled at the sound and with a suppressed cry instinctively drew back Jimmie Dale s automatic was dangling carelessly in his right hand I am afraid I am a trifle melodramatic observed Jimmie Dale apologetically surveying his own bedraggled person but I assure you it is neither intentional nor for effect As it is I was afraid I would be late Pardon me if I take the liberty of helping myself one gets a chill in wet clothes so easily he passed to the liqueur stand poured out a generous portion from one of the decanters and tossed it off Mittel neither spoke nor moved Stupefaction surprise and a very obvious regard for Jimmie Dale s revolver mingled themselves in a helpless expression on his face Jimmie Dale set down his glass and pointed to a chair in front of the desk Sit down mister Mittel he invited pleasantly It will be quite apparent to you that I have not time to prolong our interview unnecessarily in view of the possible return of the police at any moment but you might as well be comfortable You will pardon me again if I take another liberty he crossed the room turned the key in the lock of the door leading into the hall and returned to the desk Sit down mister Mittel he repeated a sudden rasp in his voice Mittel none too graciously now seated himself Look here my fine fellow he burst out you re carrying things with a pretty high hand aren t you You seem to have eluded the police for the moment somehow but let me tell you I No interrupted Jimmie Dale softly let ME tell you all there is to be told He leaned over the desk and stared rudely at the bruise on Mittel s face Rather a nasty crack that he remarked Mittel s fists clenched and an angry flush swept his cheeks I d have made it a good deal harder said Jimmie Dale with sudden insolence if I hadn t been afraid of putting you out of business and so precluding the possibility of this little meeting Now then the revolver swung upward and held steadily on a line with Mittel s eyes I ll trouble you for the diagram of that Alaskan claim that belongs to missus Michael Breen Mittel staring fascinated into the little round black muzzle of the automatic edged back in his chair So so that s what you re after is it he jerked out Well he laughed unnaturally and waved his hand at the disarray of the room it s been stolen already I know that said Jimmie Dale grimly By YOU Me Mittel started up in his chair a whiteness creeping into his face Me I I Sit down Jimmie Dale s voice rang out ominously cold I haven t any time to spare You can appreciate that But even if the police return before that map is in my possession they will still be TOO LATE as far as you are concerned Do you understand Furthermore if I am caught you are ruined Let me make it quite plain that I know the details of your little game You are a curb broker mister Mittel ostensibly In reality you run what is nothing better than an exceedingly profitable bucket shop The Weasel has been a customer and also a stool for you for years How Hamvert met the Weasel is unimportant he came East with the intention of getting in touch with a slick crook to help him the Weasel is the coincidence that is all I quite understand that you have never met Hamvert nor Hamvert you nor that Hamvert was aware that you and the Weasel had anything to do with one another and were playing in together but that equally is unimportant When Hamvert engaged the Weasel for ten thousand dollars to get the map from you for him the Weasel chose the line of least resistance He KNEW you and approached you with an offer to split the money in return for the map It was not a question of your accepting his offer it was simply a matter of how you could do it and still protect yourself The Weasel was well qualified to point the way a fake robbery of your house would answer the purpose admirably you could not be held either legally or morally responsible for a document that was placed unsolicited by you in your possession if it were stolen from you Mittel s face was ashen colourless His hands were opening and shutting with nervous twitches on the top of the desk Jimmie Dale s lips curled But Jimmie Dale was clipping off his words now viciously neither you nor the Weasel were willing to trust the other implicitly perhaps you know each other too well You were unwilling to turn over the map until you had received your share of the money and you were equally unwilling to turn it over until you were SAFE that is until you had engineered your fake robbery even to the point of notifying the police that it had been committed the Weasel on the other hand had some scruples about parting with any of the money without getting the map in one hand before he let go of the banknotes with the other It was very simply arranged however and to your mutual satisfaction While you robbed your own house this evening he was to get half the money in advance from Hamvert giving Hamvert to understand that HE had planned to commit the robbery himself to night He was to come out here then receive the map from you in exchange for your share of the money return to Hamvert with the map and receive in turn his own share I might say that Hamvert actually paid down the advance and it was perhaps unfortunate for you that you paid such scrupulous attention to details as to cut your own telephone wires I had not of course an exact knowledge of the hour or minute in which you proposed to stage your little play here The object of my first visit a little while ago was to forestall your turning the diagram over to the Weasel Circumstances favoured you for the moment I am back again however for the same purpose the map Mittel in a cowed way was huddled back in his chair He smiled miserably at Jimmie Dale QUICK Jimmie Dale flung out the word in a sharp peremptory bark Do you need to be told that the CARTRIDGES are dry Mittel s hand trembling went into his pocket and produced an envelope Open it commanded Jimmie Dale And lay it on the desk so that I can read it I am too wet to touch it Mittel obeyed like a dog that has been whipped A glance at the paper and Jimmie Dale s eyes lifted again to sweep the floor of the room He pointed to a pile of books and documents in one corner that had been thrown out of the safe Go over there and pick up that check book he ordered tersely What for Mittel made feeble protest Never mind what for snapped Jimmie Dale Go and get it and HURRY Once more Mittel obeyed and dropped the book hesitantly on the desk Jimmie Dale stared silently insolently contemptuously at the other Mittel stirred uneasily sat down shifted his feet and his fingers fumbled aimlessly over the top of the desk Compared with you said Jimmie Dale in a low voice the Weasel ay and Hamvert too crooks though they are are gentlemen Michael Breen as he died told his wife to take that paper to some one she could trust who would help her and tell her what to do and knowing no one to go to but because she scrubbed your floors and therefore thought you were a fine gentleman she came timidly to you and trusted you you cur Jimmie Dale laughed suddenly not pleasantly Mittel shivered Hamvert and Breen were partners out there in Alaska when Breen first went out said Jimmie Dale slowly pulling the tin can wrapped in oilskin from his pocket Hamvert swindled Breen out of the one strike he made and missus Breen and her little girl back here were reduced to poverty The amount of that swindle was I understand fifteen thousand dollars I have ten of it here contributed by the Weasel and Hamvert and you will I think recognise therein a certain element of poetic justice but I am still short five thousand dollars Jimmie Dale removed the cover from the tin can Mittel gazed at the contents numbly You perhaps did not hear me prompted Jimmie Dale coldly I am still short five thousand dollars Mittel circled his lips with the tip of his tongue What do you want he whispered hoarsely The balance of the amount There was an ominous quiet in Jimmie Dale s voice A check payable to missus Michael Breen for five thousand dollars I I haven t got that much in the bank Mittel fenced stammering No Then I should advise you to see that you have by ten o clock to morrow morning returned Jimmie Dale curtly Make out that check Mittel hesitated The revolver edged insistently a little farther across the desk and Mittel picking up a pen wrote feverishly He tore the check from its stub and with a snarl pushed it toward Jimmie Dale Fold it instructed Jimmie Dale in the same curt tones And fold that diagram with it Put them both in this box Thank you He wrapped the oilskin around the box again and returned the box to his pocket And again with that insolent contemptuous stare he surveyed the man at the desk then he backed to the French windows It might be as well to remind you Mittel he cautioned sternly that if for any reason this check is not honoured whether through lack of funds or an attempt by you to stop payment you ll be in a cell in the Tombs to morrow for this night s work that is quite understood isn t it Mittel was on his feet sweat glistened on his forehead My God he cried out shrilly Who are you And Jimmie Dale smiled and stepped out on the lawn Ask the Weasel said Jimmie Dale and the next instant lost in the shadows of the house was running for his car CHAPTER X THE ALIBI DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL through the underworld in dens and dives that sheltered from the law the vultures that preyed upon society prompted by self fear by secret dread by reason of their very inability to carry out their purpose the whispered sentence grew daily more venomous more insistent THE GRAY SEAL DEAD OR ALIVE BUT THE GRAY SEAL It was the standing orders of the police Railed at by a populace who angrily demanded at its hands this criminal of criminals mocked at and threatened by a virulent press stung to madness by the knowledge of its own impotence flaunted impudently to its face by this mysterious Gray Seal to whose door the law laid a hundred crimes for whom the bars of a death cell in Sing Sing was the certain goal could he but be caught the police to a man was like an uncaged beast that flicked to the raw by some unseen assailant and murderous in its fury was crouched to strike Grim paradox a common bond that linked the hands of the law with those that outraged it Death to the Gray Seal Was it at last the beginning of the end Jimmie Dale as Larry the Bat unkempt disreputable in appearance supposed dope fiend a figure familiar to every denizen below the dead line skulked along the narrow ill lighted street of the East Side that on the corner ahead boasted the notorious resort to which Bristol Bob had paid the doubtful if appropriate compliment of giving his name From under the rim of his battered hat Jimmie Dale s eyes veiled by half closed well simulated drug laden lids missed no detail either of his surroundings or pertaining to the passers by Though already late in the evening half naked children played in the gutters hawkers of multitudinous commodities cried their wares under gasoline banjo torches affixed to their pushcarts shawled women of half a dozen races and men equally cosmopolitan loitered at the curb or blocked the pavement or brushed by him Now a man passed him flinging a greeting from the corner of his mouth now another always without movement of the lips and Jimmie Dale answered them from the corner of his mouth But while his eyes were alert his mind was only subconsciously attune to his surroundings Was it indeed the beginning of the end Some day he had told himself often enough the end must come Was it coming now surely with a sort of grim implacability when it was too late to escape Slowly but inexorably even his personal freedom of action was narrowing being limited and ironically enough through the very conditions he had himself created as an avenue of escape It was not only the police now it was far more to be feared the underworld as well In the old days the role of Larry the Bat had been assumed at intervals at his own discretion when in a corner he had no other way of escape now it was forced upon him almost daily The character of Larry the Bat could no longer be discarded at will He had flung down the gauntlet to the underworld when as the Gray Seal he had closed the prison doors behind Stangeist The Mope Australian Ike and Clarie Deane and the underworld had picked the gauntlet up Betrayed as they believed by the one who though unknown to them they had counted the greatest among themselves and each one fearful that his own betrayal might come next every crook every thug in the Bad Lands now eyed his oldest pal with suspicion and distrust and each was a self constituted sleuth with the prod of self preservation behind him sworn to the accomplishment of that unhallowed slogan death to the Gray Seal Almost daily now he must show himself as Larry the Bat in some gathering of the underworld a prolonged absence from his haunts was not merely to invite certain suspicion where all were suspicious of each other it was to invite certain disaster He had now either to carry the role like a little old man of the sea upon his back or renounce it forever And the latter course he dared not even consider the Sanctuary was still the Sanctuary and the role of Larry the Bat was still a refuge the trump card in the lone hand he played He reached the corner pushed open the door of Bristol Bob s and shuffled in The place was a glare of light a hideous riot of noise On a polished section of the floor in the centre a turkey trot was in full swing laughter and shouting vied raucously with an impossible orchestra Jimmie Dale slowly made the circuit of the room past the tables that ranged around the sides were packed with occupants who thumped their glasses in tempo with the music and clamoured at the rushing waiters for replenishment A dozen two dozen men and women greeted him Jimmie Dale indifferently returned their salutes What a galaxy of crooks the cream of the underworld His eyes under half closed lids swept the faces lags dips gatmen yeggs mob stormers murderers petty sneak thieves stalls hangers on they were all there He knew them all he was known to all He shuffled on to the far end of the room his leer a little arrogant a certain arrogance too in the tilt of his battered hat He also was quite a celebrity in that gathering Larry the Bat was of the aristocracy and the elite of gangland Well the show was over he had stalked across the stage performed for his audience and in another hour now free until he must repeat the same performance the next day in some other equally notorious dive he would be sitting in for a rubber of bridge at that most exclusive of all clubs the saint James where none might enter save only those whose names were vouched for in the highest and most select circles and where for partners he would possibly have a justice of the supreme court or mayhap an eminent divine He looked suddenly around him as though startled It always startled him that comparison There was something too stupendous to be simply ironical in the incongruity of it If if he were ever run to earth His eyes met those of a heavy built coarse featured man the chewed end of a cigar in his mouth who stepped from behind the bar carrying a tin tray with two full glasses upon it It was Bristol Bob ex pugilist the proprietor How re you Larry grunted the man with what he meant to be a smile Jimmie Dale was standing in the doorway of a passage that prefaced a rear exit to the lane He moved aside to allow the other to pass Ello Bristol he returned dispassionately Bristol Bob went on along down the passage and Jimmie Dale shuffled slowly after him He had intended to leave the place by the rear door it obviated the possibility of an undesirable acquaintance joining company with him if he went out by the main entrance But now his eyes were fixed on the proprietor s back with a sort of speculative curiosity There was a private room off the passage with a window on the lane but they must be favoured customers indeed that Bristol Bob would condescend to serve personally any one who knew Bristol Bob knew that Jimmie Dale slowed his shuffling gait then quickened it again Bristol Bob opened the door and passed into the private room the door was just closing as Jimmie Dale shuffled by He had had only a glance inside but it was enough They were favoured customers indeed It was no wonder that Bristol Bob himself was on the job Two men were in the room Lannigan of headquarters rated the smartest plain clothes man in the country and across the table from Lannigan Whitey Mack as clever finished and daring a crook as was to be found in the Bad Lands whose particular line was diamonds or in the vernacular of his ilk white stones that had earned him the sobriquet of Whitey Lannigan of headquarters Whitey Mack of the underworld sworn enemies those two in secret session Bristol Bob might well play the part of outer guard If a choice few of those outside in the dance hall could get a glimpse into that private room it would be good night to Whitey Mack Jimmie Dale s eyes were narrowed a little as he shuffled on down the passage Lannigan and Whitey Mack with their heads together What was the game There was nothing in common between the two men Lannigan it was well known could not be reached Whitey Mack with his ingenious cleverness coupled with a cold blooded fearlessness that had made him an object of unholy awe and respect in the eyes of the underworld was a thorn that was sore beyond measure in the side of the police Certainly it was no ordinary thing that had brought these two together especially since with the unrest and suspicion that was bubbling and seething below the dead line and with which there was none more intimate than Whitey Mack Whitey Mack was inviting a risk in making up with the police that could only be accounted for by some urgent and vital incentive Jimmie Dale pushed open the door that gave on the lane Behind him Bristol Bob closed the door of the private room and retreated back along the passage Jimmie Dale stepped out into the lane and instinctively his eyes sought the window of the private room The shade was drawn only a yellow murk filtered out into the black unlighted lane but suddenly he started noiselessly toward it The window was open a bare inch or so at the bottom The sill was just shoulder high and placing his ear to the opening he flattened himself against the wall He could not see inside for the shade was drawn well to the bottom but he could hear as distinctly as though he were at the table beside the two men and at the first words the loose disjointed frame of Larry the Bat seemed to tauten curiously and strain forward lithe and tense This Gray Seal dope listens good Whitey but coming from you I m leery You ve got to show me Don t you want him There was a nasty laugh from Whitey Mack You BET I want him returned the headquarters man with a suppressed savagery that left no doubt as to his earnestness I want him fast enough but Then blast him so do I Whitey Mack rapped out with a vicious snarl So does every guy in the fleet down here We got it in for him You get that don t you He s got Stangeist and his gang steered for the electric chair now he put a crimp in the Weasel the other night get that He s like a blasted wizard with what he knows And who ll he deal the icy mitt to next Me damn him me for all I know That s all right observed Lannigan coolly I m not questioning your sincerity for a minute I know all about that but that doesn t land the Gray Seal I ll work with you if you ve anything to offer but we ve had enough tips and information handed us at headquarters in the last few years to make us a trifle skeptical Show me what you ve got Whitey Show you echoed Whitey Mack passionately Sure I ll show you That s what I m going to do show you I ll show you the Gray Seal I ain t handing you any tips I VE FOUND OUT WHO THE GRAY SEAL IS There was a tense silence It seemed to Jimmie Dale as though cold fingers were clutching at his heart stifling its beat then the blood came bursting to his forehead He could not see into the room but that silence was eloquent It seemed as though he could picture the two men Lannigan leaning suddenly forward Lannigan and Whitey Mack staring tensely into each other s eyes You WHAT It came low and grim from Lannigan That s what asserted Whitey Mack bluntly You heard me That s what I said I know who the Gray Seal is and I m the only guy that s wise to him Am I letting you in right You re sure demanded Lannigan hoarsely You re sure Who is he then There was a half laugh half snarl from Whitey Mack Oh no you don t he growled Nix on that What do you take me for a fool You beat it out of here and round him up eh while I suck my thumbs Say forget it Do you think I m doing this because I love you Why blame you you ve been aching for a year to put the bracelets on me yourself Say wake up I m in on this myself Again that silence Then Lannigan spoke slowly in a puzzled way I don t get you Whitey he said What do you mean Then a little sharply You re quite right you ve got some reputation yourself and you re badly wanted if we could get the goods on you If you re trying to plant something look out for yourself or Can that snapped Whitey Mack threateningly Can that sort of spiel right now or quit I ain t telling you his name yet BUT I LL TAKE YOU TO HIM TO NIGHT and you and me nabs him together Is that straight enough goods for you Don t get sore said Lannigan more pacifically Yes if you ll do that it s good enough for any man But lay your cards on the table face up Whitey I want to see what you opened the pot on You ve seen em Whitey Mack answered ungraciously I ve told you already The Gray Seal goes out for keeps curse him for a snitch If I bumped him off or wised up any of the guys to it and we was caught we d get the juice for it even if it was the Gray Seal wouldn t we Well what s the use If one of you dicks get him he gets bumped off just the same only regular up in the wire parlour at Sing Sing I ain t looking for that kind of trouble when I can duck it See Sure said Lannigan Besides and moreover continued Whitey Mack there s SOME reward hung out for him that I m figuring to born in on I d swipe it all myself don t you make any mistake about that and you d never get a look in only sore as the mob is on the Gray Seal it ain t healthy for any guy around these parts to get the reputation of being a snitch no matter who he snitches on Bump him off sure Snitching well you get the idea eh I m ducking that too Get me I get you said Lannigan with a short pleased laugh Well then announced Whitey Mack here s my proposition and it s my turn to hand out the look out for your self dope I m busting the game wide open for you to play but you throw me down and his voice sank into a sullen snarl again you can take it from me I ll get you for it All right responded Lannigan soberly Let s hear it If I agree to it I ll stick to it I believe you said Whitey Mack curtly That s why I picked you out for the medal they ll pin on you for this And here s getting down to tacks I ll lead you to the Gray Seal to night and help you nab him and stay with you to the finish but there s to be nobody but you and me on the job When it s done I fade away and nobody s to know I snitched and no questions asked as to how I found out about the Gray Seal I ain t looking for any of the glory you can fix that up to suit yourself The cash is different you come across with half the reward the day they pay it You ll get it There was savage elation in Lannigan s voice the emphatic smash of a fist on the table You re on Whitey And if we get the Gray Seal to night I ll do better by you than that We ll get him said Whitey Mack with a vicious oath And Jimmie Dale crouched suddenly low down close against the wall The crunch of a footstep sounded from the end of the lane Some one had turned in from the cross street some fifty yards away and was heading evidently for the back entrance to Bristol Bob s Jimmie Dale edged noiselessly cautiously back past the doorway kept on pressed close against the wall and finally paused He had not been seen The back door of Bristol Bob s opened and closed The man had gone in For a moment Jimmie Dale stood hesitant There was a wild surging in his brain something like a myriad batteries of trip hammers seemed to be pounding at his temples Then almost blindly he kept on down the lane in the same direction in which he had started to retreat as well one cross street as another He turned into the cross street went along it and presently emerged into the full tide of the Bowery It was garishly lighted people swarmed about him Subconsciously there were crowded sidewalks subconsciously he was on the Bowery that was all Ruin disaster peril faced him faced him and staggered him with the suddenness of the shock Was it true No it could not be true It was a bluff Whitey Mack was bluffing Jimmie Dale s lips grew thin in a mirthless smile as he shook his head Neither Whitey Mack nor any other man would dare to bluff like that It was too straight too open handed Whitey Mack had laid his cards too plainly on the table Whitey Mack s words rang in his ears I ll LEAD you to the Gray Seal to night and help you nab him and stay with you to the finish The man meant what he said meant what he said too about the finish of the Gray Seal not a man in the Bad Lands but meant death to the Gray Seal But how by what means when where had Whitey Mack got his information I m the only one that s wise Whitey Mack had said It seemed impossible It WAS impossible Whitey Mack was sincere enough probably in what he had said but the man simply could not know Whitey Mack could only have spotted some one that for some reason or other he IMAGINED was the Gray Seal That was it must be it Whitey Mack had made a mistake What clew could he have obtained to Over the unwashed face of Larry the Bat a gray pallor spread slowly His fingers were plucking at the frayed edge of his inside vest pocket The dark eyes seemed to turn coal black A laugh like the laugh of one damned rose to his lips and was choked back It was gone GONE That thin metal case like a cigarette case that between the little sheets of oil paper held those diamond shaped gray coloured adhesive seals the insignia of the Gray Seal was gone Clew It seemed as though there were an overpowering nausea upon him CLEW That little case was not a clew it was a death warrant His hands clenched fiercely If he could only think for a moment The lining of his pocket had given away The case had dropped out But there was nothing about the case to identify any one as the Gray Seal unless it were found in one s actual possession Therefore Whitey Mack to have solved his identity must have seen him drop the case There could be no question about that It was equally obvious then that Whitey Mack would know the Gray Seal as Larry the Bat Did he also know him as Jimmie Dale Yes or no It was a vital question His life hung on it That keen facile brain numbed for the moment was beginning to work with lightning speed It was four o clock that afternoon when he had assumed the character of Larry the Bat some time between four o clock and the present it was now well after eleven the case had dropped from his pocket There had been ample time then for Whitey Mack to have made that appointment with Lannigan and ample time to have made a surreptitious visit to the Sanctuary Had Whitey Mack gone there Had Whitey Mack found that hiding place in the flooring under the oilcloth Had Whitey Mack discovered that the Gray Seal was not only Larry the Bat but Jimmie Dale Jimmie Dale swept his hand across his forehead It was damp from little clinging beads of moisture Should he go to the Sanctuary and change become Jimmie Dale again Was it the safest thing to do or the most dangerous Even if Whitey Mack had been there and discovered the dual personality of Larry the Bat how would he Jimmie Dale know it The man would have been crafty enough to have left no sign behind him Was it to the Sanctuary that Whitey Mack meant to lead Lannigan that evening or did Whitey Mack know him as Jimmie Dale and to make it the more sensational plan to carry out the coup say at the saint James Club Whitey Mack and Lannigan were still at Bristol Bob s he had probably time if he so elected to reach the Sanctuary change and get away again But every minute was priceless now What should he do Run from the city as he was for cover or take the gambler s chance Whitey Mack knew him as Larry the Bat it was not certain that Whitey Mack knew him as Jimmie Dale He had halted absorbed in front of a moving picture theatre Great placards at first but a blur of colour suddenly forced themselves in concrete form upon his consciousness Letters a foot high leaped out at him THE DOUBLE LIFE There was the picture of a banker in his private office hastily secreting a forged paper as the hero in the guise of a clerk entered the companion picture was the banker in convict stripes staring out from behind the barred doors of a cell There seemed a ghastly augury in the coincidence Why should a thing like that be thrust upon him to shake his nerve when he needed nerve now more than he had ever needed it in his life before He raised his hand to jerk aimlessly at the brim of his hat dropped his hand abruptly to his side again and started quickly hurriedly away through the throng around him A sort of savagery had swept upon him In a flash he had made his decision He would take the gambler s chance And afterward Jimmie Dale s lips were like a thin straight line it was Whitey Mack s life or his own Whitey Mack had said he was the only one that was wise and Whitey Mack had not told Lannigan yet wouldn t tell Lannigan until the show down If he Jimmie Dale got to the Sanctuary became Jimmie Dale and got away again even if Whitey Mack knew him as Jimmie Dale there was still a chance It was his life or Whitey Mack s Whitey Mack with his lean jawed clean shaven wolf s face If he could get Whitey Mack before the other was ready to tell Lannigan Surely he had the right of self preservation Surely his life was as valuable as Whitey Mack s as valuable as a man s who as those in the secrets of the underworld knew well enough had blood upon his hands who lived by crime who was a menace to the community Had he not the right to preserve his own life at the expense of one such as that He had never taken life the thought was abhorrent But was there any other way in event of Whitey Mack knowing him as Jimmie Dale His back was against the wall he was trapped certain death and worse dishonour stared him in the face Lannigan and Whitey Mack would be together the odds would be two to one against him and he had no quarrel with Lannigan somehow he must let Lannigan out of it The other side of the street was less crowded He crossed over and still with the shuffling tread that dozens around him knew as the characteristic gait of Larry the Bat but covering the ground with amazing celerity he hurried along It was only at the end of the block that cross street from the Bowery that led to the Sanctuary How much time had he He turned the corner into the darker cross street Whitey Mack would have learned from Bristol Bob that Larry the Bat had just been there that is that Larry the Bat was not at the Sanctuary Whitey Mack would probably be in no hurry he and Lannigan might wait until later until Whitey Mack should be satisfied that Larry the Bat had gone home It was the line of least resistance they would not attempt to scour the city for him They might even wait in that private room at Bristol Bob s until they decided that it was time to sally out He might perhaps still find them there when he got back at any rate from there he must pick up their trail again On the other hand all this was but supposition they might make at once for the Sanctuary to lie in wait for him In any case there was need desperate need for haste He glanced sharply around him and by the side of the tenement house now that bordered on the alleyway with a curious swift gliding motion he seemed to blend into the shadow and darkness It was the Sanctuary that room on the first floor of the tenement the tenement that had three entrances three exits a passageway through to the saloon on the next street that abutted on the rear the usual front door and the side door in the alleyway Gone was the shuffling gait Quick alert he ran crouching bent down along the alleyway reached the side door opened it stealthily closed it behind him with equal caution and in the dark entry stood motionless listening intently There was no sound He began to mount the rickety dilapidated stairs and where it seemed that the lightest tread must make them creak out in blatant protest his trained muscles delicately compensating his body weight carried him upward with a silence that was almost uncanny There was need of silence as there was need of haste He was not so sure now of the time at his disposal that he had even reached the Sanctuary FIRST How long had he loitered in that half dazed way on the Bowery He did not know perhaps longer than he had imagined There was the possibility that Whitey Mack and Lannigan were already above waiting for him but even if they were not already there and he got away before they came it was imperative that no one should know that Larry the Bat had come and gone He reached the landing and paused again his right hand with a vicious muzzle of his automatic peeping now from between his fingers thrown a little forward It was black utterly black around him Again that stealthy catlike tread and his ear was at the keyhole of the Sanctuary door A full minute priceless though it was passed then satisfied that the room was empty he drew his head back from the keyhole and those slim tapering fingers that in their tips seemed to embody all the human senses felt over the lock Apparently it had been undisturbed but that was no proof that Whitey Mack had not been there after finding the metal case Whitey Mack was known to be clever with a lock clever enough for that anyhow He slipped in the key turned it and on hinges that were always oiled silently pushed the door open and stepped across the threshold He closed the door until it was just ajar that any sound might reach him from without and whipping off his coat began to undress swiftly There was no light He dared not use the gas it might be seen from the alleyway He was moving now quickly surely silently here and there It was like some weird spectre figure a little blacker than the surrounding darkness flitting about the room The oilcloth in the corner was turned back the loose flooring lifted the clothes of Jimmie Dale taken out the rags of Larry the Bat put in The minutes flew by It was not the change of clothing that took long it was the eradication of Larry the Bat s make up from his face throat neck wrists and hands Occasionally his head was turned in a tense listening attitude but always the fingers were busy working with swift deftness It was done at last Larry the Bat had vanished and in his place stood Jimmie Dale the young millionaire the social lion of New York immaculate in well tailored tweeds He stooped to the hole in the flooring and his fingers going unerringly to their hiding place took out a black silk mask and an electric flashlight his automatic was already in his possession His lips parted grimly Who knew what part a flashlight might not play and he would need the mask for Lannigan s benefit even if it did not disguise him from Whitey Mack Had he left any telltale evidence of his visit It was almost worth the risk of a light to make sure He hesitated then shook his head and stooping again carefully replaced the flooring and laid the oilcloth over it he dared not show a light at any cost But now even more caution than before was necessary At times the lodgers had naturally enough seen their fellow lodger Larry the Bat enter and leave the tenement none had ever seen Jimmie Dale either leave or enter He stole across the room to the door halted to assure himself that the hall was empty slipped out into the hall and locked the door behind him Again that trained long practiced silent tread upon the stairs It seemed as though an hour passed before he reached the bottom and his brain was shrieking at him to hurry hurry HURRY The entryway at last the door the alleyway a long breath of relief and he was on the cross street A step two he took in the direction of the Bowery and he was bending down as though to tie his shoe his automatic from his side pocket concealed in his hand WAS THAT SOME ONE THERE He could have sworn he saw a shadow like form start out from behind the steps of the house on the opposite side of the street as he had emerged from the alleyway In his bent posture without seemingly turning his head his eyes swept sharply up and down the other side of the ill lighted street Nothing There was not even a pedestrian in sight on the block from there to the Bowery Jimmie Dale straightened up nonchalantly and stooped almost instantly again as though the lace were still proving refractory Again that sharp searching glance Again nothing He went forward now in apparent unconcern but his right hand instead of being buried in his coat pocket swung easily at his side It was strange His ineffective ruse to the contrary he was certain that he had not been mistaken Was it Whitey Mack Was the question answered Was the Gray Seal known too as Jimmie Dale Were they trailing him now with the climax to come at the club at his own palatial home wherever the surroundings would best lend themselves to assuaging that inordinate thirst for the sensational that was so essentially a characteristic of the confirmed criminal What a headline in the morning s papers it would make At the corner he loitered by the curb to light a cigarette still not a soul in sight on either side of the street behind him except a couple of Italians who had just passed by Strange again The intuition if it were only intuition was still strong He swung abruptly on his heel mingled with the passers by on the Bowery walked a rapid half dozen steps until the building hid the cross street then ran across the road to the opposite side of the Bowery and in a crowd now came back to the corner He crossed from curb to curb slowly sheltered by a fringe of people that however in no way obstructed his view down the side street And then Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders He had evidently been mistaken after all He was overexcited his nerves were raw that perhaps was the solution Meanwhile every minute was counting if Whitey Mack and Lannigan should still be at Bristol Bob s He kept on down the Bowery hurrying with growing impatience through the crowds that massed in front of various places of amusement He had not intended to come along the Bowery and except for what had occurred would have taken a less frequented street He would turn off at the next block He was in front of that moving picture theatre again THE DOUBLE LIFE his eyes were attracted involuntarily to the lurid overdone display It seemed to threaten him it seemed to dangle before him a premonition as it were of what the morning held in store but now too it seemed to feed into flame that smouldering fury that possessed him His life or Whitey Mack s Men women and the children who turned night into day in that quarter of the city were clustered thick around the signs hiving like bees to the bald sensationalism Almost savagely he began to force his way through the crowd and the next instant like a man stunned had stopped in his tracks His fingers had closed in a fierce spasmodic clutch over an envelope that had been thrust suddenly into his hand JIMMIE from somewhere came a low quick voice Jimmie it is half past eleven now HURRY He whirled scanning wildly this face then that It was her voice HER voice The Tocsin The sensitive fingers were telegraphing to his brain as they always did that the texture of the envelope too was hers Her voice yes anywhere out of a thousand voices he would distinguish hers but her face he had never seen that Which out of all the crowd around him was hers Surely he could tell her by her dress she would be different her personality alone must single her out She Say have youse got de pip or do youse t ink youse owns de earth a man flung at him heaving and pushing to get by With a start though he scarcely heard the man Jimmie Dale moved on His brain was afire All the irony of the world seemed massed in a sudden overwhelming attack upon him It was useless intuitively he had known it was useless from the instant he had heard her voice It was always the same always For years she had eluded him like that come upon him without warning and disappeared but leaving always that tangible proof of her existence a letter the call of the Gray Seal to arms But to night it was as it had never been before It was not alone baffled chagrin now not alone the longing the wild desire to see her face to look into her eyes it was life and death She had come at the very moment when she perhaps alone of all the world could have pointed the way out when life liberty everything that was common to them both was at stake in deadly peril and she had gone ignorant of it all leaving him staggered by the very possibility of the succour that was held up before his eyes only to be snatched away without power of his to grasp it His intuition had not been at fault he had made no mistake in that shadow across the street from the Sanctuary It had been the Tocsin He had been followed and it was she who had followed him until in a crowd she had seized the opportunity of a moment ago Though ultimately perhaps it changed nothing it was a relief in a way to know that it was she not Whitey Mack who had been lurking there but her persistent incomprehensible determination to preserve the mystery with which she surrounded herself was like now to cost them both a ghastly price If he could only have had one word with her just one word The letter in his hand crackled under his clenched fist He stared at it in a half blind half bitter way The call of the Gray Seal to arms Another coup with its incident danger and peril that she had planned for him to execute He could have laughed aloud at the inhuman mockery of it The call of the Gray Seal to arms NOW When with every faculty drained to its last resource cornered trapped he was fighting for his very existence Jimmie it is half past eleven now HURRY The words were jangling discordantly in his brain And now he laughed outright mirthlessly A young girl hanging on her escort s arm passing glanced at him and giggled It was a different Jimmie Dale for the moment For once his immobility had forsaken him He laughed again a sort of unnatural desperate indifference to everything falling upon him What did it matter the moment or two it would take to read the letter He looked around him He was on the corner in front of the Palace Saloon and turning abruptly he stepped in through the swinging doors As Larry the Bat he knew the place well At the rear of the barroom and along the side of the wall were some half dozen little stalls partitioned off from each other Several of these were unoccupied and he chose the one farthest from the entrance It was private enough no one would disturb him From the aproned individual who presented himself he ordered a drink The man returned in a moment and Jimmie Dale tossed a coin on the table bidding the other keep the change He wanted no drink the transaction was wholly perfunctory The waiter was gone he pushed the glass away from him and tore the envelope open A single sheet closely written on both sides of the paper was in his hand It was her writing there was no mistaking that but every word every line bore evidence of frantic haste Even that customary formula dear philanthropic crook that had prefaced every line she had ever written him before had been omitted His eyes traversed the first few lines with that strange indifference that had settled upon him What after all did it matter what it was he could do nothing not even save himself probably And then with a little start he read the lines over again muttering snatches from them Max Diestricht diamonds the Ross Logan stones wedding sliding panel in wall of workshop end of the room near window ten boards to the right from side wall press small knot in the wood in the centre of the tenth board to night It brought a sudden thrill of excitement to Jimmie Dale that impossible as he would have believed it an instant ago for the moment overshadowed the realisation of his own peril A robbery such as that if it were ever accomplished would stir the country from end to end it would set New York by the ears it would loose the police in full cry like a pack of bloodhounds with their leashes slipped The society columns of the newspapers had been busy for months featuring the coming marriage of the Ross Logans daughter to one of the country s young merchant princes The combined fortunes of the two families would make the young couple the richest in America The prospective groom s wedding gift was to be a diamond necklace of perfectly matched large stones that would eclipse anything of the kind in the country Europe the foreign markets had been literally combed and ransacked to supply the gems The stones had arrived in New York the day before the duty on them alone amounting to over fifty thousand dollars All this had appeared in the papers Jimmie Dale s brows drew together in a frown On just exactly what percentage the duty was figured he did not know but it was high enough on the basis of fifty thousand dollars to assume safely that the assessed value of the stones was not less than four times that amount Two hundred thousand dollars laid down a quarter of a million Well why not In more than one quarter diamonds were ranked as the soundest kind of an investment Furthermore through personal acquaintance with the high contracting parties who were in his own set he knew it to be true He shrugged his shoulders The papers too had thrown the limelight on Max Diestricht who though for quite a time the fashion in the social world had up to the present been comparatively unknown to the average New Yorker His own knowledge of Max Diestricht went deeper than the superficial biography furnished by the newspapers the old Hollander had done more than one piece of exquisite jewelry work for him The old fellow was a character that beggared description eccentric to the point of extravagance and deaf as a post but in craftmanship a modern Cellini He employed no workmen lived alone over his shop on one of the lower streets between Fifth and Sixth Avenues near Washington Square and possessed a splendid contempt for such protective contrivances as safes and vaults If his prospective patrons expostulated on this score before intrusting him with their valuables they were at liberty to take their work elsewhere It was Max Diestricht who honoured you by accepting the commission not you who honoured Max Diestricht by intrusting him with it Of what use is it to me a safe he would exclaim It hides nothing it only says I am inside do not look farther come and get me Yes It is to explode with the nitro glycerin POUF and I am deaf and I hear nothing It is a foolishness that he had a habit of prodding at one with a levelled fore finger every night somewhere they are robbed and have I been robbed HEIN tell me that have I been robbed It was true In ten years though at times having stones and precious metal aggregating large amounts deposited with him by his customers Max Diestricht had never lost so much as the gold filings There was a queer smile on Jimmie Dale s lips now The knot in the tenth board was significant Max Diestricht was scrupulously honest a genius in originality and conception of design a master in the perfection and delicacy of his finished work he had been commissioned to design and set the Ross Logan necklace The brain works quickly All this and more had flashed almost instantaneously through Jimmie Dale s mind His eyes fell to the letter again and he read on Halfway through a sudden whiteness blanched his face and following it a surging tide of red that mounted to his temples It dazed him it seemed to rob him for the moment of the power of coherent thought He was wrong he had not read aright It was incredible dare devil beyond belief and yet in its very audacity lay success He finished the letter read it once more and his fingers mechanically began to tear it into little shreds His brain was in a whirl a vortex of conflicting emotions Had Whitey Mack and Lannigan left Bristol Bob s yet Where were they now Was there time for this He was staring at the little torn scraps of paper in his hand He thrust them suddenly into his pocket and jerked out his watch It was nearly midnight The broad muscular shoulders seemed to square back curiously the jaws to clamp a little the face to harden and grow cold until it was like stone With a swift movement he emptied his glass into the cuspidor set the glass back on the table and stepped out from the stall His destination was Max Diestricht s The Palace Saloon was near the upper end of the Bowery and failing a taxicab of which none was in sight his quickest method was to walk and he started briskly forward It was not far and it was barely ten minutes from the time he had left the Palace Saloon when he swung through Washington Square to Fifth Avenue and a moment later turned from that thoroughfare heading west toward Sixth Avenue along one of those streets which with the city s northward trend had quite lost any distinctive identity and from being once a modestly fashionable residential section had now become a conglomerate potpourri of small tradesmen s stores shops and apartments of the poorer class He knew Max Diestricht s he could well have done without the aid of the arc lamp which even if dimly indicated that low almost tumble down two story structure tucked away between the taller buildings on either side that almost engulfed it It was late The street was quiet The shops and stores had long since been closed Max Diestricht s among them the old Hollanders name in painted white letters stood out against the background of a darkened workshop window In the story above the lights too were out Max Diestricht was probably fast asleep and he was stone deaf A glance up and down the street and Jimmie Dale was standing or rather leaning against Max Diestricht s door There was no one to see and if there were what was there to attract attention to a man standing nonchalantly for a moment in a doorway It was only for a moment Those master fingers of Jimmie Dale were working surely swiftly silently A little steel instrument that was never out of his possession was in the lock and out again The door opened closed he drew the black silk mask from his pocket and slipped it over his face Immediately in front of him the stairs led upward immediately to his right was the door into the shop the modest street entrance was common to both The door into the workshop was not locked He opened it stepped inside and closed it quietly behind him The place was in blackness He stood for a moment silent straining his ears to catch the slightest sound reconstructing the plan of his surroundings in his mind as he remembered it It was a narrow oblong room running the entire depth of the building a very long room blank walls on either side a window in the middle of the rear wall that gave on a back yard and from the back yard there was access to the lane also as he remembered the place it was a riot of disorder with workbenches and odds and ends strewn without system or reason in every direction one had need of care to negotiate it in the dark He took his flashlight from his pocket and preliminary to a more intimate acquaintance with the interior glanced out through the front window near which he stood and with a suppressed cry shrank back instinctively against the wall Two men were crossing the street heading directly for the shop door The arc lamp lighted up their faces IT WAS INSPECTOR LANNIGAN OF HEADQUARTERS AND WHITEY MACK The quick intake of Jimmie Dale breath was sucked through clenched teeth They were close on his heels then far closer than he had imagined It would take Whitey Mack scarcely any longer to open that front door than it had taken him Close on his heels His face was rigid He could hear them now at the door The flashlight in his hand winked down the length of the room If was a dangerous thing to do but it was still more dangerous to stumble into some object and make a noise He darted forward circuiting a workbench a stool a small hand forge Again the flashlight gleamed Against the side wall near the rear was another workbench with a sort of coarse canvas curtain hanging part way down in front of it evidently to protect such things as might be stored away beneath it from dust and Jimmie Dale sprang for it whipped back the canvas and crawled underneath He was not an instant too soon As the canvas fell back into place the shop door opened closed and the two men had stepped inside Whitey Mack s voice in a low whisper though it was seemed to echo raucously through the shop Mabbe we ll have a sweet wait but I got the straight dope on this He s going to make a try for Dutchy s sparklers to night We ll let him go the limit and we don t either of us make a move till he s pinched them and then we get him with the goods on him He can t get away he hasn t a hope There s only two ways of getting in here or getting out this door and window here and a window that s down there at the back You guard this and I ll take care of the other end Savvy Right Lannigan answered grimly Go ahead There was the sound of footsteps moving forward then a vicious bump the scraping of some object along the floor and a muffled curse from Whitey Mack Use your flashlight advised the inspector in a guarded voice I haven t got one damn it growled Whitey Mack It s all right I ll get along Again the steps but more warily now as though the man were cautiously feeling ahead of him for possible obstacles Jimmie Dale for a moment held his breath He could have reached out and touched the man as the other passed Whitey Mack went on until he had taken up a position against the rear wall Jimmie Dale heard him as he brushed against it Then silence fell He was between them now Stretched full length on the floor Jimmie Dale raised the lower portion of the canvas away from in front of his face He could see nothing the place was in Stygian blackness but it had been close and stifling and at least it gave him more air The minutes dragged by each more interminable than the one that had gone before Not a movement not a sound and then through the stillness very faint at first came the regular repressed breathing of Whitey Mack who was much the nearer of the two men And once noticeable almost imperceptible as it was it seemed to pervade the room and fill it with a strange ominous resonance that rose and fell until the blackness palpitated with it Slowly very slowly Jimmie Dale s hand crept into his pocket and crept out again with his automatic He lay motionless once more Time in any concrete sense ceased to exist Fancied shapes began to assume form in the darkness By the door Lannigan stirred uneasily shifting his position slightly Was it hours was it only minutes It seemed to ring through the nerve racking stillness like the shriek of a hurtling shell and it was only a whisper Watch yourself Lannigan whispered Whitey Mack He s coming now through the yard Don t move till I start something Let him get his paws on the sparklers Silence again And then a low rasping at the window like the gnawing of a rat then inch by inch the sash was lifted There was the sound as of a body forcing its way over the sill cautiously then a step upon the floor inside another and still another The figure of a man loomed up suddenly against the glow of a flashlight as he threw the round white ray inquisitively here and there over the rear wall And now he appeared to be counting the boards One two three ten His hand ran up and down the tenth board Again and again he repeated the operation and something like the snarl of a baited beast echoed through the room He half turned to snatch at something in his pocket and the light for a moment showed a black bearded lowering face partially hidden by a peaked cap that was pulled far down over his eyes There was the rip and tear of rending wood as a steel jimmy in lieu of the spring the man evidently could not find bit in between the boards a muttered oath of satisfaction and a portion of the wall slid back disclosing what looked like a metal lined cupboard He reached in seized one of a dozen little boxes and wrenched off the cover A blue scintillating gleam seemed to leap out to meet the white ray of the flashlight The man chuckled hoarsely and began to cram the rest of the boxes into his pockets Jimmie Dale stirred On hands and knees he was creeping now from beneath the workbench Something caught and tore behind him the canvas curtain And at the sound with a sharp cry the man at the wall whirled the light went out and he sprang toward the window Jimmie Dale gained his feet and leaped forward A revolver shot cut a lane of fire through the blackness and above the roar of the report Whitey Mack s voice in a fierce yell It s all right Lannigan I got him No HELL There was a terrific crash of breaking glass He s got away Not yet he hasn t gritted Jimmie Dale between his teeth and his clubbed revolver swung crashing to the head of a dark form in front of him There was a half sigh half moan The form slid limply to the floor Lannigan was floundering down the shop leaping obstacles in a mad rush his flashlight picking out the way Jimmie Dale stepped swiftly backward and his hand groped out for the droplight over the end of the bench that he had knocked against in his own rush His fingers clutched it and the lower end of the shop was flooded with light Except for his felt hat that lay a little distance away there was no sign of Whitey Mack the huddled form of the man who but a moment since had chuckled as he pocketed old Max Diestricht s gems lay sprawled inert upon the floor and Lannigan was staring into the muzzle of Jimmie Dale s automatic Drop that gun Lannigan said Jimmie Dale coolly And I ll trouble you not to make a noise it might attract attention from the street there s been too much already DROP THAT GUN The revolver clattered from Lannigan s hand to the floor A step forward and Jimmie Dale s toe sent it spinning under a bench Another step and his revolver still covering the other he had whipped a pair of handcuffs from the officer s side pocket Lannigan as though the thought had never occurred to him offered no resistance He was staring in a dazed sort of way back and forth from Jimmie Dale to the man on the floor What s this mean he burst out suddenly Where s Your wrist please requested Jimmie Dale pleasantly No the left one Thank you as the handcuff snapped shut Now go over there and sit down on the floor beside that fellow QUICK Jimmie Dale s voice rasped suddenly imperatively Still bewildered but a little sullen now Lannigan obeyed Jimmie Dale stooped quickly and snapped the other link of the handcuff over the unconscious man s right wrist Jimmie Dale smiled That s the approved way of taking your man isn t it Left wrist to the prisoner s right He s only stunned he ll be around in a moment Know him Lannigan shook his head Take a good look at him invited Jimmie Dale You ought to know most of them in the business Lannigan bent over a little closer and then with an amazed cry his free hand shot forward and tore away the other s beard IT WAS WHITEY MACK My God gasped Lannigan Quite so said Jimmie Dale evenly You ll find the diamonds in his pockets and excuse me his fingers were running through Whitey Mack s clothes ah here it is the thin metal case was in his hand a little article that belongs to me and whose loss I am free to admit caused me considerable concern until I was informed that he had only found it without having the slightest idea as to whom it belonged It made quite a difference He had opened the case carelessly before Lannigan s eyes The Gray Seal I ll say it for you said Jimmie Dale whimsically This is what probably put the idea into his head after first in some way having discovered old Max Diestricht s hiding place and if I had given him time enough he would probably have stuck one of these seals in clumsy imitation of that little eccentricity of mine on the wall over there to stamp the job as genuine You begin to get it don t you Lannigan Pretty sure fire as an alibi eh And he d have got away with it too as far as you were concerned He had only to fire that shot smash the window tuck his false beard mustache and peaked cap into his pocket put on his own hat that you see there on the floor and yell that the man had escaped He d help you chase the thief too Rather neat don t you think Lannigan And worth the risk too considering the howl that would go up at the theft of those stones and that known as the slickest diamond thief in the country he would be the first to be suspected except that the police themselves in the person of Inspector Lannigan of headquarters would be prepared to prove a perfectly good alibi for him Lannigan s head was thrust forward his eyes hard were riveted on Whitey Mack My God he said again under his breath Then fiercely He ll get his for this It was a moment before Jimmie Dale spoke he was musingly examining the automatic in his hand I am going now Lannigan he observed quietly I require say fifteen minutes in which to effect my escape It is of course obvious that an alarm raised by you might prove extremely awkward but a piece of canvas from that bench there together with a bit of string would make a most effective gag I prefer however not to submit you to that indignity Instead I offer you the alternative of giving me your word to remain quietly where you are for fifteen minutes Lannigan hesitated Jimmie Dale smiled I agree said Lannigan shortly Jimmie Dale stepped back The electric light switch clicked The place was in darkness There was a moment two of utter stillness then softly from the front end of the shop a whisper If I were you Lannigan I d take that gun from Whitey s pocket before he comes round and beats you to it And the door had closed silently behind Jimmie Dale CHAPTER XI THE STOOL PIGEON In the subway ten minutes before a freckled faced messenger boy had squeezed himself into a seat beside Jimmie Dale yanked a dime novel from a refractory pocket and blissfully lost to all the world had buried his head in its pages Jimmie Dale s glance at the youngster had equally perforce embraced the lurid title of the thriller Dicing with Death so imperturbably thrust under his nose At the time he had smiled indulgently but now as he left the subway and headed for his home on Riverside Drive the words not only refused to be ignored but had resolved themselves into a curiously persistent refrain in his mind They were exactly what they purported to be dime novelish of the deepest hue of yellow melodramatic in the extreme but also to him now they were grimly apt and premonitorily appropriate Dicing with Death there was not an hour not a moment in the day when he was not literally dicing with death when with the underworld and the police allied against him a single false move would lose him the throw that left death the winner The risk of the dual life enforced upon him grew daily greater and in the end there must be the reckoning He would have been a madman to have shut his eyes in the face of what was obvious but it was worth it all and in his soul he knew that he would not have had it otherwise even now To night to morrow the day after would come another letter from the Tocsin and there would be another crime of the Gray Seal s blazoned in the press would that be the last affair or would there be another or to night to morrow the day after would he be trapped before even one more letter came He shrugged his shoulders as he ran up the steps of his house Those were the stakes that he himself had laid on the table to wager upon the game he had no quarrel there but if only before the end came or even with the end itself he could find HER With his latchkey he let himself into the spacious richly furnished well lighted reception hall and crossing this went up the broad staircase his steps noiseless on the heavy carpet Below faintly he could hear some of the servants they evidently had not heard him close the door behind him Discipline was relaxed somewhat it was quite apparent with Jason that peer of butlers away Jason poor chap was in the hospital Typhoid they had thought it at first though it had turned out to be some milder form of infection He would be back in a few days now but meanwhile he missed the old man sorely from the house He reached the landing and turning went along the hall to the door of his own particular den opened the door closed it behind him and in an instant the keen agile brain trained to the little things that never escaped it that daily held his life in the balance was alert The room was unusually dark even for night time It was as though the window shades had been closely drawn a thing Jason never did But then Jason wasn t there Jimmie Dale smiling then a little quizzically at himself reached up for the electric light switch beside the door pressed it and his finger still on the button whipped his automatic from his pocket with his other hand THE ROOM WAS STILL IN DARKNESS The smile on Jimmie Dale s lips was gone for his lips now had closed together in a tight drawn line The lights in the rest of the house as witness the reception hall were in order This was no ACCIDENT Silent motionless he stood there listening Was he trapped at last in his own house By whom The police The thugs of the underworld It made little difference the end would differ only in the method by which it was attained What was that Was there a slight stir a movement at the lower end of the room or was it his imagination His hand fell from the electric light switch to the doorknob behind his back Slowly without a sound it began to turn under his slim tapering fingers whose deft sensitive touch had made him known and feared as the master cracksman of them all and as noiselessly the door began to open It was like a duel a duel of silence What was the intruder whoever he might be waiting for The abortive click of the electric light switch to say nothing of the opening of the door when he had entered was evidence enough that he was there Was the other trying to place him exactly through the darkness to make sure of his attack The door was open now And suddenly Jimmie Dale laughed easily aloud and on the instant shifted his position Well inquired Jimmie Dale coolly from the other side of the threshold It seemed like a long drawn sigh fluttering through the room a gasp of relief and then the blood was pounding madly at his temples and he was back in the room again the door closed once more behind him Oh Jimmie why didn t you speak I had to be sure that it was you It was her voice HERS The Tocsin HERE She was here here in his house You he cried You here He was pressing the electric light switch frantically again and again Her voice came out of the darkness from across the room Why are you doing that Jimmie You know already that I have turned off the lights At the sockets of course He laughed out the words almost hysterically Your face I have never seen your face you know He was moving quickly toward the reading lamp on his desk There was a quick hurried swish of garments and she was blocking his way No she said in a low voice you must not light that lamp He laughed again shortly fiercely now She was close to him his hands reached out for her touched her and thrilling at the touch swept her toward him Jimmie Jimmie are you mad she breathed Mad Yes he was mad with the wildest most passionate exhilaration he had ever known He found his voice with an effort These months and years that I have tried until my soul was sick to find you he cried out And you are here now Your face I must see your face She had wrenched herself away from him He could hear her breath coming sharply in little gasps He groped his way onward toward the desk WAIT her tones seemed to ring suddenly vibrant through the room Wait before you touch that lamp I I put you on your honour not to light it He stopped abruptly My honour he repeated mechanically Yes I came here to night because there was no other way No other way do you understand I came trusting to your honour not to take advantage of the conditions that forced me to do this I had no fear that I was wrong I have no fear now You will not light that lamp and you will not make any attempt to prevent my going away as I came unknown Is there any question about it Jimmie I am in YOUR house You don t know what you are saying he burst out wildly I ve risked my life for a chance like this again and again I ve gone through hell living in squalour for a month on end as Larry the Bat in the hope that I might discover who you are and do you think I ll let anything stop me now I tell you no a thousand times no She made no answer There was only her low quick breathing coming from somewhere near him He made another step toward the lamp and stopped I tell you no he said again and took another step forward and stopped once more Still she made no answer A minute passed another His hand lifted and swept across his forehead in an agitated way Still silence She neither moved nor spoke His hand dropped slowly to his side There was a queer twisted smile upon his lips You win he said hoarsely Thank you Jimmie she said simply And your name who you are he was speaking but he did not seem to recognise his own voice the hundred other things I ve sworn I d make you explain when I found you are all taboo as well I suppose Yes she said He laughed bitterly Don t you know he cried out that between the police and the underworld our house of cards is likely to collapse at any minute that they are hunting the Gray Seal day and night Is it to be always like this that I am never to know until it is too late She came toward him out of the darkness impulsively They will never get you Jimmie she said in a suppressed voice And some day I promise you now you shall have your reward for to night You shall know everything When The word came from him with fierce eagerness I do not know she answered gently Soon perhaps perhaps sooner than either of us imagine And by that you mean what he asked and his hand reached out for her again through the blackness This time she did not draw away There was an instant s hesitation then she spoke again hurriedly a note of anxiety in her voice You are beginning all over again aren t you Jimmie And I have told you that to night I can explain nothing And besides it is what has brought me here that counts now and every moment is of Yes I know he interposed but then at least you will tell me one thing Why did you come to night instead of sending me a letter as you always have before Because it is different to night than it ever was before she replied earnestly Because there is something in what has happened that I cannot explain myself because there is danger and where I could not see clearly I feared a trap and so I dared not send what in a letter could at best be only vague and incomplete details Do you see Yes said Jimmie Dale but he was only listening in an abstracted way If he could only see that face so close to his He had yearned for that with all his soul for years now And she was here standing beside him and his hand was upon her arm and here in his own den in his own house he was listening to another call to arms for the Gray Seal from her own lips Honour Was he but a poor quixotic fool He had only to step to the desk and switch on the light Why should he steadied himself with a jerk and drew away his hand She was in HIS house Go on he said tersely Do you know or did you ever hear of old Luther Doyle she asked No said Jimmie Dale Do you know a man then named Connie Myers Connie Myers Who in the Bad Lands did not know Connie Myers who boasted of the half dozen prison sentences already to his credit Yes he knew Connie Myers But strangely enough it was not in the Bad Lands or as Larry the Bat that he knew the man or that the other knew him it was as Jimmie Dale Connie Myers had introduced himself one night several years ago with a blackjack that had just missed its mark as the man had jumped out from a dark alleyway on the East Side and he Jimmie Dale had thrashed the other to within an inch of his life He had reason to know Connie Myers and Connie Myers had reason to remember him Yes he said with a grim smile I know Connie Myers And the tenement across the street from where you live as Larry the Bat that of course you know He leaned toward her wonderingly now Of course he ejaculated Naturally Listen then Jimmie She was speaking quickly now It is a strange story This Luther Doyle was already over fifty when some eight or nine years ago his parents died within a few months of each other and he inherited somewhere in the neighbourhood of a hundred thousand dollars but the man though harmless enough was mildly insane half witted queer and the old couple on account of their son s mental defects took care to leave the money securely invested and so that he could only touch the interest During these eight or nine years he has lived by himself in the same old family house where he had lived with his parents in a lonely spot near Pelham And he has lived in a most frugal even miserly manner His income could not have been less than six thousand dollars a year and his expenditures could not have been more than six hundred His dementia ironically enough from the day that he came into his fortune took the form of a most pitiable and abject fear that he would die in poverty misery and want and so year after year cashing his checks as fast as he got them never trusting the bank with a penny he kept hiding away somewhere in his house every cent he could scrape and save from his income which to day must amount at a minimum calculation to fifty thousand dollars And observed Jimmie Dale quietly Connie Myers robbed him of it and No Her voice was quivering with passion as she caught up his words Twice in the last month Connie Myers TRIED to rob him but the money was too securely hidden Twice he broke into Doyle s house when the old man was out but on both occasions was unsuccessful in his search and was interrupted and forced to make his escape on account of Doyle s return To night an hour ago in an empty room on the second floor of that tenement in the room facing the landing old Luther Doyle was MURDERED There was silence for an instant Her hand had closed in a tight pressure on his arm The darkness seemed to add a sort of ghastly significance to her words In God s name how do you know all this he demanded wildly How do you know all these things Does that matter now she answered tensely You will know that when you know the rest Oh don t you understand Jimmie there is not a moment to lose now It was easy to lure a half witted creature like that anywhere it was Connie Myers who lured him to the tenement and murdered him there but from that point Jimmie I am not sure of our ground I do not know whether Connie Myers is alone in this or not but I do know that he is going to Doyle s house again to night to make another search for the money There is no question but that old Doyle was murdered to give Connie Myers and his accomplices if there are any a chance to tear the house inside out to find the money to give them the whole night to work in without interruption if necessary but Doyle dead in his own house could have interfered no more with them than Doyle dead in that tenement Why was he lured to the tenement by Connie Myers when he could much more easily have been put out of the way in his own house Jimmie there is something behind this something more that you must find out There may be others in this besides Connie Myers I do not know but there is something here that I am afraid of Jimmie you must get that man you must get the others if there are others and you must stop them from getting the money in that house to night Do you understand now why I have come here I could not explain in a letter I do not quite seem to be explaining now It would seem as though there were no need for the Gray Seal that simply the police should be notified But I KNOW Jimmie call it intuition what you will I know that there is need for us for you to night that behind all this is a tragedy deeper blacker than even the brutal cold blooded murder that is already done Her voice in its passionate earnestness died away and an anger cold grim remorseless settled upon Jimmie Dale settled as it always settled upon him at her call to arms His brain was already at work in its quick instant way probing sifting planning She was right It was strange it was more than strange that with the added risk the danger the difficulty the man should have been brought miles to be done away with in that tenement Why Connie Myers took form before him the coarse features the tawny hair that straggled across the low forehead the shifty eyes that were an indeterminate colour between brown and gray the thin lips that seemed to draw in and give the jaw a protruding belligerent effect And Connie Myers knew him as Jimmie Dale it would have to be then as Larry the Bat that the Gray Seal must work That meant time to go to the Sanctuary and change The police he asked suddenly aloud they have not yet discovered the body Not yet she replied hurriedly And that is still another reason for haste there is no telling when they will See here She thrust a paper into his hand Here is a plan of old Doyle s house and directions for finding it You must get Connie Myers red handed you must make him convict himself for the evidence through which I know him to be guilty can never be used against him And Jimmie be careful I know I am not wrong that there is still something more behind all this And now go Jimmie go There is no time to lose She was pushing him across the room toward the door Go The word seemed suddenly to bring dismay It was she again who was dominant now in his mind Who knew if to night when he was taking his life in his hands again would not be the last And she was here now here beside him where she might never be again She seemed to divine his thoughts for she spoke again a strange new note of tenderness in her voice that thrilled him You must never let them get you Jimmie for my sake It will not last much longer it is near the end and I shall keep my promise But go now Jimmie go Go he repeated numbly Go But but you I She slipped suddenly away from him retreating back down the room I will go as I came Wait Listen he pleaded There was no answer She was there somewhere back there in the darkness still He stood hesitant at the door It seemed that every faculty he possessed urged him back there again to her Could he let her escape him now when she was so utterly in his power she who meant everything in his life And then like a cold shock came that other thought she who had trusted to his honour With a jerk his hand swept out felt for the doorknob and closed upon it Good night he said heavily and stepped out into the hall It seemed for a while even after he had gained the street and made his way again to the subway that nothing was concrete around him that he was living through some fantastical dream His head whirled and he could not think rationally and then slowly little by little his grip upon himself came back She had come and gone With the roar of the subway in his ears its raucous note seeming to strike so perfectly in consonance with the turmoil within him he smiled mirthlessly After all it was as it always was She was gone and ahead of him lay the chances of the night Dicing with death The words unbidden came back once more If they were true before they were doubly applicable now It was different to night from what it had ever been before as she had said Usually to the smallest detail everything was laid open clear before him in those astounding letters To night it was vague at best A man had been murdered Connie Myers had committed the murder under circumstances that pointed strongly to some hidden motive behind and beyond the mere chance it afforded him to search his victim s house for the hidden cash What was it Jimmie Dale stared out at the black subway walls The answer would not come Station after station passed At Fourteenth Street he changed from the express to a local got out at Astor Place and a few minutes later was walking rapidly down the upper end of the Bowery The answer would not come only the fact itself grew more and more deeply significant The ghastly callous fiendishness that lured an old half witted man to his death had Jimmie Dale in that grip of cold merciless anger again and there was a dull flush now upon his cheeks Whatever it meant whatever was behind it one thing at least was certain HE WOULD GET CONNIE MYERS He was close to the Sanctuary now it was down the next cross street He reached the corner and turned it heading east but his brisk walk had changed to a nonchalant saunter there were some people coming toward him It was the Gray Seal now alert and cautious The little group passed by Ahead the tenement bordering on the black alleyway loomed up the Sanctuary with its three entrances and exits the home of Larry the Bat And across from it was that other tenement that held a new interest for him now where in an empty room on the second floor she had said old Doyle still lay Should he go there He was thinking quickly now and shook his head It would take what he did not have to spare time It was already ten o clock and granted that Connie Myers had committed the crime only a little over an hour ago the man by this time would certainly be on his way to Doyle s house near Pelham if indeed he were not already there No there was no time to spare the question resolved itself simply into how long since he had already searched twice and failed on both occasions it would take Connie Myers to unearth old Doyle s hiding place for the money Jimmie Dale glanced sharply around him slipped into the alleyway and crouching against the tenement wall moved noiselessly along to the side entrance A moment more and he had negotiated the rickety stairs with practiced soundless tread was inside the squalid quarters of Larry the Bat and the door of the Sanctuary was locked and bolted behind him Perhaps five minutes passed and then where Jimmie Dale the millionaire had entered there emerged Larry the Bat of the aristocracy and the elite of the Bad Lands But instead of leaving by the side door and the alleyway as he had entered he went along the lower hallway to the front entrance And here instinctively he paused a moment at the top of the steps as his eyes rested upon the tenement on the opposite side of the street It was strange that the crime should have been committed there Something again seemed to draw him toward that empty room on the second story He had decided once that he would not go that there was not time but after all it would not take long and there was at least the possibility of gaining something more valuable even than time from the scene of the crime itself there might even be the evidence he wanted there that would disclose the whole of Connie Myers game He went down the steps and started across the street but halfway over he hesitated uncertainly as a child s cry came petulantly from the doorway It was dark in the street and likewise it was one of those hot suffocating evenings when in the crowded tenements of the poorer class miserable enough in any case misery was added to a hundredfold for lack of a single God given breath of air These two facts apparently irrelevant caused Jimmie Dale to change his mind again He had not noticed the woman with the baby in her arms sitting on the doorstep but now as he reached the curb he not only saw but recognised her and he swung on down the street toward the Bowery He could not very well go in without passing her without being recognised himself and that was a needless risk He smiled a little wanly Once the crime was discovered she would not have hesitated long before informing the police that she had seen him enter there missus Hagan was no friend of his One could not live as he had lived as Larry the Bat and not see something in an intimate way of the pitiful little tragedies of the poor around him for bad tough and dissolute as the quarter was all were not degraded there some were simply poor missus Hagan was poor Her husband was a day labourer often out of a job and sometimes he drank That was how he Jimmie Dale or rather Larry the Bat had come to earn missus Hagan s enmity He had found Mike Hagan drunk one night and in the act of being arrested and had wheedled the man away from the officer on the promise that he would take Hagan home And he was Larry the Bat a dope fiend a character known to all the neighbourhood and missus Hagan had laid her husband s condition to HIS influence and companionship He had taken Mike Hagan home and missus Hagan had driven Larry the Bat from the door of her miserable one room lodging in that tenement with the bitter words on her tongue that only a woman can use when shame and grief and anger are breaking her heart He shrugged his shoulders as back along the Bowery he retraced his steps but now with the hurried shuffle of Larry the Bat where before had been the brisk athletic stride of Jimmie Dale At Astor Place again he took the subway this time to the Grand Central Station and well within an hour from the time he had left the Sanctuary including the train journey to Pelham he was standing in a clump of trees that fringed a deserted roadway He had passed but few houses once he was away from Pelham and as well as he could judge there was none now within a quarter of a mile of him except this one of old Luther Doyle s that showed up black and shadowy just beyond the trees Jimmie Dale s eyes narrowed as he surveyed the place It was little wonder that known to have money an attempt to rob old Doyle should have been made in a place like this It was even more grimly significant than ever of some deeper meaning that in its loneliness an ideal place for a murder the man should have been lured from there for that purpose to a crowded tenement in the city instead What did it mean Why had it been done He shook his head The answer would not come now any more than it had come before in the subway or in the train on the way out when he had set his brain so futilely to solve the problem From a survey of the house Jimmie Dale gave attention to the details of his surroundings the trees on either side the open space in front a distance of fifty yards to the road the absence of any fence And then abruptly he stole forward There was no light to be seen anywhere about the house Was it possible that Connie Myers was not yet there He shook his head again impatiently Connie Myers would not have wasted any time as the Tocsin had said there was always present the possibility that the crime in that tenement might be discovered at ANY moment Connie Myers would have lost no time for let the discovery be made let the police identify the body as they most certainly would and they would be out here hotfoot Jimmie Dale stood suddenly still What did it mean He had not thought of that before If old Doyle had been murdered HERE there would not have been even the possibility of discovery until the morning at the earliest and Connie Myers would have had all the time he wanted WHAT WAS THAT SOUND A low muffled tapping like a succession of hammer blows came from within the house Jimmie Dale darted forward reached the side of the house and dropped on hands and knees One question at least was answered Connie Myers was inside The plan that she had given him showed an old fashioned cellarway closed by folding trapdoors that was located a little toward the rear and in a moment creeping along he came upon it His hands felt over it It was shut fastened by a padlock on the outside Jimmie Dale s lips thinned a little as he took a small steel instrument from his pocket Either through inadvertence or by intention Connie Myers had passed up an almost childishly simple means of entrance into the house One side of the trapdoor was lifted up silently and silently closed Jimmie Dale was in the cellar The hammering much more distinct now heavy thudding blows came from a room in the front the connection between the cellar and the house as shown on the Tocsin s plan was through another trapdoor in the floor of the kitchen Jimmie Dale s flashlight played on a short ladderlike stairway and in an instant he was climbing upward The sounds from the front of the house continued now without interruption there was little fear that Connie Myers would hear anything else even the protesting squeak of the hinges as Jimmie Dale cautiously pushed back the trapdoor in the flooring above his head An inch two inches he lifted it and his eyes on a level with the opening now he peered into the room The kitchen itself was intensely dark but through an open doorway well to one side so that he could not see into the room beyond there struggled a curiously faint dim glimmer of light And then Jimmie Dale s form straightened rigidly on the stairs The blows stopped and a voice in a low growl presumably Connie Myers reached him Here take a drive at it from the lower edge There was no answer save that the blows were resumed again Jimmie Dale s face had set hard Connie Myers was not alone in this then Well the odds were a little heavier DOUBLED that was all He pushed the trapdoor wide open swung himself up through the opening to the floor and the next instant back a little from the connecting doorway his body pressed closely against the kitchen wall he was staring bewildered and amazed into the next room On the floor presumably to lessen the chance of any light rays stealing through the tightly drawn window shades burned a small oil lamp The place was in utter confusion The right hand side of a large fireplace made of rough untrimmed stone and cement and which occupied almost the entire end of the room was already practically demolished and the wreckage was littered everywhere part of the furniture was piled unceremoniously into one corner out of the way and at the fireplace itself working with sledge and bar were two men One was Connie Myers An ironical glint crept into Jimmie Dale s eyes The false beard and mustache the man wore would deceive no one who knew Connie Myers And that he should be wearing them now as he knelt holding the bar while the other struck at it seemed both uncalled for and absurd The other man heavily built roughly dressed had his back turned and Jimmie Dale could not see his face The puzzled frown on Jimmie Dale s forehead deepened Somewhere in the masonry of the fireplace of course was where old Luther Doyle had hidden his money That was quite plain enough and that Connie Myers in some way or other had made sure of that fact was equally obvious But how did old Luther Doyle get his money IN there from time to time as he received the interest and dividends whose accumulation according to the Tocsin comprised his hoard And how did he get it OUT again All right that ll do grunted Connie Myers suddenly We can pry this one out now Lend a hand on the bar The other dropped his sledge turned sideways as he stooped to help Connie Myers his face came into view and with an involuntary start Jimmie Dale crouched farther back against the wall as he stared at the other It was Hagan missus Hagan s husband Mike Hagan My God whispered Jimmie Dale under his breath So that was it That the murder had been committed in the tenement was not so strange now A surge of anger swept Jimmie Dale and was engulfed in a wave of pity Somehow the thin tired face of missus Hagan had risen before him and she seemed to be pleading with him to go away to leave the house to forget that he had ever been there to forget what he had seen what he was seeing now His hands clenched fiercely How realistically how importunately how pitifully she took form before him She was on her knees clasping his knees imploring him terrified From Jimmie Dale s pocket came the black silk mask Slowly almost hesitantly he fitted it over his face Mike Hagan knew Larry the Bat Why should he have pity for Mike Hagan Had he any for Connie Myers What right had he to let pity sway him The man had gone the limit he was Connie Myers accomplice a murderer But the man was not a hardened confirmed criminal like Connie Myers Mike Hagan a murderer It would have been unbelievable but for the evidence before his own eyes now The man had faults brawled enough and drank enough to have brought him several times to the notice of the police but this Jimmie Dale s eyes had never left the scene before him Both men were throwing their weight upon the bar and the stone that they were trying to dislodge they were into the heart of the masonry now seemed to move a little Connie Myers stood up and leaning forward examined the stone critically at top and bottom prodding it with the bar He turned from his examination abruptly and thrust the bar into Hagan s hands Hold it he said tersely I ll strike for a turn Crouched on his hands and knees Hagan inserted the point of the bar into the crevice Connie Myers picked up the sledge Lower Bend lower he snapped and swung the sledge It seemed to go black for a moment before Jimmie Dale s eyes seemed to paralyse all action of mind and body There was a low cry that was more a moan the clang of the iron bar clattering on the floor and Mike Hagan had pitched forward on his face an inert and huddled heap A half laugh half snarl purled from Connie Myers lips as he snatched a stout piece of cord from his pocket and swiftly knotted the unconscious man s wrists together Another instant and picking up the bar prying with it again the loosened stone toppled with a crash into the grate It had come sudden as the crack of doom that blow too quick too unexpected for Jimmie Dale to have lifted a finger to prevent it And now that the first numbed shock of mingled horror and amazement was past he fought back the quick fierce impulse to spring out on Connie Myers Whether the man was killed or only stunned he could do no good to Mike Hagan now and there was Connie Myers he was staring in a fascinated way at Connie Myers Behind the stone that the other had just dislodged was a large hollow space that had been left in the masonry and from this now Connie Myers was eagerly collecting handfuls of banknotes that were rolled up into the shape of little cylinders each one grotesquely tied with a string The man was feverishly excited muttering to himself running from the fireplace to where the table had been pushed aside with the rest of the furniture dropping the curious little rolls of money on the table and running back for more And then having apparently emptied the receptacle he wriggled his body over the dismantled fireplace stuck his head into the opening and peered upward Kinks in his nut kinks in his nut Connie Myers was muttering I ll drop the bar through from the top mabbe there s some got stuck in the pipe He regained his feet picked up the bar and ran with it into what was evidently the front hall then his steps sounded running upstairs Like a flash Jimmie Dale was across the room and at the fireplace Like Connie Myers he too put his head into the opening and then a queer unpleasant smile on his lips he bent quickly over the man on the floor Hagan was no more than stunned and was even then beginning to show signs of returning consciousness There was a rattle a clang a thud and the bar too long to come all the way through dropped into the opening and stood upright Connie Myers footsteps sounded again returning on the run and Jimmie Dale was back once more on the other side of the kitchen doorway It was all simple enough once one understood The same queer smile was still flickering on Jimmie Dale s lips There was no way to get the money out except the way Connie Myers had got it out by digging it out With the irrational cunning of his mad brain that had put the money even beyond his own reach old Doyle had built his fireplace with a hollow some eighteen inches square in a great wall of solid stonework and from it had run a two inch pipe up somewhere to the story above and down this pipe he had dropped his little string tied cylinders of banknotes satisfied that his hoard was safe There seemed something pitifully ironic in the elaborate insane craftiness of the old man s fear twisted demented mind And now Connie Myers was back in the room again and again a puzzled expression settled upon Jimmie Dale s face as he watched the other For perhaps a minute the man stood by the table sifting the little rolls of money through his fingers gloatingly then impulsively he pushed these to one side produced a revolver laid it on the table and from another pocket took out a little case which as he opened it Jimmie Dale could see contained a hypodermic syringe One more article followed the other two a letter which Connie Myers took out of an unsealed envelope He dropped this suddenly on the table as Mike Hagan three feet away on the floor groaned and sat up Hagan s eyes swept bewildered confused around him questioningly at Connie Myers and then resting suddenly on his bound wrists they narrowed menacingly Damn you you smashed me with that sledge on PURPOSE he burst out and began to struggle to his feet With a brutal chuckle Connie Myers pushed Hagan back and shoved his revolver under the other s nose Sure he admitted evenly And you keep quiet or I ll finish you now instead of letting the police do it He laughed out jarringly You re under arrest you know for the murder of Luther Doyle and for robbing the poor old nut of his savings in his house here Hagan wrenched himself up on his elbow What what do you mean he stammered Oh don t worry said Connie Myers maliciously I M not making the arrest I d rather the police did that I m not mixing up in it and by and by he lifted up the hypodermic for Hagan to see I m going to shoot a little dope into you that ll keep you quiet while I get away myself Hagan s face had gone a grayish white he had caught sight of the money on the table and his eyes kept shifting back and forth from it to Myers face Murder he said huskily There is no murder I don t know who Doyle is You said this house was yours you hired me to come here You said you were going to tear down the fireplace and build another You said I could work evenings and earn some extra money Sure I did There was a vicious leer now on Connie Myers lips But you don t think I picked you out by ACCIDENT do you Your reputation my bucko was just shady enough to satisfy anybody that it wouldn t be beyond you to go the limit Sure you murdered Doyle Listen to this He took up the letter TO THE POLICE Luther Doyle was murdered this evening in the tenement at sixty seven Street You ll find his body in a room on the second floor If you want to know who did it look in Mike Hagan s room on the floor above There s a paper stuck under the edge of Hagan s table with a piece of chewing gum where he hid it You ll know what it is when you go out and take a look at Doyle s house in Pelham Yours truly A FRIEND Mike Hagan did not speak his lips were twitching and there was horror creeping into his eyes D ye get me sneered Connie Myers Tell your story who d believe it I got you cinched Twice I tried to get this old dub s coin out here and couldn t find it But the second time I found something else a piece of paper with a drawing of the fireplace on it and a place in the drawing marked with an X That was good enough wasn t it That s the paper I stuck under your table this afternoon when your wife was out see Somebody s got to stand for the job and if it s somebody else it won t be me get me When I had a look at that fireplace I knew I couldn t do the job alone in a week and I didn t dare blast it with soup for fear of spoiling what was inside And since I had to have somebody to help me I thought I might as well let him help me all the way through and stand for it I picked you Mike that s why I croaked old Doyle in your tenement to night I wrote this letter while I was waiting for you to show up at the station to come out here with me and I m going to see that the police get it in the next hour When they find Doyle in the room below yours and that paper in your room and the busted fireplace here I guess they won t look any farther for who did it And say he leaned forward with an ugly grin mabbe you think I m soft to be telling you all this But don t you fool yourself You don t know me you don t know who I am So tell em the TRUTH They won t believe you anyway with evidence like that against you and the neater the story the more they ll think it shows brains enough on your part to have pulled a job like this My God Hagan was rocking on his knees beads of sweat were starting out on his forehead You wouldn t plant a man like that he cried brokenly You wouldn t do it would you My God you wouldn t do that Jimmie Dale s face under his mask was white and rigid There was something primal elemental in the savagery that was sweeping upon him He had it all now ALL She had been right there was need to night for the Gray Seal So that was the game inhuman hellish the whole of it to the last filthy dregs Connie Myers to protect himself was railroading an innocent man to death for the crime that he himself had committed There was a cold smile on Jimmie Dale s lips now as he took his automatic from his pocket No it wasn t quite all the game there was still HIS hand to play He edged forward a little nearer to the door and halted abruptly listening An automobile had stopped outside on the road Hagan was still pleading in a frenzied way Connie Myers was callously folding his letter while he watched the other warily neither of the men had heard the sound And then quick almost on the instant came a rush of feet a crash upon the front door an imperative command to open in the name of the law THE POLICE Jimmie Dale s brain was working now with lightning speed Somehow the police had stumbled upon the crime in that tenement and as he had foreseen in such an event had identified Doyle But they could not be sure that any one was present here in the house now they could not see a light any more than he had He must get Mike Hagan away must see that Connie Myers did NOT get away Myers was on his feet now fear struck in his turn the letter clutched in a tight closed fist his revolver swung out poised in the other hand Hagan too was on his feet and unheeded now by Connie Myers was wrenching his wrists apart Another crash upon the door another Another demand in a harsh voice to open it Then some one running around to the window at the side of the house and Jimmie Dale sprang forward There was the roar of a report a blinding flash almost in Jimmie Dale s eyes as Connie Myers whirling instantly at his entrance fired and missed It happened quick then in the space of the ticking of a watch before Jimmie Dale flinging himself forward had reached the man Like a defiant challenge to their demand it must have seemed to the officers outside that shot of Connie Myers at Jimmie Dale for it was answered on the instant by another through the side window And the shot fired at random the interior of the room hidden from the officers outside by the drawn shades found its mark and Connie Myers a bullet in his brain pitched forward dead upon the floor QUICK Jimmie Dale flung at Hagan Get that letter out of his hand He jumped for the lamp on the floor extinguished it and turned again toward Hagan Have you got it he whispered tensely Yes said Hagan in a numbed way This way then Jimmie Dale caught Hagan s arm and pulled the other across the room and into the kitchen to the trapdoor Quick he breathed again Get down there quick And no noise They don t know how many are in the house When they find HIM they ll probably be satisfied Hagan stupefied dazed obeyed mechanically and in an instant the trapdoor closed behind them Jimmie Dale was standing beside the other in the cellar Not a sound now he cautioned once more His flashlight winked went out winked again then held steadily in curious fascination it seemed as in its circuit the ray fell upon Hagan FELL UPON THE TORN RAGGED EDGE OF A PAPER IN HAGAN S HAND With a suppressed cry Jimmie Dale snatched it away from the other It was but a torn HALF of the letter The other half The other half Hagan where is it he demanded hoarsely Hagan almost in a state of collapse muttered inaudibly The crash of a toppling door sounded from above Jimmie Dale shook the man desperately Where is it he repeated fiercely He he was holding it tight it it tore in his hand Hagan stammered Does it make any difference Oh let s get out of here whoever you are for God s sake let s get out of here Any difference Jimmie Dale s jaws were clamped like a steel vise Any difference The difference between life and death for the man beside him that was all He was reading the portion in his hand It was the last part of the letter beginning with There s a paper stuck under the edge of Hagan s table From above from the floor of the front room now came the rush and trample of feet He could not go back for the other half And any attempt to conceal the fact that Connie Myers had been alone in the house was futile now They would find the torn letter in the dead man s hand proof enough that some one else had been there What was in that part of the letter that was still clutched in that death grip upstairs A sentence from it that he had heard Connie Myers read seemed to burn itself into his brain IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO DID IT LOOK IN MIKE HAGAN S ROOM ON THE FLOOR ABOVE And then suddenly like light through the darkness came a ray of hope He pulled Hagan to the cellarway and stealthily lifted one side of the double trapdoor There was a chance desperate enough one in a thousand but still a chance Voices from the house came plainly now but there was no one in sight The police to a man were evidently all inside From the road in front showed the lamp glare of their automobile Run for the car Jimmie Dale jerked out from between set teeth and with Hagan beside him steadying the man by the arm dashed across the intervening fifty yards They had not been seen A minute more and the car evidently belonging to the local police for it was headed in the direction of New York and as though it had come from Pelham swept down the road swept around a turn and Jimmie Dale with a gasp of relief straightened up a little from the wheel How much time had he The police must have heard the car but equally occupied as they were they might well give it no thought other than that it was but another car passing by There was no telephone in the house the nearest house was a quarter of a mile away and that might or might not have a telephone Could he count on half an hour He glanced anxiously at the crouched figure beside him He would have to It was the only chance They would telephone the contents of the dead man s half of the letter to the New York police Could he get to Hagan s room FIRST Look in Hagan s room their part of the letter read but it did not say for WHAT or exactly WHERE If they found nothing Hagan was safe Connie Myers reputation the fact that he was found in disguise at Doyle s house was barring any incriminating evidence quite enough to let Hagan out There would only remain in the minds of the police the question of who beside Connie Myers had been in old Doyle s house that night And now Jimmie Dale smiled a little whimsically Well perhaps he could answer that and if not quite to the satisfaction of the police at least to the complete vindication of Mike Hagan But he could not drive through towns and villages with a mask on his face and there ahead now lights were beginning to show And more than ever now with what was before him it was imperative that Mike Hagan should not recognise Larry the Bat Jimmie Dale glanced again at Hagan and slowed down the car They were on the outskirts of a town and off to the right he caught the twinkling lights of a street car Hagan he said sharply pull yourself together and listen to me If you keep your mouth shut you ve nothing to fear if you let out a word of what s happened to night you ll probably go to the chair for a crime you know nothing about Do you understand keep your mouth shut The car had stopped Hagan nodded his head All right then You get out here and take a street car into New York continued Jimmie Dale crisply But when you get there keep away from your home for the next two or three hours Hang around with some of the boys you know and if you re asked anything afterward say you were batting around town all evening Don t worry you ll find you re out of this when you read the morning papers Now get out hurry He pushed Hagan from the car I ve got to make my own get away Hagan standing in the road brushed his hand bewilderingly across his eyes Yes but you I Never mind about that Jimmie Dale leaned out and gripped Hagan s arm impressively There s only one thing you ve got to think of or remember Keep your mouth shut No matter what happens keep your mouth shut if you want to save your neck Good night Hagan The car was racing forward again It shot streaking through the streets of the town ahead and dully over its own inferno echoed shouts cries and execrations of an outraged populace then out into the night again roaring its way toward New York He had half an hour perhaps It was a good thing Hagan did not know or had not grasped the significance of that torn letter the man would have been unmanageable with fear and excitement It would puzzle Hagan to find no paper stuck under his table when he came to look for it But that was a minor consideration that mattered not at all Half an hour On roared the car towns black roads villages wooded lands were kaleidoscopic in their passing Half an hour Had he done it Had he come anywhere near doing it He did not know He was in the city at last and now he had to moderate his speed but by keeping to the less frequented streets he could still drive at a fast pace One piece of good fortune had been his the long motor coat he had found in the car with which to cover the rags of Larry the Bat and without which he would have been obliged to leave the car somewhere on the outskirts of the city and to trust like Mike Hagan to other and slower means of transportation Blocks away from Hagan s tenement he ran the car into a lane slipped off the motor coat and from his pocket whipped out the little metal insignia case and in another moment a diamond shaped gray seal was neatly affixed to the black ebony rim of the steering wheel He smiled ironically It was necessary quite necessary that the police should have no doubt as to who had been in Doyle s house with Connie Myers that night or to whom they had so considerately loaned their automobile He was running now through lanes dodging down side streets taking every short cut he knew Had he beaten the police to Mike Hagan s room It would be easy then If they were ahead of him then by some means or other he must still get that paper first He was at the tenement now shuffling leisurely up the steps The front door was open He entered and went up the first flight of stairs then along the hall and up the next flight He had half expected the place to be bustling with excitement over the crime but the police evidently had kept the affair quiet for he had seen no one since he had entered But now as he began to mount the third flight he went more slowly some one was ahead of him It was very dark he could not see The steps above died away He reached the landing started along for Hagan s room and a light blazed suddenly in his face and a hard quick grip on his shoulder forced him back against the wall Then the flashlight wavered glistened on brass buttons went out and a voice laughed roughly It s only Larry the Bat Larry the Bat eh It was another voice harsh and curt What are you doing here He was not first after all The telephone message from Pelham it was almost certainly that had beaten him They were ahead of him just ahead of him they had only been a few steps ahead of him going up the stairs just a second ahead of him on their way to Hagan s room Jimmie Dale was thinking fast now He must go too to Hagan s room with them somehow there was no other way there was Hagan s life at stake Aw I ain t done nothin he whined I was just goin ter borrow the price of a feed from Mike Hagan lemme go Hagan eh snapped the questioner Are you a friend of his Sure I am The officers whispered for a moment together We ll try it decided the one who appeared to be in command We re in the dark anyhow and the thing may be only a steer Mabbe it ll work anyway it won t do any harm His hand fell heavily on Jimmie Dale s shoulder missus Hagan know you brusquely Sure she does sniffled Larry the Bat Good rasped the officer Well we ll make the visit with you And you do what you re told or we ll put the screws on you see We re after something here and you ve blown the whole game savvy You ve spilled the gravy understand In the darkness Jimmie Dale smiled grimly It was far more than he had dared to hope for they were playing into his hands But I don t know bout any game grovelled Larry the Bat piteously Who in hell said you did growled the officer You re supposed to have snitched the lay to us that s all and mind you play your part Come on It was two doors down the hall to Mike Hagan s room and there one of the officers putting his shoulder to the door burst it open and sprang in The other shoved Jimmie Dale forward It was quickly done The three were in the room The door was closed again Came a cry of terror out of the darkness a movement as of some one rising up hurriedly in bed and then missus Hagan s voice What is it Who is it Mike The table it was against the right hand wall Jimmie Date remembered He sidled quickly toward it Strike a light ordered the officer in charge Jimmie Dale s fingers were feeling under the edge of the table a quick sweep along it NOTHING He stooped reaching farther in another sweep of his arm and his fingers closed on a sheet of paper and a piece of hard gum In an instant they were in his pocket A match crackled and flared up A lamp was lighted Larry the Bat sulked sullenly against the wall Terror stricken wide eyed missus Hagan had clutched the child lying beside her to her arms and was sitting bolt upright in bed Now then no fuss about it said the officer in charge with brutal directness You might as well make a clean breast of Mike s share in that murder downstairs Larry the Bat here has already told us the whole story Come on now out with it Murder her face went white My Mike MURDER She seemed for an instant stunned and then down the worn thin haggard face gushed the tears I don t believe it she cried I don t believe it Come on now cut that out prodded the officer roughly I tell you Larry the Bat here has opened everything up wide You re only making it worse for yourself Him She was staring now at Jimmie Dale Oh God she cried So that s what you are are you a stool pigeon for the cops Well whatever you told them you lie You re the curse of this neighbourhood you are and if my Mike is bad at all it s you that s helped to make him bad But murder you LIE She had risen slowly from the bed a gaunt pitiful figure pitifully clothed the black hair gray streaked streaming thinly over her shoulders still clutching the baby that too was crying now The officers looked at one another and nodded Guess she s handing it straight we ll have a look on our own hook the leader muttered She paid no attention to them she was walking straight to Jimmie Dale It s you is it she whispered fiercely through her sobs that would bring more shame and ruin here you that s selling my man s life away with your filthy lies for what they re paying you it s you is it that Her voice broke There was a frightened uneasy look in Larry the Bat s eyes his lips were twitching weakly he drew far back against the wall and then glancing miserably at the officers as though entreating their permission began to edge toward the door For a moment she watched him her face white with outrage her hand clenched at her side and then she found her voice again Get out of here she said in a choked strained way pointing to the door Get out of here you dirty skate Sure mumbled Larry the Bat his eyes on the floor Sure he mumbled and the door closed behind him PART TWO THE WOMAN IN THE CASE CHAPTER I BELOW THE DEAD LINE Whisperings Always whisperings low sibilant floating errantly from all sides until they seemed a component part of the drug laden atmosphere itself And occasionally another sound the soft SLAP SLAP of loose slippered feet the faint rustle of equally loose fitting garments And everywhere the sweet sickish smell of opium It was Chang Foo s simply a cellar or two deeper in Chang Foo s than that in which Dago Jim had quarrelled once and died Larry the Bat vicious faced unkempt disreputable lay sprawled out on one of the dive s bunks an opium pipe beside him But Larry the Bat was not smoking instead his ear was pressed closely against the boarding that formed the rather flimsy partition at the side of the bunk One heard many things in Chang Foo s if one cared to listen if one could first win one s way through the carefully guarded gateway that to the uninitiated offered nothing more interesting than the entrance to a Chinese tea shop and an uninviting one at that HAD HE BEEN FOLLOWED IN HERE He had been shadowed for the last hour of that at least he was certain Why By whom For an hour he had dodged in and out through the dens of the underworld as only one who was at home there and known to all could do and at last he had taken refuge in Chang Foo s like a fox burrowing deep into its hole Few could find their way into the most infamous opium den in all New York where not only the poppy ruled as master but where crime was hatched ay and carried to its ghastly consummation sometimes as well and of those few not one but was of the underworld itself And it was that fact which held his muscles strained and rigid now under the miserable rags that covered them and it was that which kept the keen quick brain alert and active every faculty keyed up and tense If it were the police he had little to fear for they could not force their way in without warning but if it were the underworld he was in imminent peril and had done little better than run himself into a trap from which there was no escape DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL he had heard that whispered more than once in this very place Who knew at what moment the role of Larry the Bat would be uncovered and the underworld where now he held so high a place would be at his throat like a pack of snarling wolves Who had been shadowing him during the last hour Whisperings Nothing tangible He could catch no words Only the never ending whisperings of gathered groups here and there and sometimes the clink of coin where some game was in progress The curtain before his bunk was drawn suddenly aside and Larry the Bat s fingers where his hand was carelessly hidden by his body tightened upon his automatic Smokee some more The fingers relaxed It was only Sam Wah one of the attendants Nix said Larry the Bat in a slightly muddled tone Got enough The curtain fell into place again Larry the Bat s lips set in a thin smile Ultimately it made little difference whether it was the police or the underworld The smile grew thinner It was the flip of a coin that was all With one there was the death house at Sing Sing for the Gray Seal with the other well there were many ways from a shot or a knife thrust in the open street to his murder in some hidden dive like this of Chang Foo s for instance where he now was the Gray Seal was responsible for the occupancy of too many penitentiary cells by those of the underworld to look for any other fate He raised himself up sharply on his elbow A shrill high note like the scream of a parrakeet rang out a second time He tore the curtain aside and jumped to his feet All around him in the twinkling of an eye Chinamen in fluttering blouses chattering like magpies mingled with snarling cursing whites were running madly A voice prefaced with an oath bawled out behind him as he sprang forward and joined the rush Beat it De cops Beat it The police A raid Was it for HIM From rooms an amazing number of them more forms rushed out joined divided separated and dashed some this way some that along branching passageways There had been raids before the police had begun to change their minds about Chang Foo s but Chang Foo s was not an easy place to raid House after house in that quarter of Chinese laundries of tea shops of chop suey joints opened one into the other through secret passages in the cellars Larry the Bat plunged down a staircase and halted in the darkness of a cellar drawing back against the wall while the flying feet of his fellow fugitives scurried by him Was it for HIM this raid If not the police had not a hope of getting him if he kept his head for back in Chang Foo s proper which would be quite closed off now Chang Foo would be blandly submitting to arrest offering himself as a sort of glorified sacrifice while the police confiscated opium and fan tan layouts If the police had no other purpose than that in mind Chang Foo would simply pay a fine the next night the place would be in full blast again and Chang Foo higher than ever in the confidence of the underworld s aristocracy would reap his reward and that would be all there was to it But was that all The raid had followed significantly close upon the heels of his entry into Chang Foo s Larry the Bat began to move forward again He dared not follow the others and later on when quiet was restored issue out into the street from any one of the various houses in which he might temporarily have taken refuge There was a chance in that a chance that the police might be more zealous than usual even if he particularly was not their game and he could take no chance Arrest for Larry the Bat even on suspicion could have but one conclusion not a pleasant one the disclosure that Larry the Bat was not Larry the Bat at all but Jimmie Dale the millionaire club man and to complete a fatal triplication that Larry the Bat and Jimmie Dale was the Gray Seal upon whose head was fixed a price All was silence around him now except that from overhead came occasionally the muffled tread of feet He felt his way along into a black narrow passage emerged into a second cellar swept the place with a single circling gleam from a pocket flashlight passed a stairway that led upward reached the opposite wall and dropping on hands and knees crawled into what innocently enough appeared to be the opening of a coal bin He knew Chang Foo s well as he knew the ins and outs of every den and place he frequented knew them as a man knows such things when his life at any moment might hang upon his knowledge He was in another passage now and this in a few steps brought him to a door Here he halted and stood for a full five minutes absolutely motionless absolutely still listening There was nothing not a sound He tried the door cautiously It was locked The slim sensitive tapering fingers of Jimmie Dale unrecognisable now in the grimy digits of Larry the Bat felt tentatively over the lock To fingers that seemed in their tips to possess all the human senses that time and again in their delicate touch upon the dial of a safe had mocked at human ingenuity and driven the police into impotent frenzy this was a pitiful thing From his pocket came a small steel instrument that was quickly and deftly inserted in the keyhole There was a click the door swung open and Jimmie Dale alias Larry the Bat stepped outside into a back yard half a block away from the entrance to Chang Foo s Again he listened There did not appear to be any unusual excitement in the neighbourhood From open windows above him and from adjoining houses came the ordinary commonplace sounds of voices talking and laughing even the queer weird notes of a Chinese chant He stole noiselessly across the yard out into the lane and made his way rapidly along to the cross street In a measure now he was safe but one thing a very vital thing remained to be done It was absolutely necessary that he should know whether he was the quarry that the police had been after in the raid if it was the police who had been shadowing him all evening If it was the police there was but one meaning to it Larry the Bat was known to be the Gray Seal and a problem perilous enough in any aspect confronted him Dare he risk the Sanctuary for the clothes of Jimmie Dale Or was it safer to burglarise as he had once done before his own mansion on Riverside Drive His thoughts were running riot and he frowned angry with himself There was time enough to think of that when he knew that it was the police against whom he had to match his wits Well in the shadow of the buildings he moved swiftly along the side street until he came to the corner of the street on which halfway down the block fronted Chang Foo s tea shop A glance in that direction and Jimmie Dale drew a breath of relief A patrol wagon was backed up to the curb and a half dozen officers were busy loading it with what was evidently Chang Foo s far from meagre stock of gambling appurtenances while Chang Foo himself together with Sam Wah and another attendant were in the grip of two other officers waiting possibly for another patrol wagon There was a crowd too but the crowd was at a respectful distance on the opposite side of the street Jimmie Dale still hugged the corner A man swaggered out from a doorway quite close to Chang Foo s and came on along the street As the other reached the corner Jimmie Dale sidled forward Ello Chick he said out of the corner of his mouth Wot s de lay Ello Larry returned the other Aw nuthin De nutcracker on Chang dat s all I t ought mabbe dey was lookin for some guy dat was in dere observed Jimmie Dale Nuthin doin the other answered I was in dere meself De whole mob beat it clean an de bulls never batted an eye Didn t youse pipe me make me get away outer Shanghai s a minute ago De bulls never went nowhere except into Chang s Dere s a new lootenant in de precinct inaugeratin himself dat s all S long Larry I gotta date S long Chick responded Jimmie Dale and started slowly back along the cross street It was not the police then who were interested in his movements Then who He shook his head with a little savage impotent gesture One thing was clear it was too early to risk a return to the Sanctuary and attempt the rehabilitation of Jimmie Dale If any one was on the hunt for Larry the Bat the Sanctuary would be the last place to be overlooked He turned the next corner hesitated a moment in front of a garishly lighted dance hall and finally shuffled in through the door made his way across the floor nodding here and there to the elite of gangland and with a somewhat arrogant air of proprietorship sat down at a table in the corner Little better than a tramp in appearance certainly the most disreputable looking object in the place even the waiter who approached him accorded him a certain curious deference was not Larry the Bat the most celebrated dope fiend below the dead line Gimme a mug o suds ordered Jimmie Dale and sprawled royally back in his chair Under the rim of his slouch hat pulled now far over his eyes he searched the faces around him If he had been asked to pick the actors for a revel from the scum of the underworld he could not have improved upon the gathering There were perhaps a hundred men and women in the room the majority dancing and with the exception of a few sight seeing slummers they were men and women whose acquaintance with the police was intimate but not cordial far from cordial Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders and sipped at the glass that had been set before him It was grimly ironic that he should be not only there but actually a factor and a part of the underworld s intimate life He Jimmie Dale a wealthy man a member of New York s exclusive clubs a member of New York s most exclusive society It was inconceivable He smiled sardonically Was it Well then it was none the less true His life unquestionably was one unique apart from any other man s but it was for all that actual and real There had been three years of it now since SHE had come into his life Jimmie Dale slouched down a little in his chair The ice was thin perilously thin that he was skating on now Each letter with its demand upon him to match his wits against police or underworld or against both combined perhaps made that peril a little greater a little more imminent if that were possible when already his life was almost literally carried daily hourly in his hand Not that he rebelled against it it was worth the price that some day he expected he must pay the price of honour wealth a name disgraced ruin death Was he quixotic Immoderately so He smiled gravely Perhaps But he would do it all over again if the choice were his There were those who blessed the name of the Gray Seal as well as those who cursed it And there was the Tocsin Who was she He did not know but he knew that he had come to love her come to care for her and that she had come to mean everything in life to him He had never seen her to know her face He had never seen her face but he knew her voice ay he had even held her for a moment the moment of wildest happiness he had ever known in his arms That night when he had entered his library his own particular den in his own house and in the darkness had found her there found her finally through no effort of his own when he had searched so fruitlessly for years to find her using every resource at his command to find her And she because she had come of her own volition relying upon him had held him in honour to let her go as she had come without looking upon her face Exquisite irony But she had made him a promise then that the work of the Gray Seal was nearly over that soon there would be an end to the mystery that surrounded her that he should know all that he should know HER He smiled again but it was a twisted smile on the mechanically misshapen lips of Larry the Bat NEARLY over Who knew That nearly might be too late Even tonight he had been shadowed was skulking even now in this place as a refuge Who knew Another hour and the newsboys might be shrieking their Uxtra Uxtra De Gray Seal caught De millionaire Jimmie Dale de Jekyll an Hyde of real life Jimmie Dale straightened up suddenly in his seat There was a shout an oath bawled out high above the riot of noise a chorus of feminine shrieks from across the room What was the matter with the underworld to night He seemed fated to find nothing but centres of disturbance first a raid at Chang Foo s and now this What was the matter here They were stampeding toward him from the other side of the room There was the roar of a revolver shot another Black Ike He caught an instant s glimpse of the gunman s distorted face through the crowd That was it probably a row over some moll And then as Jimmie Dale lunged up from his chair to his feet to escape the rush pandemonium itself seemed to break loose Yells shots screams and oaths filled the air The crowd surged this way and that Tables were overturned and sent crashing to the floor And then came sudden darkness as some one of the attendants in misguided excitability switched off the lights The darkness but served to increase the panic not allay it With a savage snap of his jaws Jimmie Dale swung from his table in the corner with the intention of making his way out by a side door behind him it was a case of the police again and the patrolman outside would probably be pulling a riot call by now And the police He stopped suddenly as though he had been struck An envelope thrust there out of the darkness was in his hand and her voice HERS the Tocsin s was sounding in his ears Jimmie Jimmie I ve been trying all evening to catch you Quick Get to the Sanctuary and change your clothes There s not an instant to lose It s for my sake to night And then a surging mob was around him on every side and pushing jostling half lifting him at times from his feet carried him forward with its rush and with him in its midst burst through the door and out into the street CHAPTER II THE CALL TO ARMS Not a sound as the key turned in the lock not a sound as the door swung back on its carefully oiled hinges not a sound as Larry the Bat slipped like a shadow into the blackness of the room closing the door behind him again With a tread as noiseless as a cat s he was across the room to satisfy himself that the shutters were tightly closed and then the single gas jet flared up murky yellow illuminating the miserable squalid room the Sanctuary the home of Larry the Bat There was need for silence need for caution In five minutes ten at the outside he must emerge again as Jimmie Dale With a smile on his lips that mingled curiously chagrin and self commiseration he took the letter from his pocket and tore it open It was she then who had been following him all evening and like a blundering idiot he had wasted precious perhaps irreparable hours What had she meant by It s for my sake to night The words had been ringing in his ears since the moment she had whispered them in that panic stricken crowd Was it not always for her sake that he answered these calls to arms Was it not always for her sake that he as the Gray Seal was The mental soliloquy came to an abrupt end He had subconsciously read the first sentence of the letter and now with sudden feverish eagerness and excitement he was reading it to the last word DEAR PHILANTHROPIC CROOK In an hour after you receive this if all goes well you shall know everything everything Who I am yes and my name It has been more than three years now hasn t it It has been incomprehensible to you but there has been no other way I dared not take the chance of discovery by any one I dared not expose you to the risk of being known by me Your life would not have been worth a moment s purchase Oh Jimmie am I only making the mystery more mystifying But to night I think I hope I pray that it is all at an end though against me and against you to night when you go to help me is the most powerful and pitiless organisation of criminals that the world has ever known and the stake we are playing for is a fortune of millions and my life And yet somehow I am afraid now just because the end is so near and the victory seems so surely won And so Jimmie be careful use all that wonderful cleverness of yours as you have never used it before and But there should be no need for that it is so simple a thing that I am going to ask you to do Why am I writing so illogically Nothing surely can possibly happen This is not like one of my usual letters is it I am beside myself to night with hope anxiety fear and excitement Listen then Jimmie Be at the northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly Place at exactly half past ten A taxicab will drive up as though you had signalled it in passing and the chauffeur will say I ve another fare in half an hour sir but I can get you most anywhere in that time You will be smoking a cigarette Toss it out into the street make any reply you like and get into the cab Give the chauffeur that little ring of mine with the crest of the bell and belfry and the motto Sonnez le Tocsin that you found the night old Isaac Pelina was murdered and the chauffeur will give you in exchange a sealed packet of papers He will drive you to your home and I will telephone to you there I need not tell you to destroy this Keep the appointment in your proper person as Jimmie Dale Carry nothing that might identify you as the Gray Seal if any accident should happen And lastly trust the pseudo chauffeur absolutely There was no signature Her letters were never signed He stood for a moment staring at the closely written sheets in his hand a heightened colour in his cheeks his lips pressed tightly together and then his fingers automatically began to tear the letter into pieces and the pieces again into little shreds To night It was to be to night the end of all this mystery To night was to see the end of this dual life of his with its constant peril To night the Gray Seal was to exit from the stage forever To night a wonderful climax of the years he was to see HER His blood was quickened now his heart pounding in a faster beat a mad elation a fierce uplift was upon him He thrust the torn bits of paper into his pocket hurriedly stepped across the room to the corner rolled back the oilcloth and lifted up the loose plank in the flooring so innocently dustladen as more than once to have eluded the eyes of inquisitive visitors in the shape of police and plain clothes men from headquarters From the space beneath he removed a neatly folded pile of clothes laid these on the bed and began to undress He was working rapidly now Tiny pieces of wax were removed from his nostrils from under his lips from behind his ears water from a cracked pitcher poured into a battered tin basin and mixed with a few drops of some liquid from a bottle which he procured from its hiding place under the flooring banished the make up stain from his face his neck his wrists and hands as if by magic It was a strange metamorphosis that had taken place the coarse brutal featured blear eyed leering countenance of Larry the Bat was gone and in its place clean cut square jawed clear eyed was the face of Jimmie Dale And where before had slouched a slope shouldered misshapen flabby creature a broad shouldered form well over six feet in height now stood erect and under the clean white skin the muscles of an athlete like knobs of steel played back and forth with every movement of his body In the streaked and broken mirror Jimmie Dale surveyed himself critically methodically and with a nod of satisfaction hastily donned the fashionably cut suit of tweeds upon the bed He rummaged then through the ragged garments he had just discarded transferred to his pockets a roll of bills and his automatic and paused hesitantly staring at the thin metal case like a cigarette case that he held in the palm of his hand He shrugged his shoulders a little whimsically it seemed strange indeed that he was through with that He snapped it open Within between sheets of oil paper lay the scores of little diamond shaped gray coloured adhesive paper seals the insignia of the Gray Seal Yes it seemed strange that he was never to use another He closed the case gathered up the clothes of Larry the Bat tucked the case in among them and shoved the bundle into the hole under the flooring All these things would have to be destroyed but there was not time to night to morrow or the next day would do for that What would it be like to live a normal life again without the menace of danger lurking on every hand without that grim slogan of the underworld Death to the Gray Seal or that savage fiat of the police The Gray Seal dead or alive but the Gray Seal forever ringing in his ears What would it be like this new life with her The thought was thrilling him again bringing again that eager exultant uplift In an hour ONE hour and the barriers of years would be swept away and she would be in his arms It s for my sake to night His face grew suddenly tense as the words came back to him That hour wasn t over yet It was no hysterical exaggeration that had prompted her to call her enemies the most powerful and pitiless organisation of criminals that the world had ever known It was not the Tocsin s way to exaggerate The words would be literally true The very life she had led for the three years that had gone stood out now as a grim proof of her assertion Jimmie Dale replaced the flooring carefully brushed the dust back into the cracks spread the oilcloth into place and stood up Who and what was this organisation What was between it and the Tocsin What was this immense fortune that was at stake And what was this priceless packet that was so crucial that meant victory now ay and her life too she had said The questions swept upon him in a sort of breathless succession Why had she not let him play a part in this True she had told him why that she dared not expose him to the risk Risk Was there any risk that the Gray Seal had not taken and at her instance He did not understand he smiled a little uncertainly as he reached up to turn out the gas There were a good many things that he did not understand about the Tocsin The room was in darkness and with the darkness Jimmie Dale s mind centred on the work immediately before him To enter the tenement where he was known and had an acknowledged right as Larry the Bat was one thing for Jimmie Dale to be discovered there was quite another He crossed the room opened the door silently stood for a moment listening then stepped out into the black musty ill smelling hallway closing the door behind him He stooped and locked it The querulous cry of a child reached him from somewhere above a murmur of voices muffled by closed doors from everywhere How many families were housed beneath that sordid roof he had never known only that there was miserable poverty there as well as vice and crime only that Larry the Bat who possessed a room all to himself was as some lordly and super being to these fellow tenants who shared theirs with so many that there was not air enough for all to breathe He had no doors to pass his was next to the staircase He began to descend They could scream and shriek those stairs like aged humans twisted and rheumatic at the least ungentle touch But there was no sound from them now There seemed something almost uncanny in the silent tread Stair after stair he descended his entire weight thrown gradually upon one foot before the other was lifted The strain upon the muscles trained and hardened as they were told As he moved from the bottom step he wiped little beads of perspiration from his forehead The door now that gave on the alleyway He opened it slipped outside darted across the narrow lane stole along where the shadows of the fence were blackest paused listening as he reached the end of the alleyway to assure himself that there was no near by pedestrian and stepped out into the street He kept on along the block turned into the Bowery and under the first lamp consulted his watch It was a quarter past ten He could make it easily in a leisurely walk He continued on up the Bowery finally crossed to Broadway and shortly afterward turned into Waverly Place At the corner of Fifth Avenue he consulted his watch again and now he lighted a cigarette Sixth Avenue was only a block away At precisely half past ten to the second he halted on the designated corner smoking nonchalantly A taxicab coincidentally coming from an uptown direction swung in to the curb Taxi sir Yes sir Then with an admirable mingling of eagerness to secure the fare and a fear that his confession might cause him the loss of it I ve another fare in half an hour sir but I can get you most anywhere in that time Jimmie Dale s cigarette was tossed carelessly into the street saint James Club he said curtly and stepped into the cab The cab started forward turned the corner and headed along Waverly Place toward Broadway The chauffeur twisted around in his seat in a matter of fact way as though to ask further directions Have you anything for me he inquired casually It lay where it always lay that ring between the folds of that little white glove in his pocketbook Jimmie Dale took it out now and handed it silently to the chauffeur The other s face changed instantly composure was gone and a quick strained look was in its place I m afraid I ve been watched he said tersely Look behind you will you and tell me if you see anything Jimmie Dale glanced backward through the little window in the hood There s another taxi just turned in from Sixth Avenue he reported the next instant Keep your eye on it instructed the chauffeur shortly The speed of the cab increased sensibly With a curious tightening of his lips Jimmie Dale settled himself in his seat so that he could watch the cab behind There was trouble coming intuitively he sensed that and he reflected bitterly he might have known It was too marvellous too wonderful ever to come to pass that this one hour the thought of which had fired his blood and made him glad beyond any gladness life had ever held for him before should bring its promised happiness Where s the cab now the chauffeur flung back over his shoulder They had passed Fifth Avenue and were nearing Broadway About the same distance behind Jimmie Dale answered That looks bad the chauffeur gritted between his teeth We ll have to make sure I ll run down Lower Broadway If you think we re followed suggested Jimmie Dale quietly why not run uptown and give them the slip somewhere where the traffic is thick Lower Broadway at this time of night is as empty and deserted as a country road The chauffeur s sudden laugh was mirthless My God you don t know what you are talking about he burst out If they re following all hell couldn t throw them off the track And I ve got to know I ve got to be SURE before I dare make a move to night I couldn t tell up in the crowded districts if I was followed could I They won t come out into the open until their hands are forced The car swerved sharply rounded the corner and speeding up faster and faster began to tear down Lower Broadway Watch WATCH cried the chauffeur There was no word between them for a moment then Jimmie Dale spoke crisply It s turned the corner It s coming this way The taxicab was rocking violently with the speed silent empty Lower Broadway stretched away ahead Apart from an occasional street car probably there would be nothing between them and the Battery Jimmie Dale glanced at his companion s face as a light flashing by threw it into relief It was set and stern even a little haggard but too there was something else there something that appealed instantly to Jimmie Dale a sort of bulldog grit that dominated it If he holds our speed we ll know the chauffeur was shouting now to make himself heard over the roar of the car Look again Where is it now Once more Jimmie Dale looked through the little rear window The cab had been a block behind them when it had turned the corner and he watched it now in a sort of grim fascination There was no possible doubt of it The two bobbing bouncing headlights were creeping steadily nearer And then a sort of unnatural calm settled upon Jimmie Dale and his hand went mechanically to his pocket to feel his automatic there as he turned again to the chauffeur If you ve got any more speed you d better use it he said significantly The man shot a quick look at him They are following us You are SURE Yes said Jimmie Dale The chauffeur laughed again in that mirthless savage way Lean over here where I can talk to you he rasped out The game s up as far as I am concerned I guess But there s a chance for you They don t know you in this Give her more speed or dodge into a cross street suggested Jimmie Dale coolly They haven t got us yet by a long way The other shook his head It s not only that cab behind he answered through set lips You don t know what we re up against If they re really after us there s a trap laid in every section of this city the devils It s the package they want Thank God for the presentiment that made me leave it behind I was going back for it you understand if I was satisfied that we weren t followed Listen There s a chance for you there s none for me That package remember this no one else knows where it is and it s life and death to the one who sent you here It s in Box four hundred twenty eight at My God LOOK Look there he yelled and with a wrench at the wheel sent the taxi lurching and staggering for the car tracks in the centre of the street The scene fast as thought itself was photographing itself in every detail upon Jimmie Dale s brain From the cross street ahead one from each corner two motor cars had nosed out into Broadway blocking the road on both sides And now the car on the left hand side was moving forward across the tracks to counteract the chauffeur s move deliberately insuring a collision There was no chance no further room to turn no time to stop the man driving the other car jumped for safety they would be into it in an instant Box four hundred twenty eight Jimmie pleaded fiercely Go on man Go on FINISH Yes cried the chauffeur John Johansson at But Jimmie Dale heard no more There was the crash of impact as the taxicab plowed into the car that had been so craftily manoeuvered in front of it and Jimmie Dale lifted from his feet was hurled violently forward with the shock and all went black before his eyes CHAPTER III THE CRIME CLUB For what length of time he had remained unconscious Jimmie Dale had not the slightest idea He regained his senses to find himself lying on a couch in a strange room that had a most exquisitely brass wrought dome light in the ceiling That was what attracted his attention because the light hurt his eyes and his head was already throbbing as though a thousand devils were beating a diabolical tattoo upon it He closed his eyes against the light Where was he What had happened Oh yes he remembered now That smash on Lower Broadway He had been hurt He moved first one limb and then another tentatively and was relieved to find that though his body ached as if it had been severely shaken and his head was bad he had apparently escaped without serious injury Where was he In a hospital His fingers resting at his side upon the couch supplied him with the information that it was a very expensive couch upholstered in finest leather If he were in a hospital he would be in a cot He opened his eyes again to glance curiously around him The room was quite in keeping with the artistic lighting fixture and the refined if expensive taste that was responsible for the couch A heavy velvet rug of rich dark green was bordered by a polished hardwood floor panellings of dark green frieze and beautifully grained woodwork made the lower walls while above on a background of some soft toned paper hung a few and evidently choice oil paintings There was a big inviting lounging chair a massive writing table or more properly a desk of walnut and behind the desk his back half turned apparently intent upon a book sat a man in immaculate evening dress Jimmie Dale closed his eyes again There was something reassuring about it all comfortably reassuring Though why there should be any occasion for a feeling of reassurance at all he could not for the moment make out And then in a sudden flash the details of the night came back to him The Tocsin s letter the package he was to get the taxicab the chauffeur who was not a chauffeur the chase the trap He lay perfectly still It was the professional Jimmie Dale now whose brain in spite of the throbbing brutally aching head was at work keen alert The chauffeur What had happened to him Had the man been killed in the auto smash or less fortunate than himself fallen into the hands of those whose power he seemed both to fear and rate so highly And that package Box what was the number yes four hundred twenty eight What did that mean What box Where was it Who was John Johansson He hadn t heard any more than that the smash had come then And lastly he was back again to the same question he had begun with Where was he now himself It looked as though some good Samaritan had picked him up Who was this gentleman so quietly reading there at the desk Jimmie Dale opened his eyes for the third time How still how absolutely silent the room was He studied the man s back speculatively for a moment then his gaze travelled on past the man to the wall riveted there and his fingers without movement of his arm pressed against the outside of his coat pocket He thought as much His automatic was gone Not a muscle of Jimmie Dale s face moved His eyes shifted to a picture on the wall THE MAN WAS WATCHING HIM NOT READING Just above the level of the desk a small mirror held the couch in focus but equally it held the man in focus and Jimmie Dale had seen the other s eyes through a black mask that covered the face to the top of the upper lip fixed intently upon him There was a chill now where before there had been reassurance something ominous in the very quiet and refinement of the room and Jimmie Dale smiled inwardly in bitter irony his good Samaritan wore a mask His self congratulations had come too soon Whatever had happened to the chauffeur it was evident enough that he himself was caught What was it the chauffeur had said Something about a chance through being unknown Was it to be a battle of wits then God if his head did not ache so frightfully It was hard to think with the brain half sick with pain Those two eyes shining in that mirror There seemed something horribly spectre like about it He did not look again but he knew they were there It was like a cat watching a mouse Why did not the man speak or move or do something and He turned his head slowly the man was laughing in a low amused way You appear to be taken with that picture observed a pleasant voice Perhaps you recognise it from there It is a Corot Jimmie Dale with a well simulated start sat up and with another quite as well simulated stared at the masked man The other had laid down his book and swung around in his chair to face the couch Jimmie Dale stood up a little shakily Look here he said awkwardly I I don t quite understand I remember that my taxi got into a smash up and I suppose I have to thank you for the assistance you must have rendered me only as I say he looked in a puzzled way around the room and in an even more perplexed way at the mask on the other s face I must confess I am at a loss to understand quite the meaning of this Suppose that instead of trying to understand you simply accept things as you find them The voice was soft but there was a finality in it that its blandness only served to make the more suggestive Jimmie Dale drew himself up and bowed coldly I beg your pardon he said I did not mean to intrude I have only to thank you again then and bid you good night The lips beneath the mask parted slightly in a politely deprecating smile There is no hurry said the man a sudden sharpness creeping into his tones I am sorry that the rule I apply to you does not work both ways For instance I might be quite at a loss to account for your presence in that taxicab Jimmie Dale s smile was equally polite equally deprecating I fail to see how it could be of the slightest possible interest to you he replied However I have no objection to telling you I hailed the taxi at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly Place told the chauffeur to drive me to the saint James Club and The saint James Club broke in the other coldly is I believe north not SOUTH of Waverly Place and on Broadway not at all Jimmie Dale stared at the other for an instant in patient annoyance I am quite well aware of that he said stiffly Nevertheless I told the man to drive me to the saint James Club We came across Waverly Place but on reaching Broadway instead of turning uptown he suddenly whirled in the other direction and sent the car flying at full speed down Lower Broadway I shouted at the man I don t know yet whether he was drunk or crazy or Jimmie Dale s eyes fixed disdainfully on the other s mask whether there might not after all have been method in his madness I can only say that before we had gone more than two or three blocks a wild effort on his part to avoid a collision with an auto swinging out from a side street resulted in an even more disastrous smash with another on the other side and I was knocked senseless Victim I presume is the idea you desire to convey observed the other evenly You were quite the victim of circumstances as it were Jimmie Dale s eyebrows lifted slightly It would appear to be fairly obvious I should say Very clever commented the man But now suppose we remove the buttons from the foils His voice rasped suddenly You are quite as well aware as I am that what has happened to night was not an accident Nor in case the possibility may have occurred to you are the police any the wiser save for the existence of two wrecked cars on Lower Broadway and another which escaped and for which doubtless they are still searching assiduously The ownership of the taxicab you so inadvertently entered they will have no difficulty in establishing you perhaps however are in a better position than I am to appreciate the fact that the establishment of its ownership will lead them nowhere As I understand it the man who drove you to night obtained the loan of the cab from one of the company s chauffeur s in return for a hundred dollar bill Am I right In view of what has happened admitted Jimmie Dale simply I should not be surprised There was a sort of sardonic admiration in the other s laugh As for the other car he went on I can assure you that its ownership will never be known When the nearest patrolman rushed up there were no survivors of the disaster save those in the third car which he was powerless to stop which accounts for your presence here You will admit that I have been quite frank Oh quite said Jimmie Dale a little wearily But would you mind telling me what all this is leading to The man had been leaning forward in his chair one hand palm downward resting lightly on the desk He shifted his hand now suddenly to the arm of his chair THIS he said and on the desk where his hand had been lay the Tocsin s gold signet ring Jimmie Dale s face expressed mild curiosity He could feel the other s eyes boring into him We were speaking of ownership said the man in a low menacing tone I want to know where the woman who owns this ring can be found to night There was no play no trifling here the man was in deadly earnest But it seemed to Jimmie Dale even with the sense of peril more imminent with every instant that he could have laughed outright in savage mockery at the irony of the question Where was she Even WHO was she And this was the hour in which he was to have known May I look at it he requested calmly The other nodded but his eyes never left Jimmie Dale It will give you an extra moment or so to frame your answer he said sarcastically Jimmie Dale ignored the thrust picked up the ring examined it deliberately and set it back again on the table Since I do not know who owns it he said I cannot answer your question No Well then there is still another matter a little package that was in the taxicab with you Where is that See here said Jimmie Dale irritably This has gone far enough I have seen no package large or small or of any description whatever You are evidently mistaking me for some one else You have only to telephone to the saint James Club He reached toward his pocket for his cardcase My name is Dale supplied the other curtly Don t bother about the card mister Dale We have already taken the liberty of searching you He rose abruptly from his chair I am afraid you do not quite realise your position mister Dale he said with an ominous smile Let me make it clear I do not wish to be theatrical about this but we do not temporise here You will either answer both of those questions to my satisfaction OR YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE Jimmie Dale s face hardened His eyes met the other s steadily Ah I think I begin to see he said caustically When I have been thoroughly frightened I shall be offered my freedom at a price A sort of up to date game of holdup The penalty of being a wealthy man If you had named your figure to begin with we would have saved a lot of idle talk and you would have had my answer the sooner NOTHING Do you know said the other in a grimly musing way there has always been one man but only one until now that I have wished I might add to my present associates I refer to the so called Gray Seal To night there are two I pay you the compliment of being the other But he was smiling ominously again we are wasting time mister Dale I am willing to expose my hand to the extent of admitting that the information you are withholding is infinitely more valuable to me than the mere wreaking of reprisal upon you for a refusal to talk Therefore if you will answer I pledge you my word you will be free to leave here within five minutes If you refuse you are already aware of the alternative Well mister Dale Who was this man Jimmie Dale was studying the other s chin the lips the white even teeth the jet black hair Some day the tables might be turned Could he recognise again this cool imperturbable ruffian who so callously threatened him with murder Well mister Dale I am waiting I am not a magician said Jimmie Dale contemptuously I could not answer your questions if I wanted to The other s hand slid instantly to a row of electric buttons on the desk Very well mister Dale he said quietly You do not believe I see that I would dare to carry my threat into execution you perhaps even doubt my power I shall take the trouble to convince you I imagine it will stimulate your memory The door opened Two men were standing on the threshold both in evening dress both masked The man behind the desk came forward took Jimmie Dale s arm almost courteously and led him from the room out into a corridor where he halted abruptly I want to call your attention first mister Dale to the fact that as far as you are concerned you neither have now nor ever will have any idea whether you are in the heart of New York or fifty miles away from it Now listen Do you hear anything There was nothing Only the strange silence of that other room was intensified now There was not a sound stillness such as it seemed to Jimmie Dale he had never experienced before was around him You may possibly infer from the silence that you are NOT in the city suggested the other after a moment s pause I leave you to your own conclusions in that respect The cause however of the silence is internal not external we had sound proof principles in mind to a perhaps exaggerated degree when this building was constructed If you care to do so you have my permission to shout say for help to your heart s content We shall make no effort to stop you Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders He was staring down a brilliantly lighted richly carpeted corridor There were doors on one side windows on the other the windows all hung with heavy closely drawn portieres The corridor was certainly not on the ground floor but whether it was on the second or third or even above that again he had no means of knowing From appearances though the place seemed more like a large private mansion than anything else Just one word more before we proceed continued the other I do not wish you to labour under any illusion Here we are frankly criminals This is our home It should have some effect in impressing you with the power and resource at our command and also with the class of men with whom you are dealing There is not one among us whose education is not fully equal to your own not one indeed but who is chosen granting first his criminal tendencies because he is a specialist in his own particular field in commerce in the government diplomatic service in the professions of law and medicine in the ranks of pure science We are bordering on the fantastical are we not Dreaming you will probably say of the Utopian in crime organisation Quite so mister Dale I only ask you to consider the POSSIBILITIES if what I say is true Now let us proceed I am going to take you into three rooms the three whose doors you see ahead of you You will notice that including the one you have just left there are four on this corridor I do not wish to strain your credulity or play tricks upon you so I am going to ask you to fix an approximate idea of the length of the corridor in your mind as it will perhaps enable you to account more readily for what may appear to be a discrepancy in the corresponding size of the rooms One of the men opened the door ahead Jimmie Dale at a sign from his conductor moved forward and entered Just what he had expected to find he could not have told his brain was whirling partly from his aching head partly from his desperate effort to conceive some way of escape from the peril which for all his nonchalance he knew only too well was the gravest he had ever faced but what he saw was simply a cozily furnished bedroom There was nothing peculiar about it nothing out of the way except perhaps that it was rather narrow And then suddenly rubbing his eyes involuntarily he was staring in a dazed way before him The whole right hand side of the wall was sinking without a sound into the floor increasing the width of the room by some five or six feet and in this space was disclosed what appeared to be a sort of chemical laboratory elaborately equipped extending the entire length of the room The wall is purely a matter of mechanical construction operated hydraulically The man was speaking softly at Jimmie Dale s side The room beneath is built to correspond the base ceiling and wall mouldings here do not have to be very ingenious to effect a disguise I might say however that few visitors other than yourself have ever seen anything here but a bedroom He waved his hand toward the retorts the racks of test tubes the hundred and one articles that strewed the laboratory bench As for this its purpose is twofold We as well as the police have often need of analysis We make it If we require a drug a poison say we compound it from its various ingredients or as the case may be distil it perhaps it is you will agree somewhat more difficult to trace to its source if procured that way And speaking of poisons he stepped forward and lifted a glass stoppered bottle containing a colourless liquid from a shelf in a modest way we have even done some original research work here This for instance is as Utopian from our standpoint as the formation and personnel of the organisation I have briefly outlined to you It possesses very essential qualities It is almost instantaneous in its action requires a very small quantity and defies detection even by autopsy He uncorked the bottle and dipped in a long glass rod Will you watch the experiment he invited with a sort of ghastly pleasantry I do not want you to accept anything on trust With a start Jimmie Dale swung around He had heard no sound but another man was at his elbow now and struggling in the man s hand was a little white rabbit It was over in an instant A single drop in the rabbit s mouth and the animal had stiffened out a lifeless thing It is quite as effective on the human organism continued the other only instead of one drop three are required If I make it ten he was carefully measuring the liquid into two wineglasses it is only that even you may be satisfied that the quantity is fatal He filled up the glasses with what was apparently wine of some description which he poured from a decanter and held out the glasses in front of him And again Jimmie Dale started again he had heard no one enter and yet two men had stepped forward from behind him and had taken the glasses from their leader s hands He glanced around him counting quickly they were surely the two who had entered with him from the corridor No Including the leader there were now six men all in evening dress all masked in the room with him A wave of the leader s hand and the two men holding the glasses left the room The man turned to Jimmie Dale again Shall we proceed to the second room mister Dale he asked politely I think it is now prepared for us I do not wish to bore you with a repetition of magical sliding walls There was something now that numbed the ache in Jimmie Dale s brain a sense of some deadly remorseless thing that seemed to be constantly creeping closer to him clutching at him to smother him to choke him There was something absolutely fiendish terrifying in the veneer of culture around him They had entered the second room This like the other was a pseudo bedroom but here the movable wall was already down Ranged along the right hand side were a great number of cabinets that slid in and out much after the style and fashion used by clothing dealers to stock and display their wares These cabinets were now all open displaying hundreds of costumes of all kinds and descriptions and evidently complete to the minutest detail The cabinets were flanked by full length mirrors at each end of the room and on little tables before the mirrors was an assortment that none better than Jimmie Dale himself could appreciate of make up accessories The man smiled apologetically I am afraid this is rather uninteresting he said I have shown it to you simply that you may understand that we are alive to the importance of detail Disguise that is daily vital to us is an art that depends essentially on detail I venture to say we could impersonate any character or type or nationality or class in the United States at a moment s notice But he took Jimmie Dale s arm again and conducted him out into the corridor while the two men who were evidently acting the role of guards followed closely behind there is still the third room here He halted Jimmie Dale before the door I have asked you to answer two questions mister Dale he said softly I ask you now to remember the alternative They still stood before the door There was that uncanny silence again it seemed to Jimmie Dale to last interminably Neither of the three men surrounding him moved nor spoke Then the door before him was opened on an unlighted room and he was led across the threshold He heard the door close behind him The lights came on And then it seemed as though he could not move as though he were rooted to the spot and the colour ebbed from his face Three figures were before him the two men who had carried the glasses from the first room and the chauffeur who had driven him in the taxicab The two men still held the glasses the chauffeur was bound hand and foot in a chair One of the glasses was EMPTY the other was still significantly full Jimmie Dale with a violent effort at self control leaned forward The man in the chair was dead CHAPTER IV THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER 
2380-152158-0000	train-other-500	There was not a sound That stillness weird unnerving that permeated as it were everywhere through that mysterious house was if that were possible accentuated now
2380-152158-0001	train-other-500	The four masked men in evening dress five including their leader for the man who had appeared in that other room with the rabbit was not here were as silent as motionless as the dead man who was lashed there in the chair
2380-152158-0002	train-other-500	And to Jimmie Dale it seemed at first as though his brain stunned and stupefied at the shock refused its functions and left him groping blindly vaguely
none	none	 with only a sort of dull subconscious realisation of menace and a deadly peril 
2380-152158-0003	train-other-500	imminent hanging over him He tried to rouse himself mentally to prod his brain to action to pit it in a fight for life against these self confessed criminals and murderers with their mask of culture who surrounded him now
2380-152158-0004	train-other-500	Was there a way out What was it the Tocsin had said the most powerful and pitiless organisation of criminals the world has ever known the stake a fortune of millions her life There had indeed been no overemphasis in the words she had used
2380-152158-0005	train-other-500	They had taken pains themselves to make that ominously clear these men Every detail of the strange house with its luxurious furnishings its cleverly contrived appointments breathed a horribly suggestive degree of power
2380-152158-0006	train-other-500	a deadly purpose and an organisation swayed by a master mind and grim evidence of the merciless inexorable length to which they would go was the ghastly white face of the dead chauffeur bound hand and foot in the chair before him
2380-152158-0007	train-other-500	That EMPTY glass in the hand of one of the men He could not take his eyes from it except as his eyes were drawn magnetically to that FULL glass in the hand of one of the others What height of sardonic irony
2380-152158-0008	train-other-500	He was to drink that other glass to die because he refused to answer questions that for years with every resource at his command risking his liberty his wealth his name his life with everything that he cared for thrown into the scales
2380-152158-0009	train-other-500	he had struggled to solve and failed And then the leader spoke mister Dale he said with cold significance I regret to admit that your pseudo taxicab driver
2380-152158-0010	train-other-500	was so ill advised as to refuse to answer the SAME questions that I have put to you Five to one That was the only way out and it was hopeless It was the only way out because convinced
2380-152158-0011	train-other-500	that he could answer those questions if he wanted to these men were in deadly earnest it was hopeless because they were five to one And probably there were as many more twice or three times as many more within call
2380-152158-0012	train-other-500	But what did it matter how many more there were He could fight until he was overpowered that was all he could do and the five could accomplish that Still if he could knock the full glass out of that man s hand and gain the door
2380-152158-0013	train-other-500	then perhaps he turned quickly as the door opened It was as though they had read his thoughts A number of men were grouped outside in the corridor then the door closed again with a cordon ranged against it inside the room
2380-152158-0014	train-other-500	and at the same instant his arms and wrists were caught in a powerful grasp by the two men immediately behind him who all along had enacted the role of guards Again the leader spoke I will repeat the questions he said sharply
2380-152158-0015	train-other-500	Where is the woman whose ring was found on that man there in the chair And where is the package that you two men had with you in the taxicab to night Jimmie Dale glanced from the tall straight immaculately clothed figure of the speaker
2380-152158-0016	train-other-500	from the threatening smile on the set lips that just showed under the edge of the mask to the dead man in the chair He had faced the prospect of death before many times
none	none	 but it had come with the heat of passion accompanying it 
2380-152158-0017	train-other-500	it had come quickly abruptly with every faculty called into action to combat it without time to dwell upon it to sift weigh or measure its meaning and if there had been fear it had been subordinate to other emotions But it was different now
none	none	 He could not of course answer those questions 
2380-152158-0018	train-other-500	nor he was doggedly conscious would he have answered them if he could and there was no middle course Death within the next few moments stared him in the face and it seemed curiously irrelevant that in a sort of unnatural calmness
none	none	 he should be attempting to analyse his feelings 
2380-152158-0019	train-other-500	and emotions concerning it All his life it had seemed to him that the acme of human mental torture was the cell of a condemned criminal with the horror of its hopelessness with the time to dwell upon it
2380-152158-0020	train-other-500	and that the acme of that torture itself must be that awful moment immediately preceding execution when anticipation at last was to merge into soul sickening reality Strange that thought should come
2380-152158-0021	train-other-500	Strange that he should be framing a brain picture of such a scene vivid minute in detail No not strange He was picturing himself The analogy was not perfect it was true
2380-152158-0022	train-other-500	he had not had the months weeks days and hours of suspense but it was perfect enough to bring home to him with appalling force the realisation of his position He was standing as a condemned man might stand in those last final moments
2380-152158-0023	train-other-500	those moments which he had imagined must be the most terrible that could exist in life but that dismay of soul the horror the terror were not his there was instead a smouldering fury a passionate amazement
none	none	 that it was his own life 
2380-152158-0024	train-other-500	that was threatened It seemed impossible that it could be his voice that was speaking now in such quiet measured tones Is it worth while will it convince you now any more than before to repeat that there is some mistake here
2380-152158-0025	train-other-500	I am no more able to answer your questions than you are yourselves I never saw that man in the chair there in my life until the moment that I hailed him in his cab to night I do not know who the woman is to whom that ring belongs
none	none	 much less do I know where she is 
2380-152158-0026	train-other-500	And if there was a package of any sort in the taxicab as you state I never saw it The lips under the mask curved into a lupine smile Think well mister Dale The man s voice was low menacing Ethically
2380-152158-0027	train-other-500	if you so choose to consider it your refusal may be the act of a brave man
none	none	 practically it is the act of a fool 
2380-152158-0028	train-other-500	Now your answer I have answered you said Jimmie Dale and relaxing the muscles in his arms let them hang limply for an instant in the grip of the two men behind him I have no other answer It was only a sign a motion of the leader s hand
2380-152158-0029	train-other-500	but with it quick as a lightning flash Jimmie Dale was in action The limp arms tautened into steel as he wrenched them loose and whirling around
none	none	 he whipped his fist to the chin of one of the two guards 
2380-152158-0030	train-other-500	In an instant with the blow as the man staggered backward the room was in pandemonium There was a rush from the door and two three four leaping forms hurled themselves upon Jimmie Dale He shook them off and they came again
2380-152158-0031	train-other-500	There was no chance ultimately he knew that it was only the elemental within him that rose in fierce revolt at the thought of tame submission that bade him sell his life as dearly as he could
2380-152158-0032	train-other-500	Panting gasping for breath dragging them by sheer strength as they clung to him he got his back to the wall fighting with the savage fury and abandon of a wild cat But it could not last
2380-152158-0033	train-other-500	Where one man went down before him two remorselessly appeared the room seemed filled with men they poured in through the door he laughed at them in a half demented way more and more of them came
2380-152158-0034	train-other-500	there was no play for his arms no room to fight they seemed so close around him so many of them upon him that he could not breathe and he was bending being crushed down
none	none	 as by an intolerable weight 
2380-152158-0035	train-other-500	And then his feet were jerked from beneath him he crashed to the floor and in another moment bound hand and foot he was tied into a chair beside that other chair whose grim occupant sat in such ghastly apathy of the scene
2380-152158-0036	train-other-500	The room cleared instantly of all but the original five His head was drawn suddenly violently backward and clamped in that position and a metal instrument forced into his mouth
none	none	 while his lips bled in their resistance 
2380-152158-0037	train-other-500	pried jaws apart and held them open One drop the leader ordered curtly The man with the full glass bent over him and dipped a glass rod into the liquid The drop glistened a ruby red on the end of the rod
2380-152158-0038	train-other-500	and fell with a sharp acrid burning sensation upon Jimmie Dale s tongue For a moment Jimmie Dale s animation mental and physical seemed swept away from him in as it were a hiatus of hideous suspense
2380-152158-0039	train-other-500	What was it to be like this passing
none	none	 Why did it not act at once as it had acted on the rabbit 
2380-152158-0040	train-other-500	they had showed him in the other room Yes he remembered It took more than one drop for a man and besides this was diluted One drop had no effect on a man it required Good God ONE DROP EVEN OF THIS WAS ENOUGH
2380-152158-0041	train-other-500	He strained forward in the chair until the sweat in great beads sprang from his forehead
none	none	 strained and fought and tore at his bonds in a paroxysm 
2380-152158-0042	train-other-500	of madness to free himself while there still remained a little strength There was something filming before his eyes a numbed feeling was creeping through his limbs robbing them sapping them of their vitality and power
2380-152158-0043	train-other-500	He felt himself slipping away into a state of utter weakness and his brain began to grow confused A voice seemed to float in the air near him For the last time will you answer
2380-152158-0044	train-other-500	With a supreme effort Jimmie Dale strove to rally his tottering senses Did they not understand the stupendous mockery of their questions Did they not understand that he did not know He had told them so perhaps
2380-152158-0045	train-other-500	he had better tell them so again I He tried to speak and found the words thick upon his tongue I do not know The glass itself was thrust abruptly between his lips
2380-152158-0046	train-other-500	Some of the contents spilled and trickled upon his chin and then a flood of it
none	none	 burning fiery 
2380-152158-0047	train-other-500	poured down his throat A flood of it and it needed but THREE drops and there had been TEN in the glass So this was death a hazy nebulous thing There was no pain It was like like nothingness
none	none	 And out of the nothingness SHE came 
2380-152158-0048	train-other-500	Strange that she should come Alone she had fought these fiends and outwitted them for how long was it Three years She would be more than ever alone now Pray God she did not finally fall into their clutches
none	none	 How it burned now that fatal draught they had forced down his throat 
2380-152158-0049	train-other-500	and how it gripped at him and seemed to eat and bore its way into the very tissues It was the end and no It was STIMULATING him Strength seemed to be returning to his limbs
none	none	 it seemed as though he were being carried 
2380-152158-0050	train-other-500	as though the bonds about him were being loosened and now his brain seemed to be growing clearer He roused up with a startled exclamation
2380-152158-0051	train-other-500	He was back in the same room in which he had first returned to consciousness after the accident He was on the same couch The same masked figure was at the same desk Had he been dreaming Was this then
2380-152158-0052	train-other-500	only some horrible ghastly nightmare through which he had passed No it had been real enough his clothes rent and torn and the blood upon his hands where the skin had been scraped from his knuckles in the fight bore evidence to that
none	none	 He must then have lost consciousness for a while 
2380-152158-0053	train-other-500	though it seemed to him that at no moment hazy irrational though his brain might have been had he become entirely oblivious to what was taking place around him
2380-152158-0054	train-other-500	And yet it must have been so The eyes from behind the mask were fixed steadily upon him and below the mask there was the hard unpleasant set
none	none	 to the lips that Jimmie Dale had grown accustomed to expect 
2380-152158-0055	train-other-500	The man spoke abruptly That you find yourself alive mister Dale he said grimly is no confession of weakness upon the part of those with whom you have had to deal here To bear witness to that
2380-152158-0056	train-other-500	there is one who is not alive as you have seen That man we knew With you it was somewhat different Your presence in the taxicab was only suspicious There was always the possibility that you might be one of those
2380-152158-0057	train-other-500	ubiquitous innocent bystanders Your name your position the improbability that you could have anything in common with shall we say the matter that so deeply interests us was all in your favour
2380-152158-0058	train-other-500	However presumption and probability are the tools of fools We do not depend upon them we apply the test And having applied the test we are convinced that you have told the truth that is all
2380-152158-0059	train-other-500	He rose from his chair brusquely I shall not apologise to you for what has happened
none	none	 I doubt very much if you are in a frame of mind to accept anything of the sort 
2380-152158-0060	train-other-500	I imagine rather that you are promising yourself that we shall pay and pay dearly for this
none	none	 that among other things we shall answer for the murder of that man in the other room 
2380-152158-0061	train-other-500	All this will be quite within your province mister Dale and quite fruitless To morrow morning the story that you are preparing to tell now would sound incredible even in your own ears furthermore as we shall take pains to see that you leave
2380-152158-0062	train-other-500	this place with as little knowledge of its location as you obtained when you arrived your story even if believed would do little service to you and less harm to us I think of nothing more mister Dale except
2380-152158-0063	train-other-500	There was a whimsical smile on the lips now Ah yes the matter of your clothes We can and shall be glad to make reparation to you to the slight extent of offering you a new suit before you go
2380-152158-0064	train-other-500	Jimmie Dale scowled Sick shaken and weak as he was the cool imperturbable impudence of the man was fast growing unbearable The man laughed I am sure you will not refuse mister Dale since we insist
none	none	 The condition of the clothes you have on at present might I say might in a measure support your story with some degree of tangible evidence 
2380-152158-0065	train-other-500	It is not at all likely of course but we prefer to discount even so remote a possibility When you have changed you will be motored back to your home I bid you good night mister Dale Jimmie Dale rubbed his eyes
2380-152158-0066	train-other-500	The man was gone through a door at the rear of the desk a door that he had not noticed before that was not even in evidence now that was simply a movable section of the wall panelling
2380-152158-0067	train-other-500	and for an instant Jimmie Dale experienced a sense of sickening impotence It was as though he stood defenceless unarmed and utterly at the mercy of some venomous power
none	none	 that could crush what it would remorselessly 
2380-152158-0068	train-other-500	and at will in its might The place was a veritable maze a lair of hellish cleverness He had no illusions now he laboured under no false estimate of either the ingenuity or the resources of this inhuman nest of vultures
2380-152158-0069	train-other-500	to whom murder was no more than a matter of detail
none	none	 And it was against these men that henceforth he was to match his wits 
2380-152158-0070	train-other-500	There could be no truce no armistice
none	none	 It was their lives or hers or his 
2380-152158-0071	train-other-500	Well he was alive now the first round was over and so far he had won His brows furrowed suddenly Had he He was not so sure after all He was conscious of a disquieting premonitory intuition that in some way
none	none	 which he could not explain the honours were not entirely his 
2380-152158-0072	train-other-500	He was apparently the apparently was a mental reservation quite alone in the room He got up from the couch and walked shakily across the floor to the desk A revolver lay invitingly upon the blotting pad It was his own
2380-152158-0073	train-other-500	the one they had taken from him after the accident Jimmie Dale picked it up examined it and smiled a little sarcastically
none	none	 at himself for his trouble 
2380-152158-0074	train-other-500	It was unloaded of course He was twirling it in his hand as a man masked as every one in the house was masked and carrying a neatly folded suit over his arm entered from the corridor
2380-152158-0075	train-other-500	The car is ready as soon as you are dressed announced the other briefly He laid the clothes upon the couch and settled himself significantly in a chair Jimmie Dale hesitated Then with a shrug of his shoulders recrossed the room
2380-152158-0076	train-other-500	and began to remove his torn garments What was the use They would certainly have their own way in the end It wasn t worth another fight and there was nothing to be gained by a refusal except to offer a sop to his own exasperation
2380-152158-0077	train-other-500	He dressed quickly in what proved to be an exceedingly well fitting suit and finally turned tentatively to the man in the chair The other stood up and produced a heavy black silk scarf
none	none	 If you have no objections he said curtly I ll tie this over your eyes Again Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders I am glad enough to get out on any conditions he answered caustically Fortunate would be the better word rejoined the other meaningly and deftly knotting the scarf led Jimmie Dale blindfolded from the room CHAPTER V ON GUARD Was he in the city 
2309-152159-0000	train-other-500	In a suburban town On a country road It seemed childishly absurd that he could not at least differentiate to that extent and yet from the moment he had been placed in the automobile in which he now found himself he was forced to admit that he could not tell
none	none	 He had started out with the belief that knowing New York and its surroundings as minutely as he knew them 
2309-152159-0001	train-other-500	it would be impossible do what they would to prevent it
none	none	 that at the end of the journey he should be without a clew and a very good clew at that 
2309-152159-0002	train-other-500	to the location of what he now called appropriately enough it seemed the Crime Club But he had never ridden blindfolded in a car before He could see absolutely nothing And if that increased or accentuated his sense of hearing it helped little
none	none	 the roar of the racing car beat upon his eardrums the more heavily that was all He could tell of course the nature of the roadbed 
2309-152159-0003	train-other-500	They were running on an asphalt road that was obvious enough but city streets and suburban streets and hundreds of miles of country road around New York were of asphalt Traffic He was quite sure for he had strained his ears in an effort to detect it
2309-152159-0004	train-other-500	that there was little or no traffic but then it must be one or two o clock in the morning and at that hour the city streets certainly those that would be chosen by these men would be quite as deserted as any country road And as for a sense of direction
2309-152159-0005	train-other-500	he had none whatever even if the car had not been persistently swerving and changing its course every little while If he had been able to form even an approximate idea of the compass direction in which they had started
2309-152159-0006	train-other-500	he might possibly have been able in a general way to counteract this further effort of theirs to confuse him but without the initial direction
2309-152159-0007	train-other-500	he was essentially befogged With these conclusions finally thrust home upon him Jimmie Dale philosophically subordinated the matter in his mind and leaning back composed himself as comfortably as he could upon his seat There was a man beside him
2309-152159-0008	train-other-500	and he could feel the legs of two men on the seat facing him These with the driver would make four He was still well guarded The car itself was a closed car not hooded the sense of touch told him therefore a limousine of some description
2309-152159-0009	train-other-500	These facts in a sense inconsequential were absorbed subconsciously and then Jimmie Dale s brain remorselessly active in spite of the pain from his throbbing head was at work again
none	none	 It seemed as though a year had passed since 
2309-152159-0010	train-other-500	in the early evening as Larry the Bat he had burrowed so ironically for refuge in Chang Foo s den from her It seemed like some mocking unreality some visionary dream that so short a while before
2309-152159-0011	train-other-500	he had read those words of hers that had sent the blood coursing and leaping through his veins
none	none	 in mad exultation at the thought that the culmination of the years had come that all he longed for hoped for that all his soul cried out for was to be his 
2309-152159-0012	train-other-500	in an hour An HOUR and he was to have seen her the woman whose face he had never seen the woman whom he loved And the hour instead
2309-152159-0013	train-other-500	the hours since then had brought a nightmare of events so incredible as to seem but phantoms of the imagination Phantoms He sat up suddenly with a jerk The face of the dead chauffeur the limp form lashed in that chair
none	none	 the horrible picture in its entirety 
2309-152159-0014	train-other-500	every detail standing out in ghastly relief took form before him God knew there was no phantom there The man beside him at the sudden start lifted a hand and felt hurriedly over the bandage across Jimmie Dale s eyes
none	none	 Jimmie Dale was scarcely conscious of the act With that face before him with the scene re enacting itself in his mind again had come another thought staggering him for a moment with the new menace that it brought 
2309-152159-0015	train-other-500	He had had neither time nor opportunity to think before
none	none	 it had been all horror 
2309-152159-0016	train-other-500	all shock when he had entered that room But now like an inspiration he saw it all from another angle There was a glaring fallacy in the game these men had played for his benefit to night a fallacy which they had counted on glossing over
none	none	 as it had indeed been glossed over by the sudden shock with which they had forced that scene upon him or failing in that they had counted on the fact that his or any other man s nerve would have failed when it came to open defiance 
2309-152159-0017	train-other-500	based on a supposition which might after all be wrong and being wrong meant death But it was not supposition Either he was right now or these men were childish immature fools and whatever else they might be
2309-152159-0018	train-other-500	they were not that NOT A SINGLE DROP OF POISON HAD PASSED THE CHAUFFEUR S LIPS The man had not been murdered in that room He had not in a sense been murdered at all The man absolutely unquestionably without a loophole for doubt
2309-152159-0019	train-other-500	had either been killed outright in the automobile accident
none	none	 or had died immediately afterward 
2309-152159-0020	train-other-500	probably without regaining consciousness certainly without supplying any of the information that was so determinedly sought Yes he saw it now Their backs were against the wall they were at their wits end these men The knowledge that the chauffeur possessed
2309-152159-0021	train-other-500	that they KNEW he possessed was evidently life and death to them To kill the man before they had wormed out of him what they wanted to know
none	none	 or at least until by holding him a prisoner they had exhausted every means at their command to make him speak was the last thing they would do Jimmie Dale sat for a long time quite motionless The car was speeding at a terrific rate along a straight stretch of road He could almost have sworn guided by some intuitive sense that they were in the country Well even if it were so what did that prove They might have started FROM New York itself only to return to it when they had satisfied themselves that he was sufficiently duped Or they might have started legitimately from outside New York and be going toward the city now Since the ultimate destination was New York and they had made no attempt to hide that from him it was useless to speculate for at best 
2309-152159-0022	train-other-500	it could be only speculation He had decided that once before The man at his side felt again over the scarf to see that it was in place
none	none	 Curiously now Jimmie Dale recalled the inward monitor that had warned him the honours had not all been his in this first round with the Crime Club to night 
2309-152159-0023	train-other-500	If they had deliberately murdered the chauffeur because of a refusal to answer
none	none	 they would equally have done the same to him 
2309-152159-0024	train-other-500	Fool that he had been not to have seen that before And yet would it have made any difference He shook his head
none	none	 He could not have acted to any better advantage than he had done He could not his lips curled in grim derision have been any more convincing Convincing It was all clear enough now 
2309-152159-0025	train-other-500	If the chauffeur had suffered death rather than talk even admitting the fact that they had more grounds for suspecting the chauffeur s complicity would his Jimmie Dale s mere denial his choice too of death
none	none	 have been any the more convincing or have saved his life 
2309-152159-0026	train-other-500	where it had not saved the other s A certain added respect for these men against whom until the end now his victory or theirs he realised he was fighting for his life came over him as he recognised the touch of a master hand
2309-152159-0027	train-other-500	They did not know where to find the Tocsin the package that she had said was vital to them was still beyond their reach the chauffeur was dead and he Jimmie Dale alone remained a clew that they had still to prove valid or invalid it was true
2309-152159-0028	train-other-500	but the only clew in their possession And gaining nothing from him by a show of force to throw him off his guard they had let him go meaning him to believe they were convinced he knew nothing and that the episode
2309-152159-0029	train-other-500	the adventure of the night was as far as they were concerned ended finished and done with Time passed a very long time as he sat there It might have been an hour he could only hazard a guess Not one of the men in the car had spoken a word
2309-152159-0030	train-other-500	But to Jimmie Dale the car itself the ride its duration these three strange companions were for the time being extraneous Even that sick giddiness in his head had at least temporarily gone from him
2309-152159-0031	train-other-500	And so all unsuspectingly he was to lead them to the Tocsin and fall into the trap himself His hands thrust deep in his pockets were tightly clenched They were clever enough
none	none	 ingenious enough powerful enough to watch him henceforth at every turn and from now on day and night they were to be reckoned with Suppose that in some way as it might well have happened for it was now vitally necessary that she should communicate with him 
2309-152159-0032	train-other-500	and he with her he had played blindly into their hands and through him she should have fallen into their power
none	none	 It brought a sickening chill a sort of hideous panic to Jimmie Dale 
2309-152159-0033	train-other-500	and then fury anger
none	none	 in a torrent surged upon him and there came a merciless desire to crush 
2309-152159-0034	train-other-500	to strangle to stamp out this inhuman band of criminals that with intolerable effrontery
none	none	 to the laws of God and man were so elaborately and scientifically equipped 
2309-152159-0035	train-other-500	for their monstrous purposes And then Jimmie Dale in the darkness smiled again grimly as the leader s reference to the Gray Seal recurred to him Well perhaps who knew they would have reason more than they dreamed of to wish the Gray Seal enrolled in their own ranks
2309-152159-0036	train-other-500	It was strange curious He had thought all that was ended Only a few short hours before he had hidden away all everything that was incident to the life of the Gray Seal the clothes of Larry the Bat
2309-152159-0037	train-other-500	that little metal case with the gray coloured adhesive seals a dozen other things believing that it only remained for him to return and destroy them at his leisure as a finishing touch to the Gray Seal s career
none	none	 and now instead he was face to face with the gravest and most dangerous problem 
2309-152159-0038	train-other-500	that she had ever called upon him to undertake
none	none	 Well at least the odds were not all in the Crime Club s favour 
2309-152159-0039	train-other-500	Where they now certainly believed him to be entirely off his guard he was thoroughly on his guard and where they might suspect him watch him they would suspect and watch only the character the person of Jimmie Dale
2309-152159-0040	train-other-500	and count not at all upon either Larry the Bat or the Gray Seal A sort of savage elation fell upon Jimmie Dale His brain that had been stagnant confused physically sick with pain and suffering was working now with its old time vigour
2309-152159-0041	train-other-500	and ease mapping planning scheming the way ahead To strike and strike quickly to strike FIRST It must be his move next not theirs And he must act to night at once the moment he was given this pretence to liberty
2309-152159-0042	train-other-500	that they had in store for him before they had an opportunity of closing down around him with a network of spies that he could not elude By morning Jimmie Dale would be Larry the Bat and inhabiting the Sanctuary again And a tip to Jason his old butler
2309-152159-0043	train-other-500	to the effect say that he had gone away for a trip would account for his disappearance satisfactorily enough it would not necessarily arouse their suspicions when they eventually discovered he was gone
none	none	 for against that was always the possible and quite likely presumption that where they had succeeded in nothing else they had at least succeeded in frightening him thoroughly and to the extent of imbuing him with a hasty desire to put a safe distance between himself and them 
2309-152159-0044	train-other-500	And now with his mind made up to his course of action
none	none	 an intense impatience to put his plan into effect 
2309-152159-0045	train-other-500	an irritation at the useless twistings and turnings of the car that had latterly become more frequent took hold upon him How much longer was this to last They must have been fully an hour and a half on the road already and ah the car was stopping now
2309-152159-0046	train-other-500	He straightened up in his seat as the machine came to a halt but the man at his side laid a restraining hand upon him The car door opened and one of the men got out Jimmie Dale caught an indistinct murmur of voices from without
none	none	 then the man returned to his seat and the car went on again Another half hour passed that curbing his irritation and impatience was filled with the conjectures and questions that anew came crowding in upon his mind Why had the car made that stop It was rather curious It was certainly a prearranged meeting place Why And these clothes that he now wore why had they made him change His own had not been very badly torn The reason given him was on the face of it now in view of what he now knew mere pretence 
2309-152159-0047	train-other-500	What was the ulterior motive behind that pretence What did this package that had already cost a man his life to night contain Who was the chauffeur
none	none	 What was this death feud between the Tocsin and these men Did she know where the Crime Club was Who and where was John Johansson What was this box that was numbered four hundred twenty eight 
2309-152159-0048	train-other-500	Could she supply the links that would forge the chain into an unbroken whole And then for the second time the car slowed down and this time the man on the seat beside Jimmie Dale reached up and untied the scarf
none	none	 You get out here said the man tersely CHAPTER VI THE TRAP Had it not been for the stop the car had previously made for the possibility that he might have obtained a glimpse outside when the door had been opened the scarf over his eyes would have been superfluous for now with it removed he could scarcely distinguish the forms of the three men around him 
2309-152160-0000	train-other-500	since the window curtains of the car were tightly drawn
none	none	 Nor was he given the opportunity to do more even had it been possible 
2309-152160-0001	train-other-500	The car stopped the door was opened he was pushed toward it
none	none	 and even as he reached the ground the door was closed behind him and the car was speeding on again But where he could not see before it took now but a glance to obtain his bearings 
2309-152160-0002	train-other-500	he was standing on a corner on Riverside Drive within a few doors of his own house
none	none	 Jimmie Dale stood still for a moment watching the car as it disappeared rapidly up the Drive And with a sort of grim facetiousness his brain began to correlate time and distance Where had he come from 
2309-152160-0003	train-other-500	Where was this Crime Club They had been as nearly as he could estimate two hours in making the journey
none	none	 and as nearly as he could estimate in their turnings and twistings had covered at least twice the distance that would be represented by a direct route 
2309-152160-0004	train-other-500	Granting then an average speed of forty miles an hour which was overgenerous to be on the safe side and the fact that they certainly had not crossed the Hudson which now lay before him flanking the Drive the Crime Club was somewhere within the area of a semicircle
2309-152160-0005	train-other-500	whose centre was the corner on which he now stood and whose radius was forty miles OR FORTY YARDS He forced a laugh It was just that no more no less
none	none	 he was as likely to have started on his ride from within a biscuit throw of where he now stood as to have started on it from miles away But he aroused himself with a start he was wasting time It must be very late near morning and he would have need for every moment that was left between now and daylight He turned walked quickly to his house 
2309-152160-0006	train-other-500	mounted the steps and with his latch key they had at least permitted him to retain the contents of his pockets when they had forced him to change his clothes opened the front door softly and stepping inside closed the door as silently as he had opened it He paused for an instant to listen
2309-152160-0007	train-other-500	There was not a sound The servants naturally would have been in bed hours ago Even old Jason Jimmie Dale smiled half whimsically half affectionately whose paternal custom it was to sit up for his Master Jim
2309-152160-0008	train-other-500	who as he was fond of saying he had dandled as a baby on his knee had evidently given it up as a bad job on this occasion
none	none	 and had turned in himself Jason however had left the light burning here in the big reception hall 
2309-152160-0009	train-other-500	Jimmie Dale stepped to the switch and turned off the light then stood hesitant in the darkness
none	none	 Was there anything to be gained by rousing Jason now and telling him what he intended to do to instruct him to answer any inquiries by the statement that mister Dale had gone away for a trip He could trust Jason Jason already knew much more than one of those mysterious letters of the Tocsin s had passed through Jason s hands Jimmie Dale shook his head No he could communicate with Jason from downtown in the morning He had half expected to find Jason up and in that case would have taken the other as far as necessary into his confidence but it was not a matter that pressed for the moment He could get into touch with Jason at any time readily enough Was there anything else before he went He would not be able to get back as easily as he got out 
2309-152160-0010	train-other-500	Money He shook his head again a little grimly this time
none	none	 He had been caught once before as Larry the Bat without funds 
2309-152160-0011	train-other-500	There was plenty of money now hidden in the Sanctuary enough for any emergency enough to last him indefinitely He stepped forward along the hall his tread noiseless on the rich heavy rug passed into the rear of the house descended the back stairs
2309-152160-0012	train-other-500	and reached the cellar It was below the level of the ground of course but a narrow window here
none	none	 though quite large enough to permit of egress 
2309-152160-0013	train-other-500	gave on the driveway at the side of the house that led to the garage in the rear Cautiously now for the cement flooring was in the stillness little less than a sounding board Jimmie Dale reached the wall
none	none	 and felt along it to the window 
2309-152160-0014	train-other-500	the lower edge of whose sill was just slightly below the level of his shoulder It opened inward if he remembered correctly His fingers were feeling for the fastenings It was too dark to see a thing He muttered in annoyance Where were the fastenings At the sides or at the bottom
none	none	 His hand began to make a circuit of the sill and then suddenly with a low sharp cry he leaned forward 
2309-152160-0015	train-other-500	WHAT DID THIS MEAN Wires
none	none	 No wires had ever been there before 
2309-152160-0016	train-other-500	His fingers were working now with feverish haste telegraphing their message to his brain
none	none	 The wires ran through the sill close to the corner of the wall 
2309-152160-0017	train-other-500	tiny fragments of wood as from an auger were still on the sill and here was a small particle of wire insulation that those sensitive finger tips proclaimed was FRESH A cold thrill ran through Jimmie Dale and there came again that sickening sense of impotency
none	none	 in the face of the malignant 
2309-152160-0018	train-other-500	devilish cunning arrayed against him that once before he had experienced that night
none	none	 He had thought to forestall them 
2309-152160-0019	train-other-500	and he had been forestalled himself This could only have been done they had had no interest in him before then while they held him at the Crime Club while he was spending that two hours in the car Was that why they had taken so long in coming
2309-152160-0020	train-other-500	Was that why the car had stopped that time that those with him might be told that the work here had been completed and he need no longer be kept away He edged away from the window and as cautiously as he had come retraced his steps across the cellar and up the stairs
2309-152160-0021	train-other-500	and then the possibility of being heard from without gone he broke into a run There was no need to wonder long what those wires meant They could mean only one of two things and the Crime Club would have little concern in his electric light THEY HAD TAPPED HIS TELEPHONE
2309-152160-0022	train-other-500	The mains he knew ran into the cellar from the underground service in the street He was racing like a madman now How long ago how many hours ago had they done that Great Scott SHE was to have telephoned Had she done so
2309-152160-0023	train-other-500	Was the game all everything she herself at their mercy already If she had telephoned
none	none	 Jason would have left a message on his desk 
2309-152160-0024	train-other-500	he would look there first afterward he would waken Jason He gained the door of his den on the first landing
none	none	 a room that ran the entire length of one side of the house from front to rear burst in switched on the light and stood stock still in amazement 
2309-152160-0025	train-other-500	Jason he cried out The old butler fully dressed
none	none	 rubbing and blinking his eyes at the light and with a startled cry rose up from the depths of a lounging chair Jason exclaimed Jimmie Dale again I beg pardon sir Master Jim stammered the man I I must have fallen asleep sir Jason what are you doing here 
2309-152160-0026	train-other-500	Jimmie Dale demanded sharply Well sir said Jason
none	none	 still fumbling for his words it it was 
2309-152160-0027	train-other-500	the telephone sir The TELEPHONE Yes sir A woman begging your pardon Master Jim a lady sir has been telephoning every hour or so and she YES
none	none	 Jimmie Dale had jumped across the room and had caught the other fiercely by the shoulder 
2309-152160-0028	train-other-500	Yes yes What did she say QUICK man Good Lord Master Jim faltered Jason I she Jason said Jimmie Dale suddenly as cold as ice what did she say Think man Every word
2309-152160-0029	train-other-500	She didn t say anything Master Jim Nothing at all sir except to keep asking each time if she could speak to you Nothing else Jason
none	none	 No sir You are SURE 
2309-152160-0030	train-other-500	I m sure Master Jim
none	none	 Not another thing but that sir just as I ve told you Thank God said Jimmie Dale in a low voice 
2309-152160-0031	train-other-500	Yes sir said Jason mechanically How long ago was it since she telephoned last asked Jimmie Dale quickly Well sir I couldn t rightly say You see as I said Master Jim I must have gone to sleep but
2309-152160-0032	train-other-500	They were staring tensely into each other s face The telephone on the desk was ringing vibrantly clamourously through the stillness of the room Jason white frightened bewildered touched his lips with the tip of his tongue
2309-152160-0033	train-other-500	That ll be her again sir he said hoarsely Wait said Jimmie Dale tersely He was trying to think to think faster than he had ever thought before
none	none	 He could not tell Jason to say that he had not yet come in 
2309-152160-0034	train-other-500	THEY knew he was in it would be but showing his hand to that some one who would be listening now on the wire He dared not speak to her or above all allow her to expose herself by a single inadvertent word
none	none	 He dared not speak to her and she was here now 
2309-152160-0035	train-other-500	calling him He could not speak to her and it was life and death almost that she should know
none	none	 what had happened 
2309-152160-0036	train-other-500	life and death almost for both of them that he should know all and everything she could tell him
none	none	 True it would take but a minute to run to the cellar and cut those wires while Jason held her on the pretence of calling him Jimmie Dale to the phone 
2309-152160-0037	train-other-500	only a minute to cut those wires
none	none	 and in so doing advertise to these fiends 
2309-152160-0038	train-other-500	the fact that he had discovered their trick admit as though in so many words that their suspicions of him were justified
none	none	 lay himself open to some new move that he could not hope to foresee and paramount to all else rob her and himself of this master trump the Crime Club had placed in his hands 
2309-152160-0039	train-other-500	by means of which there was a chance that he could hoist them with their own petard The telephone rang again imperatively persistently Listen Jason Jimmie Dale was speaking rapidly earnestly
none	none	 Say that I ve come in and have gone to bed 
2309-152160-0040	train-other-500	in a vile humour That you told me a lady had been calling but that I said if she called again I wasn t to be disturbed
none	none	 if it was the Queen of Sheba herself that I wouldn t answer any phone to night for anybody Do you understand No argument with her just that Now answer 
2309-152160-0041	train-other-500	Jason lifted the receiver from the hook Yes hello he said Yes ma am mister Dale has come in but he has retired Yes I told him but begging your pardon ma am
2309-152160-0042	train-other-500	he was in what I might say was a bit of a temper and said he wasn t to be disturbed by any one Jimmie Dale snatched the receiver from Jason and put it to his own ear Kindly tell mister Dale that unless he comes to the phone now a feminine voice her voice
2309-152160-0043	train-other-500	in well simulated indignation was saying it will be a very long day before I shall trouble myself to Jimmie Dale clapped his hand firmly over the mouthpiece of the instrument Thank God for that clever brain of hers She understood
none	none	 Repeat what you said before Jason he instructed hurriedly 
2309-152160-0044	train-other-500	Then say Good night He removed his hand from the mouthpiece It s quite useless ma am said Jason apologetically In the rare temper he was in he wouldn t come to use his own words ma am not for the Queen of Sheba herself ma am
2309-152160-0045	train-other-500	Good night ma am Jimmie Dale hung the receiver back on the hook and with his hand flirted away a bead of moisture that had sprung to his forehead Good Lord Master Jim what s wrong sir What s happened sir
none	none	 And and those clothes Master Jim sir They aren t the ones you went out in sir they aren t yours at all sir 
2309-152160-0046	train-other-500	Jason ventured anxiously Jason said Jimmie Dale switch off the light and go to the front window and look out Keep well behind the curtains Don t show yourself Tell me if you see anything Yes sir said Jason obediently The light went out
2309-152160-0047	train-other-500	Jimmie Dale moved to the rear of the room to the window overlooking the garage and yard I don t see anything sir Jason called Watch Jimmie Dale answered A minute passed two three
2309-152160-0048	train-other-500	Jimmie Dale was staring down into the black of the yard She understood She knew of course before she phoned that something had gone wrong to night She knew that only peril of the gravest moment would have kept him from the phone and her She knew now
2309-152160-0049	train-other-500	as a logical conclusion that it was dangerous to attempt to communicate with him at his home Those wires Where did they lead to Not far away that would be almost a mechanical impossibility
none	none	 Was it into the Crime Club itself near at hand 
2309-152160-0050	train-other-500	Or the basement say of that apartment house across the driveway Or where And then Jimmie Dale spoke again
none	none	 Do you see anything Jason 
2309-152160-0051	train-other-500	I m not sure sir Jason answered hesitantly I thought I saw a man move behind a tree out there across the road a minute ago sir
none	none	 Yes sir there he is again 
2309-152160-0052	train-other-500	There was a thin mirthless smile on Jimmie Dale s lips
none	none	 Below in the shadow of the garage a dark form like a deeper shadow stirred 
2309-152160-0053	train-other-500	and was still again What time is it Jason Jimmie Dale asked presently It ll be about half past four sir Go to bed Jason Yes sir but Jason s voice low troubled came through the darkness from the upper end of the room
2309-152160-0054	train-other-500	Master Jim sir I Go to bed Jason and not a word of this Yes sir Good night Master Jim Good night Jason Jimmie Dale groped his way to the big lounging chair in which he had found Jason asleep and flung himself into it
2309-152160-0055	train-other-500	They had struck quickly these ingenious dress suited murderers of the Crime Club The house was already watched would be watched now untiringly unceasingly not a movement of his henceforth but would be under their eyes
2309-152160-0056	train-other-500	His hands resting on the arms of the chair closed slowly until they became tight clenched knotted fists What was he to do It was not only the Crime Club it was not only the Tocsin and her peril
none	none	 there was the underworld snapping and snarling at his heels there was the police dogged and sullen ever on the trail of the Gray Seal 
2309-152160-0057	train-other-500	His life even before this in his fight against the underworld and the police had depended upon his freedom of action and now at one and the same time that freedom was cut away from beneath his feet as it were and a third foe
2309-152160-0058	train-other-500	equally as deadly as the others was added to the list For months to preserve and sustain the character of Larry the Bat
none	none	 he had been forced to assume the role almost daily 
2309-152160-0059	train-other-500	for in that sordid empire below the dead line whose one common bond and aim was the Gray Seal s death where suspicion one of the other was rampant and extravagant where each might be the one against whom all swore their vengeance
2309-152160-0060	train-other-500	Larry the Bat could not mysteriously disappear from his accustomed haunts without inviting suspicion in an active and practical form an inquisitorial visit to his squalid lodgings the Sanctuary and the end of Larry the Bat
2309-152160-0061	train-other-500	If as he had thought only a few hours before he was through forever with his dual life that would not have mattered
none	none	 the underworld would have been welcome to make what it chose of it but now the preservation of the character of Larry the Bat was more vital and necessary to him than it had ever been before It was a means of defense and offense against these men who lurked now outside his doors It was the sole means now of communication with her for warned both by Jason s words 
2309-152160-0062	train-other-500	and what must be an obvious fact to her that their plans had miscarried that it was dangerous to communicate with him as Jimmie Dale she would expect him count on him to make that move
none	none	 There would be no longer either reason or attempt on her part to maintain the mystery with which she had heretofore surrounded herself the crisis had come 
2309-152160-0063	train-other-500	she would be watching waiting hoping seeking for him more anxiously and with far more at stake than he had ever sought for her until now He got up impulsively from his chair and in the blackness began to pace the room
2309-152160-0064	train-other-500	The next move was clear pitifully clear it had been clear from the first it had been clear even in that ride in the car it was so clear that it seemed veritably to mock him as he prodded his brains for some means of putting it into execution
2309-152160-0065	train-other-500	He must get to the Sanctuary become Larry the Bat but how HOW The question seemed at last to become resonant to ring through the room with the weight of doom upon it Schemes plans ideas came
2309-152160-0066	train-other-500	bringing a momentary uplift only to be discarded the next instant with a sort of bitter desperate regret These men were not men of mere ordinary intelligence
2309-152160-0067	train-other-500	their cleverness their power the amazing scope of their organisation all bore grim witness to the fact that they would be blinded not at all by any paltry ruse
none	none	 He could walk out of the house in the morning as Jimmie Dale without apparent hindrance 
2309-152160-0068	train-other-500	that was obvious enough And so long as he pursued the usual avocations of Jimmie Dale he would not be interfered with only WATCHED It was useless to consider that plan for a moment
none	none	 It would not help him to reach the Sanctuary without leading them there behind him True there was always the chance that he might shake them off his trail 
2309-152160-0069	train-other-500	but he could hardly hope to accomplish anything like that without their knowing that it was done DELIBERATELY and that he dared not risk
none	none	 The strongest weapon in his hands now was his secret knowledge that he was being watched That telephone there for instance that most curiously kept on insisting in his mind that it and it alone was the way out was the last thing he could place in jeopardy 
2309-152160-0070	train-other-500	Besides there was another reason why such a plan would not do for granting even that he succeeded in eluding them on the way and managed to reach the Sanctuary
none	none	 his freedom of action would be so restricted and limited as to be practically worthless 
2309-152160-0071	train-other-500	he would have to return to his home here again within a reasonable time as Jimmie Dale within a few hours at most
none	none	 or again they would be in possession of the fact that he had discovered their surveillance That it was true had been his original plan 
2309-152160-0072	train-other-500	when he had entered the house half an hour previously
none	none	 but it was an entirely different matter now 
2309-152160-0073	train-other-500	Then he had counted on GETTING AWAY without their knowing it before they as he had fondly thought would have had a chance to establish their espionage
none	none	 and when they would have had no reason to suspect 
2309-152160-0074	train-other-500	for a time at least that he was not still within the house when they would have been watching as it were an empty cage He stopped in his walk and after a moment dropped down into the lounging chair again That was it of course An empty cage If he could escape from the house
none	none	 Not so much without their seeing him that was more or less a mechanical detail 
2309-152160-0075	train-other-500	But escape and leave them in possession of a sort of guarantee or assurance that he was still there That would give him the freedom of action that he must have He smiled with bitter irony That solved the problem That was all there was to it just that
2309-152160-0076	train-other-500	It was very simple exceedingly simple it was only impossible
none	none	 The smile left his lips and once more his hands clenched fiercely No it was not impossible It MUST be done if he was to win through if he was even to save himself It must be done or FAIL her It COULD be done there was a way if he could only see it CHAPTER VII THE HOUR As the minutes passed many of them Jimmie Dale sat there motionless staring before him at the desk that was faintly outlined in the unlighted room Then somewhere in the house a clock struck the hour Five o clock He raised his head YES It could be done There was a way He had the germ of it now And now the plan began to grow to take form and shape in his mind to dovetail to knit the integral parts into a comprehensive whole There was a way but he must have assistance Jason yes assuredly Benson his chauffeur yes equally as trustworthy as Jason Benson was devoted to him and moreover Benson was young alert daring cool He had had more than one occasion to test Benson s resourcefulness and nerve Jimmie Dale rose abruptly went to the rear window and parting the curtains cautiously stood peering down into the courtyard Yes it was feasible even a little more than feasible The garage fronted the driveway of course to give free entrance and egress to the cars but where the wall of the garage and the rear wall of the house overlapped as it were the space between them was not much more than ten yards and here the shadows of the two walls mingling lay like a black impenetrable pathway not like that other shadow he had seen moving at the side of the garage and that if not for the moment discernible was none the less surely still lurking there Satisfied Jimmie Dale swung briskly from the window and going now to his bedroom across the hall undressed and went to bed but not to sleep There would be time enough to sleep all day if he wished now there were still the little details to be thought out that more than anything else could make or wreck his plans A point overdone the faintest suggestion of a false note where men of the calibre of those against whom he was now fighting for his life were concerned would not only make his scheme abortive but would place him utterly at their mercy It was nine o clock when he rang for Jason Jason he said abruptly as the other entered I want you to telephone for Doctor Merlin The doctor sir exclaimed the old man anxiously You re you re not ill Master Jim sir Do I look ill Jason inquired Jimmie Dale gravely Well sir admitted Jason in concern a bit done up sir perhaps A little pale sir though I m sure I m glad to hear it said Jimmie Dale sitting up in bed The worse I look the better I I beg pardon sir stammered Jason Jason said Jimmie Dale gravely again you have had reason to know that on several occasions my life has been threatened It is threatened now You know from last night that this house is now watched You may or you may not have surmised that our telephone wires have been tapped Tapped sir Jason s face had gone a little gray Yes a party line so to speak said Jimmie Dale grimly Do you understand You must be careful to say no more no less than exactly what I tell you to say Now go and telephone Ask the doctor to come over and see me this morning Simply say that I am not feeling well but that apart from being apparently in a very nervous condition you do not know what is the matter Yes sir good Lord sir gasped Jason and left the room to carry out his orders An hour later Doctor Merlin had been and gone and had left two prescriptions one written the other verbal With the written one Benson in his chauffeur s livery was dispatched to the drug store the verbal one was precisely what Jimmie Dale had expected from the fussy old family physician Two or three days of quiet in the house James and if you need me again let me know Now Jason said Jimmie Dale when the old man had returned from ushering Doctor Merlin from the house our friends out there will be anxious to learn the verdict I was to dine with the Ross Hendersons to morrow night was I not Yes sir I think so sir Make sure said Jimmie Dale Look in my engagement book there on the table Jason looked Yes sir that s right he announced Very good said Jimmie Dale softly Now go and telephone again Jason Present my regrets and excuses to the Ross Hendersons and say that under the doctor s orders I am confined to the house for the next few days and Jason Yes sir When Benson returns with the medicine let him bring it here himself and I shall want you as well Jimmie Dale propped himself up a little wearily on the pillows as Jason went out of the room After all his condition was not entirely feigned He was as a matter of fact pretty well played out both mentally and physically Certainly that he should require a doctor and be confined to the house could not arouse suspicion even in the minds of those alert aristocratic thugs of the Crime Club prone as they would be to suspect anything a man who had been knocked unconscious in an automobile smash the night before had been in a fight had been subjected to a terrific mental shock to say nothing of the infernal drug that had been administered to him might well be expected to be indisposed the next morning and for several mornings following that It might indeed even cause them to relax their vigilance for the time being though he dared build nothing on that Well he had only to coach Benson and Jason in the parts they were to play and the balance of the morning and all the afternoon was his in which to rest He reached over to the table picked up a pencil and paper and began to jot down memoranda He had just tossed the pencil back on the table as the two men entered Jason at a sign closed the door quietly Jimmie Dale looked at Benson half musingly half whimsically for a moment before he spoke Benson he said the back seat of the large touring car is hinged and lifts up once the cushion is removed doesn t it Yes sir Benson answered promptly And there s space enough for say a man inside isn t there Why yes sir I suppose so at a squeeze Benson stared blankly Quite so said Jimmie Dale calmly Now another matter Benson I believe some chauffeurs have a habit when occasion lends itself of taking shall we say their best girl out riding in their masters machines SOME might Benson replied a little stiffly I hope you don t think sir that One moment Benson The point is it s done quite generally Yes sir And you have a best girl or at least could find one for such a purpose if you were so inclined Yes sir said Benson but Very good Jimmie Dale interrupted Then to night Benson taking advantage of my illness and to morrow night and the nights after that until further notice you will acquire and put into practice that reprehensible habit I I don t understand mister Dale No I dare say not said Jimmie Dale and then the whimsicality dropped from him Benson he said slowly do you remember a night nearly four years ago the first night you ever saw me You had indiscreetly I think displayed more money than was wise in that East Side neighbourhood I remember said Benson with a sudden start then simply I wouldn t be here now sir if it hadn t been for you Well said Jimmie Dale quietly the tables are turned to day Benson As Jason already knows this house is watched For reasons that I cannot explain I am in great danger Bluntly I am putting my life in your hands and Jason s Benson looked for an instant from Jimmie Dale to Jason caught the strained troubled expression on the old man s face then back again at Jimmie Dale D ye mean that sir he cried Then you can count on me mister Dale to the last ditch I know that Benson Jimmie Dale said softly And now both of you listen It is imperative that I should get away from the house and equally imperative that those watching should believe that I am still here Not even the servants are to be permitted a suspicion that I am not here in my bed ill That Jason is your task You will allow no one to wait on me but yourself you will bring the meal trays up regularly and eat the food yourself You will answer all inquiries telephone and otherwise in person I am not seeing any one You understand perfectly Jason I understand Master Jim You need have no fear sir on that score Now you Benson Jimmie Dale went on A few minutes ago I sent you out in your chauffeur s togs with that prescription You were undoubtedly observed I wanted you to be It was quite necessary that they should know and be able to recognise you again to disabuse their minds later on of the possibility that I might be masquerading in your clothes and also of course that they should know who you were and what your position was in the household Very well To night at eight o clock exactly you are to go out from the back door of the house to the garage On the way out it will be quite dark then I want you to drop something say a bunch of keys that you had been jingling in your hand You are to experience some difficulty in finding it again move about a little to force any one that may be lurking by the garage to retreat around the corner Grumble a bit and make a little noise but you are not to overdo it a couple of minutes at the outside is enough by that time I shall be under the car seat You will then run the machine out to the street and stop at the curb jump out and as though you had forgotten something hurry back to the garage You must not be away long enough only to permit say a passer by to glance into the car and satisfy himself that it is empty You understand of course Benson that the hood must be down no closed car to invite even the suggestion of concealment that would be a fatal blunder Drive then to the young lady s home by as direct a route as you can give no appearance of being aware that you are followed as you will be and much less the appearance of attempting to elude pursuit Act naturally Between here and your destination I will manage readily enough to leave the car You will then take the young lady for her drive that is what they will be interested in your motive for going out to night And as I said take her driving again on each succeeding night establish the HABIT to their satisfaction Jimmie Dale paused glanced at the paper which he still held in his hand then handed it to Benson Just one thing more Benson he said Listed on that paper you will find a different rendezvous for each night for the next five nights excluding to night which after you have returned the young lady to her home you are to pass by on your way back here See that your drive is always over in time for you to pass each night s rendezvous at half past eleven sharp Don t stop unless I signal you If I am not there go right on home and be at the next place on the following night I am fairly well satisfied they will not bother about you after to night or to morrow night at the most but for all that you must take no chances so except in the route you take in going to the young lady s always avoid covering the same ground twice which might give the appearance of having some ulterior purpose in view even in your drives vary your runs Is this clear Benson Yes sir said Benson earnestly Very well then said Jimmie Dale Eight o clock to the dot Benson compare your time with Jason s And now Jason see that I get a chance to sleep until dinner time to night The hours that followed were hours of sound and much needed sleep for Jimmie Dale and from which he awoke only on Jason s entrance that evening with the dinner tray I ve slept like a log Jason he cried briskly as he leaped out of bed Anything new anything happened No sir not a thing Jason answered Only Master Jim sir the old man twisted his hands nervously I you ll excuse my saying so sir I do hope you ll be careful to night sir I can t help being afraid that something ll happen to you Master Jim Nonsense Jason Jimmie Dale laughed cheerfully There s nothing going to happen to me You go ahead now and stay with the servants and get them out of the road at the proper time He bathed dressed ate his dinner and was slipping cartridges into the magazine of his automatic when within a minute or two of eight o clock Jason s whisper came from the doorway It s all clear now Master Jim sir Right Jimmie Dale responded and followed Jason down the stairway and to the head of the cellar stairs Here Jason halted God keep you Master Jim said the old man huskily Good night Jason Jimmie Dale answered softly and with a reassuring squeeze on the other s arm went on down to the cellar Here he moved quickly noiselessly across to the window not the window of the night before but another of the same description almost directly beneath the one in his den above that faced the garage and lay in the line of that black shadow path between the two buildings Deftly cautiously without sound a half inch an inch at a time he opened it He stood listening then A minute passed Then he heard Benson open and shut the back door then Benson in the yard and then Benson s voice in a muttered and irritable growl talking to himself as he stamped around on the ground With a lithe agile movement Jimmie Dale pulled himself up and through the window and began to creep rapidly on hands and knees toward the garage It was dark intensely dark He could barely distinguish Benson s form though as he passed the other the slight sounds he made drowned out by the chauffeur s angry mumblings he could have reached out and touched Benson easily He gained the interior of the garage and as Benson came on again stepped lightly into the car lifted the seat and wriggled his way inside It was close stuffy abominably cramped but Jimmie Dale was smiling grimly now Thanks to Benson there wasn t a possibility that he had been seen He both felt and heard Benson start the car Then the car moved forward ran the length of the driveway bumped slightly as it made the street and stopped He heard Benson jump out and run back and then he listened intently and the grim smile flickered on his lips again Came the sound of a footstep on the sidewalk close beside the car then silence the car shook a little as though some one s weight was on the step then the footsteps receded Benson returned on the run and the car started forward once more Perhaps ten minutes passed Three times the car had swerved sharply making a corner turn Then Jimmie Dale pushed up the seat and protected from observation from behind by the back of the car itself crawled out and crouched down on the floor of the tonneau Don t look around Benson he said calmly Are we followed Yes sir Benson answered At least there s always been a car behind us though not the same one They re pretty clever There must be three or four each following the other Every time I turn a corner it s a different car that turns it behind me How far behind Jimmie Dale asked Half a block Slow down a little instructed Jimmie Dale and don t turn another corner until they ve had a chance to accommodate themselves to your new speed You are going too fast for me to jump and I don t want them to notice any change in speed except what is made in plain sight Yes that s better Where are we Benson That s Amsterdam Avenue ahead replied Benson All right said Jimmie Dale quietly Turn into it The more people the better Tell me just as you are about to turn Yes sir said Benson then almost on the instant All ready sir Jimmie Dale s hand reached out for the door catch edged the door ajar the car swerved took the corner and Jimmie Dale stepped out on the running board hung there negligently for a moment as though chatting with Benson and then with an airy good night dropped nonchalantly to the ground and the next instant had mingled with the throng of pedestrians on the sidewalk A half minute later a large gray automobile turned the corner and followed Benson and Jimmie Dale stepping out into the street again swung on a downtown car The road to the Sanctuary was open In his impatience now the street car seemed to drag along every foot of the way but a glance at his watch as he finally reached the Bowery and walking then rapidly approached the cross street a few steps ahead that led to the Sanctuary told him that it was still but a quarter to nine But even at that he quickened his steps a little He was free now There was a sort of savage elemental uplift upon him He was free He could strike now in his own defense and hers In a few moments he would be at the Sanctuary in a few more he would be Larry the Bat and by to morrow at the latest he would see The Tocsin After all that hour was not to be taken from him It was not perhaps the hour that she had meant it should be thought and prayed perhaps that it might be It was not the hour of victory But it was the hour that meant to him the realisation of the years of longing the hour when he should see her see her for the first time face to face when there should be no more barriers between them when Fer Gawd s sake mister buy a pencil A hand was plucking at his sleeve the thin voice was whining in his ear He halted mechanically A woman old bedraggled ragged was thrusting a bunch of cheap pencils imploringly toward him and then with a stifled cry Jimmie Dale leaned forward The eyes that lifted to his for an instant were bright and clear with the vigor of youth great eyes of brown they were and trouble hope fear wistfulness ay and a glorious shyness were in their depths And then the voice he knew so well the Tocsin s was whispering hurriedly I will be waiting here Jimmie for Larry the Bat CHAPTER VIII THE TOCSIN It was only a little way back along the street from the Sanctuary to the corner on the Bowery where as Jimmie Dale he had left her where as Larry the Bat now he was going to meet her again it would take only a moment or so even at Larry the Bat s habitual characteristic slouching gait but it seemed that was all too slow that he must throw discretion to the winds and run the distance His blood was tingling there was elation upon him coupled with an almost childlike dread that she might be gone The Tocsin The Tocsin he kept saying to himself Yes she was still there still whiningly imploring those who passed to buy her miserable pencils and then with a quick flung whisper to him to follow as he slouched up close to her she had started slowly down the street The Tocsin The Tocsin The Tocsin his brain seemed to be ringing with the words ringing with them in a note clear as a silver bell The Tocsin at last The woman who so strangely so wonderfully so mysteriously had entered into his life and possessed it and filled it with a love and yearning that had come to mold and sway and actuate his very existence the woman for whom he had fought for whom he had risked and gladly risked his wealth his name his honour everything the woman for whose sake he the Gray Seal was sought and hounded as the most notorious criminal of the age she whose cleverness whose resourcefulness whose amazing intimacy with the hidden things of the underworld had seemed indeed to border on the supernatural she the Tocsin the woman whose face he had never seen before The woman whose face he had never seen before and who now was that wretched hag that hobbled along the street before him begging whining and importuning the passers by to purchase of her pitiful wares He laughed a little buoyantly He had never pictured a first meeting such as this A hag Yes And one as disreputable in appearance as he himself as Larry the Bat was disreputable But he had seen her eyes Inimitable as was her disguise she could not hide her eyes or hide the pledge they held of the beauty of form and feature beneath the tattered rags and the touch of a master in the make up that brought haggard want and age into the face and dimly he began to divine the source the means by which she had acquired the information that for years had enabled her to plan their coups that had enabled him to execute them under the guise of crime that for years had seemed beyond all human reach Where was she going Where was she taking him But what did it matter The years of waiting were at an end the years of mystery in a few moments now would be mystery no more Ah She had turned from the Bowery and was heading east He shuffled on after her guardedly a half block behind It was well that Jimmie Dale had disappeared that he was Larry the Bat again the neighbourhood was growing more and more one that Jimmie Dale could not long linger in without attracting attention while on the other hand it was the natural environment of such as Larry the Bat and such as she who was leading him now to the supreme moment of his life Yes it was that the fulfillment of the years The thought of it alone filled his mind his soul it brushed aside it blotted out for the time being the danger the peril the deadly menace that hung over them both It was only that she the Tocsin was here only that at last they would be together On she went traversing street after street the direction always trending toward the river until finally she halted before what appeared to be as nearly as he could make out in the almost total darkness of the ill lighted street a small and tumble down self contained dwelling that bordered on what seemed to be an unfenced store yard of some description He drew his breath in sharply She had halted waiting for him to come up with her She was waiting for him WAITING for him It seemed as though he drank of some strange exhilarating elixir he reached her side eagerly and then and then her hand had caught his and she was leading him into the house into a black passage where he could see nothing into a room equally black over whose threshold he stumbled and her voice in a low conscious way with a little tremour a half sob in it that thrilled him with its promise was in his ears We are safe here Jimmie for a little while but oh Jimmie what have I done What have I done to bring you into this only only I was so sure so sure Jimmie that there was nothing more to fear The blood was beating in hammer blows at his temples It seemed all unreal untrue that this moment could be his that it was not a dream a dream which was presently to be snatched from him in a bitter awakening And then he laughed out wildly passionately No it was true it was real Her breath was on his cheek it was a living pulsing hand that was still in his and then soul and mind and body seemed engulfed and lost in a mad ecstasy and she was in his arms crushed to him and he was raining kisses upon her face I love you I love you he was crying hoarsely and over and over again I love you I love you She did not struggle The warm rich lips were yielding to his he could feel the throb the life in the young lithe form against his own She was his his The years the past all were swept away and she was his at last his for always And there came a mighty sense of kingship upon him as though all the world were at his feet and virility and a great glad strength above all other men s and a song was in his soul a song triumphant for she was his You he cried out and strained her to him You he cried again and kissed her lips and her eyelids and her lips again And then her head was buried on his shoulder and she was crying softly but after a moment she raised her hands and laid them upon his face and held them there and because it was dark dared to raise her head as well and her eyes to look into his Then for a long time they stood there so and for a long time neither spoke and then with a little startled broken cry as though the peril and the menace hanging over them forgotten for the moment were thrust like a knife stab suddenly upon her she drew herself away and ran from him and went and got a lamp and lighted it and set it upon the table And Jimmie Dale still standing there watched her How gloriously her eyes shone dimmed and misty with the tears that filled them though they were And there was nothing incongruous in the rags that clothed her in the squalour and poverty of the bare room in the white furrows that the tears had plowed through the grime and make up on her cheeks You wonderful wonderful woman Jimmie Dale whispered She shook her head as though almost in self reproach I am not wonderful Jimmie she said in a low voice I and then she caught his arm and her voice broke a little I ve brought you into this probably to your death Jimmie tell me what happened last night and since then I I ve thought at times to day I should go mad Oh Jimmie there is so much to say to night so much to do if if we are ever to be together for for always Last night Jimmie the telephone I knew there was danger that all had gone wrong what was it His arms were around her shoulders drawing her close to him again I found the wires tapped he said slowly Yes and and the man you met the chauffeur He is dead Jimmie Dale answered gently He felt her hand close with a quick spasmodic clutch upon his arm her face grew white and for a moment she turned away her head And and the package she asked presently I do not know replied Jimmie Dale He did not have it with him he Wait she interrupted quickly We are only wasting time like this Tell me everything everything just as it happened everything from the moment you received my letter And holding her there in his arms softening as best he could the more brutal details he told her And at the end for a little while she was silent then in a strained impulsive way she asked again The chauffeur you are sure you are positive that he is dead Yes said Jimmie Dale grimly I am sure And then the pent up flood of questions burst from his lips Who was the chauffeur The package the box numbered four hundred twenty eight and John Johansson And the Crime Club And the issue at stake The danger the peril that surrounded her And she above all more than anything else about herself her strange life its mystery She checked him with a strangely wistful touch of her finger upon his lips with a queer pathetic shake of her head No Jimmie not that way You would never understand I cannot But I am to know now Surely I am to know NOW he cried a sudden sense of dismay upon him Three years Three years and always the next time I must know now if I am to help you She smiled a little wanly at him as she drew herself away and dropping into a chair placed her elbows on the rickety table cupping her chin in her hands Yes you are to know now she said almost as though she were talking to herself then with a swift intake of her breath impulsively Jimmie Jimmie I had thought that it would be all so different when when you came That that I would have nothing to fear for you for me because it would be all over And now you are here Jimmie and oh thank God for you but I feel to night almost almost as though it were hopeless that that we were beaten Beaten He stepped quickly to the table and sat down and took one of her hands away from her face to hold it in both his own Beaten he laughed out defiantly then playfully soothingly to reassure her Jimmie Dale and Larry the Bat and the Gray Seal and the Tocsin BEATEN And after we have just scored the last trick But we do not hold many trumps Jimmie she answered gravely You have seen something of this Crime Club s power its methods its merciless cruel inhuman cunning and you perhaps think that you understand but you have not begun to grasp the extent of either that power or cunning This horrible organisation has been in existence for many years I do not know how many I only know that the men of whom it is composed are not ordinary criminals that they do not work in the ordinary way to day they set the machinery of fraud deception robbery and murder in motion that ten years from now and perhaps only then will culminate in the final success of their schemes and they play only for enormous stakes But her lips grew set you will see for yourself I must not talk any longer than is necessary we must not take too much time You count on three days before they begin to suspect that all is not right with Jimmie Dale I know them better than you and I give you two days forty eight hours at the outside and possibly far less Jimmie abruptly did you ever hear of Peter LaSalle The capitalist Yes said Jimmie Dale He died a few years ago I know his brother Henry well at the club and all that Do you she said evenly Well the man you know is not Peter LaSalle s brother he is an impostor and one of the Crime Club Not Peter LaSalle s brother Jimmie Dale repeated the words mechanically And suddenly his brain was whirling Vaguely dimly in little memory snatches events not pertinent then vitally significant now came crowding upon him Peter LaSalle had come from somewhere in the West to live in New York and very shortly afterward had died The estate had been worth something over eleven millions And there had been he leaned quickly tensely forward over the table staring at her My God he whispered hoarsely You are not you cannot be the the daughter Peter LaSalle s daughter who disappeared strangely Yes she said quietly I am Marie LaSalle CHAPTER IX THE TOCSIN S STORY LaSalle The old French name That old French inscription on the ring SONNEZ LE TOCSIN Yes he began to understand now She was Marie LaSalle He began to remember more clearly Marie LaSalle They had said she was one of the most beautiful girls who had ever made her entree into New York society But he had never met her as Marie LaSalle never met her until now as the Tocsin in this bare destitute squalid hovel here at bay both of them for their lives He had been away when she had come with her father to New York and on his return there had only been the father s brother in the father s place and she was gone He remembered the furor her disappearance had caused the enormous rewards her uncle had offered in an effort to trace her the thousand and one speculations as to what had become of her and that then gradually as even the most startling and mystifying of events and happenings always do the affair had dropped into oblivion and had been forgotten by the public at least He began to count back Yes it must have been nearly five years ago two years before she as the Tocsin and he as the Gray Seal had formed their amazing and singular partnership that he started suddenly as she spoke I want to tell you in as few words as I can she said abruptly breaking the silence Listen then Jimmie My mother died ten years ago I was little more than a child then Shortly after her death father made a business trip to New York and on the advice of some supposed friends he had a new will drawn up by a lawyer whom they recommended and to whom they introduced him I do not know who those men were The lawyer s name was Travers Hilton Travers She glanced curiously at Jimmie Dale and added quickly He was the chauffeur the man who was killed last night You mean Jimmie Dale burst out you mean that he was but first the will What was in the will It was a very simple will she answered And from the nature of it it was not at all strange that my father should have been willing to have had it drawn by a comparative stranger if that is what you are thinking Summarised in a few words the will left everything to me and appointed my Uncle Henry as my guardian and the sole executor of the estate until I should have reached my twenty fifth birthday It provided for a certain sum each year to be paid to my uncle for his services as executor and at the expiration of the trust period that is when I was twenty five bequeathed to him the sum of one hundred thousand dollars Jimmie Dale nodded Go on he prompted It is hard to tell it in logical sequence she said hesitating a moment So many things seem to overlap each other You must understand a little more about Hilton Travers During the five years following the signing of the will father came frequently to New York and became not only intimate with Travers but so much impressed with the other s cleverness and ability that he kept putting more and more of his business into Travers hands At the end of that five years we moved to New York and father who was then quite an old man retired from all active business and turned over a great many of his personal affairs to Travers to look after for him giving Travers power of attorney in a number of instances So much for Travers Now about my uncle He was my father s only brother in fact they were the only surviving members of their family apart from very distant connections in France from where generations back the family originally came Her hand touched Jimmie Dale s for an instant That ring Jimmie with its crest and inscription is the old family coat of arms Yes he said briefly I surmised as much Strange as it may seem in view of the fact that they had not seen each other for twenty years she went on hurriedly my father and my uncle were more than ordinarily attached to each other Letters passed regularly between them and there was constant talk of one paying the other a visit but the visit never materialised My uncle was somewhere in Australia my father was here and consequently I never saw my uncle He was quite a different type of man from father more restless less settled more rough and ready preferring the outdoor life of the Australian bush to the restrictions of any so called civilisation I imagine Financially I do not think he ever succeeded very well for twice in one way or another he lost every sheep on his ranch and father set him up again and I do not think he could ever have had much of a ranch for I remember once in one of the letters he wrote that he said he had not seen a white man in weeks so he must have lived a very lonely life Indeed at about the time father drew the new will my uncle wrote saying that he had decided to give up sheep running on his own account as it did not pay and to accept a very favourable offer that had been made to him to manage a ranch in New Zealand and his next letter was from the latter country stating that he had carried out his intentions and was well satisfied with the change he had made The long proposed visit still continued to occupy my father s thoughts and on his retirement from business he definitely made up his mind to go out to New Zealand taking me with him In fact the plans were all arranged my uncle expressed unbounded delight in his letters and we were practically on the eve of sailing when a cable came from my uncle telling us to postpone the visit for a few months as he was obliged to make a buying trip for his new employer that would keep him away that length of time and then her fingers that had been abstractedly picking out the lines formed by the grain of the wood in the table top closed suddenly into tight clenched fists and then my father died Jimmie Dale turned away his head There were tears in her eyes The old sense of unreality was strong upon him again He was listening to the Tocsin s story It was strange that he should be doing that that it could be really so It seemed as though magically he had been transported out of the world where for years past he had lived with danger lurking at every turn where men set watch about his house to trap him where the denizens of the underworld yowled like starving beasts to sink their fangs in him where the police were ceaselessly upon his trail to wreak an insensate vengeance upon him it seemed as though he had been transported away from all that to something that he had dreamed might perhaps sometime happen that he had hoped might happen that he had longed for always but now that it was his that it also was full of the sense of the unreal And yet as his mind followed the thread of her story and leaped ahead and vaguely glimpsed what was to come he was conscious in a sort of premonitory way of a vaster peril than any he had ever known as though forces for the moment masked were arrayed against him whose strength and whose malignity were beyond human parallel In what a strange almost incoherent way his brain was working He roused himself a little and looked around him and with a shock the starkness of the room the abject pitiful air of destitution brought home to him with terrific startling force the significance of the scene in which he was playing a part His face set suddenly in hard lines That she should have been brought to assume such a life as this forced out of her environment of wealth and refinement forced in her purity to rub shoulders with the vile the dissolute forced to exist as such a creature amid the crime and vice the wretched horror of the underworld that swirled around her There was anger now upon him burning hot a merciless craving that was a savage hungry lust for vengeance And then she was speaking again Father s death occurred very shortly after my uncle s message advising us to postpone our trip was received On his death Travers very naturally as father s lawyer cabled my uncle to come to New York at once and my uncle replied saying that he was coming by the first steamer She paused again but only for an instant as though to frame her thoughts in words I have told you that I had never seen my uncle that even my father had not seen him for twenty years and I have told you that the man you know as Henry LaSalle is an impostor I am using the word uncle now when I refer to him simply to avoid confusion You are perhaps expecting me to say that I took a distinctive dislike to him from the moment he arrived On the contrary I had every reason to be predisposed toward him and indeed was rather agreeably surprised than otherwise he was not nearly so uncouth and unpolished as somehow I had pictured his life would have made him Do you understand Jimmie He was kind sympathetic and in an apathetic way I liked him I say apathetic because I think that best describes my own attitude toward every one and everything following father s death until THAT NIGHT She rose abruptly from her chair as though a passive position of any kind had suddenly become intolerable Why tell you what my father and I were to each other she cried out in a low passionate voice It seemed as though everything that meant anything had gone out of my life I became worn out nervous and though the days were bad enough the nights were a source of dread I began to suffer from insomnia I could not sleep This was even before my supposed uncle came I used to read for hours and hours in my room after I had gone to bed But she flung out her hand with an impatient gesture there is no need to dwell on that One night about a week after that man had arrived and a little over a month after father had died I was in my room and had finished a book I was reading I remember that it was well after midnight I had not the slightest inclination to sleep I picked up another book and after that another There were plenty in my room but irrationally of course none pleased me I decided to go down to the library not that I think I really expected to find anything that I actually wanted but more because it was an impulse and furnished me for the moment with some definite objective something to do I got up slipped on a dressing gown and went downstairs The lights were all out I was just on the point of switching on those in the reception hall when suddenly it seemed as though I had not strength to lift my hand and I remember that for an instant I grew terribly cold with dread and fear From the room on my right a voice had reached me The door was closed but the voice was raised in an outburst of profanity I I could hear every word If she s out of the way there s no come back the voice snarled I won t listen to anything else Do you hear Why you fool what are you trying to do hand me one Turn everything into cash and divvy and beat it eh And I m the goat and I get caught and get twenty years for stealing trust funds and the rest of you get the coin He swore terribly again Who s taken the risk in this for the last five years There ll be no smart Aleck lawyer tricks there ll be no halfway measures And who are you to dictate She goes out that s safe I inherit as next of kin with no one to dispute it and that s all there is to it I stood there and could not move It was the voice of the man I knew as my uncle My heart seemed to have stopped beating I tried to tell myself that I was dreaming that it was too horrible too incredible to be real that they could not really mean to to MURDER me And then I recognised Hilton Travers voice I am not dictating and you are not serious of course he said with what seemed an uneasy laugh I am only warning you that you are forgetting to take the real Henry LaSalle into account He is bound to hear of this eventually and then Another voice broke in one I did not recognise You re talking too loud both of you Travers doesn t understand but he s to be wised up to night according to orders and The voice became inaudible muffled I could not hear any more I suppose I remained there another three or four minutes too stunned to know what to do and then I ran softly along the hall to the library door The library you understand was at the rear of the room they were in and the two rooms were really one that is there was only an archway between them I cannot tell you what my emotions were I do not know I only know that I kept repeating to myself they are going to kill me they are going to kill me and that it seemed I must try and find out everything everything I could She turned away from the table and began to pace nervously up and down the miserable room Jimmie Dale rose impulsively from his chair but she waved him back again No wait she said Let me finish I crept into the library It took me a long time because I had to be so careful not to make the slightest noise I suppose it was fully six or seven minutes from the time I had first heard my supposed uncle s voice until I had crept far enough forward to be able to see into the room beyond There were three men there The man I knew as my uncle was sitting at one end of the table another had his back toward me and Travers was facing in my direction and I think I never saw so ghastly a face as was Hilton Travers then He was standing up sort of swaying as he leaned with both hands on the table Now then Travers the man whose back was turned to me was saying threateningly you ve got the story now sign those papers It seemed as though Travers could not speak for a moment He kept looking wildly from one to the other He was white to the lips You ve let me in for THIS he said hoarsely at last You devils you devils you devils You ve let me in for murder Both of them Both Peter and his brother MURDERED She stopped abruptly before Jimmie Dale and clutched his arm tightly Jimmie I don t know why I did not scream out Everything went black for a moment before my eyes It was the first suspicion I had had that my father had met with foul play and I But now Jimmie Dale swayed up from his chair Murdered he exclaimed tensely Your father But but I remember perfectly there was no hint of any such thing at the time and never has been since He died from quite natural causes She looked at him strangely He died from inoculation she said Did did you not see something of that laboratory in the Crime Club yourself the night before last enough to understand Good God muttered Jimmie Dale in a startled way then Go on Go on What happened then She passed her hand a little wearily across her eyes and sank down into her chair again Travers she continued picking up the thread of her story had raised his voice and the third man at the table leaned suddenly aggressively toward him Hold your tongue he growled furiously All you re asked to do is sign the papers not talk Travers shook his head I won t he cried out I won t have any hand in another murder in hers My God I won t I won t I tell you It s horrible Look here you fool the man who was posing as my uncle broke in then You re in this too deep to get out now If you know what s good for you you ll do as you re told Jimmie I shall never forget Travers face It seemed to have changed from white to gray and there was horror in his eyes and then he seemed to lose all control of himself shaking his fists in their faces cursing them in utter abandon I m bad he cried I ve gone everything everything but the limit everything but murder I stop there I ll have no more to do with this I m through You you pulled me into this and and I didn t know Well you know now the third man sneered What are you going to do about it I m going to see that no harm comes to Marie LaSalle Travers answered in a dull way The other man now was on his feet and I do not know quite how to express it Jimmie he seemed ominously quiet in both his voice and his movements You d better think that over again Travers he said Do you mean it I mean it Travers said I mean it God help me You may well add that returned the other with an ugly laugh He reached out his hand toward the telephone on the table Do you know what will happen to you if I telephone a certain number and say that you have turned traitor I ll have to take my chances Travers replied doggedly I m through Take them then flung out the other You ll have little time given you to do us any harm Travers did not answer I think he almost expected an attack upon him then from the two men He hesitated a moment then backed slowly toward the door What happened in the next few moments in that room I do not know I stole out of the library I was obsessed with the thought that I must see Travers see him at all costs before he got away from the house I reached the end of the hall as the room door opened and he came out It was dark as I said and I could not see distinctly but I could make out his form He closed the door behind him and then I called his name in a whisper He took a quick step toward me then turned and hurried toward the front door and I thought he was going away but the next instant I understood his ruse He opened the front door shut it again quite loudly and crept back to me Take me somewhere where we will be safe quick he whispered There was only one place where I was sure we would be safe I led him to the rear of the house and up the servants stairs and to my boudoir She broke off abruptly and once more rose from her chair and once more began to pace the room Back in his chair Jimmie Dale tense and motionless now watched her without a word It would take too long to tell you all that passed between us she went on hurriedly The man was frankly a criminal but not to the extent of murder And in that respect at least he was honest with himself Almost the first words he said to me were Miss LaSalle I am as good as a dead man if I am caught by the devils behind those two men downstairs And then he began to plead with me to make my own escape He did not know who the man was that was posing as my uncle had never seen him before until he presented himself as Henry LaSalle the other man he knew as Clarke but knew also that Clarke was merely an assumed name He had fallen in with Clarke almost from the time that he had begun to practise his profession and at Clarke s instigation had gone from one crooked deal to another and had made a great deal of money He knew that behind Clarke was a powerful daring and unscrupulous band of criminals organised on a gigantic scale of which he himself was in a sense a probationary sense as he put it a member but he had never come into direct contact with them he had received all his orders and instructions through Clarke He had been told by Clarke that he was to cultivate father following the introduction to win father s confidence to get as many of father s affairs into his hands as possible to reach the position in fact of becoming father s recognised attorney and all this with the object as he supposed of embezzling from father on a large scale Then father died and Travers was instructed to cable my uncle He knew that the man who answered that summons was an impostor but he did not know until they had admitted it to him that night that both my father and my uncle had been murdered and that I too was to be made away with She looked at Jimmie Dale and suddenly laughed out bitterly No you don t understand even yet the patient ingenious deviltry of those fiends It was they at the time the new will was drawn who offered to buy out my real uncle s sheep ranch in that lonely unsettled district in Australia and offered him that new position in New Zealand My uncle never reached New Zealand He was murdered on his way there And in his place assuming his name appeared the man who has been posing as my uncle ever since Do you begin to see For five years they were patiently working out their plans for five years before my father s death that man lived and became known and accepted and ESTABLISHED himself as Henry LaSalle Do you see now why he cabled us to postpone our visit He ran very little risk The chances were one in a thousand that any of his few acquaintances in Australia would ever run across him in New Zealand and besides he was chosen because it seems there was a slight resemblance between him and the real Henry LaSalle enough with his changed mode of living and more elaborate and pretentious surroundings to have enabled him to carry through a bluff had it become necessary He had all of my uncle s papers and the Crime Club furnished him with every detail of our lives here I forgot to say too that from the moment my uncle was supposed to have reached New Zealand all his letters were typewritten an evidence in father s eyes that his brother had secured a position of some importance as indeed from apparently unprejudiced sources they took pains to assure father was a fact This left them with only my uncle s signature to forge to the letters not a difficult matter for them Believing that they had Travers so deeply implicated that he could do nothing even if he had the inclination which they had not for a moment imagined and arrogant in the belief in their own power to put him out of the way in any case if he proved refractory they admitted all this to him that night when he brought up the issue of the real Henry LaSalle putting in an appearance sooner or later and when they wanted him to smooth their path by releasing all documents where his power of attorney was involved Do you see now the part they gave Travers to play It was to put the stamp of genuineness upon the false Henry LaSalle Not but that they were prepared with what would appear to be overwhelmingly convincing evidence to prove it if it were necessary but if the man were accepted by the estate s lawyer there was little chance of any one else questioning his identity She halted again by the table and forced a smile as her eyes met Jimmie Dale s I am almost through Jimmie That night was a terrible one for both of us Travers life was not worth a moment s purchase once they found him and mine was only under reprieve until sufficient time to obviate suspicion should have elapsed after father s death We had no proof that would stand in any court even if we should have been given the chance to adopt that course And without absolute irrefutable proof it was all so cleverly woven stretched over so many years that our charge must have been held to be too visionary and fantastic to have any basis in fact All Travers would have been able to advance was the statement that the supposed Henry LaSalle had admitted being an impostor and a murderer to him Who would believe it On the face of it it appeared to be an absurdity And even granted that we were given an opportunity to bring the charge they would be able to prove by a hundred influential and well known men in New Zealand that the impostor was really Henry LaSalle and were we able to find any of my uncle s old acquaintances in Australia it would be necessary to get them here and not one of them would have reached America alive But there was not a chance not a chance Jimmie of doing that they would have killed Travers the moment he showed himself in the open The only thing we could do that night was to try and save our own lives the only thing we could look forward to was acquiring in some way unknown to them the proof fully established with which we could crush them in a single stroke and before they would have time to strike back The vital thing was proof of my uncle s death That if it could be obtained at all could only be obtained in Australia Travers was obliged to go somewhere to disappear from that moment if he wanted to save his life and he volunteered to go out there He left the house that night by the back entrance in an old servant s suit which I found for him and I never heard from him again until a month ago in the personal column of the MORNING NEWS ARGUS through which we had agreed to communicate As for myself I left the house the next morning telling my pseudo uncle that I was going to spend a few days with a friend And this I actually did but in those few days I managed to turn all my own securities that had been left me by my mother and which amounted to a considerable sum into cash And then Jimmie I came to this I have lived like this and in different disguises as a settlement worker as a widow of means in a fashionable uptown apartment but mostly as you see me now for five years For five years I have watched my supposed uncle hoping praying that through him I could get to know the others associated with him hoping praying that Travers would succeed hoping praying that we would get them all and watching day after day and year after year the personal column of the paper until at last I began to be afraid that it was all useless And there was nothing Jimmie nothing anywhere and I had no success her voice choked a little Nothing Even Clarke never went again to the house You can understand now how I came to know the strange things that I wrote to the Gray Seal how the life that I have led how this life here in the underworld how the constant search for some clew on my own account brought them to my knowledge and you can understand now too why I never dared to let you meet me for I knew well enough that while I worked to undermine my father s and my uncle s murderers they were moving heaven and earth to find me That is all Jimmie The day before yesterday a month after Travers first message to let me know that he was coming there was another personal giving me an hour and a telephone number He was back He had everything everything We dared not meet he was afraid suspicious that they had got track of him again You know the rest That package contained the proof that with Travers death can probably never be obtained again Do you understand why THEY want it why it is life and death to me Do you understand why my supposed uncle offered huge rewards for me why secretly every resource of that hideous organisation has been employed to find me that it is only by my DEATH the estate can pass into their hands and now She flung out her hands suddenly toward Jimmie Dale Oh Jimmie Jimmie I ve I ve fought so long alone Jimmie what are we to do He came slowly to his feet She had fought so long alone But now now it was his turn to fight for her But how She had not told him all surely she had not told him all for everything depended upon that package There had been so much to tell that she had not thought of all and she had not told him the details about that That box No four hundred twenty eight he cried quickly What is that What does it mean She shook her head I do not know she answered Then who is this John Johansson I do not know she said again Nor where the Crime Club is No dully He stared at her for a moment in a dazed way My God Jimmie Dale murmured And then she turned away her head It s it s pretty bad isn t it Jimmie I I told you that we did not hold many trumps CHAPTER X SILVER MAG There was silence between them Minute after minute passed Neither spoke Jimmie Dale dropped back into his chair again and stared abstractedly before him We do not hold many trumps Jimmie we do not hold many trumps her words were repeating themselves over and over in his mind They seemed to challenge him mockingly to deny what was so obviously a fact and because he could not deny it to taunt and jeer at him to jeer at him when all that was held at stake hung literally upon his next move He looked up mechanically as the Tocsin walked to a broken mirror at the rear of the miserable room nodded mechanically in approval as she began deftly to retouch the make up on her face where the tears had left their traces and resumed his abstracted gaze before him Box number four two eight John Johansson the Crime Club the identity of the man who was posing as Henry LaSalle If only he could hit upon a clew to the solution of a single one of those things or a single phase of one of them if only he could glimpse a ray of light that would at least prompt action when every moment of inaction was multiplying the odds against them There were the men who were watching his house at that moment on Riverside Drive he as Larry the Bat might in turn keep watch on them He had though of that In time perhaps he might by so doing discover the whereabouts of the Crime Club In time It was just that he had no time Forty eight hours the Tocsin insisted was all the time that he could count upon before they would become suspicious of Jimmie Dale s illness before they would discover that they were watching an empty house He might though this was even more hazardous make an attempt to trace the wires that tapped those of his telephone through the basement window that gave on the garage driveway And what then True they could not lead very far away but even if successful what then They would not lead him to the Crime Club but simply to some confederate to some man or woman playing the part of a servant perhaps in the house next door who in turn would have to be shadowed and watched Jimmie Dale shook his head Better of the two to start in at once and shadow those who were shadowing his house But that was not the way He knew that intuitively He hated to eliminate it from consideration for he had no other move to take its place but such a move was almost suicide in itself Time and time alone was the vital factor They the Tocsin and he must act quickly and STRIKE that night if they were to win His fingers the grimy fingers dirty nailed of Larry the Bat that none now would recognise as the slim tapering wonderfully sensitive fingers of Jimmie Dale the fingers that had made the name of the Gray Seal famous whose tips mocked at bars and safes and locks and seemed to embody in themselves all the human senses tightened spasmodically on the edge of the table Time Time Time It seemed to din in his ears And while he sat there powerless impotent the Crime Club was moving heaven and earth to find what HE must find that package if he was to save this woman here the woman whom he loved she who had been forced through the machinations of these hell fiends to adopt the life of a wretched hag to exist among the dregs of the underworld whose squalour and vice and wantonness none knew better than he Jimmie Dale s face set grimly Somewhere somewhere in the past five years of this life of hers in which she had been fighting the Crime Club pitting that clever brain of hers against it MUST lie a clew She had told him her story only in baldest outline with scarcely a reference to her own personal acts with barely a single detail There must be something something that perhaps she had overlooked something just the merest hint of something that would supply a starting point give him a glimmer of light She came back from across the room and sank down in her chair again She did not speak the question that meant life and death to them both was in her eyes Jimmie answered the mute interrogation tersely Not yet he said Then almost curtly in a quick incisive way as the keen alert brain began to delve and probe You say this man Clarke never returned to the house after that night She nodded her head quietly You are sure of that he insisted Yes she said I am sure And you say that all these years you have kept a watch on the man who is posing as your uncle and that he never went anywhere or associated with any one that would afford you a clew to this Crime Club Yes she said again It was a moment before Jimmie Dale spoke It s very strange he said musingly at last So strange in fact that it s impossible He must have communicated with the others and communicated with them often The game they were playing was too big too full of details to admit of any other possibility And the telephone as an explanation isn t good enough And yet she said earnestly possible or impossible it is nevertheless true That he might have succeeded in eluding me on occasions was perhaps to be expected but that in all those years I should not catch him once in what if you are correct must have been many and repeated conferences with the same men is too improbable to be thought of seriously Jimmie Dale shook his head again If you had been able to watch him night and day that might be so he said crisply But at best you could only watch him a very small portion of the time She smiled at him a little wanly Do you think Jimmie from what you as the Gray Seal know of me that I would have watched in any haphazard way like that He glanced at her with a sudden start What do you mean he asked quickly Look at me she said quietly Have you ever seen me before I mean as I am now No he answered after an instant Not that I know of And yet she smiled wanly again you have not lived or made the place you hold in the underworld without having heard of Silver Mag You exclaimed Jimmie Dale You Silver Mag He stared at her wonderingly as crouch shouldered now the hair gray threaded straggling out from under the hood of a faded dark blue seam worn cloak she sat before him a typical creature of the underworld her role an art in its conception perfect in its execution Silver Mag Yes he had heard of Silver Mag as every one in the Bad Lands had heard of her Silver Mag and her pocketful of coin Always a pocketful of silver so they said that was dispensed prodigally to the wives and children temporarily deprived of support by husbands and fathers unfortunate enough in their clashes with the law to be doing spaces up the river and therefore the underworld swore by Silver Mag Always silver never a bill Silver Mag had never been seen with a banknote that was her eccentricity Much or little she gave or paid out of her pocketful of jangling silver She was credited with being a sworn enemy of the police and yes he remembered too with having done time herself I don t quite understand he said in a puzzled way I haven t run across you personally because you probably took care to see that I shouldn t but it s no secret every one says you ve served a jail sentence yourself That is simply enough explained she answered gravely The story is of my own making When I decided to adopt this life both for my own safety and as the best means of keeping a watch on that man I knew that I must win the confidence of the underworld that I must have help and that in order to obtain that help I must have some excuse for my enmity against the man known as Henry LaSalle To be widely known in the underworld was of inestimable value nothing I knew could accomplish that as quickly as eccentricity You see now how and why I became known as Silver Mag I gained the confidence of every crook in New York through their wives and children I told them the story of my jail sentence while I swore vengeance on Henry LaSalle I told them that he had had me arrested for something I never stole while I was working for him as a charwoman and that he had had me railroaded to jail There wasn t one but gave me credit for the theft perhaps but equally there wasn t one but understood and my eccentricity helped this out my wanting to get Henry LaSalle Well do you see now Jimmie I had money I had the confidence of the underworld I had an excuse for my hatred of Henry LaSalle and so I had all the help I wanted Day and night that man has been watched He receives no visitors what social life he has is as you know at the club There is not a house that he has ever entered that sooner or later I have not entered after him in the hope of finding the headquarters of the clique Even the men and women as far as human possibility could accomplish it that he has talked to on the streets have been shadowed and their identity satisfactorily established and the net result has been failure utter absolute complete failure Jimmie Dale s eyes that had held steadily on her face shifted troubled and perplexed to the table top You are wonderful he said under his breath Wonderful And and that makes it all the more amazing all the more incomprehensible It is still impossible that he has not been in close and constant touch with his accomplices He MUST have been We would be blind fools to argue against it It could not on the face of it have been otherwise Then how when where has he done it she asked wearily God knows he said bitterly And if they have been clever enough to escape you all these years I m almost inclined to say what you said a little while ago that we re beaten She watched him miserably as he pushed back his chair impulsively and standing up stared down at her We re against it HARD he said with a mirthless laugh Then his lips tightening But we ll try another tack the chauffeur Travers Though even here the Crime Club has a day s start of us even if last night they knew no more about the whereabouts of that package than we know now I m afraid of it The chances are more than even that they ve already got it If they were able to catch Travers as the chauffeur they would have had something tangible to work back from Jimmie Dale was talking more to himself than to the Tocsin now as though he were muttering his thoughts aloud How did they get track of him When Where What has it led to And what in Heaven s name he burst out suddenly is this box number four two eight A safety deposit vault perhaps that he has taken somewhere she hazarded Jimmie Dale laughed mirthlessly again That is the one definite thing I do know that it isn t he said positively It is nothing of that kind It was half past ten o clock at night when I met him and he said that he had intended going back for the package if it had been safe to do so Deposit vaults are not open at that hour The package is or was if they have not already got it readily accessible and at any hour Now go over everything again every detail that passed between you and Travers He let you know that he was back in New York by means of a personal you said What else was in that personal besides the telephone number and the hour you were to call him Anything Nothing that will help us any she replied colourlessly There were simply the words northeast corner of Sixth Avenue and Waverly Place and the signature that we had agreed upon the two first and two last letters of the alphabet transposed BAZY I see said Jimmie Dale quickly And over the phone he completed his message Clever enough Yes she said In that way if any one were listening or overhead the plan there could be little harm come of it for the essential feature of all the place of rendezvous was not mentioned It has not been Travers fault that this happened and in spite of every precaution it has cost him his life He wanted nothing to give them a clew to my whereabouts he was trying to guard against the slightest evidence that would associate us one with the other He even warned me over the phone not to tell him how where or the mode of life I was living And naturally he dared give me no particulars about himself I was simply to select a third party whom I could trust and to follow out his instructions which were those that I sent to you in my letter Jimmie Dale began to pace nervously up and down the room Nothing else he queried a little blankly Nothing else she said monotonously But since last night since you knew that things had gone wrong he persisted surely you traced that telephone number the one you called up Yes she said and shrugged her shoulders in a tired way Naturally I did that but like everything else it amounted to nothing He telephoned from Makoff s pawnshop on that alley off Thompson Street and WHERE Jimmie Dale suddenly stock still almost shouted the word He telephoned from where Say that again She looked at him in amazement half rising from her chair Jimmie what is it she cried You don t mean that He was beside her now his hands pressed upon her shoulders his face flushed Box number four two eight He laughed out hysterically in his excitement John Johansson box number four two eight And like a fool I never thought of it Don t you see Don t you know now yourself THE UNDERGROUND POST OFFICE She stood up clinging to him a wild relief that was based on her confidence in him in her eyes and face even while she shook her head No she said frantically No I do not know Tell me Jimmie Tell me quickly You mean at Makoff s No Not Makoff s at Spider Jack s on Thompson Street he was clipping off his words still holding her tightly by the shoulders still staring into her eyes You know Spider Jack Jack s little novelty store Ah you have not learned all of the underworld yet Spider Jack is the craftiest fence in the Bad Lands and Makoff is his partner Spider buys the crooks stuff and Makoff disposes of it through the pawnshop it s only a step through the connecting back yard from one to the other and Yes but she interrupted feverishly the package you said Wait Jimmie Dale cried I m coming to that If Travers stood in with Makoff he stood in with Spider Jack For years Spider has been a sort of clearing house for the underworld for years he has conducted and profitably too his underground post office Crooks from all over the country let alone those in New York communicate with each other through Spider Jack These for a fee are registered at Spider s and given a number a box number he calls it though of course there are no actual boxes Letters come by mail addressed to him the sealed envelope within containing the actually intended recipient s name These Spider either forwards or delivers in person when they are called for Dozens of crooks too unwilling perhaps to dispose of small ill gotten articles at ruinous fence prices and finding it unhealthy for the moment to keep them in their possession use this means of depositing them temporarily for safe keeping You see now don t you It s certain that s where Travers left the package He used the name of John Johansson not to hoodwink Spider Jack I should say but as an added safeguard against the Crime Club Travers must have known both Makoff and Spider Jack in the old days and probably had reason and good reason to trust them both possibly a crook then himself as he confessed he may have acted in a legal capacity for them in their frequent tangles with the police Then she said and there was a glad new note in her voice then Jimmie Jimmie we are safe You can get it Jimmie It is only a little thing for the Gray Seal to do to get it now that we know where it is Yes he said tersely Yes if it is still there Still there she repeated the words quickly nervously Still there What do you mean I mean if they too have not discovered that he was at Makoff s if they have not got there first he said grimly There seems to be no limit to their cleverness or their power They penetrated his disguise as a chauffeur and who knows what more they have learned since last night We are fighting them in the dark and WHAT S THAT he whispered tensely suddenly and leaning forward like a flash as he whipped his automatic from his pocket he blew out the lamp The room was in darkness They stood there rigid silent listening Her hand found and caught his arm And then it came again a low sound the sound of a stealthy footstep just outside the window that faced on the storage yard CHAPTER XI THE MAGPIE A minute passed another The automatic at Jimmie Dale s hip the muzzle just peeping over the table top held a steady bead on the window Came the footstep again and then suddenly a series of low quick tappings upon the windowpane The Tocsin s hand slipped away from his arm Jimmie Dale s set face relaxed as he read the underground Morse and he replaced his revolver slowly in his pocket The Magpie said Jimmie Dale in an undertone What s he want I don t know she answered in a whisper He never came here before There s a back way out Jimmie if you No he said quickly We ve enemies enough with out making one of the Magpie He knows some one is here with you our shadows were on the blind Don t queer yourself Let him in I ll light the lamp He struck a match as she ran from the room and lifting the hot lamp chimney with the edge of his ragged coat lighted the lamp He turned the wick down a little shading and dimming the room and then as he flirted a bead of moisture from his forehead whimsically stretched out his hand to watch it in the lamplight That s bad Jimmie he muttered gravely to himself as he noted an almost imperceptible tremour Got a start didn t you Under a bit of a strain eh Well grimly never mind It looks as though the luck had turned Makoff and Spider Jack His hand reached up to his hat jerked the brim at a rakish angle over his eyes and he sprawled himself out on a chair He heard the Tocsin s voice at the front door and a man s voice low and guarded answer her Then the door closed and their steps approached the room It was rather curious that a visit from the Magpie What could the Magpie want What could there be in common between the Magpie and Silver Mag The Magpie alias Slimmy Joe was counted the cleverest safe worker in the United States barring only and always one a smile flickered across the lips of Larry the Bat one whose pre eminence the Magpie much to his own chagrin admitted himself the Gray Seal He looked up twisting the stub of a cigarette between his grimy fingers and fumbling for a match as the Tocsin and behind her the Magpie short slim and wiry shrewd faced with sharp quick glancing little black eyes entered the room Ello Larry grinned the Magpie Got yer breath back yet I felt it through de windowpane when youse let go at de lamp Ello Slimmy returned Jimmie Dale ungraciously speaking through the corner of his mouth Ferget it Sure said the Magpie unconcernedly He stared about him and finally drawing a chair up to the table sat down motioned the Tocsin to do the same and leaned forward amiably I didn t mean to throw no scare into youse he said in a conciliating tone But I had a little business wid Mag an I was kind of interested in whether she was entertainin company or not see I didn t know youse an Mag was workin together Mabbe observed Jimmie Dale as ungraciously as before mabbe dere s some more t ings youse don t know Aw cough up de grouch advised the Magpie with a hint of impatience creeping into his voice Youse don t need to be sore all night I told youse I wasn t tryin to hand youse one didn t I Never mind Larry Slimmy put in the Tocsin petulantly He s down on his luck dat s all He ain t had de price of a pinch of coke fer two days Oho exclaimed the Magpie grinning again So dat s wot s givin youse de pip eh Larry Well den say youse can take it from me dat mabbe youse ll be glad I blew around I was lookin fer a guy about yer size fer a little job to night an I was t inkin of lettin Young Dutchy in on it but seem youse are here an in wid Mag an dat I got to get Mag in too youse are on if youse say de word Wot s de lay inquired Larry the Bat unbending a little The Magpie cocked his eye and stuck his tongue in his cheek GOOD night he said tersely Nothin like dat Are youse on or ain t youse Well den wot s in it fer me persisted Larrry the Bat More n de price of a coke sneeze returned the Magpie pertinently Dere s a century note fer youse an mabbe two or t ree of dem fer Mag Larry the Bat s eyes gleamed avariciously Aw quit yer kiddin he said gruffly A century note fer me Dat s wot I said Youse heard me rejoined the Magpie shortly Only if it listens good to youse now I don t want no squealin after the divvy I m takin de chances youse has de soft end of it One century note fer youse an de rest is none of yer business Dat s puttin it straight ain t it Well wot do youse say an say it quick cause if youse ain t comin in youse can beat it out of here so s I can talk to Mag Dere ain t nothin I wouldn t take a chance on fer a hundred plunks declared Larry the Bat with sudden fervency and stared anxiously expectant at the Magpie Sure I m on Slimmy Sure I am Cut it loose Spill de story Well den said the Magpie I wants Youse ain t through yet interrupted the Tocsin tartly I ain t heard youse askin me nothin I ain t on me uppers like Larry an mabbe de price don t cut so much ice see Aw said the Magpie with a smirk I don t have to ask youse on dis lay Dis is where youse d come in on it fer marbles Say dis is where we gets de hook into a guy by de name of Henry LaSalle Get me HENRY LASALLE Under the table Jimmie Dale s hand clenched suddenly but not a muscle of his face moved save as with the tip of his tongue he shifted the butt of the cigarette that was hanging royally from his lower lip to the other corner of his mouth Sure She s got youse Slimmy he flung out with a grin as the Tocsin wrinkled up her face menacingly and began to mumble to herself He s de guy dat handed her one when she was young an she s been layin fer him ever since Sure I know Ain t I worked him fer her till I wears me shoes out tryin to get somet ing on him Sure she s in on it Go on Slimmy wot s de lay Wot do I do fer dat century The Magpie hitched his chair closer to the table and as his sharp little ferret eyes glanced around the room motioned the two to brings their heads nearer One of me influential broker friends down on Wall Street put me wise he said with a wink Dat s good enough fer youse two as far as dat goes But take it from me I got it dead straight He lowered his voice Say he s one of de richest mugs in New York ain t he Well he s been sellin stocks an bonds all day t ousands an t ousands of dollars worth fer cash All dem t ings is always sold fer cash remarked Larry the Bat fatuously Aw ferget it said the Magpie earnestly Fer CASH I said de coin de long green understand He wasn t shovin no checks fer what he sold into de bank except to get dem cashed Dat s wot he s been doin all day gettin de checks cashed an gettin de money in big bills see I know of one bunch of eighty t ousand an dat s only one Wot fer inquired Larry the Bat It was the question that was pounding at his brain as he stared innocently at the Magpie What did it mean Why was Henry LaSalle turning and if the Magpie was right feverishly turning every security he could lay his hands on into cash And then in a flash the answer came THEY HAD NOT FOUND THE PACKAGE Equally to them as to the Tocsin sitting there before him it meant life and death If the package were found by the Tocsin instead of themselves the game was up They were preparing for eventualities If they were forced to run at a moment s notice they at least were not going to run empty handed Far from empty handed it seemed It would not be difficult for the estate s executor to realise a vast sum in short order on instantly marketable gilt edged securities say half a million dollars Not very bulky either in large bills Five thousand hundred dollar bills would make half a million It was astonishing how small a hand bag say might hold a fortune Wot fer Slimmy he inquired again wiggling his cigarette butt on his tongue tip Wot d he do dat fer How de hell do youse suppose I knows demanded the Magpie politely scornful Dat s his business dat ain t wot s worryin me No sure it ain t admitted Larry the Bat ingratiatingly But go on keep movin Slimmy Wot s he done wid de stuff Done wid it echoed the Magpie with a short laugh Wot do youse t ink He s been luggin it home to his swell joint up dere on de avenoo an crammin his safe full of it Larry the Bat sucked in his breath Gee dat s soft he murmured and then suddenly as though with painful inspiration Say Slimmy say are youse sure youse ain t been handed a steer The Magpie grinned wickedly I ain t fallin fer steers he said shortly Dis is on de level Jimmie Dale lurched up from his chair and leaning over the lamp chimney drew wheezily on his cigarette to get a light His eyes sought the Tocsin s face To all intents and purposes she was entirely absorbed in the Magpie He sat down again to gape with well stimulated doglike admiration at Slimmy Joe WAS THIS TOO A PLANT Why had the Magpie come to THEM with this story of Henry LaSalle And then the next instant as the Magpie spoke his suspicions were allayed Let s get down to cases the Magpie invited crisply I didn t blow in here just by luck Dis Henry LaSalle is de guy youse worked fer once ain t he Mag Dat s de spiel ain t it he sent youse up fer pinchin de tacks out of his carpets I never pinched nothin snarled Silver Mag truculently He s a dirty liar I never did Cut it out Cut it out Can dat complained the Magpie patiently De point is youse worked in his house didn t youse Sure I did snapped the Tocsin sullenly aggressive but Well den dat s wot I want dat s wot I come fer Mag a plan of de house See Jimmie Dale could feel the Tocsin s eyes upon him questioning searching seeking a cue A plan of the house yes or no And a decision on the instant Sure said Larry the Bat brightly Dat s wot I was t inkin youse were after all de time Say youse are all right Slimmy Youse are de kind to work wid Go on Mag draw de dope fer Slimmy Dat s better dan tryin to put one over on de swell guy Dis ll make him squeal fer fair The Magpie produced a pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket and laid them on the table in front of the Tocsin Dere youse are he announced Help yerself an go to it Mag The Tocsin evidently not quite certain of her part wet the pencil doubtfully on the end of her tongue I ain t never drawed plans she said anxiously Mabbe she glanced at Jimmie Dale mabbe I dunno how to do it RIGHT Aw go ahead nodded Larry the Bat Youse can do it right Mag Youse don t have to make no oil paintin All de Magpie wants is de doors an windows eh Slimmy Sure agreed the Magpie encouragingly Dat s all Mag Just mark de rooms out on de first floor an de basement Youse can explain wot youse re doin as youse goes along I ll get youse The Tocsin cackled maliciously in assent and then while the Magpie got up from his chair and stood peering over her shoulder she began to draw labouriously her brows knitted the pencil hooked awkwardly between cramped up forefinger and thumb Larry the Bat slouched forward over the table his chin in his hands appeared to watch the proceedings with mild interest but his eyes like a hawk s were following every line on the paper transferring them to his brain photographing every detail of the plan in his mind And as he watched there seemed something that was near to the acme of all that was ironical in the Magpie standing there his sharp little black eyes drinking in greedily the Tocsin s work in the Tocsin herself aiding and abetting in the projected theft OF HER OWN MONEY How far would he let the Magpie go He did not know Perhaps who could tell all the way Between now and then there lay that package If it were at Makoff s at Spider Jack s if he could find it get it the Magpie as a temporary custodian of the estate s money would at least preclude its loss by flight if the Crime Club took alarm too quickly Larry the Bat s eyes under half closed lids rested musingly on the Magpie s face The Magpie would not get very far away with it On the other hand if he failed at Spider Jack s if after all he was wrong and the package had never been there or if they had forestalled him turned the trick upon him already secured it then Larry the Bat s lips working on his cigarette formed in a twisted smile then well then that was quite another matter Perhaps he and the Magpie might not agree so far A half million dollars was perhaps not much out of eleven millions but it was a salvage not to be despised Why did he say half a million Well why not If the Magpie knew of a single transaction of eighty thousand and there had been many transactions during the day a half million was little likely to prove an exaggeration and the less likely in view of the fact that if those in the Crime Club were preparing for an emergency they would not stint themselves in the disposal of securities The Magpie was keeping up a running fire of questions as the Tocsin toiled on with her pencil Where did the hall lead to How many windows in the library Did she remember the kind of fastenings Did the servants sleep in the basement or above And finally twice over as she finished the clumsy drawing and pushed it toward him he demanded minute details of the position of the safe Aw dat s all right Slimmy Larry the Bat cut in airily If youse ferget anyt ing when youse get in dere youse can ask me I got it cinched The Magpie folded the paper and stowed it carefully away in his pocket Ask youse eh he grunted sarcastically An where do youse t ink youse ll be about dat time In dere wid youse of course replied Larry the Bat promptly Dat s wot youse said Yes youse will NOT announced the Magpie with cold finality Do youse t ink I want to queer myself A hot one youse d be on an inside job Youse ll be OUTSIDE wid yer peepers skinned for de bulls youse an Mag here too See Get dat straight While I m on de job youse two plays de game Now youse listen to me both of youse Don t start nothin unless youse has to If it s a cinch I got to make a get away youse two start a drunk fight Get me Youse know de lay T row de talk loud an I ll fade Dat s all We ll crack de crib early it ll be quiet enough up dere by one o clock One o clock Larry the Bat shook his head What time was it now It was about nine when he had first met the Tocsin then the Sanctuary then the long walk as he had followed her say a quarter of ten for that And he had certainly been here with her not less than an hour and a half It must be after eleven then One o clock And before that must come Makoff and Spider Jack The night that half an hour ago had seemed so sterile was crowding a program of events upon him now too fast Nothin doin he said thoughtfully Youse are in wrong dere Slimmy One o clock don t go Say take it from me I ve watched dat guy too many nights fer Mag Tain t often he leaves de club before one o clock an he ain t never in bed before two All right agreed the Magpie after a moment s reflection Youse ought to know Make it three o clock He pulled a cigar from his pocket lighted it and leaning back in his chair stuck his feet up on the table If youse don t mind Mag I ll stick around a while he decided calmly Mabbe de less I m seen to night de better an I guess dere won t be nobody lookin fer me here Larry the Bat coughed suddenly and rose up a little heavily from his chair He had not counted on that If the Magpie was settling down for a prolonged stay it devolved upon him Jimmie Dale to get away and at once and without exciting the Magpie s suspicions He coughed again looked nervously from the Tocsin to the Magpie stammered swallowed hard and coughed once more Well wot s bitin youse inquired the Magpie ironically Nothin said Larry the Bat and hesitated Nothin only He hesitated again and then the words in a rush Say Slimmy couldn t youse come across wid a piece of dat century now Wot fer demanded the Magpie a little aggressively Larry the Bat cleared his throat with a desperate effort Youse knows he admitted sheepishly Just gimme de price of one Slimmy just one Coke exploded the Magpie An get soaked to de eyes not by a damn sight No Honest to Gawd no Slimmy just one pleaded Larry the Bat Nix said the Magpie shortly Larry the Bat thrust out a hand before the Magpie s eyes that shook tremulously I got to have it he declared with sudden fierceness I GOT to see Look at me I ain t goin to be no good to night if I don t I tell youse I got to I ain t goin to t row youse down Slimmy honest I ain t Just one an it

Well dere youse are but youse can take it from me Larry dat if youse gets whiffed he swore threateningly I ll crack every bone in yer face Get me Slimmy said Larry the Bat fervently grabbing at the bill with a hungry hand youse can count on me I ll be up dere on de job before youse are Three o clock eh Well so long Slimmy he slouched eagerly to the door So long Mag he paused on the threshold for a single quick flung significant glance See youse on de avenoo Mag I ll be up dere before youse are So long Oh so long said the Tocsin contemptuously And an instant later Jimmie Dale closed the outer door behind him CHAPTER XII JOHN JOHANSSON FOUR TWO EIGHT Nearly midnight already It was even later than he had thought Larry the Bat pressed his face against a shop s windowpane on the Bowery for a glance at a clock that had caught his eye on the wall within Nearly midnight He slouched on again hurriedly still debating in his mind as he had been debating it all the way from the Tocsin s the question of returning again to the Sanctuary So far the way both to Spider Jack s and the Sanctuary had been in the same direction but the Sanctuary was on the next street Jimmie Dale reached the corner and hesitated It was strange how strong was the intuition upon him to night that bade him go on and make all speed to Spider Jack s while equally strong was the cold stubborn logic that bade him go first to the Sanctuary There were things that he needed there that would probably be absolutely essential to him before the night was out things without which he might be so badly handicapped as to invite failure from the start and yet it was already midnight Ostensibly both Makoff and Spider Jack closed their places at eleven But that might mean anything depending upon their own respective inclinations or on what of their own peculiar brand of deviltry might be afoot If they were still about still in evidence he was still too early midnight though it was though on the other hand if the coast was clear he could ill afford to lose a moment of the time between now and the hour that the Magpie had planned for the robbery of Henry LaSalle for it would not be an easy matter even once inside Spider Jack s to find that package since it was Spider s open boast that things committed to his care were where the police or any one else might as well whistle and suck their thumbs as try to find them And then with sudden decision taking his hesitation as it were by the throat Jimmie Dale hurried on again to the Sanctuary At most it could delay him but another fifteen minutes and by half past twelve or a quarter to one at the latest he would be at Spider Jack s Disdaining the secrecy of the side door on the alley for who had a better right or was better known there than Larry the Bat a tenant of years he entered the tenement by the front door scuffled up the stairs to the first landing and let himself into his disreputable room He locked the door behind him lighted the choked and wheezy gas jet in a single sharp flung glance assured himself that the blinds were tightly shut and kneeling in the far corner threw back the oilcloth and lifted up the loose section of the flooring beneath He reached inside fumbling under the neatly folded clothes of Jimmie Dale and in a moment laid his leather girdle with its kit of burglar s tools on the floor beside him and beside that again an electric flashlight a black silk mask and what he had never expected to use again when early the night before he had as he had believed put it away forever the thin metal insignia case of the Gray Seal Another moment and with the flooring replaced the oilcloth rolled back into position he had stripped off his coat and was pulling his spotted greasy shirt off over his head then stooping quickly he picked up the girdle put it on put on his shirt again over it put on his coat put the metal case the flashlight and the mask in his pockets and once more the Sanctuary was in darkness It was perhaps fifteen minutes later that Jimmie Dale turned into the upper section of Thompson Street Here he slowed his pace that had been almost a run since he had left the Sanctuary and began to shuffle leisurely along for the street that a few hours before would have been choked with its pushcarts and venders its half naked children playing where they could find room in the gutters its sidewalks thronged with shawled women and picturesquely dressed earringed dark visaged men a scene as it were transported from some foreign land was still far from deserted the quiet if quiet it could be called was but comparative there were many yet about and he had no desire to attract attention by any evidence of undue haste And besides Spider Jack s was just ahead making the corner of the alleyway a few hundred feet farther on and he had very good reasons for desiring to approach Spider s little novelty store at a pace that would afford him every opportunity for observation On he shuffled along the street until reaching Spider Jack s a little two storied tumble down brick structure a muttered exclamation of satisfaction escaped him The shop was closed and dark and though Spider Jack lived above the store there were no lights even in the upper windows Spider Jack presumably was either out or in bed So far then he could have asked for nothing more Jimmie Dale edged in close to the building as he slouched by so close that his hat brim seemed to touch the windowpane It was possible that from a room at the rear of the store there might be a light with a telltale ray perhaps filtering through say a door crack But there was nothing only blackness within He paused at the corner of the building by the alleyway Down here adjoining the high board fence of Spider Jack s back yard Makoff made pretense at pawnbrokering in a small and dingy wooden building that was little more pretentious than a shed and in Makoff s place so far as he could see there was no light either Jimmie Dale s fingers were industriously rolling a cigarette as under the brim of his slouch hat his eyes were noting every detail around him A yard in against the wall of Spider Jack s the wall cutting off the rays of the street lamp at a sharp angle it was shadowy and black and beyond that farther in the alleyway was like a pit It would take less far less than the fraction of a second to gain that yard but some one was approaching behind him and a little group of people loitered with annoying persistency directly across the way on the other side of the street Jimmie Dale stuck the cigarette between his lips fumbled in his pockets and finally produced a box of matches The group opposite was moving on now the footsteps he had heard behind him those of a man drew nearer the man passed by and the box of matches in Jimmie Dale s hand dropped to the ground He reached to pick them up and in his stooping posture without seeming to turn his head flung a quick glance behind him up the street No one for that fraction of a second that he needed was near enough to see and in that fraction of a second Jimmie Dale disappeared A dozen yards down the lane he sprang for the top of the high fence gripped it and lithe and active as a cat swung himself up and over and dropped noiselessly to the ground on the other side Here he stood motionless for a moment close against the fence to get his bearings The rear of Spider Jack s building loomed up before him the back windows as unlighted as those in front Luck so far at least was with him He turned and looked about him and his eyes growing accustomed to the darkness he could just make out Makoff s place bordering the end of the yard nor from this new vantage point could he discover any more than before a single sign of life about the pawnbroker s establishment Jimmie Dale stole forward across the yard mounted the three steps of the low stoop at Spider Jack s back door and tried the door cautiously It was locked From his pocket came the small steel instrument that had stood Larry the Bat in good stead a hundred times before in similar circumstances He inserted it in the keyhole worked deftly with it for an instant and tried the door again It was still locked And then Jimmie Dale smiled almost apologetically Spider Jack did not use ordinary locks on his back door The discountenanced instrument went back into his pocket and now Jimmie Dale s hand slipped inside his shirt and from one of the little upright pockets of the leather belt and from still another and from after that a third came the vicious little blued steel tools The sensitive fingers travelled slowly up and down the side of the door and then he was at work in earnest A minute passed another there was a dull low grating sound a snick as of metal yielding suddenly and Jimmie Dale was coolly stowing away his tools again inside his shirt He pushed the door open an inch listened then swung it wide stepped inside and closed it behind him A round white beam of light flashed in a quick circle and went out It was a sort of storeroom innocent enough and orderly enough in appearance bare floored with boxes and packing cases piled neatly against the walls In one corner a staircase led to the story above and from above quite audibly now he caught the sound of snoring Spider Jack was in bed then Directly facing him was the open door of another room and Jimmie Dale moving softly forward entered it He had never been in Spider Jack s before and his first concern was to form an intimate acquaintanceship with his surroundings Again the flashlight circled and again went out No windows muttered Jimmie Dale under his breath Nothing very fancy about the architecture Three rooms in a row Store in front of this room through that door of course Wonder if the door s locked though it s a foregone conclusion the package wouldn t be in there Not a sound his tread silent he crossed to the closed door that he had noticed It was unlocked and he opened it tentatively a little way A faint glow of light diffused itself through the opening Jimmie Dale nodded his head and closed the door again The street lamp shining through the shop windows accounted for the light And now the flashlight played with steady inquisitiveness about him The room in which he stood seemed to combine a sort of office with a lounging room in which Spider Jack no doubt entertained his particular cronies There was table in the centre cards still upon it chairs about it Against the wall farthest away from the shop stood a huge old fashioned cabinet and a little farther along anglewise partitioning off the corner as it were hung for some purpose or other a cretonne curtain Also against the wall next to the lane bringing a commiserating smile to Jimmie Dale s lips as his eyes fell upon it was a clumsy lumbering antique safe Jimmie Dale s eyes returned to the curtain What was it doing there What was it for Instinctively he stepped over to examine it A single glance however as he lifted it aside sufficed It was nothing but a make shift clothes closet He turned from it switched off the flashlight and stood staring meditatively into the darkness In a strange house with the knowledge to begin with that what he sought was carefully hidden it was no sinecure to find that package He had never for a moment imagined that it would be But of one thing however there was no uncertainty in his mind he would get the package by search if possible by other means if search failed It was now close to one o clock If by two o clock his efforts had been fruitless Spider Jack would hand over the package at the revolver point It was quite simple Meanwhile Jimmie Dale shrugged his shoulders and going over to the safe knelt down in front of it meanwhile as well begin here as anywhere else The trained fingers closed on the handle and on the instant as though in startled amazement shifted to the dial They came back to the handle a wrench then a low amused chuckle and the door swung open The great unwieldy thing was only a monumental bluff It not only had not been locked but it COULD NOT be locked the mechanism was out of order the bolts could not be moved by so much as a hair s breadth Still chuckling Jimmie Dale shot the flashlight s ray into the interior of the safe and the chuckle died on his lips and into his face came a look of strained bewilderment Inside everything was in chaos books papers a miscellany of articles as though they had first been ruthlessly pulled out on the floor then gathered up in an armful and crammed back inside again For an instant he did not move and then a queer hard mirthless smile drew down the corners of his mouth With a sort of bitter expectant nod of his head he turned the light upon the door of the safe Yes there were the scratches that the tools had left and as though in sardonic jest the holes where the steel bit had bored were plugged with putty and rubbed over with some black substance that was still wet and came off smearing his finger as he touched it It could not have been done long ago then How long A half hour an hour Not more than that Mechanically he closed the door of the safe rose to his feet and almost heedless of noise now the flashlight ray dancing before him he jumped across to the old fashioned cabinet and pulled the door open Here as within the safe all inside plain evidence of thorough if hasty search was scattered and tossed about in hopeless confusion He shut the cabinet door the flashlight went out and he stood like a man stunned the sense of some abysmal disaster upon him He was too late The game was up If it had ever been here the package was gone now GONE The Crime Club had been here before him The game was up The game was up his mind seemed to keep on repeating that The Crime Club had beaten him by an hour at most and had been here and had searched It was strange though that they should have been at such curious pains to cover their tracks by leaving the room in order by such paltry efforts to make the safe appear untouched when the first glance that was at all critical would disclose immediately what had been done Why should they need to cover their tracks at all or if it was necessary why above all in such a pitifully inadequate way His mind barked back to the same ghastly refrain the game was up NO Not yet There was still a chance There was still Spider Jack Suppose in spite of their search they had failed to find the package Jimmie Dale s lips set in a thin line as he started abruptly toward the door There was still that chance and one thing was grimly certain Spider Jack would at least show him where the package HAD BEEN And then halfway to the door he halted suddenly and stood still listening An electric bell was ringing loudly imperiously somewhere upstairs Followed almost immediately the sound of some one Spider Jack presumably moving hurriedly about overhead and then a moment later steps coming down the staircase in the adjoining room Jimmie Dale drew back flattening himself against the wall Spider Jack entered the room stumbled across it in the darkness fumbled for the door that led into his little shop opened it passed through fumbled around in there again for matches evidently then lighted a gas jet in the store and going to the street door opened it Jimmie Dale had edged along the wall a little to a position where he had an unobstructed view through the open doorway connecting the shop and the room in which he stood Spider Jack in trousers and shirt hastily donned no doubt as he had got out of bed was standing in the street doorway and beyond him loomed the forms of several men Spider Jack stepped aside to allow his visitors to enter and suddenly a cry barely suppressed upon his lips Jimmie Dale involuntarily strained forward Three men had entered but his eyes were fixed fascinated upon only one the first of the three Was it an hallucination Was he mad dreaming It was Hilton Travers THE CHAUFFEUR the man whom he could have sworn he had last seen dead lashed in that chair in that ghastly death chamber of the Crime Club Rather rough on you Spider to pull you out of bed at this hour the chauffeur was saying apologetically Oh that s all right seein it s you Travers Spider Jack answered gruffly amiable Only I was kind of lookin for you last night I know the chauffeur replied but I couldn t connect with my friends here Shake hands with them Spider Bob Marvin Harry Stead Glad to know you gents said Spider Jack with a handgrip apiece The chauffeur lowered his voice a little I suppose we re alone here eh Spider Yes Well then you know what I ve come for that package Marvin and Stead here are the ones that are in on it with me Get it for me will you Spider Sure mister Johansson Spider grinned Sure Come on into the back room and make yourselves comfortable I ll be mabbe five minutes or so Jimmie Dale s brain was whirling What did it mean He could not seem to understand His mind seemed to refuse its functions Travers the chauffeur ALIVE He drew in his breath sharply That curtain in the corner He must see this out now They were coming Quick noiseless he stole along the side of the wall reached the corner and slipped in behind the curtain as Spider Jack striking a match entered the room Spider Jack lighted the gas and as the others followed behind him waved them toward the chairs around the table I ll just ask you gents not to leave the room he said meaningly over his shoulder as he stepped toward the rear door It s kind of a fad of mine to keep some things even from my wife All right Spider I understand the chauffeur returned readily Jimmie Dale s knife cut a tiny slit in the cretonne on a level with his eyes The three men had seated themselves at the table and appeared to be listening intently Spider Jack s footsteps echoed back as he crossed the rear room sounded dull and muffled descending the stoop outside and died away I told you it wasn t in the house the man who had been introduced as Stead laughed shortly We wasted the hour we had here The third man spoke crisply incisively to the chauffeur Turn down that gas jet a little You ve got across with it so far but you can t stand a searchlight Clarke And at the words in a flash the meaning of it all of it to the last detail that was spelling death ruin and disaster for her the Tocsin for himself as well burst upon Jimmie Dale That VOICE He would have known it recognised it among a thousand it was the masked man of the night before the leader the head of the Crime Club And it was not Travers there at all He remembered now too well that second room they had showed him in the Crime Club its multitude of disguises though in this case they had the dead man s clothes ready to their hands the leader s boast that impersonation was but child s play to them And now he understood why they had covered up the traces of their search in only so curiously inadequate a manner They had failed to find the package and as a last resort had adopted the ruse of impersonating Hilton Travers the chauffeur which made it necessary that when they called Spider Jack from his bed as they had just done that Spider Jack at a CASUAL glance should notice nothing amiss but it would be no more than a casual glance for who should know better than they he would not have to go for the package to any place that they had disturbed And he Jimmie Dale could only stand here and watch them helpless powerless to move Three of them A step out into the room was to invite certain death It would not matter his death if he could gain anything for her for the Tocsin by it But what could he gain by dying He clenched his hands until the nails bit into the flesh Spider Jack re entered the room carrying what looked like a large bulky manila envelope heavily sealed in his hand He tossed it on the table There you are Travers he said I wonder suggested the leader pleasantly if now that we re here Travers your friend would mind letting us have this room for a few minutes to ourselves to clean up the business Sure agreed Spider Jack cordially You re welcome to it I ll wait out here in the store until you say the word He went out closing the door after him The leader picked up the package We ll take no chances with this he said grimly It s been too close a call After we ve had a look at it we ll put it out of harm s way on the spot here while we ve got it before we leave He ripped the package open and disclosed perhaps a dozen official looking documents besides a miscellaneous number of others He took up the first of the papers glanced through it hurriedly then tossed it to the pseudo chauffeur Tear it up and tear it up SMALL he ordered tersely The next after examining it as he had the first he tossed to the other man Go ahead curtly Work fast From the looks of these Travers had us cold There s proof enough here of LaSalle s murder to send us all to the chair He went on glancing through the documents and then suddenly joining the others in their work began to rip and tear at the papers himself A sort of cold horror had settled upon Jimmie Dale and his forehead was clammy wet The inhuman irony of it That he should stand there and watch impotent to prevent it the destruction of what he would have given his life to secure And then slowly a grim hard merciless smile came to his lips He had recognised the leader s voice now he would recognise the leader s FACE At least that was left to him perhaps the master trump of all It would not be very hard to find the Crime Club now with that man to lead the way The scraps of paper tiny shreds mounted into a heap on the table and with the last of the contents of the package destroyed the leader stood up Put these pieces in your pockets we don t want to leave them here he directed quietly And then let s get out In scarcely a moment the last scrap of paper had vanished The three men walked to the door passed through it and joined Spider Jack in the store and Jimmie Dale slipping out from behind the curtain gained the door of the rear room crept through it reached the stoop and then darting like the wind across the yard was over the fence in a second and in another was out of the alleyway and on the street He was in time in plenty of time They had just left Spider Jack s and were perhaps fifty yards or so ahead of him He slouched on behind them the cold grim smile on his lips once more It was the Crime Club now that hell s cradle where their devil s schemes were hatched that was the one thing left to him they would lead him to that and then and then it would be his turn to STRIKE They turned the first corner And suddenly as the racing engine of an automobile caught his ear he broke into a run and dashed around the corner after them in time to see them jump into a car and the car speed off along the street He halted as though he were suddenly dazed started involuntarily to run forward again stopped with a hollow laugh at the futility of it and stood still and motionless on the sidewalk And then he swayed a little and his face grew gray Failure defeat ruin in that moment he knew them all to their bitterest dregs How could he go to her How could he face her and tell her that they were beaten that the last hope was gone that he had failed God he cried aloud and clenched his hands Then deep in his consciousness a thought stirred and he swept a shaking hand across his eyes Why had it come again that thought Did it mean that HE must play the last card There was a way there had always been a way The way the Crime Club took MURDER It was their own weapon If the man who posed as Henry LaSalle were killed If that man were killed The Magpie was to be there at three he muttered and started mechanically back along the street CHAPTER XIII THE ONLY WAY It was a horrible thing and it grew upon him In a blind mechanical way his brain receptive to nothing else Jimmie Dale walked on along the street To kill a man Death he had faced himself a hundred times witnessed it a hundred times in its most violent forms had seen murder done before his eyes had been in straits where to save his own life it had seemed the one last desperate chance and yet his hands were still clean To kill a man in fair fight in struggle when the blood was hot was terrible enough a possibility that was always before him the one thing from which he shrank the one thing that as the Gray Seal he had always feared but to kill a man deliberately to creep upon his victim with hideous cold blooded premeditation he shivered a little and his hand shook as he drew it nervously across his eyes But there was no other way Again and again insidiously grappling with his revulsion with the horror that the impulse to murder inspired came that other thought there was no other way If the man who posed as Henry LaSalle were DEAD If he were dead If he were dead See now what would happen if that man were dead How clear his brain was on that point The whole plot would tumble like a house of cards about the heads of the Crime Club The courts would require an auditing of the estate by a trustee of the courts own appointing who would continue to administer it until the Tocsin s twenty fifth birthday or until there was tangible evidence of her death but the Tocsin automatically with her pseudo uncle s death could publicly appear again Her death could no longer benefit the Crime Club since it the Crime Club with the supposed uncle dead could not profit through the false Henry LaSalle inheriting as next of kin It was the weak link the vulnerable point in the stupendous scheme of murder and crime with which these hell fiends had played for and won so far the stake of eleven millions Not that they had overlooked or been blind to this they were too clever too cunning for that it was only that they had planned to accomplish the Tocsin s death as they had her father s and uncle s and ESTABLISH the false Henry LaSalle in undisputed possession and ownership of the estate and had failed in that up to the present But the material results remained the same so long as the Tocsin to save her life was forced to remain in hiding so long as proof that would convict the Crime Club was not forthcoming SO LONG AS THAT MAN LIVED Time passed to which Jimmie Dale was oblivious At times he walked slowly scarcely moving at times his pace was a nervous hurried stride that was almost a run And as he was oblivious to time so was he oblivious to his surroundings to the direction which he took At times his forehead was damp with moisture that was not there from physical exertion at times his face deathly white was full as of the vision of some shuddering abhorrent sight at times his lips were thinned into a straight line and there was a glitter in the dark eyes that was not good to see while his hands at his sides clenched until the skin tight over the knuckles was an ivory white To kill a man What other way was there The proof that it had taken Hilton Travers years to obtain the proof on which the Tocsin s life depended was destroyed utterly irreparably It could never be duplicated Hilton Travers was dead MURDERED Murder That thought again It was their own weapon Murder Would one kill a venomous reptile in whose fangs was death What right had this man to life whose life was forfeit even under the law for murder Was she to drag on an intolerable existence among the dregs and the scum of the underworld she in her refinement and her purity to exist among the vile and dissolute in daily hourly peril of her life because the weapons that these inhuman vultures had used to rob her to destroy those she loved to make of her life a hideous joyless thing should not be used against them But to kill a man To steal upon a man with cold intent in the blackness of the night and take his life To be a murderer To know the horror of blood forever upon one s hands to rise cold sweated in the night fearful of the very shadows around one to live with every detail of that fearsome act sweeping like some dread spectre at unexpected moments upon the consciousness He put up his hands before his face as though to blot out the thought from him Mind and soul recoiled before it to kill a man He walked on and on until at last conscious of a sense of fatigue he stopped He must have come a long way been walking a long time Where was he He looked about him for a moment in a dazed way and suddenly with a low cry shrank back As though he had been drawn to it by some ghastly magnet he found himself standing in front of the LaSalle mansion on Fifth Avenue No no it was not for that he had come to kill a man It was only only to get that money Yes he remembered now that money from the safe before the Magpie got it The Magpie was to be there at three o clock and the Tocsin was to be there too The Tocsin That package He had failed It had been her one hope and and it was gone What could he say to her How could he tell her the miserable truth But but he had not come there in the dead of night to kill a man these other things were what had Jimmie It was a quick breathed whisper A hand was on his arm He turned startled It was the Tocsin Silver Mag Jimmie in alarm Why are you standing here like this You may be SEEN Seen Suppose he WERE seen He shuddered a little Yes that s so he said hoarsely He glanced numbly up and down the wide deserted but well lighted avenue It was no place that most aristocratic section of the city for such as Silver Mag and Larry the Bat to be seen at that hour of night or rather morning And if anything HAPPENED inside that house I I didn t think of that he said mechanically Come across the street under the stoop of that house there She had his arm and was half dragging him as she spoke the alarm in her voice intensified And then a moment later safe from observation Jimmie Jimmie what is the matter What has happened What makes you act so strangely Nothing he said I TELL me she insisted wildly And then with a violent effort Jimmie Dale forced his mind back to the immediate present He was only inspiring her with terror and there was the Magpie and that money in the safe Where is the Magpie he asked with quick apprehension Am I late Is he in there already No she said He hasn t come yet What time is it he demanded anxiously About half past two she replied But Jimmie Wait he broke in Where is he now You were both together And you were both to be here at three What are you doing here alone at half past two A strange little exclamation one almost of dismay it seemed escaped her The Magpie left my place an hour ago to get his kit I think And I came here at once because that was what you and I understood I was to do wasn t it Jimmie you frighten me You are not yourself Don t you remember the last words you said as you nodded to me behind the Magpie s back that you would be here BEFORE us There was no mistaking your meaning if I could get away from him I was to come here and meet you Jimmie Dale passed his hand nervously across his eyes Of course he remembered now What a frightful turmoil his brain had been in Yes of course He tried to speak nonchalantly I had forgotten for the moment She caught his arm in a quick tight hold shaking him in a terrified way YOU forget a thing like that Jimmie something terrible has happened Can t you see that I am nearly mad with anxiety What is it What is it That package Jimmie is it the package He did not answer What could he say It meant life hope joy everything that the world held for her and it was gone Yes it IS the package she whispered frantically Quick Jimmie Tell me It it was not there You you could not find it It was there he said as though the words were literally forced from him Then Then WHAT Jimmie The clutch on his arm was like a vise They got it he said It was like a death sentence that he pronounced It is destroyed She did not speak or move save that her hands as though nerveless and without strength fell away from his arms and dropped to her sides It was dark there under the stoop though not so dark but that he could see her face It was gray gray as death And there was misery and fear and a pitiful helplessness in it and then she swayed a little and he caught her in his arms Gone she murmured in a dead colourless way and suddenly laughed out sharply hysterically Don t For God s sake don t do that he pleaded wildly She looked at him then for a moment in strange quiet and lifted her hand and stroked his face in a numbed way It it would have been better Jimmie wouldn t it she said in the same monotonous voice it would have been better if if I had never found out anything and they they had done the same to me that they did to to father Marie Marie It was the first time he had ever spoken her name and it was on his lips now in an agony of tenderness and appeal Don t You mustn t speak like that I m tired she said I I can t fight any more She did not cry She lay there in his arms quite still like a weary child The minutes passed When Jimmie Dale spoke again it was irrelevantly and his face was very white Marie describe the upper floor of that house over there for me She roused herself with a start The upper floor she repeated slowly Why why do you ask that Have YOU forgotten in turn he said with a steady smile That money in the safe it s yours we can at least save that out of the wreck You only drew the basement plan and the first floor for the Magpie the more I know about the house the better of course in case anything goes wrong Now see try and be brave and tell me quickly for I must get through before the Magpie comes and I have barely half an hour No Jimmie no She slipped out of his arms Let it alone I am afraid Something I I have a feeling that something will happen It is the only way He said it involuntarily more to himself than to her Jimmie let it alone she said again No he said I am going so tell me quickly Every minute that we wait is one that counts against us She hesitated an instant and then speaking rapidly made a verbal sketch of the upper portion of the house for him It s a very large house isn t it he commented innocently to pave the way for the question above all others that he had to ask Which is your uncle s I mean that man s room The first on the right at the head of the landing she answered Only Jimmie don t don t go He drew her close to him again Now listen he said quietly When the Magpie comes and finds I am not here lead him to think that the money he gave me was too much for me that I am probably in some den doped with drug and hold him as long as you can on the pretext that there is always the possibility I may after all show up before he goes in there You understand And now about yourself you must do exactly as I say On no account allow yourself to be seen by ANY ONE except the Magpie I would tell you to go now only unless it is vitally necessary we cannot afford to arouse the Magpie s suspicions he d have every crook in the underworld snarling at our heels But you are not to wait even for him if you detect the slightest disturbance in that house before he comes And equally after he has gone in whether I have come out or not at the first indication of anything unusual you are to get away at once You understand Marie Yes she said But but Jimmie you Just one thing more He smiled at her reassuringly Did the Magpie say anything about how he intended to get in Yes by the side away from the corner of the street she said tremulously You see there s quite a space between the house and the one next door and besides the house next door is closed up there s nobody there the family has gone away for the summer The library window there is low enough to reach from the ground For a moment longer he held her close to him as though he could not let her go then bent and kissed her passionately And in that moment all the emotions he had known as he had walked blindly from Spider Jack s that night surged again upon him and that voice was whispering whispering whispering It is the only way it is the only way And then not daring to trust his voice he released her suddenly and stepped back out from under the stoop and the next instant he was across the deserted avenue Another and he had slipped through the iron gates that opened on the street driveway and in yet another he was crouched close up against the front door of the LaSalle mansion It was a large house a very large house one of the few that even amid the wealth and luxury of that quarter boasted its own grounds and those so restricted as scarcely to deserve the name but it was set far enough back from the street to escape the radius of the street lamps and so guarantee in its shadows security from observation It was not the Magpie s way the front door the obvious to the Magpie and his ilk was a thing always to be shunned Jimmie Dale s lips were set in a grim smile as his fingers worked with lightning speed now taking this instrument and now that from the leather pockets in the girdle beneath his shirt the penitentiaries were full of Magpies who shunned the obvious Very slowly very cautiously the door opened He listened breathlessly tensely The door closed again behind him He was inside now Stillness Blackness Not a sound A minute went by another And then as he stood there strained listening the silence itself began it seemed to palpitate and pound pound pound and be full of strange noises It was a horrible thing to kill a man CHAPTER XIV OUT OF THE DARKNESS A moment later Jimmie Dale stepped forward through the vestibule He was quite calm now a sort of cold merciless precision in every movement succeeding the riot of turbulent emotions that had possessed him as he had entered the house The half hour the maximum length of time before the Magpie would appear as he had estimated it when out there under the stoop with the Tocsin had dwindled now to perhaps twenty minutes twenty five at the outside Twenty five minutes Twenty five minutes was so little that for an instant the temptation was strong upon him to sacrifice rather than any of those precious minutes the Magpie instead And then in the darkness as he stole noiselessly across the hall he shook his head It would be a cowardly brutal thing to do What chance would a man with a record like the Magpie s stand if caught there How easy it would be to shift the murder of the supposed Henry LaSalle to the Magpie s shoulders Jimmie Dale s lips closed firmly Self preservation was perhaps the first law but he would save the Magpie if he could the Magpie should have his chance The man might be a criminal might deserve punishment at the hands of the law his liberty might be a menace to the community but he was not a murderer his life forfeit for a crime he had never committed If he Jimmie Dale could only in some way have arranged with the Tocsin out there to keep the Magpie away altogether But it could not be done without arousing the Magpie s suspicions and as a corollary to that afterward with the subsequent events would come the deluge The law of the underworld was clear concise and admitting of no appeal on that point to double cross a pal meant sooner or later a knife thrust a blackjack or But what difference did it make what form the execution of the sentence took And since then that was out of the question since he could not keep the Magpie away without practically risking his own life the Magpie at least must have his chance Jimmie Dale was at the library door now that according to the plan the Tocsin had drawn for the Magpie and as he remembered her description when she had told him her story earlier in the evening was just at the foot of the staircase How dark it was Though the stairs could be only a few feet away he could not see them And how intense the silence was again Here where he stood the slightest stir from above must have reached him but there was not a sound His hand felt out for the doorknob found it turned it and pushed the door open He stepped inside the room and closed the door behind him The safe according to the Tocsin s plan again was in that sort of alcove at the lower end of the library Jimmie Dale s flashlight played inquisitively about the room There was the window the only one in the room the window through which the Magpie proposed to enter there was the archway of the alcove with its no there were no longer any portieres and there was the safe he could see it quite plainly from where he stood at the upper end of the room The flashlight went out for the space of perhaps thirty seconds thirty seconds of absolute silence absolute stillness then the round white ray of the light again but glistening now on the nickel knobs and dial of the safe and Jimmie Dale was on his knees before it A low scarcely breathed exclamation that seemed to mingle anxiety and hesitation escaped him He who knew the make of every safe in the country knew this one for its true worth Twenty five minutes Could he open it in that time let alone with any time to spare It was not like the one in Spider Jack s it was the kind that the Magpie however clever he might be in his own way would be forced to negotiate with soup and with the attendant noise double his chance of discovery and capture and the responsibility for what might have happened UPSTAIRS No the Magpie must have his chance And besides the money in the safe apart why should not he Jimmie Dale have his own chance as well All this would help The motive robbery the perpetrator there was grim mockery on his lips now as the light went out and the sensitive fingers closed on the knob of the dial the perpetrator the Gray Seal It would afford excellent food for the violent editorial diatribes under which the police again would writhe in frenzy Stillness again Silence Only a low tense breathing only so faint that it could not be heard a foot away a curious scratching as from time to time the supersensitive fingers fell away from the dial to rub upon the carpet to increase even their sensitiveness by setting the nerves to throbbing through the skin surface at the tips And then Jimmie Dale s head ear pressed close against the safe to catch the tumbler s fall was lifted and the flashlight played again on the dial Twenty eight and a quarter left How fast the time went and how slowly Still the black shape crouched there in the darkness against the safe At times in strange ghostly flashes the nickel dial with the ray upon it seemed to leap out and glisten through the surrounding blackness at times the quick intake of breath as from great exertion at times faint musical little clicks as after abortive effort the dial whirled preparatory to a fresh attempt And then at last a gasp of relief Ah Came the sound barely audible as of steel sliding in well oiled grooves the muffled thud of metal meeting metal as the bolts shot back and the heavy door swung outward Jimmie Dale stretched his cramped limbs and wiped the moisture from his face then set to work again upon the inner door This was an easier matter far easier Five minutes perhaps a little more went by and then the inner door was open and the flashlight s ray was flooding the interior of the safe A queer little sound half of astonishment half of disappointment issued from Jimmie Dale s lips There was money here a great deal of money undoubtedly but there was no such sum as he had somehow fantastically imagined from the Magpie s evidently overcoloured story that there would be there was money ten packages of banknotes neatly piled in the bottom compartment but there was no half million of dollars He picked up one of the packages hurriedly and drew in his breath After all there was a great deal the notes were of hundred dollar denomination and on the bottom were two one thousand dollar bills Calculated roughly if each of the other nine packages contained a like amount the total must exceed a hundred thousand And now Jimmie Dale began to work with feverish haste From the leather girdle inside his shirt came the thin metal insignia case and a gray seal was stuck firmly on the dial knob of the safe This done he tucked away the packages of banknotes some into his pockets and some inside his shirt and then quickly ransacked the interior of the safe flauntingly spilling the contents of drawers and pigeonholes out upon the floor He stood up and leaving the safe door wide open walked back across the room to the window unfastened the catch and opened the window an inch or two The way was open now for the Magpie The Magpie would have no need to make any noise in forcing an entrance he would be able to see almost at a glance that he had been forestalled by the Gray Seal and that as far as he was concerned the game was up The Magpie had his chance If the Magpie did not take the hint and make his escape as noiselessly as he had entered it was his own fault He Jimmie Dale had given the Magpie his chance Jimmie Dale turned from the window and made his way out of the library to the foot of the stairs leaving the library door open behind him How long had he been Was it more or less than the twenty five minutes He did not know only as yet the Magpie had not come and now perhaps it did not make so much difference Where was he going now His foot was on the first stair and suddenly he drew it back the cold sweat bursting out on his forehead Where was he going now THE FIRST ROOM ON THE RIGHT AT THE HEAD OF THE LANDING From his inner consciousness as it were the answer in all the bald naked horror that it implied flashed upon him The first room on the right THAT man s room God how the darkness and the stillness began to palpitate again and suddenly seem to shriek out at him over and over the one single ghastly word MURDER It had been with him that thought all the time he had been working at the safe but it had been there then only subconsciously like some heavy nameless dread subjugated for the moment by the work he had had to do which had demanded the centred attention of every faculty he possessed But now the moment had come when there was only THAT before him only that nothing else only that the man upstairs in the first room to the right of the landing Why did he hesitate Why did he stand there while the priceless moments before daylight came were passing The man was a murderer a blotch on society and his life already forfeited he was living now only because the law had not found him out the man was a criminal bloodstained and his life because he had taken her father s life and had tried to take the Tocsin s own life stood between her and every hope of happiness robbing her even literally in a material sense of everything that the world could hold for her Why did he hesitate It was that man s life or hers It was the only way He put his foot upon the bottom step again paused still another instant and then began stealthily to mount the stairs The darkness There had never been it seemed such darkness before The stillness he had never known silence so heavy so full of strange premonitory pulsings a silence that seemed so incongruously full of clamouring whispers in his ears It must be those imagined whispers that were affecting his nerve for now as he gained the landing and slipped his automatic from his pocket his hand was shaking with a queer twitching motion For an instant fighting for his self composure he stood striving to locate his surroundings through the darkness The staircase was a circular one making the landing nearly at the front of the house and rearward from this the Tocsin had said a hallway ran down the centre with rooms on either side The first room to the right therefore should be just at his hand He reached out feeling cautiously there was nothing He edged to the right still nothing edged a little farther a sense of bewilderment growing upon him and finally his fingers touched the wall It was very strange The hallway must be much wider than he had understood it to be from what she had said He moved along now straight ahead of him his hand on the wall feeling for the door and with every step his bewilderment increased Surely there must be some mistake perhaps he had misunderstood He had come fully twice the distance that one would expect and yet there was no door Ah what was that His fingers closed on soft heavy velvet hangings These could hardly be in front of a door and yet what else could it be He drew the hangings warily apart and felt behind them It was a window but it was shuttered in some way evidently for he could not see out Jimmie Dale stood motionless there for fully a minute It seemed absurd preposterous the conviction that was being forced home upon him that there were no rooms on the right hand side of the corridor at all But that was not like the Tocsin accurate always in the most minute details The room must be still farther along He was tempted to use his flashlight but that as long as he could feel his way was an unnecessary risk A flashlight upstairs where a sleeping room door might be ajar or even wide open where some one wakeful THAT man himself perhaps might see it was quite another matter than a flashlight in the closed and deserted library below He went on once more still guiding himself by a light finger touch upon the wall passed another portiere similar to the first and after that another and finally stopped by bringing up abruptly against the end wall of the house It was certainly very strange There WERE no rooms on the right hand side of the corridor And here hanging across the end wall was another of those ubiquitous velvet portieres He parted it and a little to his surprise found a window that was not shuttered but that instead was heavily barred by an ornamental grille work He could see out however and found that he was looking directly out from the rear of the house A lamp from the side street threw what was undoubtedly the garage into shadowy outline and he made out below him a short stretch of yard between the garage and the house He remembered that now she had described all that to the Magpie There was no driveway between the front and the rear The house being on the corner the entrance to the garage was directly from the side street Yes she had described all that exactly as it was but he dropped the portiere and faced around carrying his hand in a nonplused way to his eyes but here upstairs within the house it was not as she had said it was at all What did it mean She could not have blundered so egregiously as that unless he caught his breath suddenly unless she had done so intentionally Was that it Had she surmised formed a suspicion of what was in his mind of what he meant to do and taken this means of defeating it If so well it was too late for that now There was one way only one way Whatever the cost whatever it might mean for him there was only one way out for her His flashlight was in his hand now and the round white ray shot down the corridor seemed suddenly to falter unsteadily swept in through an open door that was almost beside him and then as though a nerveless hand held it the ray dropped and played shakily on the toe of his boot before it went out A stifled cry rose to his lips Something cold like a hand of ice seemed to clutch at his heart Those portieres the wide richly carpeted corridor It was the corridor of the night before That room at his side was the room where he had seen Hilton Travers the chauffeur dead lashed in a chair He felt the sweat beads burst out anew upon his forehead IT WAS THE CRIME CLUB CHAPTER XV RETRIBUTION His brain seemed to whirl staggered as by some gigantic ghastly mockery The Crime Club HERE He had thought to creep upon that man and he had run blindly into the very heart and centre of these hell fiends nest Silently he stood there holding his breath as he listened now motionless as a statue forcing his mind to THINK He remembered that last night his impression of the place had been that it was more like some great private mansion than anything else Well he had been right it seemed He could have laughed aloud sardonically hysterically It was not so strange now that there were no rooms on the right hand side of the corridor And what could have suited their purpose better what by its very location its unimpeachable character could be a more ideal lair for them than this house And how grimly simple it was now the explanation In the five years that the false Henry LaSalle had been in possession they had cunningly remodelled the upper floor that was all It was quite clear now why the man never entertained why he had never been caught or found or known to be in communication with his fellow conspirators It was no longer curious that one might watch the door of the house for months at a stretch and go unrewarded for one s pains as the Tocsin had done when access to the house by those who frequented it was so easy through the garage on the side street and from the garage if their work there was in keeping with their clever contrivances within the house by an underground connection into say the cellar or basement Again Jimmie Dale checked that nervous unnatural inclination to laugh aloud Was there anything any single incident any single detail of all that had transpired that was not explained borne out as it could be explained and borne out in no other way save that the Crime Club should be no other than this very house itself It was the exposition of that favourite theory of his it was so obvious that therein lay its security He had mocked at the Magpie not many moments before on that score and now it was the beam in his own eye It was so obvious now so glaringly obvious that the Crime Club could have been nowhere else so obvious with every word of the Tocsin s story pointing it out like a signpost and he had not seen it And then suddenly every muscle grew strained and rigid WAS THERE SOME ONE IN THE CORRIDOR Was it some one moving or was it only fancy He listened while he strained his eyes through the darkness There was no sound only that abnormal heavy silence that yes he remembered that too now that had clung about him last night like a pall He could see nothing hear nothing but intuitively bringing a cold dismay the greater because it was something unknown intangible he FELT as though eyes were upon him that even in the darkness he was being watched And as he stood there then slowly there crept upon Jimmie Dale the sense of peril and disaster It was not intuition now it was certainty He was trapped It was the part of a fool to imagine that with their devil s cunning their cleverness their ingenuity he or any one else could enter that house unknown to its occupants Had he made electric contact when he had opened the front door and rung a signal here perhaps upstairs had he set some system of alarm at work when he had touched that window What did it matter the details that had heralded his entrance He was certain now that his presence in the house was known Only why had they left him so long without attack He shook his head with a quick impatient movement That too was obvious He was under observation Who was he Why had he come Was he simply a paltry safe tapper or was he one whom they had a real need to fear And then too there might well be another reason It was far from likely in fact unreasonable to imagine that all the men he had seen here the night before were in the house now Not many of them if any would LIVE here for CONSTANT daily coming and going even through the garage could not escape notice and of the servants probably a lesser breed of criminal some of them at least no doubt were engaged at that moment in watching his own house on Riverside Drive There was even the possibility that the man posing as Henry LaSalle was for the time being here alone He shook his head again He could hardly hope for that he had no right to hope for anything more now than a struggle with an inevitably fatal ending to himself but one in which at least he could sell his life as dearly as possible one in which perhaps he might pay the Tocsin s score with the man he had come to find If he could do that well after all the price was not too great There were no tremours of the muscles now It was Jimmie Dale the Gray Seal every faculty alert tense keyed up to its highest efficiency the brain cool keen and active fighting for his life The front door through which he had entered was an impossibility but there was the window in the library that he had opened if they would let him get that far That was as good a chance as any If he made an effort to find say a way to the flat above and chanced some means of escape there it would in no wise obviate an attack upon him and he would only be under the added disadvantage of unfamiliar surroundings Feeling out with his left hand his automatic thrown a little forward in his right he began to retrace his way along the blank wall of the corridor pausing between each step to listen moving silently his tread on the heavy carpet as noiseless as though it were some shadow creeping there Stillness utter absolute Always that stillness Always that sense of danger around him the tense bated expectancy of momentary attack a revolver flash through the darkness a sudden rush upon him But still there was nothing only the darkness only the silence He gained the head of the stairs and began to descend and now the strain began to tell upon his nerves again Again he was possessed of the mad impulse to cry out to do anything that would force the issue that would end the horrible unbearable suspense Why did that revolver shot not come Why had they not yet rushed upon him Why were they playing with him as a cat with a mouse Or was it all wild fanciful imagination NO What was that again He could have sworn this time that he had heard a sound but he could neither define its character nor locate the direction from which it had come He was at the foot of the stairs now and guiding himself by the wall moving now barely an inch at a time he reached the library door that he had left open and stole in over the threshold Halfway down the room and diagonally across from where he stood was the window In a moment now he could gain that but they would never let him go so easily and so it must come now in that next moment their attack Where were they Where were they now The table he must remember not to bump into the table A pause between each step he was crossing the room He was halfway to the window Had it been all fancy was he to And then Jimmie Dale stood motionless SOME ONE HAD CLOSED THE LIBRARY DOOR SOFTLY Stillness again A sort of deadly calm upon him Jimmie Dale felt out behind his back for the big library table that he had been circuiting if the window were wide open it might be done but to jump for it and stand silhouetted there during the pause necessary to fling the window up was little less than suicidal He edged back noiselessly until his fingers touched the table then lowering himself to his knees he backed in underneath it and lay flat upon the floor It was not much protection but it had one advantage if they switched on the lights it would show an EMPTY room for the first instant and that instant meant the first shot Where were they now By the library door How many of them were there Well it was their move Two could play at cat and mouse until until DAYLIGHT That wasn t very far off now and when that came he might still have the first shot but after that he turned his head quickly toward the window There was a faint scratching noise as of finger nails gripping the sill then the window very slowly almost silently was pushed steadily upward and a dark form loomed up outside and then crawling through a man dropped as though his feet were padded like a cat s on the floor inside the room The Magpie A flashlight s ray shot out and with a twisted smile propped now on his left elbow to give free play to his revolver arm Jimmie Dale followed the white spot eagerly with his eyes But it did not circle around instead the light was turned almost instantly toward the lower end of the room and a second later was holding steadily on the open door of the safe and the litter of papers on the floor Came a savage growl of amazed fury from the Magpie then his step down the room and as he reached the safe a torrent of unbridled blasphemy and then in a sort of staggered gasp as he leaned suddenly forward examining the knob of the dial The Gray Seal A moment the Magpie stood there and then cursing again in abandon turned and started back for the window his flashlight dancing before him and stopped a snarl of fury on his lips The flashlight was playing full on Jimmie Dale under the table Larry the Bat The Gray Seal By God choked the Magpie You you The Magpie s flashlight as he shifted it from his right hand to his left and wrenched out his revolver had fallen upon two men crouched close against the wall by the library door and he screamed out in an access of fury De double cross A plant De bulls You damned snitch Larry screamed out the Magpie and fired The bullet tore into the carpet beside Jimmie Dale Came answering shots from the men by the door and then the Magpie emptying his automatic at the two men as he ran the flame tongues cutting vicious lanes of fire through the darkness dashed for the window There was a cry the crash of a heavy body pitching to the floor and the Magpie had flung himself out through the window and in the momentary ensuing silence within the room came the sound of his footsteps running on the gravel below There was a low moan the movement as of some one staggering and lurching around and then the lights went on But for an instant Jimmie Dale did not move He was staring at the form of a man still and motionless on the floor in front of him the man who had posed as Henry LaSalle Dead The man was dead His mind ran riot for a moment Where were the others were there only these two Only these two in the house Only these two and one was dead And then Jimmie Dale was on his feet One was dead but there was still the other the man who was reeling there back turned to him by the electric light switch But even as Jimmie Dale sprang forward this second man clawing at the wall for support slipped to his knees and fell upon the carpet Jimmie Dale reached him snatched the revolver from his hand and bent over him It was the man whose name he did not know but whose face he had reason enough to know too well it was the leader of the Crime Club The man though evidently badly wounded smiled defiantly in spite of his pain So you re the Gray Seal he flung out contemptuously A clever enough safe cracker but only a lowbrow like the rest of them Another illusion dispelled Well you ve got the money better run hadn t you Jimmie Dale made no answer Satisfied that the man was too badly hurt to move he went and bent over the silent form in the centre of the room A moment s examination was enough Henry LaSalle was dead He stood there looking down at the man It was what he had come for though it was the Magpie not himself who had accomplished it The man was dead The words began to run through his mind in a queer reiteration The man was dead the man was dead He checked himself sharply He must think now think fast and think RIGHT The Magpie knew that Larry the Bat was the Gray Seal and as fast as the Magpie could get there the news would spread like wildfire through the underworld Death to the Gray Seal Death to the Gray Seal He could hear that slogan ringing again in his ears but as he had never heard it before with a snarl of triumph now as of wolves who at last had pulled their quarry down He had not a second to spare and yet that man wounded there on the floor What of him guilty of murder the brains of this inhuman monstrous organisation the one to whom more even than to that dead man the Tocsin owed the horror and the misery and the grief and despair that had come into her life What of him What of the Crime Club here What of this nest of vipers Were they to escape Were they to With a sudden low exclamation Jimmie Dale jumped for the table and snatching up the telephone rattled the hook violently Give me his voice came in well simulated gasps each like a man fighting for every word give me police headquarters Quick QUICK I ve been shot The wounded man on the floor raised himself on his elbow What are you doing he demanded in a startled way Are you mad Thank your stars you were lucky enough to get out of this alive and get out now while you have the chance Jimmie Dale pressed his hand firmly over the mouthpiece of the telephone I ll go he said with a cold smile when I ve settled with you for the murder of Henry LaSalle That man ejaculated the man scornfully pointing to the form on the floor So that s your game Going to try and cover your tracks Why you fool I LIVE here Do you think the police would imagine for an instant that I killed him I said HENRY LASALLE said Jimmie Dale evenly The man came farther up on his elbow a sudden look of fear in his face What what do you mean he cried hoarsely But Jimmie Dale was talking again into the telephone gasping choking out his words as before Police headquarters I m Henry LaSalle Fifth Avenue I I ve been shot Take down this statement I ll I ll be dead before you get here I m not the real Henry LaSalle at all We murdered Henry LaSalle in Australia and murdered Peter LaSalle here We we tried to kill the daughter but she ran away This house has been our headquarters for the last five years The man who shot me to night is the leader of the gang We quarrelled over the division of a haul He s here on the floor now wounded Get them all get them all damn them do you hear get them all They re out of the house now but lay a trap for them They always come in through the garage on the side street Oh God I m done for Break down the west walls of the rooms upstairs if you want proof of what the gang s been doing Hurry Hurry I m I m done for I Jimmie Dale permitted the telephone to drop with a clash from his hand to the table The face of the man on the floor was livid Who are you In God s name who are you he cried out wildly Does it matter inquired Jimmie Dale grimly Your game is up You ll go to the chair for the murder of Henry LaSalle if it is by proxy Those rooms upstairs alone are enough to damn you to prove every word of that dying confession but to morrow added to it will come the story of Marie LaSalle herself For a moment the man hung there swaying on his elbow his face working in ghastly fashion and then suddenly with a strange laugh he carried one hand swiftly to his mouth and laughed again and before Jimmie Dale could reach him was lifeless on the floor A tiny vial rolled away upon the carpet Jimmie Dale picked it up A drop or two of liquid still remained in it colourless clear like that liquid this same man had dropped into the rabbit s mouth the night before like the liquid in the glasses they had carried into that third room like the liquid that his man had said was from a formula of their own that was instantaneous in its action that defied detection by autopsy The set stern features of Jimmie Dale relaxed It was justice but it was also death In a surge of emotion the events of scarcely more than twenty four hours began to crowd upon him and then ominously dominant above all else that slogan of the underworld Death to the Gray Seal came ringing once more in his ears It brought him with a startled movement of his hand across his eyes to a realisation of his own desperate position Yes yes he must go The way was clear now for the Tocsin clear now for her He dropped the vial into his pocket and running to the safe quickly scraped the gray seal from the dial s knob then he drew the packages of money from his shirt and pockets and tossed them on the floor among the litter of papers already there she would get it back again when it had served its purpose it would be self evident that it was the proceeds of that day s sale of the estate s securities over which the quarrel had occurred And now the window He ran to it closed it and LOCKED it then laying the revolver he had taken from the leader down beside the man he stepped across the room again and drew the body of Henry LaSalle closer to the table as though the man had fallen there when the telephone had dropped from his hand It was done now On the floor beside him lay each man s weapon and both of the revolvers had been discharged several times Jimmie Dale paused on the library threshold for a final survey of the room It was done The way was clear for her And now if he could only save himself There was no chance for Larry the Bat Could he save JIMMIE DALE He crossed the hall a queer half grim half wistful smile on his lips unlocked the front door stepped out locked it behind him and in another moment doubling around the corner was running along like a hare along the side street CHAPTER XVI DEATH TO THE GRAY SEAL On Jimmie Dale ran Across on Fourth Avenue he swung on a car that took him to Astor Place Then striking east once more making a detour to avoid the Bowery he ran on at top speed again To reach the Sanctuary not before the Magpie should have spread the alarm that was impossible but to reach it before the underworld should have had time to recover its breath as it were before the underworld should have had time to act that was his only chance The Magpie had at the outside a start of fifteen minutes but he Jimmie Dale had probably retrieved five minutes of that in the time he had made in getting downtown That left the Magpie ten to the good How long would it take the Magpie to bring the underworld swarming like hornets around the Sanctuary On Larry the Bat ran At the Sanctuary were the clothes the belongings of Jimmie Dale Could he save Jimmie Dale If he could get there change and get out again the way was clear for him as clear as for the Tocsin now In a few hours the police would have every member of the Crime Club in the trap there would be no watch any more around his house on Riverside Drive and he would be free to return there and resume his normal life as Jimmie Dale again if he could make the Sanctuary in time But let the Magpie get there first let the underworld tear the place to pieces in its fury as it would do let them discover that hiding place under the flooring for instance and the Gray Seal would not be merely Larry the Bat but Jimmie Dale as well and a cry escaped him even as he ran it meant ruin the disgrace of an honoured name death crimes without number at his door Crimes The Gray Seal had never committed a crime But the crimes attributed to the Gray Seal he could not disprove not one of them He had meant them to appear as crimes and he had succeeded so well that the Gray Seal s name execrated was a synonym for the most callous dangerous and unscrupulous criminal of the age He was gasping for breath as finally making for the side door he darted into the alleyway that flanked the Sanctuary What story would the Magpie tell Not the truth of course that would let the Magpie in for what had happened that night for the Magpie must be well aware that he had shot at least one of the two men in that room But the truth wasn t necessary it was foreign and had no bearing on the one outstanding fact the Gray Seal was Larry the Bat At the present moment the Magpie had a double incentive for getting the Gray Seal the Gray Seal was the only one who could prove murder against him that night in the LaSalle mansion And afterwards when the police version of the affair was made public the Magpie to save himself would be careful enough to do or say nothing to contradict Henry LaSalle s confession Larry the Bat slipped in through the door halted there listened and then began to mount the rickety stairs with his silent tread At the top he paused again Nothing no sound They were not here yet so far he was in time He stepped to the Sanctuary door unlocked it passed into the squalid miserable room that had harboured him for so long as Larry the Bat locked the door behind him crossed quickly to the window to make sure that the shutters were closed and then for the first time as the gray light streaked in through the interstices he was conscious that it was already dawn So much the more need for haste then He whipped out his revolver and laid it at his hand on the dilapidated table then the flooring in the corner was up in an instant and he began to strip off the rags of Larry the Bat Boots mismated socks the torn patched trousers the greasy flannel shirt the threadbare coat the nondescript slouch hat were thrown in a pile on the floor and with them from their hiding place the grease paints and heterogeneous collection of make up accessories This done he began to slip on the clothes of Jimmie Dale and when half dressed turned to the table again to remove the characteristic grime stain and paint of Larry the Bat from face hands wrists throat and neck This was a longer more arduous task He reached for the cracked pitcher to pour more water into the basin and snatching up his revolver instead whirled to face the door Some one was outside He had caught the creak of a footstep upon the stairs In a flash he was across the room and crouched by the door Yes the step was nearer now at the head of the stairs on the landing His revolver lifted holding a steady bead on the door panel And then there came a low voice Jimmie Jimmie Are you there Quick Jimmie Are you there The Tocsin What was she doing here Why had he not warned her up there on the avenue fool that he was that of all places she was to keep away from here She slipped into the room as he unlocked the door They re coming Jimmie she panted breathlessly There s not an instant to lose Listen When the Magpie ran from the house I ran with him but it she tried to smile it wasn t to obey you to run away I had made up my mind I wouldn t do that it was to find out from him what had happened He told me you were the Gray Seal He did not suspect me He thinks you were no more than just Larry the Bat to me as you were to everybody else He went straight to Chicago Ike s gambling rooms and found the Skeeter s gang there you know them Red Mose the Midget Harve Thoms and the Skeeter you remember your fight with them over old Luddy s diamonds Well they have not forgotten either They are on their way here now The news that you are the Gray Seal is travelling like lightning all through the underworld there will be a mob here on the Skeeter s heels So Jimmie quick Run Run Half Larry the Bat half Jimmie Dale and run In another five minutes perhaps yes But there probably would not be five minutes and she if she were found here Yes he said quietly I ll get away in a moment You go at once I ll he was smiling at her reassuringly I ll meet you at She looked at him then for an instant interrupting him quickly as she shook her head I didn t notice Jimmie You cannot go like that can you It would be even worse than being caught as Larry the Bat Hurry then I am not going without you No he said Go now Go at once Marie while you can You have risked your life as it is to come here and tell me this For God s sake go now The great brown eyes were smiling bravely through a sudden mist She shook her head again Not without you Jimmie It brought a fierce wild throb of joy upon him and then a cold sickening fear Listen he cried out desperately You must go now You cannot take any chances now Marie Everything is right for you That man who posed as your uncle is dead the leader of the Crime Club is dead Don t you understand what that means You have only to be Marie LaSalle again and claim your own I cannot tell you all now there s no time That house was the Crime Club itself The police will get them all Don t you see Don t you see Everything is clear for you now and now go Go you must go She was staring at him a strange wonder in her face Clear All clear for me I I can go back to to my own life again It was as though she were whispering some amazing thing of unbelievable joy to herself YES he cried out again Yes But go go Marie But now for answer suddenly she reached out and took the key from the door and put it in the pocket of her dress We will go together Jimmie or not at all she said simply We are wasting precious moments Hurry and dress He hesitated miserably What could he do if she WOULD not go And it was true the moments were flying Better rather than futile argument to use them as she said There was still a chance Why not Five minutes He could do better than that He MUST do better than that Without a word he ran back across the room In frantic haste from face hands wrists and neck came the stain There was still time She was standing there by the door listening She the Tocsin she whom he loved she who all through the years that had gone had been so strangely elusive and yet so intimately a part of his life SHE was standing there now here with him in peril with every second that passed He had only to slip on his coat and vest now and make a bundle of Larry the Bat s things on the floor so that he could carry them away to destroy them He stooped to gather up the clothes and straightened suddenly and jumped toward the door again They are coming Jimmie she called in a low voice But he had already heard them the stairs were creaking loudly under the tread of many feet He pushed the Tocsin hurriedly back against the wall at the side of the door Stand there he said under his breath Out of the line of fire Don t move There was a rush against the door and then a voice growled Aw cut dat out Wot do youse want to do scare him away by bustin it Pick de lock an we ll lay for him inside till he shows up It was the Skeeter s voice The Skeeter and his gang the worst apaches in the city of New York Professional assassins death contractors he had called them and the lowest bidders A man s life any time for twenty five dollars No they were not likely to forget the affair of the pushcart man to forget old Luddy and his diamonds to forget the Gray Seal And they were only the vanguard of what was to come Some one was working at the lock now There was one way to stop that It would not take them long to find out that he WAS there once the door was opened Better know it with the door SHUT Jimmie Dale lifted his revolver coolly and fired through the panel A burst of yells answered the shot and among them high above the others the Magpie s scream We got him We got him He s dere now And then it seemed that pandemonium broke loose there was a volley of shots the bullets splintering through the door panels as from a machine gun so fast they came and then another rush against the door Flat on the floor but well back and to one side Jimmie Dale fired steadily again and again Came screams of pain yells and oaths and they fell back from the door And now from above from overhead came tumult windows thrown up the stamp of feet cries of fright And from the street a low sullen roar The underworld was gathering fast Once more the rush upon the door and Jimmie Dale a grim twisted smile upon his lips emptied his revolver into the panels Once more they fell back and then there came the Skeeter s voice snarling like an infuriated beast He ll get de lot of us like dis Cut it out Besides we ll have de bulls down here in a minute an he s OUR meat not theirs Dey d be too damned soft wid him dey d only send him to de chair Youse chase upstairs Mose an pass de word to beat it an beat it quick We ll BURN de skunk out dat s wot An de bulls can stand alongside an watch if dey likes but he s our meat Jimmie Dale did not dare to look at the Tocsin s face Mechanically he refilled the magazine of his automatic and lay there waiting The roar from the street grew louder They seemed to be fighting out there as though an inadequate number of police were trying to disperse a mob and not succeeding Pretty soon with the riot call in there would probably be a battle for the Gray Seal Sublime irony It was death at the hands of either one Children whimpered on the stairs outside men swore women cried feet shuffled hurriedly by as the tenement emptied Occasionally a pertinent invitation to him to remain where he was there was a vicious rip through the panel and the drumming whir of a bullet flying through the room And then a curious ominous crackling sound and then the smell of smoke Jimmie Dale stood up his face drawn and haggard The tenement would go like matchwood burn like a bonfire with any kind of a start and there was no doubt about the start The Skeeter the Magpie and the rest would have seen that it had headway enough to serve their purpose before either firemen or police could thwart them He Jimmie Dale could take his choice walk out into a bullet or stay there and he smiled miserably as his eyes fell upon the pile of Larry the Bat s clothing on the floor There was no longer need to worry about ITS destruction the fire would take care of that only too well And then a low bitter cry came to his lips and he clenched his hands If it were only himself only himself He crossed to the Tocsin and caught her in his arms Oh my God Marie he faltered The cape and hood had fallen from her and with the hood had fallen the gray streaked hair of Silver Mag and now as she smiled at him it was from a face that was very beautiful and very brave and very full of tenderness And he held her there and neither spoke It seeped in under the threshold of the door it came from everywhere filling the room the black strangling smoke Outside in the hall all was silence now save for that crackle of flame that grew in volume that came now in quick sharp reports like revolver shots From out in the street swelled a cry Death to the Gray Seal Then the clang of bells the roar and rattle of fire apparatus strident voices bellowing orders and the crowd again blood hungry Death to the Gray Seal There was a chance just one if the fire had no headway along the upper end of the landing and if they had not thought to set a watch for him ABOVE They the Magpie the Skeeter and his gang must have been driven even out of the house now by the smoke and flame Give me the key I am going to open the door Marie he said quietly Cover your face with a handkerchief anything and run to the LEFT to the next flight of stairs There are two flats above this we ll make the roof if we can Now are you ready It was an instant before she answered an instant in which she lifted her face to his and held his face between her two hands and then I am ready Jimmie He flung open the door his arm around her to help her forward and instinctively with a cry fell back for a moment With the inrush of the draft poured the smoke and through it lurid yellow showed the flames leaping from the stair well And then all was blind madness Together they ran At the foot of the stairs she fell recovered herself staggered up another and fell again He caught her up in his arms and staggering now as she had staggered went on His lungs seemed to be bursting His limbs grew weak and trembled under him He could not see or breathe The nauseating fumes suffocated him bringing an intolerable agony He gained the first landing above There was one more one more If he could only rest here for a moment Yes that was it rest It wasn t so bad here now She stirred in his arms struggled to her feet and he was helping her on again and up the next flight of stairs And suddenly he found himself laughing in hysteria for they were climbing a half stair half ladderway at the end of the upper landing and the open skylight was above them and they were drinking in the pure fresh air and now they were out upon the roof and the roar from the street was in their ears like the roar of great waters from some canyon far below Jimmie Dale tried to speak and found his lips were cracked and dry He wet them with his tongue Don t stand up we d be seen CRAWL he mumbled hoarsely It took a long time over one roof and then another and yet another and then through the skylight of a tenement whose occupants were either craning from the front windows or were on the street below It was perhaps half an hour and then they too were standing in the street and all about them the crowd was shouting in wild excitement Up the block inside the fire lines the Sanctuary was blazing furiously and now suddenly the wall seemed to bulge outward It brought a yell from the crowd Death to the Gray Seal She pulled at his arm Let us get away Let us get away Jimmie she whispered frantically A strange smile was on Jimmie Dale s lips We re safe now for always he whispered back Look The Sanctuary wall bulged farther outward seemed to hang an instant hesitant in mid air and fell with a mighty crash The Gray Seal was dead End of Project Gutenberg s The Adventures of Jimmie Dale by Frank L Packard END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF JIMMIE DALE This file should be named
