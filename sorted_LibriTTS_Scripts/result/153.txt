and leant with his forehead and arms against the framework his face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful child s who has felt the pricks of life somewhat before his time The well into which he was looking was as ancient as the village itself and from his present position appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining disk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down There was a lining of green moss near the top and nearer still the hart s tongue fern He said to himself in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy that the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a morning like this and would never draw there any more I ve seen him look down into it when he was tired with his drawing just as I do now and when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home But he was too clever to bide here any longer a small sleepy place like this A tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well The morning was a little foggy and the boy s breathing unfurled itself as a thicker fog upon the still and heavy air His thoughts were interrupted by a sudden outcry Bring on that water will ye you idle young harlican It came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the garden gate of a green thatched cottage not far off The boy quickly waved a signal of assent drew the water with what was a great effort for one of his stature landed and emptied the big bucket into his own pair of smaller ones and pausing a moment for breath started with them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well stood nearly in the centre of the little village or rather hamlet of Marygreen It was as old fashioned as it was small and it rested in the lap of an undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs Old as it was however the well shaft was probably the only relic of the local history that remained absolutely unchanged Many of the thatched and dormered dwelling houses had been pulled down of late years and many trees felled on the green Above all the original church hump backed wood turreted and quaintly hipped had been taken down and either cracked up into heaps of road metal in the lane or utilized as pig sty walls garden seats guard stones to fences and rockeries in the flower beds of the neighbourhood In place of it a tall new building of modern Gothic design unfamiliar to English eyes had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain obliterator of historic records who had run down from London and back in a day The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to the Christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level grass plot that had immemorially been the churchyard the obliterated graves being commemorated by eighteen penny cast iron crosses warranted to last five years II Slender as was Jude Fawley s frame he bore the two brimming house buckets of water to the cottage without resting Over the door was a little rectangular piece of blue board on which was painted in yellow letters Drusilla Fawley Baker Within the little lead panes of the window this being one of the few old houses left were five bottles of sweets and three buns on a plate of the willow pattern While emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an animated conversation in progress within doors between his great aunt the Drusilla of the sign board and some other villagers Having seen the school master depart they were summing up particulars of the event and indulging in predictions of his future And who s he asked one comparatively a stranger when the boy entered Well ye med ask it missus Williams He s my great nephew come since you was last this way The old inhabitant who answered was a tall gaunt woman who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject and gave a phrase of her conversation to each auditor in turn He come from Mellstock down in South Wessex about a year ago worse luck for n Belinda turning to the right where his father was living and was took wi the shakings for death and died in two days as you know Caroline turning to the left It would ha been a blessing if Goddy mighty had took thee too wi thy mother and father poor useless boy But I ve got him here to stay with me till I can see what s to be done with un though I am obliged to let him earn any penny he can Just now he s a scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham It keeps him out of mischty Why do ye turn away Jude she continued as the boy feeling the impact of their glances like slaps upon his face moved aside The local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of Miss or missus Fawley s as they called her indifferently to have him with her to kip ee company in your loneliness fetch water shet the winder shetters o nights and help in the bit o baking Miss Fawley doubted it Why didn t ye get the schoolmaster to take ee to Christminster wi un and make a scholar of ee she continued in frowning pleasantry I m sure he couldn t ha took a better one The boy is crazy for books that he is It runs in our family rather His cousin Sue is just the same so I ve heard but I have not seen the child for years though she was born in this place within these four walls as it happened My niece and her husband after they were married didn get a house of their own for some year or more and then they only had one till Well I won t go into that Jude my child don t you ever marry Tisn t for the Fawleys to take that step any more She their only one was like a child o my own Belinda till the split come Ah that a little maid should know such changes Jude finding the general attention again centering on himself went out to the bakehouse where he ate the cake provided for his breakfast The end of his spare time had now arrived and emerging from the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a path northward till he came to a wide and lonely depression in the general level of the upland which was sown as a corn field This vast concave was the scene of his labours for mister Troutham the farmer and he descended into the midst of it The brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all round where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the actual verge and accentuated the solitude The only marks on the uniformity of the scene were a rick of last year s produce standing in the midst of the arable the rooks that rose at his approach and the path athwart the fallow by which he had come trodden now by he hardly knew whom though once by many of his own dead family How ugly it is here he murmured The fresh harrow lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in a piece of new corduroy lending a meanly utilitarian air to the expanse taking away its gradations and depriving it of all history beyond that of the few recent months though to every clod and stone there really attached associations enough and to spare echoes of songs from ancient harvest days of spoken words and of sturdy deeds Every inch of ground had been the site first or last of energy gaiety horse play bickerings weariness Groups of gleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard Love matches that had populated the adjoining hamlet had been made up there between reaping and carrying Under the hedge which divided the field from a distant plantation girls had given themselves to lovers who would not turn their heads to look at them by the next harvest and in that ancient cornfield many a man had made love promises to a woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seed time after fulfilling them in the church adjoining But this neither Jude nor the rooks around him considered For them it was a lonely place possessing in the one view only the quality of a work ground and in the other that of a granary good to feed in The boy stood under the rick before mentioned and every few seconds used his clacker or rattle briskly At each clack the rooks left off pecking and rose and went away on their leisurely wings burnished like tassets of mail afterwards wheeling back and regarding him warily and descending to feed at a more respectful distance He sounded the clacker till his arm ached and at length his heart grew sympathetic with the birds thwarted desires They seemed like himself to be living in a world which did not want them Why should he frighten them away They took upon more and more the aspect of gentle friends and pensioners the only friends he could claim as being in the least degree interested in him for his aunt had often told him that she was not He ceased his rattling and they alighted anew Poor little dears said Jude aloud You SHALL have some dinner you shall There is enough for us all Farmer Troutham can afford to let you have some Eat then my dear little birdies and make a good meal They stayed and ate inky spots on the nut brown soil and Jude enjoyed their appetite A magic thread of fellow feeling united his own life with theirs Puny and sorry as those lives were they much resembled his own His clacker he had by this time thrown away from him as being a mean and sordid instrument offensive both to the birds and to himself as their friend All at once he became conscious of a smart blow upon his buttocks followed by a loud clack which announced to his surprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence used The birds and Jude started up simultaneously and the dazed eyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person the great Troutham himself his red face glaring down upon Jude s cowering frame the clacker swinging in his hand So it s Eat my dear birdies is it young man Eat dear birdies indeed I ll tickle your breeches and see if you say Eat dear birdies again in a hurry And you ve been idling at the schoolmaster s too instead of coming here ha n t ye hey That s how you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn Whilst saluting Jude s ears with this impassioned rhetoric Troutham had seized his left hand with his own left and swinging his slim frame round him at arm s length again struck Jude on the hind parts with the flat side of Jude s own rattle till the field echoed with the blows which were delivered once or twice at each revolution Don t ee sir please don t ee cried the whirling child as helpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked fish swinging to land and beholding the hill the rick the plantation the path and the rooks going round and round him in an amazing circular race I I sir only meant that there was a good crop in the ground I saw em sow it and the rooks could have a little bit for dinner and you wouldn t miss it sir and mister Phillotson said I was to be kind to em oh oh oh This truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more than if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all and he still smacked the whirling urchin the clacks of the instrument continuing to resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant workers who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business of clacking with great assiduity and echoing from the brand new church tower just behind the mist towards the building of which structure the farmer had largely subscribed to testify his love for God and man Presently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task and depositing the quivering boy on his legs took a sixpence from his pocket and gave it him in payment for his day s work telling him to go home and never let him see him in one of those fields again Jude leaped out of arm s reach and walked along the trackway weeping not from the pain though that was keen enough not from the perception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme by which what was good for God s birds was bad for God s gardener but with the awful sense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year in the parish and hence might be a burden to his great aunt for life With this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the village and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge and across a pasture Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms lying half their length on the surface of the damp ground as they always did in such weather at that time of the year It was impossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them at each tread Though Farmer Troutham had just hurt him he was a boy who could not himself bear to hurt anything He had never brought home a nest of young birds without lying awake in misery half the night after and often reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next morning He could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped from a fancy that it hurt them and late pruning when the sap was up and the tree bled profusely had been a positive grief to him in his infancy This weakness of character as it may be called suggested that he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before the fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that all was well with him again He carefully picked his way on tiptoe among the earthworms without killing a single one On entering the cottage he found his aunt selling a penny loaf to a little girl and when the customer was gone she said Well how do you come to be back here in the middle of the morning like this I m turned away What mister Troutham have turned me away because I let the rooks have a few peckings of corn And there s my wages the last I shall ever hae He threw the sixpence tragically on the table Ah said his aunt suspending her breath And she opened upon him a lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands doing nothing If you can t skeer birds what can ye do There don t ye look so deedy Farmer Troutham is not so much better than myself come to that But tis as Job said Now they that are younger than I have me in derision whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock His father was my father s journeyman anyhow and I must have been a fool to let ee go to work for n which I shouldn t ha done but to keep ee out of mischty More angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for dereliction of duty she rated him primarily from that point of view and only secondarily from a moral one Not that you should have let the birds eat what Farmer Troutham planted Of course you was wrong in that Jude

none	none	what The heavenly Jerusalem suggested the serious urchin Ay though I should never ha thought of it myself But I can t see no Christminster to day The boy strained his eyes also yet neither could he see the far off city He descended from the barn and abandoning Christminster with the versatility of his age he walked along the ridge track looking for any natural objects of interest that might lie in the banks thereabout When he repassed the barn to go back to Marygreen he observed that the ladder was still in its place but that the men had finished their day s work and gone away It was waning towards evening there was still a faint mist but it had cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country and along the river courses He thought again of Christminster and wished since he had come two or three miles from his aunt s house on purpose that he could have seen for once this attractive city of which he had been told But even if he waited here it was hardly likely that the air would clear before night Yet he was loth to leave the spot for the northern expanse became lost to view on retreating towards the village only a few hundred yards He ascended the ladder to have one more look at the point the men had designated and perched himself on the highest rung overlying the tiles He might not be able to come so far as this for many days Perhaps if he prayed the wish to see Christminster might be forwarded People said that if you prayed things sometimes came to you even though they sometimes did not He had read in a tract that a man who had begun to build a church and had no money to finish it knelt down and prayed and the money came in by the next post Another man tried the same experiment and the money did not come but he found afterwards that the breeches he knelt in were made by a wicked Jew This was not discouraging and turning on the ladder Jude knelt on the third rung where resting against those above it he prayed that the mist might rise He then seated himself again and waited In the course of ten or fifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the northern horizon as it had already done elsewhere and about a quarter of an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds parted the sun s position being partially uncovered and the beams streaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud The boy immediately looked back in the old direction Some way within the limits of the stretch of landscape points of light like the topaz gleamed The air increased in transparency with the lapse of minutes till the topaz points showed themselves to be the vanes windows wet roof slates and other shining spots upon the spires domes freestone work and varied outlines that were faintly revealed It was Christminster unquestionably either directly seen or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere The spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their shine going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles The vague city became veiled in mist Turning to the west he saw that the sun had disappeared The foreground of the scene had grown funereally dark and near objects put on the hues and shapes of chimaeras He anxiously descended the ladder and started homewards at a run trying not to think of giants Herne the Hunter Apollyon lying in wait for Christian or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his forehead and the corpses round him that remutinied every night on board the bewitched ship He knew that he had grown out of belief in these horrors yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the lights in the cottage windows even though this was not the home of his birth and his great aunt did not care much about him Inside and round about that old woman s shop window with its twenty four little panes set in lead work the glass of some of them oxidized with age so that you could hardly see the poor penny articles exhibited within and forming part of a stock which a strong man could have carried Jude had his outer being for some long tideless time But his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings were small Through the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward he was always beholding a gorgeous city the fancied place he had likened to the new Jerusalem though there was perhaps more of the painter s imagination and less of the diamond merchant s in his dreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer And the city acquired a tangibility a permanence a hold on his life mainly from the one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes he had so much reverence was actually living there not only so but living among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein In sad wet seasons though he knew it must rain at Christminster too he could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there Whenever he could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two which was not often he would steal off to the Brown House on the hill and strain his eyes persistently sometimes to be rewarded by the sight of a dome or spire at other times by a little smoke which in his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense Then the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he ascended to the point of view after dark or possibly went a mile or two further he would see the night lights of the city It would be necessary to come back alone but even that consideration did not deter him for he could throw a little manliness into his mood no doubt The project was duly executed It was not late when he arrived at the place of outlook only just after dusk but a black north east sky accompanied by a wind from the same quarter made the occasion dark enough He was rewarded but what he saw was not the lamps in rows as he had half expected No individual light was visible only a halo or glow fog over arching the place against the black heavens behind it making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or so He set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the schoolmaster might be he who never communicated with anybody at Marygreen now who was as if dead to them here In the glow he seemed to see Phillotson promenading at ease like one of the forms in Nebuchadnezzar s furnace He had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour and the fact now came into his mind He parted his lips as he faced the north east and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor You he said addressing the breeze caressingly were in Christminster city between one and two hours ago floating along the streets pulling round the weather cocks touching mister Phillotson s face being breathed by him and now you are here breathed by me you the very same Suddenly there came along this wind something towards him a message from the place from some soul residing there it seemed Surely it was the sound of bells the voice of the city faint and musical calling to him We are happy here He had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this mental leap and only got back to it by a rough recalling A few yards below the brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses made its appearance having reached the place by dint of half an hour s serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity They had a load of coals behind them a fuel that could only be got into the upland by this particular route They were accompanied by a carter a second man and a boy who now kicked a large stone behind one of the wheels and allowed the panting animals to have a long rest while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged in a drink round They were elderly men and had genial voices Jude addressed them inquiring if they had come from Christminster Heaven forbid with this load said they The place I mean is that one yonder He was getting so romantically attached to Christminster that like a young lover alluding to his mistress he felt bashful at mentioning its name again He pointed to the light in the sky hardly perceptible to their older eyes

tucked up under his arm having brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark slipped and fell into the road The carter eyed him while he picked it up and straightened the leaves Ah young man he observed you d have to get your head screwed on t other way before you could read what they read there Why asked the boy Oh they never look at anything that folks like we can understand the carter continued by way of passing the time On y foreign tongues used in the days of the Tower of Babel when no two families spoke alike They read that sort of thing as fast as a night hawk will whir Tis all learning there nothing but learning except religion And that s learning too for I never could understand it Yes tis a serious minded place Not but there s wenches in the streets o nights You

corrupt passions they ll do it if it can be done and polish un off like the workmen they be and turn un out wi a long face and a long black coat and waistcoat and a religious collar and hat same as they used to wear in the Scriptures so that his own mother wouldn t know un sometimes There tis their business like anybody else s But how should you know Now don t you interrupt my boy Never

your homely note with the rest And there s a street in the place the main street that ha n t another like it in the world I should think I did know a little about Christminster By this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their collars again Jude throwing a last adoring look at the distant halo turned and walked beside his remarkably well informed friend who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city its towers and halls and churches The waggon turned into a cross road whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his information and said he only wished he could talk half as well about Christminster as he Well tis oonly what has come in my way said the carter unboastfully I ve never been there no more than you but I ve picked up the knowledge here and there and you be welcome to it A getting about the world as I do and mixing with all classes of society one can t help hearing of things A friend o mine that used to clane the boots at the Crozier Hotel in Christminster when he was in his prime why I knowed un as well as my own brother in his later years Jude continued his walk homeward alone pondering so deeply that he forgot to feel timid He suddenly grew older It had been the yearning of his heart to find something to anchor on to cling to for some place which he could call admirable Should he find that place in this city if he could get there Would it be a spot in which without fear of farmers or hindrance or ridicule he could watch and wait and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the men of old of whom he had heard As the halo had been to his eyes when gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier so was the spot mentally to him as he pursued his dark way It is a city of light he said to himself The tree of knowledge grows there he added a few steps further on It is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to It is what you may call a castle manned by scholarship and religion After this figure he was silent a long while till he added It would just suit me IV Walking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration the boy an ancient man in some phases of thought much younger than his years in others was overtaken by a light footed pedestrian whom notwithstanding the gloom he could perceive to be wearing an extraordinarily tall hat a swallow tailed coat and a watch chain that danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky light as its owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots Jude beginning to feel lonely endeavoured to keep up with him Well my man I m in a hurry so you ll have to walk pretty fast if you keep alongside of me Do you know who I am Yes I think Physician Vilbert Ah I m known everywhere I see That comes of being a public benefactor Vilbert was an itinerant quack doctor well known to the rustic population and absolutely unknown to anybody else as he indeed took care to be to avoid inconvenient investigations Cottagers formed his only patients and his Wessex wide repute was among them alone His position was humbler and his field more obscure than those of the quacks with capital and an organized system of advertising He was in fact a survival The distances he traversed on foot were enormous and extended nearly the whole length and breadth of Wessex Jude had one day seen him selling a pot of coloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg the woman arranging to pay a guinea in instalments of a shilling a fortnight for the precious salve which according to the physician could only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on Mount Sinai and was to be captured only at great risk to life and limb Jude though he already had his doubts about this gentleman s medicines felt him to be unquestionably a travelled personage and one who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not strictly professional I s pose you ve been to Christminster Physician I have many times replied the long thin man That s one of my centres It s a wonderful city for scholarship and religion You d say so my boy if you d seen it Why the very sons of the old women who do the washing of the colleges can talk in Latin not good Latin that I admit as a critic dog Latin cat Latin as we used to call it in my undergraduate days And Greek Well that s more for the men who are in training for bishops that they may be able to read the New Testament in the original I want to learn Latin and Greek myself A lofty desire You must get a grammar of each tongue I mean to go to Christminster some day Whenever you do you say that Physician Vilbert is the only proprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all disorders of the alimentary system as well as asthma and shortness of breath Two and threepence a box specially licensed by the government stamp Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout I ll sell you mine with pleasure those I used as a student Oh thank you sir said Jude gratefully but in gasps for the amazing speed of the physician s walk kept him in a dog trot which was giving him a stitch in the side I think you d better drop behind my young man Now I ll tell you what I ll do I ll get you the grammars and give you a first lesson if you ll remember at every house in the village to recommend Physician Vilbert s golden ointment life drops and female pills Where will you be with the grammars I shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of five and twenty minutes past seven My movements are as truly timed as those of the planets in their courses Here I ll be to meet you said Jude With orders for my medicines Yes Physician Jude then dropped behind waited a few minutes to recover breath and went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for Christminster Through the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly at his inward thoughts as if they were people meeting and nodding to him smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen to spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea as if a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures giving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then He honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures in whom he now sincerely believed walking miles hither and thither among the surrounding hamlets as the Physician s agent in advance On the evening appointed he stood motionless on the plateau at the place where he had parted from Vilbert and there awaited his approach The road physician was fairly up to time but to the surprise of Jude on striking into his pace which the pedestrian did not diminish by a single unit of force the latter seemed hardly to recognize his young companion though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings had grown light Jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his wearing another hat and he saluted the physician with dignity Well my boy said the latter abstractedly I ve come said Jude You who
899_126232_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 are you 
none	none	Oh yes to be sure Got any orders lad Yes And Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers who were willing to test the virtues of the world renowned pills and salve The quack mentally registered these with great care And the Latin and Greek grammars Jude s voice trembled with anxiety What about them You were to bring me yours that you used before you took your degree Ah yes yes Forgot all about it all So many lives depending on my attention you see my man that I can t give so much thought as I would like to other things Jude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth and he repeated in a voice of dry misery You haven t brought em No But you must get me some more orders from sick people and I ll bring the grammars next time Jude dropped behind He was an unsophisticated boy but the gift of sudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him all at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of There was to be no intellectual light from this source The leaves dropped from his imaginary crown of laurel he turned to a gate leant against it and cried bitterly The disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness He might perhaps have obtained grammars from Alfredston but to do that required money and a knowledge of what books to order and though physically comfortable he was in such absolute dependence as to be without a farthing of his own At this date mister Phillotson sent for his pianoforte and it gave Jude a lead Why should he not write to the schoolmaster and ask him to be so kind as to get him the grammars in Christminster He might slip a letter inside the case of the instrument and it would be sure to reach the desired eyes Why not ask him to send any old second hand copies which would have the charm of being mellowed by the university atmosphere To tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it It was necessary to act alone After a further consideration of a few days he did act and on the day of the piano s departure which happened to be his next birthday clandestinely placed the letter inside the packing case directed to his much admired friend being afraid to reveal the operation to his aunt Drusilla lest she should discover his motive and compel him to abandon his scheme The piano was despatched and Jude waited days and weeks calling every morning at the cottage post office before his great aunt was stirring At last a packet did indeed arrive at the village and he saw from the ends of it that it contained two thin books He took it away into a lonely place and sat down on a felled elm to open it Ever since his first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its possibilities Jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable sort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one language into those of another He concluded that a grammar of the required tongue would contain primarily a rule prescription or clue of the nature of a secret cipher which once known would enable him by merely applying it to change at will all words of his own speech into those of the foreign one His childish idea was in fact a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is everywhere known as Grimm s Law an aggrandizement of rough rules to ideal completeness Thus he assumed that the words of the required language were always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the given language by those who had the art to uncover them such art being furnished by the books aforesaid When therefore having noted that the packet bore the postmark of Christminster he cut the string opened the volumes and turned to the Latin grammar which chanced to come uppermost he could scarcely believe his eyes The book was an old one thirty years old soiled scribbled wantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the letterpress and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier than his own day But this was not the cause of Jude s amazement He learnt for the first time that there was no law of transmutation as in his innocence he had supposed there was in some degree but the grammarian did not recognize it but that every word in both Latin and Greek was to be individually committed to memory at the cost of years of plodding Jude flung down the books lay backward along the broad trunk of the elm and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of an hour As he had often done before he pulled his hat over his face and watched the sun peering insidiously at him through the interstices of the straw This was Latin and Greek then was it this grand delusion The charm he had supposed in store for him was really a labour like that of Israel in Egypt What brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools he presently thought to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands There were no brains in his head equal to this business and as the little sun rays continued to stream in through his hat at him he wished he had never seen a book that he might never see another that he had never been born Somebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his trouble and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were further advanced than those of his grammarian But nobody did come because nobody does and under the crushing recognition of his gigantic error Jude continued to wish himself out of the world V During the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular vehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and by roads near Marygreen driven in a quaint and singular way 
93_126208_000003_000000	train-clean-360	In the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books Jude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead languages 
93_126208_000003_000001	train-clean-360	In fact his disappointment at the nature of those tongues had after a while been the means of still further glorifying the erudition of Christminster 
93_126208_000003_000002	train-clean-360	To acquire languages departed or living in spite of such obstinacies as he now knew them inherently to possess was a herculean performance which gradually led him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent process 
93_126208_000003_000003	train-clean-360	The mountain weight of material under which the ideas lay in those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him into a dogged mouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal 
93_126208_000004_000000	train-clean-360	He had endeavoured to make his presence tolerable to his crusty maiden aunt by assisting her to the best of his ability and the business of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence 
93_126208_000004_000001	train-clean-360	An aged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at a sale a creaking cart with a whity brown tilt obtained for a few pounds more and in this turn out it became Jude s business thrice a week to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters immediately round Marygreen 
none	none	The singularity aforesaid lay after all less in the conveyance itself than in Jude s manner of conducting it along its route Its interior was the scene of most of Jude s education by private study As soon as the horse had learnt the road and the houses at which he was to pause awhile the boy seated in front would slip the reins over his arm ingeniously fix open by means of a strap attached to the tilt the volume he was reading spread the dictionary on his knees and plunge into the simpler passages from Caesar Virgil or Horace as the case might be in his purblind stumbling way and with an expenditure of labour that would have made a tender hearted pedagogue shed tears yet somehow getting at the meaning of what he read and divining rather than beholding the spirit of the original which often to his mind was something else than that which he was taught to look for 
93_126208_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old Delphin editions because they were superseded and therefore cheap 
none	none	But bad for idle schoolboys it did so happen that they were passably good for him 
93_126208_000006_000002	train-clean-360	The hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously covered up the marginal readings and used them merely on points of construction as he would have used a comrade or tutor who should have happened to be passing by 
93_126208_000006_000003	train-clean-360	And though Jude may have had little chance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means he was in the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow 
none	none	While he was busied with these ancient pages which had already been thumbed by hands possibly in the grave digging out the thoughts of these minds so remote yet so near the bony old horse pursued his rounds and Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the stoppage of his cart and the voice of some old woman crying Two to day baker and I return this stale one 
93_126208_000008_000000	train-clean-360	He was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without his seeing them and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood began to talk about his method of combining work and play such they considered his reading to be which though probably convenient enough to himself was not altogether a safe proceeding for other travellers along the same roads 
none	none	There were murmurs 
93_126208_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Then a private resident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the baker s boy should not be allowed to read while driving and insisted that it was the constable s duty to catch him in the act and take him to the police court at Alfredston and get him fined for dangerous practices on the highway 
93_126208_000008_000003	train-clean-360	The policeman thereupon lay in wait for Jude and one day accosted him and cautioned him 
none	none	As Jude had to get up at three o clock in the morning to heat the oven and mix and set in the bread that he distributed later in the day he was obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying the sponge so that if he could not read his classics on the highways he could hardly study at all The only thing to be done was therefore to keep a sharp eye ahead and around him as well as he could in the circumstances and slip away his books as soon as anybody loomed in the distance the policeman in particular 
93_126208_000009_000002	train-clean-360	To do that official justice he did not put himself much in the way of Jude s bread cart considering that in such a lonely district the chief danger was to Jude himself and often on seeing the white tilt over the hedges he would move in another direction 
none	none	On a day when Fawley was getting quite advanced being now about sixteen and had been stumbling through the Carmen Saeculare on his way home he found himself to be passing over the high edge of the plateau by the Brown House The light had changed and it was the sense of this which had caused him to look up 
93_126208_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The sun was going down and the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in the opposite quarter 
none	none	His mind had become so impregnated with the poem that in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years before had caused him to kneel on the ladder he stopped the horse alighted and glancing round to see that nobody was in sight knelt down on the roadside bank with open book 
93_126208_000010_000004	train-clean-360	He turned first to the shiny goddess who seemed to look so softly and critically at his doings then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand as he began 
none	none	Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana 
93_126208_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The horse stood still till he had finished the hymn which Jude repeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never have thought of humouring in broad daylight 
93_126208_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Reaching home he mused over his curious superstition innate or acquired in doing this and the strange forgetfulness which had led to such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished next to being a scholar to be a Christian divine 
93_126208_000013_000001	train-clean-360	It had all come of reading heathen works exclusively 
93_126208_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The more he thought of it the more convinced he was of his inconsistency 
93_126208_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He began to wonder whether he could be reading quite the right books for his object in life 
93_126208_000013_000004	train-clean-360	Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan literature and the mediaeval colleges at Christminster that ecclesiastical romance in stone 
none	none	Ultimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken up a wrong emotion for a Christian young man 
93_126208_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He had dabbled in Clarke s Homer but had never yet worked much at the New Testament in the Greek though he possessed a copy obtained by post from a second hand bookseller 
93_126208_000014_000002	train-clean-360	He abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a new dialect and for a long time onward limited his reading almost entirely to the Gospels and Epistles in Griesbach s text 
93_126208_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Moreover on going into Alfredston one day he was introduced to patristic literature by finding at the bookseller s some volumes of the Fathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the neighbourhood 
93_126208_000015_000000	train-clean-360	As another outcome of this change of groove he visited on Sundays all the churches within a walk and deciphered the Latin inscriptions on fifteenth century brasses and tombs 
93_126208_000015_000001	train-clean-360	On one of these pilgrimages he met with a hunch backed old woman of great intelligence who read everything she could lay her hands on and she told him more yet of the romantic charms of the city of light and lore 
none	none	Thither he resolved as firmly as ever to go 
93_126208_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But how live in that city 
93_126208_000016_000001	train-clean-360	At present he had no income at all 
93_126208_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He had no trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which he could subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which might spread over many years 
93_126208_000017_000000	train-clean-360	What was most required by citizens 
93_126208_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Food clothing and shelter An income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre for making the second he felt a distaste the preparation of the third requisite he inclined to 
93_126208_000017_000002	train-clean-360	They built in a city therefore he would learn to build 
93_126208_000017_000003	train-clean-360	He thought of his unknown uncle his cousin Susanna s father an ecclesiastical worker in metal and somehow mediaeval art in any material was a trade for which he had rather a fancy 
93_126208_000017_000004	train-clean-360	He could not go far wrong in following his uncle s footsteps and engaging himself awhile with the carcases that contained the scholar souls 
93_126208_000018_000000	train-clean-360	As a preliminary he obtained some small blocks of freestone metal not being available and suspending his studies awhile occupied his spare half hours in copying the heads and capitals in his parish church 
93_126208_000019_000000	train-clean-360	There was a stone mason of a humble kind in Alfredston and as soon as he had found a substitute for himself in his aunt s little business he offered his services to this man for a trifling wage Here Jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of freestone working 
93_126208_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Some time later he went to a church builder in the same place and under the architect s direction became handy at restoring the dilapidated masonries of several village churches round about 
93_126208_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Not forgetting that he was only following up this handicraft as a prop to lean on while he prepared those greater engines which he flattered himself would be better fitted for him he yet was interested in his pursuit on its own account 
93_126208_000020_000001	train-clean-360	He now had lodgings during the week in the little town whence he returned to Marygreen village every Saturday evening 
none	none	And thus he reached and passed his nineteenth year VI At this memorable date of his life he was one Saturday returning from Alfredston to Marygreen about three o clock in the afternoon It was fine warm and soft summer weather and he walked with his tools at his back his little chisels clinking faintly against the larger ones in his basket 
93_126209_000002_000001	train-clean-360	It being the end of the week he had left work early and had come out of the town by a round about route which he did not usually frequent having promised to call at a flour mill near Cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt 
93_126209_000003_000000	train-clean-360	He was in an enthusiastic mood 
93_126209_000003_000001	train-clean-360	He seemed to see his way to living comfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two and knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which he had dreamed so much 
93_126209_000003_000002	train-clean-360	He might of course have gone there now in some capacity or other but he preferred to enter the city with a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at present 
93_126209_000003_000003	train-clean-360	A warm self content suffused him when he considered what he had already done 
93_126209_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Now and then as he went along he turned to face the peeps of country on either side of him 
none	none	But he hardly saw them the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when less occupied and the one matter which really engaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far
93_126209_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I have acquired quite an average student s power to read the common ancient classics Latin in particular This was true Jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with great ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary conversations therein 
none	none	I have read two books of the Iliad besides being pretty familiar with passages such as the speech of Phoenix in the ninth book the fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth the appearance of Achilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth and the funeral games in the twenty third I have also done some Hesiod a little scrap of Thucydides and a lot of the Greek Testament 
93_126209_000005_000002	train-clean-360	I wish there was only one dialect all the same 
93_126209_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 I have done some mathematics including the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books of Euclid and algebra as far as simple equations 
93_126209_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I know something of the Fathers and something of Roman and English history 
93_126209_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 These things are only a beginning 
none	none	But I shall not make much farther advance here from the difficulty of getting books 
93_126209_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Hence I must next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster Once there I shall so advance with the assistance I shall there get that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish ignorance 
93_126209_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I must save money and I will and one of those colleges shall open its doors to me shall welcome whom now it would spurn if I wait twenty years for the welcome 
none	none	I ll be D D before I have done 
93_126209_000010_000000	train-clean-360	And then he continued to dream and thought he might become even a bishop by leading a pure energetic wise Christian life 
93_126209_000010_000001	train-clean-360	And what an example he would set 
none	none	If his income were Lfive thousand a year he would give away Lfour thousand five hundred in one form and another and live sumptuously for him on the remainder 
93_126209_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Well on second thoughts a bishop was absurd 
none	none	He would draw the line at an archdeacon 
93_126209_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Perhaps a man could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of archdeacon as in that of bishop 
93_126209_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Yet he thought of the bishop again 
none	none	Meanwhile I will read as soon as I am settled in Christminster the books I have not been able to get hold of here Livy Tacitus Herodotus Aeschylus Sophocles Aristophanes Ha ha ha
93_126209_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Hoity toity

93_126209_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The sounds were expressed in light voices on the other side of the hedge but he did not notice them His thoughts went on 
none	none	Euripides Plato Aristotle Lucretius Epictetus Seneca Antoninus Then I must master other things the Fathers thoroughly Bede and ecclesiastical history generally a smattering of Hebrew I only know the letters as yet Hoity toity
93_126209_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 but I can work hard 
93_126209_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I have staying power in abundance thank God and it is that which tells 
93_126209_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Yes Christminster shall be my Alma Mater and I ll be her beloved son in whom she shall be well pleased 
93_126209_000016_000000	train-clean-360	In his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude s walk had slackened and he was now standing quite still looking at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern 
93_126209_000016_000001	train-clean-360	On a sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear and he became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him and had fallen at his feet 
93_126209_000017_000000	train-clean-360	A glance told him what it was a piece of flesh the characteristic part of a barrow pig which the countrymen used for greasing their boots as it was useless for any other purpose 
93_126209_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Pigs were rather plentiful hereabout being bred and fattened in large numbers in certain parts of North Wessex 
93_126209_000018_000000	train-clean-360	On the other side of the hedge was a stream whence as he now for the first time realized had come the slight sounds of voices and laughter that had mingled with his dreams 
93_126209_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He mounted the bank and looked over the fence 
93_126209_000018_000002	train-clean-360	On the further side of the stream stood a small homestead having a garden and pig sties attached in front of it beside the brook three young women were kneeling with buckets and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs chitterlings which they were washing in the running water 
none	none	One or two pairs of eyes slyly glanced up and perceiving that his attention had at last been attracted and that he was watching them they braced themselves for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity
93_126209_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you said Jude severely 
93_126209_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I DIDN T throw it I tell you asserted one girl to her neighbour as if unconscious of the young man s presence 
93_126209_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Nor I the second answered 
93_126209_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Anny how can you said the third 
93_126209_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 If I had thrown anything at all it shouldn t have been THAT 
none	none	Pooh 
93_126209_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I don t care for him And they laughed and continued their work without looking up still ostentatiously accusing each other 
93_126209_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Jude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face and caught their remarks 
93_126209_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 YOU didn t do it oh no he said to the up stream one of the three 
93_126209_000027_000000	train-clean-360	She whom he addressed was a fine dark eyed girl not exactly handsome but capable of passing as such at a little distance despite some coarseness of skin and fibre 
93_126209_000027_000001	train-clean-360	She had a round and prominent bosom full lips perfect teeth and the rich complexion of a Cochin hen s egg 
none	none	She was a complete and substantial female animal no more no less and Jude was almost certain that to her was attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him That you ll never be told said she deedily
93_126209_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Whoever did it was wasteful of other people s property 
93_126209_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s nothing 
93_126209_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 But you want to speak to me I suppose 
93_126209_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes if you like to 
93_126209_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall I clamber across or will you come to the plank above here 
none	none	Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity for somehow or other the eyes of the brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words and there was a momentary flash of intelligence a dumb announcement of affinity in posse between herself and him which so far as Jude Fawley was concerned had no sort of premeditation in it She saw that he had singled her out from the three as a woman is singled out in such cases for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance but in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of their lives is to be occupied with the feminine 
93_126209_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Springing to her feet she said Bring back what is lying there 
93_126209_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her father s business had prompted her signal to him 
93_126209_000036_000001	train-clean-360	He set down his basket of tools picked up the scrap of offal beat a pathway for himself with his stick and got over the hedge 
93_126209_000036_000002	train-clean-360	They walked in parallel lines one on each bank of the stream towards the small plank bridge 
93_126209_000036_000003	train-clean-360	As the girl drew nearer to it she gave without Jude perceiving it an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her cheeks in succession by which curious and original manoeuvre she brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect dimple which she was able to retain there as long as she continued to smile 
93_126209_000036_000004	train-clean-360	This production of dimples at will was a not unknown operation which many attempted but only a few succeeded in accomplishing 
93_126209_000037_000000	train-clean-360	They met in the middle of the plank and Jude tossing back her missile seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him 
none	none	But she slyly looking in another direction swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge till moved by amatory curiosity she turned her eyes critically upon him You don t think I would shy things at you Oh no
93_126209_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 We are doing this for my father who naturally doesn t want anything thrown away 
93_126209_000041_000001	train-clean-360	He makes that into dubbin She nodded towards the fragment on the grass 
93_126209_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 What made either of the others throw it I wonder Jude asked politely accepting her assertion though he had very large doubts as to its truth 
93_126209_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Impudence 
93_126209_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Don t tell folk it was I mind 
none	none	How can I I don t know your name Ah no Shall I tell it to you Do
93_126209_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Arabella Donn 
93_126209_000047_000001	train-clean-360	I m living here 
93_126209_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I must have known it if I had often come this way 
93_126209_000048_000001	train-clean-360	But I mostly go straight along the high road 
93_126209_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 My father is a pig breeder and these girls are helping me wash the innerds for black puddings and such like 
93_126209_000050_000000	train-clean-360	They talked a little more and a little more as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the hand rail of the bridge 
93_126209_000050_000001	train-clean-360	The unvoiced call of woman to man which was uttered very distinctly by Arabella s personality held Jude to the spot against his intention almost against his will and in a way new to his experience 
none	none	It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this moment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such but had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes He gazed from her eyes to her mouth thence to her bosom and to her full round naked arms wet mottled with the chill of the water and firm as marble
93_126209_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 What a nice looking girl you are he murmured though the words had not been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism 
none	none	Ah you should see me Sundays she said piquantly
93_126209_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t suppose I could he answered
93_126209_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 That s for you to think on 
93_126209_000054_000001	train-clean-360	There s nobody after me just now though there med be in a week or two She had spoken this without a smile and the dimples disappeared 
93_126209_000055_000000	train-clean-360	Jude felt himself drifting strangely but could not help it 
93_126209_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 Will you let me 
93_126209_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t mind 
93_126209_000057_000000	train-clean-360	By this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning her face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking operation before mentioned Jude being still unconscious of more than a general impression of her appearance 
93_126209_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 Next Sunday he hazarded To morrow that is 
none	none	Yes
93_126209_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall I call 
none	none	Yes She brightened with a little glow of triumph swept him almost tenderly with her eyes in turning and retracing her steps down the brookside grass rejoined her companions 
93_126209_000062_000000	train-clean-360	Jude Fawley shouldered his tool basket and resumed his lonely way filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze 
93_126209_000062_000001	train-clean-360	He had just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere which had evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went for he knew not how long but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass 
93_126209_000062_000002	train-clean-360	The intentions as to reading working and learning which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes earlier were suffering a curious collapse into a corner he knew not how 
none	none	Well it s only a bit of fun he said to himself faintly conscious that to common sense there was something lacking and still more obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had drawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her something in her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream 
93_126209_000063_000001	train-clean-360	It had been no vestal who chose THAT missile for opening her attack on him He saw this with his intellectual eye just for a short fleeting while as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness 
93_126209_000063_000002	train-clean-360	And then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn and Jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected though it had lain close beside him 
93_126209_000063_000003	train-clean-360	He was to meet this enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday 
93_126209_000064_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions and she silently resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid stream 
none	none	Catched un my dear laconically asked the girl called Anny I don t know I wish I had thrown something else than that regretfully murmured Arabella
93_126209_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Lord he s nobody though you med think so 
none	none	He used to drive old Drusilla Fawley s bread cart out at Marygreen till he prenticed himself at Alfredston 
93_126209_000067_000002	train-clean-360	Since then he s been very stuck up and always reading 
93_126209_000067_000003	train-clean-360	He wants to be a scholar they say 
none	none	Oh I don t care what he is or anything about n 
93_126209_000068_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you think it my child 
93_126209_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh don t ye 
none	none	You needn t try to deceive us What did you stay talking to him for if you didn t want un 
93_126209_000069_000003	train-clean-360	Whether you do or whether you don t he s as simple as a child 
none	none	I could see it as you courted on the bridge when he looked at ee as if he had never seen a woman before in his born days Well he s to be had by any woman who can get him to care for her a bit if she likes to set herself to catch him the right way VII The next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping ceiling looking at the books on the table and then at the black mark on the plaster above them made by the smoke of his lamp in past months It was Sunday afternoon four and twenty hours after his meeting with Arabella Donn During the whole bygone week he had been resolving to set this afternoon apart for a special purpose the re reading of his Greek Testament his new one with better type than his old copy following Griesbach s text as amended by numerous correctors and with variorum readings in the margin He was proud of the book having obtained it by boldly writing to its London publisher a thing he had never done before He had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon s reading under the quiet roof of his great aunt s house as formerly where he now slept only two nights a week But a new thing a great hitch had happened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life and he felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter skin and cannot understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its new one He would not go out to meet her after all He sat down opened the book and with his elbows firmly planted on the table and his hands to his temples began at the beginning HE KAINE DIATHEKE Had he promised to call for her Surely he had She would wait indoors poor girl and waste all her afternoon on account of him There was a something in her too which was very winning apart from promises He ought not to break faith with her Even though he had only Sundays and week day evenings for reading he could afford one afternoon seeing that other young men afforded so many After to day he would never probably see her again Indeed it would be impossible considering what his plans were In short as if materially a compelling arm of extraordinary muscular power seized hold of him something which had nothing in common with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto This seemed to care little for his reason and his will nothing for his so called elevated intentions and moved him along as a violent schoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar in a direction which tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no respect and whose life had nothing in common with his own except locality HE KAINE DIATHEKE was no more heeded and the predestinate Jude sprang up and across the room Foreseeing such an event he had already arrayed himself in his best clothes In three minutes he was out of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant hollow of corn ground which lay between the village and the isolated house of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland As he walked he looked at his watch He could be back in two hours easily and a good long time would still remain to him for reading after tea Passing the few unhealthy fir trees and cottage where the path joined the highway he hastened along and struck away to the left descending the steep side of the country to the west of the Brown House Here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook that oozed from it and followed the stream till he reached her dwelling A smell of piggeries came from the back and the grunting of the originators of that smell He entered the garden and knocked at the door with the knob of his stick Somebody had seen him through the window for a male voice on the inside said Arabella Here s your young man come coorting Mizzle my girl Jude winced at the words Courting in such a businesslike aspect as it evidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he was thinking of He was going to walk with her perhaps kiss her but courting was too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas The door was opened and he entered just as Arabella came downstairs in radiant walking attire Take a chair mister What s your name said her father an energetic black whiskered man in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard from outside I d rather go out at once wouldn t you she whispered to Jude Yes said he We ll walk up to the Brown House and back we can do it in half an hour Arabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt glad he had come and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto haunted him First they clambered to the top of the great down during which ascent he had occasionally to take her hand to assist her Then they bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway which they followed till it intersected the high road at the Brown House aforesaid the spot of his former fervid desires to behold Christminster But he forgot them now He talked the commonest local twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt in discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently adored university and passed the spot where he had knelt to Diana and Phoebus without remembering that there were any such people in the mythology or that the sun was anything else than a useful lamp for illuminating Arabella s face An indescribable lightness of heel served to lift him along and Jude the incipient scholar prospective D D professor bishop or what not felt himself honoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country wench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her Sunday frock and ribbons They reached the Brown House barn the point at which he had planned to turn back While looking over the vast northern landscape from this spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke from the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a distance of a couple of miles It is a fire said Arabella Let s run and see it do It is not far The tenderness which had grown up in Jude s bosom left him no will to thwart her inclination now which pleased him in affording him excuse for a longer time with her They started off down the hill almost at a trot but on gaining level ground at the bottom and walking a mile they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than it had seemed Having begun their journey however they pushed on but it was not till five o clock that they found themselves on the scene the distance being altogether about half a dozen miles from Marygreen and three from Arabella s The conflagration had been got under by the time they reached it and after a short inspection of the melancholy ruins they retraced their steps their course lying through the town of Alfredston Arabella said she would like some tea and they entered an inn of an inferior class and gave their order As it was not for beer they had a long time to wait The maid servant recognized Jude and whispered her surprise to her mistress in the background that he the student who kept hisself up so particular should have suddenly descended so low as to keep company with Arabella The latter guessed what was being said and laughed as she met the serious and tender gaze of her lover the low and triumphant laugh of a careless woman who sees she is winning her game They sat and looked round the room and at the picture of Samson and Delilah which hung on the wall and at the circular beer stains on the table and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust The whole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which few places can produce like a tap room on a Sunday evening when the setting sun is slanting in and no liquor is going and the unfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest It began to grow dusk They could not wait longer really for the tea they said Yet what else can we do asked Jude It is a three mile walk for you I suppose we can have some beer said Arabella Beer oh yes I had forgotten that Somehow it seems odd to come to a public house for beer on a Sunday evening But we didn t No we didn t Jude by this time wished he was out of such an uncongenial atmosphere but he ordered the beer which was promptly brought Arabella tasted it Ugh she said Jude tasted What s the matter with it he asked I don t understand beer very much now it is true
899_126232_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I like it 
none	none	well enough but it is bad to read on and I find coffee better But this seems all right Adulterated I can t touch it She mentioned three or four ingredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops much to Jude s surprise How much you know he said good humouredly Nevertheless she returned to the beer and drank her share and they went on their way It was now nearly dark and as soon as they had withdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together till they touched each other She wondered why he did not put his arm round her waist but he did not he merely said what to himself seemed a quite bold enough thing Take my arm She took it thoroughly up to the shoulder He felt the warmth of her body against his and putting his stick under his other arm held with his right hand her right as it rested in its place Now we are well together dear aren t we he observed Yes said she adding to herself Rather mild How fast I have become he was thinking Thus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland where they could see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom From this point the only way of getting to Arabella s was by going up the incline and dipping again into her valley on the right Before they had climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been walking on the grass unseen These lovers you find em out o doors in all seasons and weathers lovers and homeless dogs only said one of the men as they vanished down the hill Arabella tittered lightly Are we lovers asked Jude You know best But you can tell me For answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder Jude took the hint and encircling her waist with his arm pulled her to him and kissed her They walked now no longer arm in arm but as she had desired clasped together After all what did it matter since it was dark said Jude to himself When they were half way up the long hill they paused as by arrangement and he kissed her again They reached the top and he kissed her once more You can keep your arm there if you would like to she said gently He did so thinking how trusting she was Thus they slowly went towards her home He had left his cottage at half past three intending to be sitting down again to the New Testament by half past five It was nine o clock when with another embrace he stood to deliver her up at her father s door She asked him to come in if only for a minute as it would seem so odd otherwise and as if she had been out alone in the dark He gave way and followed her in Immediately that the door was opened he found in addition to her parents several neighbours sitting round They all spoke in a congratulatory manner and took him seriously as Arabella s intended partner They did not belong to his set or circle and he felt out of place and embarrassed He had not meant this a mere afternoon of pleasant walking with Arabella that was all he had meant He did not stay longer than to speak to her stepmother a simple quiet woman without features or character and bidding them all good night plunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down But that sense was only temporary Arabella soon re asserted her sway in his soul He walked as if he felt himself to be another man from the Jude of yesterday What were his books to him what were his intentions hitherto adhered to so strictly as to not wasting a single minute of time day by day Wasting It depended on your point of view to define that he was just living for the first time not wasting life It was better to love a woman than to be a graduate or a parson ay or a pope When he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed and a general consciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things confronting him He went upstairs without a light and the dim interior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry There lay his book open just as he had left it and the capital letters on the title page regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight like the unclosed eyes of a dead man HE KAINE DIATHEKE Jude had to leave early next morning for his usual week of absence at lodgings and it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his basket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had brought with him He kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself Arabella on the contrary made them public among all her friends and acquaintance Retracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours earlier under cover of darkness with his sweetheart by his side he reached the bottom of the hill where he walked slowly and stood still He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss As the sun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed there since Jude looked on the ground and sighed He looked closely and could just discern in the damp dust the imprints of their feet as they had stood locked in each other s arms She was not there now and the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of nature so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart which nothing could fill A pollard willow stood close to the place and that willow was different from all other willows in the world Utter annihilation of the six days which must elapse before he could see her again as he had promised would have been his intensest wish if he had had only the week to live An hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her two companions of the Saturday She passed unheedingly the scene of the kiss and the willow that marked it though chattering freely on the subject to the other two And what did he tell ee next Then he said And she related almost word for word some of his tenderest speeches If Jude had been behind the fence he would have felt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his sayings and doings on the previous evening were private You ve got him to care for ee a bit nation if you han t murmured Anny judicially It s well to be you In a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low hungry tone of latent sensuousness I ve got him to care for me yes But I want him to more than care for me I want him to have me to marry me I must have him I can t do without him He s the sort of man I long for I shall go mad if I can t give myself to him altogether I felt I should when I first saw him As he is a romancing straightfor ard honest chap he s to be had and as a husband if you set about catching him in the right way Arabella remained thinking awhile What med be the right way she asked Oh you don t know you don t said Sarah the third girl On my word I don t No further that is than by plain courting and taking care he don t go too far The third girl looked at the second She DON T know Tis clear she don t said Anny And having lived in a town too as one may say Well we can teach ee som at then as well as you us Yes And how do you mean a sure way to gain a man Take me for an innocent and have done wi it As a husband As a husband A countryman that s honourable and serious minded such as he God forbid that I should say a sojer or sailor or commercial gent from the towns or any of them that be slippery with poor women I d do no friend that harm Well such as he of course Arabella s companions looked at each other and turning up their eyes in drollery began smirking Then one went up close to Arabella and although nobody was near imparted some information in a low tone the other observing curiously the effect upon Arabella Ah said the last named slowly I own I didn t think of that way But suppose he ISN T honourable A woman had better not have tried it Nothing venture nothing have Besides you make sure that he s honourable before you begin You d be safe enough with yours I wish I had the chance Lots of girls do it or do you think they d get married at all Arabella pursued her way in silent thought I ll try it she whispered but not to them VIII One week s end Jude was as usual walking out to his aunt s at Marygreen from his lodging in Alfredston a walk which now had large attractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and morose relative He diverged to the right before ascending the hill with the single purpose of gaining on his way a glimpse of Arabella that should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments Before quite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top of her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge Entering the gate he found that three young unfattened pigs had escaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top and that she was endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which she had set open The lines of her countenance changed from the rigidity of business to the softness of love when she saw Jude and she bent her eyes languishingly upon him The animals took advantage of the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way They were only put in this morning she cried stimulated to pursue in spite of her lover s presence They were drove from Spaddleholt Farm only yesterday where Father bought em at a stiff price enough They are wanting to get home again the stupid toads Will you shut the garden gate dear and help me to get em in There are no men folk at home only Mother and they ll be lost if we don t mind He set himself to assist and dodged this way and that over the potato rows and the cabbages Every now and then they ran together when he caught her for a moment and kissed her The first pig was got back promptly the second with some difficulty the third a long legged creature was more obstinate and agile He plunged through a hole in the garden hedge and into the lane He ll be lost if I don t follow n said she Come along with me She rushed in full pursuit out of the garden Jude alongside her barely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight Occasionally they would shout to some boy to stop the animal but he always wriggled past and ran on as before Let me take your hand darling said Jude You are getting out of breath She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness and they trotted along together This comes of driving em home she remarked They always know the way back if you do that They ought to have been carted over By this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the open down across which he sped with all the agility his little legs afforded As soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the top of the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run all the way to the farmer s if they wished to get at him From this summit he could be seen as a minute speck following an unerring line towards his old home It is no good cried Arabella He ll be there long before we get there It don t matter now we know he s not lost or stolen on the way They ll see it is ours and send un back Oh dear how hot I be Without relinquishing her hold of Jude s hand she swerved aside and flung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn precipitately pulling Jude on to his knees at the same time Oh I ask pardon I nearly threw you down didn t I But I am so tired She lay supine and straight as an arrow on the sloping sod of this hill top gazing up into the blue miles of sky and still retaining her warm hold of Jude s hand He reclined on his elbow near her We ve run all this way for nothing she went on her form heaving and falling in quick pants her face flushed her full red lips parted and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin Well why don t you speak deary I m blown too It was all up hill They were in absolute solitude the most apparent of all solitudes that of empty surrounding space Nobody could be nearer than a mile to them without their seeing him They were in fact on one of the summits of the county and the distant landscape around Christminster could be discerned from where they lay But Jude did not think of that then Oh I can see such a pretty thing up this tree said Arabella A sort of a caterpillar of the most loveliest green and yellow you ever came across Where said Jude sitting up You can t see him there you must come here said she He bent nearer and put his head in front of hers No I can t see it he said Why on the limb there where it branches off close to the moving leaf there She gently pulled him down beside her I don t see it he repeated the back of his head against her cheek But I can perhaps standing up He stood accordingly placing himself in the direct line of her gaze How stupid you are she said crossly turning away her face I don t care to see it dear why should I 
899_126233_000005_000003	train-clean-360	he replied 
none	none	looking down upon her Get up Abby Why I want you to let me kiss you I ve been waiting to ever so long She rolled round her face remained a moment looking deedily aslant at him then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet and exclaiming abruptly I must mizzle walked off quickly homeward Jude followed and rejoined her Just one he coaxed Shan t she said He surprised What s the matter She kept her two lips resentfully together and Jude followed her like a pet lamb till she slackened her pace and walked beside him talking calmly on indifferent subjects and always checking him if he tried to take her hand or clasp her waist Thus they descended to the precincts of her father s homestead and Arabella went in nodding good bye to him with a supercilious affronted air I expect I took too much liberty with her somehow Jude said to himself as he withdrew with a sigh and went on to Marygreen On Sunday morning the interior of Arabella s home was as usual the scene of a grand weekly cooking the preparation of the special Sunday dinner Her father was shaving before a little glass hung on the mullion of the window and her mother and Arabella herself were shelling beans hard by A neighbour passed on her way home from morning service at the nearest church and seeing Donn engaged at the window with the razor nodded and came in She at once spoke playfully to Arabella I zeed ee running with un hee hee I hope tis coming to something Arabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without raising her eyes He s for Christminster I hear as soon as he can get there Have you heard that lately quite lately asked Arabella with a jealous tigerish indrawing of breath Oh no But it has been known a long time that it is his plan He s on y waiting here for an opening Ah well he must walk about with somebody I s pose Young men don t mean much now a days Tis a sip here and a sip there with em Twas different in my time When the gossip had departed Arabella said suddenly to her mother I want you and Father to go and inquire how the Edlins be this evening after tea Or no there s evening service at Fensworth you can walk to that Oh What s up to night then Nothing Only I want the house to myself He s shy and I can t get un to come in when you are here I shall let him slip through my fingers if I don t mind much as I care for n If it is fine we med as well go since you wish In the afternoon Arabella met and walked with Jude who had now for weeks ceased to look into a book of Greek Latin or any other tongue They wandered up the slopes till they reached the green track along the ridge which they followed to the circular British earth bank adjoining Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway and of the drovers who had frequented it probably before the Romans knew the country Up from the level lands below them floated the chime of church bells Presently they were reduced to one note which quickened and stopped Now we ll go back said Arabella who had attended to the sounds Jude assented So long as he was near her he minded little where he was When they arrived at her house he said lingeringly I won t come in Why are you in such a hurry to go in to night It is not near dark Wait a moment said she She tried the handle of the door and found it locked Ah they are gone to church she added And searching behind the scraper she found the key and unlocked the door Now you ll come in a moment she asked lightly We shall be all alone Certainly said Jude with alacrity the case being unexpectedly altered Indoors they went Did he want any tea No it was too late he would rather sit and talk to her She took off her jacket and hat and they sat down naturally enough close together Don t touch me please she said softly I am part egg shell Or perhaps I had better put it in a safe place She began unfastening the collar of her gown What is it said her lover An egg a cochin s egg I am hatching a very rare sort I carry it about everywhere with me and it will get hatched in less than three weeks Where do you carry it Just here She put her hand into her bosom and drew out the egg which was wrapped in wool outside it being a piece of pig s bladder in case of accidents Having exhibited it to him she put it back Now mind you don t come near me I don t want to get it broke and have to begin another Why do you do such a strange thing It s an old custom I suppose it is natural for a woman to want to bring live things into the world It is very awkward for me just now he said laughing It serves you right There that s all you can have of me She had turned round her chair and reaching over the back of it presented her cheek to him gingerly That s very shabby of you You should have catched me a minute ago when I had put the egg down There she said defiantly I am without it now She had quickly withdrawn the egg a second time but before he could quite reach her she had put it back as quickly laughing with the excitement of her strategy Then there was a little struggle Jude making a plunge for it and capturing it triumphantly Her face flushed and becoming suddenly conscious he flushed also They looked at each other panting till he rose and said One kiss now I can do it without damage to property and I ll go But she had jumped up too You must find me first she cried Her lover followed her as she withdrew It was now dark inside the room and the window being small he could not discover for a long time what had become of her till a laugh revealed her to have rushed up the stairs whither Jude rushed at her heels IX It was some two months later in the year and the pair had met constantly during the interval Arabella seemed dissatisfied she was always imagining and waiting and wondering One day she met the itinerant Vilbert She like all the cottagers thereabout knew the quack well and she began telling him of her experiences Arabella had been gloomy but before he left her she had grown brighter That evening she kept an appointment with Jude who seemed sad I am going away he said to her I think I ought to go I think it will be better both for you and for me I wish some things had never begun I was much to blame I know But it is never too late to mend Arabella began to cry How do you know it is not too late she said That s all very well to say I haven t told you yet and she looked into his face with streaming eyes What he asked turning pale Not Yes And what shall I do if you desert me Oh Arabella how can you say that my dear You KNOW I wouldn t desert you Well then I have next to no wages as yet you know or perhaps I should have thought of this before But of course if that s the case we must marry What other thing do you think I could dream of doing I thought I thought deary perhaps you would go away all the more for that and leave me to face it alone You knew better Of course I never dreamt six months ago or even three of marrying It is a complete smashing up of my plans I mean my plans before I knew you my dear But what are they after all Dreams about books and degrees and impossible fellowships and all that Certainly we ll marry we must That night he went out alone and walked in the dark self communing He knew well too well in the secret centre of his brain that Arabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind Yet such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable young men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he unfortunately had done he was ready to abide by what he had said and take the consequences For his own soothing he kept up a factitious belief in her His idea of her was the thing of most consequence not Arabella herself he sometimes said laconically The banns were put in and published the very next Sunday The people of the parish all said what a simple fool young Fawley was All his reading had only come to this that he would have to sell his books to buy saucepans Those who guessed the probable state of affairs Arabella s parents being among them declared that it was the sort of conduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude in reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart The parson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too And so standing before the aforesaid officiator the two swore that at every other time of their lives till death took them they would assuredly believe feel and desire precisely as they had believed felt and desired during the few preceding weeks What was as remarkable as the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all surprised at what they swore Fawley s aunt being a baker she made him a bride cake saying bitterly that it was the last thing she could do for him poor silly fellow and that it would have been far better if instead of his living to trouble her he had gone underground years before with his father and mother Of this cake Arabella took some slices wrapped them up in white note paper and sent them to her companions in the pork dressing business Anny and Sarah labelling each packet In remembrance of good advice The prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very brilliant even to the most sanguine mind He a stone mason s apprentice nineteen years of age was working for half wages till he should be out of his time His wife was absolutely useless in a town lodging where he at first had considered it would be necessary for them to live But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so little a degree caused him to take a lonely roadside cottage between the Brown House and Marygreen that he might have the profits of a vegetable garden and utilize her past experiences by letting her keep a pig But it was not the sort of life he had bargained for and it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day Arabella however felt that all these make shifts were temporary she had gained a husband that was the thing a husband with a lot of earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should begin to get frightened a bit and stick to his trade and throw aside those stupid books for practical undertakings So to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage giving up his old room at his aunt s where so much of the hard labour at Greek and Latin had been carried on A little chill overspread him at her first unrobing A long tail of hair which Arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back of her head was deliberately unfastened stroked out and hung upon the looking glass which he had bought her What it wasn t your own he said with a sudden distaste for her Oh no it never is nowadays with the better class Nonsense Perhaps not in towns But in the country it is supposed to be different Besides you ve enough of your own surely Yes enough as country notions go But in town the men expect more and when I was barmaid at Aldbrickham Barmaid at Aldbrickham Well not exactly barmaid I used to draw the drink at a public house there just for a little time that was all Some people put me up to getting this and I bought it just for a fancy The more you have the better in Aldbrickham which is a finer town than all your Christminsters Every lady of position wears false hair the barber s assistant told me so Jude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be true to some extent for all that he knew many unsophisticated girls would and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing their simplicity of life and embellishments Others alas had an instinct towards artificiality in their very blood and became adepts in counterfeiting at the first glimpse of it However perhaps there was no great sin in a woman adding to her hair and he resolved to think no more of it A new made wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few weeks even though the prospects of the household ways and means are cloudy There is a certain piquancy about her situation and her manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it which carries off the gloom of facts and renders even the humblest bride independent awhile of the real missus Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of Alfredston one market day with this quality in her carriage when she met Anny her former friend whom she had not seen since the wedding As usual they laughed before talking the world seemed funny to them without saying it So it turned out a good plan you see remarked the girl to the wife I knew it would with such as him He s a dear good fellow and you ought to be proud of un I am said missus Fawley quietly And when do you expect Ssh Not at all What I was mistaken Oh Arabella Arabella you be a deep one Mistaken well that s clever it s a real stroke of genius It is a thing I never thought o wi all my experience I never thought beyond bringing about the real thing not that one could sham it Don t you be too quick to cry sham Twasn t sham I didn t know My word won t he be in a taking He ll give it to ee o Saturday nights Whatever it was he ll say it was a trick a double one by the Lord I ll own to the first but not to the second Pooh he won t care He ll be glad 
899_126233_000042_000003	train-clean-360	I was wrong 
none	none	in what I said He ll shake down bless ee men always do What can em do otherwise Married is married Nevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached the time when in the natural course of things she would have to reveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation The occasion was one evening at bedtime and they were in their chamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked home from his work every day He had worked hard the whole twelve hours and had retired to rest before his wife When she came into the room he was between sleeping and waking and was barely conscious of her undressing before the little looking glass as he lay One action of hers however brought him to full cognition Her face being reflected towards him as she sat he could perceive that she was amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the dimple before alluded to a curious accomplishment of which she was mistress effecting it by a momentary suction It seemed to him for the first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face during his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the earlier weeks of their acquaintance Don t do that Arabella he said suddenly There is no harm in it but I don t like to see you She turned and laughed Lord I didn t know you were awake she said How countrified you are That s nothing Where did you learn it Nowhere that I know of They used to stay without any trouble when I was at the public house but now they won t My face was fatter then I don t care about dimples I don t think they improve a woman particularly a married woman and of full sized figure like you Most men think otherwise I don t care what most men think if they do How do you know I used to be told so when I was serving in the tap room Ah that public house experience accounts for your knowing about the adulteration of the ale when we went and had some that Sunday evening I thought when I married you that you had always lived in your father s house You ought to have known better than that and seen I was a little more finished than I could have been by staying where I was born There was not much to do at home and I was eating my head off so I went away for three months You ll soon have plenty to do now dear won t you How do you mean Why of course little things to make Oh When will it be Can t you tell me exactly instead of in such general terms as you have used Tell you Yes the date There s nothing to tell I made a mistake What It was a mistake He sat bolt upright in bed and looked at her How can that be Women fancy wrong things sometimes But Why of course so unprepared as I was without a stick of furniture and hardly a shilling I shouldn t have hurried on our affair and brought you to a half furnished hut before I was ready if it had not been for the news you gave me which made it necessary to save you ready or no Good God Don t take on dear What s done can t be undone I have no more to say He gave the answer simply and lay down and there was silence between them When Jude awoke the next morning he seemed to see the world with a different eye As to the point in question he was compelled to accept her word in the circumstances he could not have acted otherwise while ordinary notions prevailed But how came they to prevail There seemed to him vaguely and dimly something wrong in a social ritual which made necessary a cancelling of well formed schemes involving years of thought and labour of foregoing a man s one opportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals and of contributing his units of work to the general progress of his generation because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory instinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice and could be only at the most called weakness He was inclined to inquire what he had done or she lost for that matter that he deserved to be caught in a gin which would cripple him if not her also for the rest of a lifetime There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the immediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non existent But the marriage remained X The time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his wife had fattened in their sty during the autumn months and the butchering was timed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning so that Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter of a day The night had seemed strangely silent Jude looked out of the window long before dawn and perceived that the ground was covered with snow snow rather deep for the season it seemed a few flakes still falling I m afraid the pig killer won t be able to come he said to Arabella Oh he ll come You must get up and make the water hot if you want Challow to scald him Though I like singeing best I ll get up said Jude I like the way of my own county He went downstairs lit the fire under the copper and began feeding it with bean stalks all the time without a candle the blaze flinging a cheerful shine into the room though for him the sense of cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze to heat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as yet lived and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner of the garden At half past six the time of appointment with the butcher the water boiled and Jude s wife came downstairs Is Challow come she asked No They waited and it grew lighter with the dreary light of a snowy dawn She went out gazed along the road and returning said He s not coming Drunk last night I expect The snow is not enough to hinder him surely Then we must put it off It is only the water boiled for nothing The snow may be deep in the valley Can t be put off There s no more victuals for the pig He ate the last mixing o barleymeal yesterday morning Yesterday morning What has he lived on since Nothing What he has been starving Yes We always do it the last day or two to save bother with the innerds What ignorance not to know that That accounts for his crying so Poor creature Well you must do the sticking there s no help for it I ll show you how Or I ll do it myself I think I could Though as it is such a big pig I had rather Challow had done it However his basket o knives and things have been already sent on here and we can use em Of course you shan t do it said Jude I ll do it since it must be done He went out to the sty shovelled away the snow for the space of a couple of yards or more and placed the stool in front with the knives and ropes at hand A robin peered down at the preparations from the nearest tree and not liking the sinister look of the scene flew away though hungry By this time Arabella had joined her husband and Jude rope in hand got into the sty and noosed the affrighted animal who beginning with a squeak of surprise rose to repeated cries of rage Arabella opened the sty door and together they hoisted the victim on to the stool legs upward and while Jude held him Arabella bound him down looping the cord over his legs to keep him from struggling The animal s note changed its quality It was not now rage but the cry of despair long drawn slow and hopeless Upon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig than have had this to do said Jude A creature I have fed with my own hands Don t be such a tender hearted fool There s the sticking knife the one with the point Now whatever you do don t stick un too deep I ll stick him effectually so as to make short work of it That s the chief thing You must not she cried The meat must be well bled and to do that he must die slow We shall lose a shilling a score if the meat is red and bloody Just touch the vein that s all I was brought up to it and I know Every good butcher keeps un bleeding long He ought to be eight or ten minutes dying at least He shall not be half a minute if I can help it however the meat may look said Jude determinedly Scraping the bristles from the pig s upturned throat as he had seen the butchers do he slit the fat then plunged in the knife with all his might Od damn it all she cried that ever I should say it You ve over stuck un And I telling you all the time Do be quiet Arabella and have a little pity on the creature Hold up the pail to catch the blood and don t talk However unworkmanlike the deed it had been mercifully done The blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had desired The dying animal s cry assumed its third and final tone the shriek of agony his glazing eyes riveting themselves on Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends Make un stop that said Arabella Such a noise will bring somebody or other up here and I don t want people to know we are doing it ourselves Picking up the knife from the ground whereon Jude had flung it she slipped it into the gash and slit the windpipe The pig was instantly silent his dying breath coming through the hole That s better she said It is a hateful business said he Pigs must be killed The animal heaved in a final convulsion and despite the rope kicked out with all his last strength A tablespoonful of black clot came forth the trickling of red blood having ceased for some seconds That s it now he ll go said she Artful creatures they always keep back a drop like that as long as they can The last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger and in recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood had been caught There she cried thoroughly in a passion Now I can t make any blackpot There s a waste all through you Jude put the pail upright but only about a third of the whole steaming liquid was left in it the main part being splashed over the snow and forming a dismal sordid ugly spectacle to those who saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat The lips and nostrils of the animal turned livid then white and the muscles of his limbs relaxed Thank God Jude said He s dead What s God got to do with such a messy job as a pig killing I should like to know she said scornfully Poor folks must live I know I know said he I don t scold you Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand Well done young married volk I couldn t have carried it out much better myself cuss me if I could The voice which was husky came from the garden gate and looking up from the scene of slaughter they saw the burly form of mister Challow leaning over the gate critically surveying their performance Tis well for ee to stand there and glane said Arabella Owing to your being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled Twon t fetch so much by a shilling a score Challow expressed his contrition You should have waited a bit he said shaking his head and not have done this in the delicate state too that you be in at present ma am Tis risking yourself too much You needn t be concerned about that said Arabella laughing Jude too laughed but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in his amusement Challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the scalding and scraping Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man at what he had done though aware of his lack of common sense and that the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by deputy The white snow stained with the blood of his fellow mortal wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice not to say a Christian 
899_126232_000081_000001	train-clean-360	but he could not 
none	none	see how the matter was to be mended No doubt he was as his wife had called him a tender hearted fool He did not like the road to Alfredston now It stared him cynically in the face The wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of his wife that to keep them out of his eyes he read whenever he could as he walked to and from his work Yet he sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping common place nor gaining rare ideas every working man being of that taste now When passing near the spot by the stream on which he had first made her acquaintance he one day heard voices just as he had done at that earlier time One of the girls who had been Arabella s companions was talking to a friend in a shed himself being the subject of discourse possibly because they had seen him in the distance They were quite unaware that the shed walls were so thin that he could hear their words as he passed Howsomever twas I put her up to it Nothing venture nothing have I said If I hadn t she d no more have been his mis ess than I Tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told him she was What had Arabella been put up to by this woman so that he should make her his mis ess otherwise wife The suggestion was horridly unpleasant and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of entering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket inside the garden gate and passed on determined to go and see his old aunt and get some supper there This made his arrival home rather late Arabella however was busy melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig for she had been out on a jaunt all day and so delayed her work Dreading lest what he had heard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he spoke little But Arabella was very talkative and said among other things that she wanted some money Seeing the book sticking out of his pocket she added that he ought to earn more An apprentice s wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on as a rule my dear Then you shouldn t have had one Come Arabella That s too bad when you know how it came about I ll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you was true Doctor Vilbert thought so It was a good job for you that it wasn t so I don t mean that he said hastily I mean before that time I know it was not your fault but those women friends of yours gave you bad advice If they hadn t or you hadn t taken it we should at this moment have been free from a bond which not to mince matters galls both of us devilishly It may be very sad but it is true Who s been telling you about my friends What advice I insist upon you telling me Pooh I d rather not But you shall you ought to It is mean of ee not to Very well And he hinted gently what had been revealed to him But I don t wish to dwell upon it Let us say no more about it Her defensive manner collapsed That was nothing she said laughing coldly Every woman has a right to do such as that The risk is hers I quite deny it Bella She might if no lifelong penalty attached to it for the man or in his default for herself if the weakness of the moment could end with the moment or even with the year But when effects stretch so far she should not go and do that which entraps a man if he is honest or herself if he is otherwise What ought I to have done Given me time Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that pig s fat to night Please put it away Then I must do it to morrow morning It won t keep Very well do XI Next morning which was Sunday she resumed operations about ten o clock and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had accompanied it the night before and put her back into the same intractable temper That s the story about me in Marygreen is it that I entrapped ee Much of a catch you were Lord send As she warmed she saw some of Jude s dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have been laid I won t have them books here in the way she cried petulantly and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon the floor Leave my books alone he said You might have thrown them aside if you had liked but as to soiling them like that it is disgusting In the operation of making lard Arabella s hands had become smeared with the hot grease and her fingers consequently left very perceptible imprints on the book covers She continued deliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor till Jude incensed beyond bearing caught her by the arms to make her leave off Somehow in going so he loosened the fastening of her hair and it rolled about her ears Let me go she said Promise to leave the books alone She hesitated Let me go she repeated Promise After a pause I do Jude relinquished his hold and she crossed the room to the door out of which she went with a set face and into the highway Here she began to saunter up and down perversely pulling her hair into a worse disorder than he had caused and unfastening several buttons of her gown It was a fine Sunday morning dry clear and frosty and the bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the north People were going along the road dressed in their holiday clothes they were mainly lovers such pairs as Jude and Arabella had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier These pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she now presented bonnetless her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind her bodice apart her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work and her hands reeking with melted fat One of the passers said in mock terror Good Lord deliver us See how he s served me she cried Making me work Sunday mornings when I ought to be going to my church and tearing my hair off my head and my gown off my back Jude was exasperated and went out to drag her in by main force Then he suddenly lost his heat Illuminated with the sense that all was over between them and that it mattered not what she did or he her husband stood still regarding her Their lives were ruined he thought ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong comradeship tolerable Going to ill use me on principle as your father ill used your mother and your father s sister ill used her husband she asked All you be a queer lot as husbands and wives Jude fixed an arrested surprised look on her But she said no more and continued her saunter till she was tired He left the spot and after wandering vaguely a little while walked in the direction of Marygreen Here he called upon his great aunt whose infirmities daily increased Aunt did my father ill use my mother and my aunt her husband said Jude abruptly sitting down by the fire She raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by gone bonnet that she always wore Who s been telling you that she said I have heard it spoken of and want to know all You med so well I s pose though your wife I reckon twas she must have been a fool to open up that There isn t much to know after all Your father and mother couldn t get on together and they parted It was coming home from Alfredston market when you were a baby on the hill by the Brown House barn that they had their last difference and took leave of one another for the last time Your mother soon afterwards died she drowned herself in short and your father went away with you to South Wessex and never came here any more Jude recalled his father s silence about North Wessex and Jude s mother never speaking of either till his dying day It was the same with your father s sister Her husband offended her and she so disliked living with him afterwards that she went away to London with her little maid The Fawleys were not made for wedlock it never seemed to sit well upon us There s sommat in our blood that won t take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what we do readily enough if not bound That s why you ought to have hearkened to me and not ha married Where did Father and Mother part by the Brown House did you say A little further on where the road to Fenworth branches off and the handpost stands A gibbet once stood there not onconnected with our history But let that be In the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his old aunt s as if to go home But as soon as he reached the open down he struck out upon it till he came to a large round pond The frost continued though it was not particularly sharp and the larger stars overhead came out slow and flickering Jude put one foot on the edge of the ice and then the other it cracked under his weight but this did not deter him He ploughed his way inward to the centre the ice making sharp noises as he went When just about the middle he looked around him and gave a jump The cracking repeated itself but he did not go down He jumped again but the cracking had ceased Jude went back to the edge and stepped upon the ground It was curious he thought What was he reserved for He supposed he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide Peaceful death abhorred him as a subject and would not take him What could he do of a lower kind than self extermination what was there less noble more in keeping with his present degraded position He could get drunk Of course that was it he had forgotten Drinking was the regular stereotyped resource of the despairing worthless He began to see now why some men boozed at inns He struck down the hill northwards and came to an obscure public house On entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and Delilah on the wall caused him to recognize the place as that he had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their courtship He called for liquor and drank briskly for an hour or more Staggering homeward late that night with all his sense of depression gone and his head fairly clear still he began to laugh boisterously and to wonder how Arabella would receive him in his new aspect The house was in darkness when he entered and in his stumbling state it was some time before he could get a light Then he found that though the marks of pig dressing of fats and scallops were visible the materials themselves had been taken away A line written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope was pinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace Have gone to my friends Shall not return All the next day he remained at home and sent off the carcase of the pig to Alfredston He then cleaned up the premises locked the door put the key in a place she would know if she came back and returned to his masonry at Alfredston At night when he again plodded home he found she had not visited the house The next day went in the same way and the next Then there came a letter from her That she had gone tired of him she frankly admitted He was such a slow old coach and she did not care for the sort of life he led There was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her She further went on to say that her parents had as he knew for some time considered the question of emigrating to Australia the pig jobbing business being a poor one nowadays They had at last decided to go and she proposed to go with them if he had no objection A woman of her sort would have more chance over there than in this stupid country Jude replied that he had not the least objection to her going He thought it a wise course since she wished to go and one that might be to the advantage of both He enclosed in the packet containing the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig with all he had besides which was not much From that day he heard no more of her except indirectly though her father and his household did not immediately leave but waited till his goods and other effects had been sold off When Jude learnt that there was to be an auction at the house of the Donns he packed his own household goods into a waggon and sent them to her at the aforesaid homestead that she might sell them with the rest or as many of them as she should choose He then went into lodgings at Alfredston and saw in a shopwindow the little handbill announcing the sale of his father in law s furniture He noted its date which came and passed without Jude s going near the place or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by the southern road was materially increased by the auction A few days later he entered a dingy broker s shop in the main street of the town and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans a clothes horse rolling pin brass candlestick swing looking glass and other things at the back of the shop evidently just brought in from a sale he perceived a framed photograph which turned out to be his own portrait It was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man in bird s eye maple as a present for Arabella and had duly given her on their wedding day On the back was still to be read Jude to Arabella with the date She must have thrown it in with the rest of her property at the auction Oh said the broker seeing him look at this and the other articles in the heap and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself It is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage sale out on the road to Marygreen The frame is a very useful one if you take out the likeness You shall have it for a shilling The utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife as brought home to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of his portrait and gift was the conclusive little stroke required to demolish all sentiment in him He paid the shilling took the photograph away with him and burnt it frame and all when he reached his lodging Two or three days later he heard that Arabella and her parents had departed He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal leave taking but she had said that it would be better otherwise since she was bent on going which perhaps was true On the evening following their emigration when his day s work was done he came out of doors after supper and strolled in the starlight along the too familiar road towards the upland whereon had been experienced the chief emotions of his life It seemed to be his own again He could not realize himself On the old track he seemed to be a boy still hardly a day older than when he had stood dreaming at the top of that hill inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for Christminster and scholarship Yet I am a man he said I have a wife More I have arrived at the still riper stage of having disagreed with her disliked her had a scuffle with her and parted from her He remembered then that he was standing not far from the spot at which the parting between his father and his mother was said to have occurred A little further on was the summit whence Christminster or what he had taken for that city had seemed to be visible A milestone now as always stood at the roadside hard by Jude drew near it and felt rather than read the mileage to the city He remembered that once on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an inscription on the back of that milestone embodying his aspirations It had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship before he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman He wondered if the inscription were legible still and going to the back of the milestone brushed away the nettles By the light of a match he could still discern what he had cut so enthusiastically so long ago THITHER J F with a pointing finger The sight of it unimpaired within its screen of grass and nettles lit in his soul a spark of the old fire Surely his plan should be to move onward through good and ill to avoid morbid sorrow even though he did see uglinesses in the world Bene agere et loetari to do good cheerfully which he had heard to be the philosophy of one Spinoza might be his own even now He might battle with his evil star and follow out his original intention By moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a north easterly direction There actually rose the faint halo a small dim nebulousness hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith It was enough for him He would go to Christminster as soon as the term of his apprenticeship expired He returned to his lodgings in a better mood and said his prayers Part Second AT CHRISTMINSTER Save his own soul he hath no star SWINBURNE Notitiam primosque gradus vicinia fecit Tempore crevit amor OVID I The next noteworthy move in Jude s life was that in which he appeared gliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three years later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella and the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her He was walking towards Christminster City at a point a mile or two to the south west of it He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston he was out of his apprenticeship and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start the start to which barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with Arabella he had been looking forward for about ten years Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible meditative and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance He was of dark complexion with dark harmonizing eyes and he wore a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at his age this with his great mass of black curly hair was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone dust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade His capabilities in the latter having been acquired in the country were of an all round sort including monumental stone cutting gothic free stone work for the restoration of churches and carving of a general kind In London he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a moulding mason a foliage sculptor perhaps a statuary He had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village nearest the city in this direction and was now walking the remaining four miles rather from choice than from necessity having always fancied himself arriving thus The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin one more nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual as is often the case with young men One day while in lodgings at Alfredston he had gone to Marygreen to see his old aunt and had observed between the brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the photograph of a pretty girlish face in a broad hat with radiating folds under the brim like the rays of a halo He had asked who she was His grand aunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin Sue Bridehead of the inimical branch of the family and on further questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in Christminster though she did not know where or what she was doing His aunt would not give him the photograph But it haunted him and ultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of following his friend the school master thither He now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity and obtained his first near view of the city Grey stoned and dun roofed it stood within hail of the Wessex border and almost with the tip of one small toe within it at the northernmost point of the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields of that ancient kingdom The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues Reaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard willows growing indistinct in the twilight and soon confronted the outmost lamps of the town some of those lamps which had sent into the sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days of dreaming so many years ago They winked their yellow eyes at him dubiously and as if though they had been awaiting him all these years in disappointment at his tarrying they did not much want him now He was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to finer issues than a mere material gain He went along the outlying streets with the cautious tread of an explorer He saw nothing of the real city in the suburbs on this side His first want being a lodging he scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer on inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he demanded and after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed Beersheba though he did not know this at the time Here he installed himself and having had some tea sallied forth It was a windy whispering moonless night To guide himself he opened under a lamp a map he had brought The breeze ruffled and fluttered it but he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to reach the heart of the place After many turnings he came up to the first ancient mediaeval pile that he had encountered It was a college as he could see by the gateway He entered it walked round and penetrated to dark corners which no lamplight reached Close to this college was another and a little further on another and then he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city When he passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them A bell began clanging and he listened till a hundred and one strokes had sounded He must have made a mistake he thought it was meant for a hundred When the gates were shut and he could no longer get into the quadrangles he rambled under the walls and doorways feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving The minutes passed fewer and fewer people were visible and still he serpentined among the shadows for had he not imagined these scenes through ten bygone years and what mattered a night s rest for once High against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed pinnacles and indented battlements Down obscure alleys apparently never trodden now by the foot of man and whose very existence seemed to be forgotten there would jut into the path porticoes oriels doorways of enriched and florid middle age design their extinct air being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones It seemed impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers Knowing not a human being here Jude began to be impressed with the isolation of his own personality as with a self spectre the sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself seen or heard He drew his breath pensively and seeming thus almost his own ghost gave his thoughts to the other ghostly presences with which the nooks were haunted During the interval of preparation for this venture since his wife and furniture s uncompromising disappearance into space he had read and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position of the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age Some of them by the accidents of his reading loomed out in his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest The brushings of the wind against the angles buttresses and door jambs were as the passing of these only other inhabitants the tappings of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement making him comrades in his solitude In the gloom it was as if he ran against them without feeling their bodily frames The streets were now deserted but on account of these things he could not go in There were poets abroad of early date and of late from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has recently passed into silence and that musical one of the tribe who is still among us Speculative philosophers drew along not always with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits but pink faced slim and active as in youth modern divines sheeted in their surplices among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the founders of the religious school called Tractarian the well known three the enthusiast the poet and the formularist the echoes of whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home A start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move them at sight of those other sons of the place the form in the full bottomed wig statesman rake reasoner and sceptic the smoothly shaven historian so ironically civil to Christianity with others of the same incredulous temper who knew each quad as well as the faithful and took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters He regarded the statesmen in their various types men of firmer movement and less dreamy air the scholar the speaker the plodder the man whose mind grew with his growth in years and the man whose mind contracted with the same The scientists and philologists followed on in his mind sight in an odd impossible combination men of meditative faces strained foreheads and weak eyed as bats with constant research then official characters such men as governor generals and lord lieutenants in whom he took little interest chief justices and lord chancellors silent thin lipped figures of whom he knew barely the names A keener regard attached to the prelates by reason of his own former hopes Of them he had an ample band some men of heart others rather men of head he who apologized for the Church in Latin the saintly author of the Evening Hymn and near them the great itinerant preacher hymn writer and zealot shadowed like Jude by his matrimonial difficulties Jude found himself speaking out loud holding conversations with them as it were like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the audience on the other side of the footlights till he suddenly ceased with a start at his absurdity Perhaps those incoherent words of the wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over his lamp and he may have raised his head and wondered what voice it was and what it betokened Jude now perceived that so far as solid flesh went he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception of a belated townsman here and there and that he seemed to be catching a cold A voice reached him out of the shade a real and local voice You ve been a settin a long time on that plinth stone young man What med you be up to It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the latter observing him Jude went home and to bed after reading up a little about these men and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he had brought with him concerning the sons of the university As he drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had just been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances some audible some unintelligible to him One of the spectres who afterwards mourned Christminster as the home of lost causes though Jude did not remember this was now apostrophizing her thus Beautiful city so venerable so lovely so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century so serene Her ineffable charm keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us to the ideal to perfection Another voice was that of the Corn Law convert whose phantom he had just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell Jude thought his soul might have been shaping the historic words of his master speech Sir I may be wrong but my impression is that my duty towards a country threatened with famine requires that that which has been the ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to now namely that there should be free access to the food of man from whatever quarter it may come Deprive me of office to morrow you can never deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives from no desire to gratify ambition for no personal gain Then the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity How shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic world to those evidences miracles which were presented by Omnipotence The sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the awful spectacle and appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world Then the shade of the poet the last of the optimists How the world is made for each of us And each of the Many helps to recruit The life of the race by a general plan Then one of the three enthusiasts he had seen just now the author of the Apologia My argument was that absolute certitude as to the truths of natural theology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and converging probabilities that probabilities which did not reach to logical certainty might create a mental certitude The second of them no polemic murmured quieter things Why should we faint and fear to live alone Since all alone so Heaven has will d we die He likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short face the genial Spectator When I look upon the tombs of the great every motion of envy dies in me when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful every inordinate desire goes out when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone my heart melts with compassion when I see the tombs of the parents themselves I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow And lastly a gentle voiced prelate spoke during whose meek familiar rhyme endeared to him from earliest childhood Jude fell asleep Teach me to live that I may dread The grave as little as my bed Teach me to die He did not wake till morning The ghostly past seemed to have gone and everything spoke of to day He started up in bed thinking he had overslept himself and then said By Jove I had quite forgotten my sweet faced cousin and that she s here all the time and my old schoolmaster too His words about his schoolmaster had perhaps less zest in them than his words concerning his cousin II Necessary meditations on the actual including the mean bread and cheese question dissipated the phantasmal for a while and compelled Jude to smother high thinkings under immediate needs He had to get up and seek for work manual work the only kind deemed by many of its professors to be work at all Passing out into the streets on this errand he found that the colleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances some were pompous some had put on the look of family vaults above ground something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all The spirits of the great men had disappeared The numberless architectural pages around him he read naturally less as an artist critic of their forms than as an artizan and comrade of the dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually executed those forms He examined the mouldings stroked them as one who knew their beginning said they were difficult or easy in the working had taken little or much time were trying to the arm or convenient to the tool What at night had been perfect and ideal was by day the more or less defective real Cruelties insults had he perceived been inflicted on the aged erections The condition of several moved him as he would have been moved by maimed sentient beings They were wounded broken sloughing off their outer shape in the deadly struggle against years weather and man The rottenness of these historical documents reminded him that he was not after all hastening on to begin the morning practically as he had intended He had come to work and to live by work and the morning had nearly gone It was in one sense encouraging to think that in a place of crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of his trade to do in the business of renovation He asked his way to the workyard of the stone mason whose name had been given him at Alfredston and soon heard the familiar sound of the rubbers and chisels The yard was a little centre of regeneration Here with keen edges and smooth curves were forms in the exact likeness of those he had seen abraded and time eaten on the walls These were the ideas in modern prose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry Even some of those antiques might have been called prose when they were new They had done nothing but wait and had become poetical How easy to the smallest building how impossible to most men He asked for the foreman and looked round among the new traceries mullions transoms shafts pinnacles and battlements standing on the bankers half worked or waiting to be removed They were marked by precision mathematical straightness smoothness exactitude there in the old walls were the broken lines of the original idea jagged curves disdain of precision irregularity disarray For a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination that here in the stone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the name of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges But he lost it under stress of his old idea He would accept any employment which might be offered him on the strength of his late employer s recommendation but he would accept it as a provisional thing only This was his form of the modern vice of unrest Moreover he perceived that at best only copying patching and imitating went on here which he fancied to be owing to some temporary and local cause He did not at that time see that mediaevalism was as dead as a fern leaf in a lump of coal that other developments were shaping in the world around him in which Gothic architecture and its associations had no place The deadly animosity of contemporary logic and vision towards so much of what he held in reverence was not yet revealed to him Having failed to obtain work here as yet he went away and thought again of his cousin whose presence somewhere at hand he seemed to feel in wavelets of interest if not of emotion How he wished he had that pretty portrait of her At last he wrote to his aunt to send it She did so with a request however that he was not to bring disturbance into the family by going to see the girl or her relations Jude a ridiculously affectionate fellow promised nothing put the photograph on the mantel piece kissed it he did not know why and felt more at home She seemed to look down and preside over his tea It was cheering the one thing uniting him to the emotions of the living city There remained the schoolmaster probably now a reverend parson But he could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet so raw and unpolished was his condition so precarious were his fortunes Thus he still remained in loneliness Although people moved round him he virtually saw none Not as yet having mingled with the active life of the place it was largely non existent to him But the saints and prophets in the window tracery the paintings in the galleries the statues the busts the gargoyles the corbel heads these seemed to breathe his atmosphere Like all newcomers to a spot on which the past is deeply graven he heard that past announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by and even incredible to the habitual residents For many days he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the colleges at odd minutes in passing them surprised by impish echoes of his own footsteps smart as the blows of a mallet The Christminster sentiment as it had been called ate further and further into him till he probably knew more about those buildings materially artistically and historically than any one of their inmates It was not till now when he found himself actually on the spot of his enthusiasm that Jude perceived how far away from the object of that enthusiasm he really was Only a wall divided him from those happy young contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental life men who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read mark learn and inwardly digest Only a wall but what a wall Every day every hour as he went in search of labour he saw them going and coming also rubbed shoulders with them heard their voices marked their movements The conversation of some of the more thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes owing to his long and persistent preparation for this place to be peculiarly akin to his own thoughts Yet he was as far from them as if he had been at the antipodes Of course he was He was a young workman in a white blouse and with stone dust in the creases of his clothes and in passing him they did not even see him or hear him rather saw through him as through a pane of glass at their familiars beyond Whatever they were to him he to them was not on the spot at all and yet he had fancied he would be close to their lives by coming there But the future lay ahead after all and if he could only be so fortunate as to get into good employment he would put up with the inevitable So he thanked God for his health and strength and took courage For the present he was outside the gates of everything colleges included perhaps some day he would be inside Those palaces of light and leading he might some day look down on the world through their panes At length he did receive a message from the stone mason s yard that a job was waiting for him It was his first encouragement and he closed with the offer promptly He was young and strong or he never could have executed with such zest the undertakings to which he now applied himself since they involved reading most of the night after working all the day First he bought a shaded lamp for four and six pence and obtained a good light Then he got pens paper and such other necessary books as he had been unable to obtain elsewhere Then to the consternation of his landlady he shifted all the furniture of his room a single one for living and sleeping rigged up a curtain on a rope across the middle to make a double chamber out of one hung up a thick blind that nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep laid out his books and sat down Having been deeply encumbered by marrying getting a cottage and buying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife he had never been able to save any money since the time of those disastrous ventures and till his wages began to come in he was obliged to live in the narrowest way After buying a book or two he could not even afford himself a fire and when the nights reeked with the raw and cold air from the Meadows he sat over his lamp in a great coat hat and woollen gloves From his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral and the ogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city The tall tower tall belfry windows and tall pinnacles of the college by the bridge he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase These objects he used as stimulants when his faith in the future was dim Like enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of procedure Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance he never dwelt upon them For the present he said to himself the one thing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge and await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming a son of the University For wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it His desire absorbed him and left no part of him to weigh its practicability At this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old aunt on the subject which had previously distressed her a fear that Jude would not be strong minded enough to keep away from his cousin Sue Bridehead and her relations Sue s father his aunt believed had gone back to London but the girl remained at Christminster To make her still more objectionable she was an artist or designer of some sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse which was a perfect seed bed of idolatry and she was no doubt abandoned to mummeries on that account if not quite a Papist Miss Drusilla Fawley was of her date Evangelical As Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological this news of Sue s probable opinions did not much influence him one way or the other but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting With an altogether singular pleasure he walked at his earliest spare minutes past the shops answering to his great aunt s description and beheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk who was suspiciously like the original of the portrait He ventured to enter on a trivial errand and having made his purchase lingered on the scene The shop seemed to be kept entirely by women It contained Anglican books stationery texts and fancy goods little plaster angels on brackets Gothic framed pictures of saints ebony crosses that were almost crucifixes prayer books that were almost missals He felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk she was so pretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong to him Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the counter and he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his own voice softened and sweetened but his own What was she doing He stole a glance round Before her lay a piece of zinc cut to the shape of a scroll three or four feet long and coated with a dead surface paint on one side Hereon she was designing or illuminating in characters of Church text the single word A L L E L U J A A sweet saintly Christian business hers thought he Her presence here was now fairly enough explained her skill in work of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her father s occupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal The lettering on which she was engaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some chancel to assist devotion He came out It would have been easy to speak to her there and then but it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt to disregard her request so incontinently She had used him roughly but she had brought him up and the fact of her being powerless to control him lent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as an argument So Jude gave no sign He would not call upon Sue just yet He had other reasons against doing so when he had walked away She seemed so dainty beside himself in his rough working jacket and dusty trousers that he felt he was as yet unready to encounter her as he had felt about mister Phillotson And how possible it was that she had inherited the antipathies of her family and would scorn him as far as a Christian could particularly when he had told her that unpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming enchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire Thus he kept watch over her and liked to feel she was there The consciousness of her living presence stimulated him But she remained more or less an ideal character about whose form he began to weave curious and fantastic day dreams Between two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some more men outside Crozier College in Old time Street in getting a block of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement before hoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing Standing in position the head man said Spaik when he heave He ho And they heaved All of a sudden as he lifted his cousin stood close to his elbow pausing a moment on the bend of her foot till the obstructing object should have been removed She looked right into his face with liquid untranslatable eyes that combined or seemed to him to combine keenness with tenderness and mystery with both their expression as well as that of her lips taking its life from some words just spoken to a companion and being carried on into his face quite unconsciously She no more observed his presence than that of the dust motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams His closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled and turned his face away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him though as she had never once seen him she could not possibly do so and might very well never have heard even his name He could perceive that though she was a country girl at bottom a latter girlhood of some years in London and a womanhood here had taken all rawness out of her When she was gone he continued his work reflecting on her He had been so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her general mould and build He remembered now that she was not a large figure that she was light and slight of the type dubbed elegant That was about all he had seen There was nothing statuesque in her all was nervous motion She was mobile living yet a painter might not have called her handsome or beautiful But the much that she was surprised him She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity that was his How could one of his cross grained unfortunate almost accursed stock have contrived to reach this pitch of niceness London had done it he supposed From this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his breast as the bottled up effect of solitude and the poetized locality he dwelt in insensibly began to precipitate itself on this half visionary form and he perceived that whatever his obedient wish in a contrary direction he would soon be unable to resist the desire to make himself known to her He affected to think of her quite in a family way since there were crushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any other The first reason was that he was married and it would be wrong The second was that they were cousins It was not well for cousins to fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion The third even were he free in a family like his own where marriage usually meant a tragic sadness marriage with a blood relation would duplicate the adverse conditions and a tragic sadness might be intensified to a tragic horror Therefore again he would have to think of Sue with only a relation s mutual interest in one belonging to him regard her in a practical way as some one to be proud of to talk and nod to later on to be invited to tea by the emotion spent on her being rigorously that of a kinsman and well wisher So would she be to him a kindly star an elevating power a companion in Anglican worship a tender friend III But under the various deterrent influences Jude s instinct was to approach her timidly and the next Sunday he went to the morning service in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further view of her for he had found that she frequently attended there She did not come and he awaited her in the afternoon which was finer He knew that if she came at all she would approach the building along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from which it was accessible and he stood in a corner while the bell was going A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as one of the figures walking along under the college walls and at sight of her he advanced up the side opposite and followed her into the building more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed himself To see her and to be himself unseen and unknown was enough for him at present He lingered awhile in the vestibule and the service was some way advanced when he was put into a seat It was a louring mournful still afternoon when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to ordinary practical men and not only a luxury of the emotional and leisured classes In the dim light and the baffling glare of the clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers indistinctly only but he saw that Sue was among them He had not long discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting of the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second part In quo corriget the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian tune as the singers gave forth Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way It was the very question that was engaging Jude s attention at this moment What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as he had done to an animal passion for a woman and allow it to lead to such disastrous consequences then to think of putting an end to himself then to go recklessly and get drunk The great waves of pedal music tumbled round the choir and nursed on the supernatural as he had been it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that the psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this moment of his first entry into the solemn building And yet it was the ordinary psalm for the twenty fourth evening of the month The girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary tenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those which floated into his ears and the thought was a delight to him She was probably a frequenter of this place and steeped body and soul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit had no doubt much in common with him To an impressionable and lonely young man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for his thoughts which promised to supply both social and spiritual possibilities was like the dew of Hermon and he remained throughout the service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy Though he was loth to suspect it some people might have said to him that the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee Jude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen before he himself moved She did not look towards him and by the time he reached the door she was half way down the broad path Being dressed up in his Sunday suit he was inclined to follow her and reveal himself But he was not quite ready and alas ought he to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him For though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the service and he had persuaded himself that such was the case he could not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism She was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation and he said It can t be I a man with a wife must not know her Still Sue WAS his own kin and the fact of his having a wife even though she was not in evidence in this hemisphere might be a help in one sense It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out of Sue s mind and make her intercourse with him free and fearless It was with some heartache that he saw how little he cared for the freedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such knowledge Some little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the pretty liquid eyed light footed young woman Sue Bridehead had an afternoon s holiday and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in which she not only assisted but lodged took a walk into the country with a book in her hand It was one of those cloudless days which sometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet as if intercalated by caprice of the weather god She went along for a mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the city she had left behind her The road passed between green fields and coming to a stile Sue paused there to finish the page she was reading and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles new and old On the other side of the stile in the footpath she beheld a foreigner with black hair and a sallow face sitting on the grass beside a large square board whereon were fixed as closely as they could stand a number of plaster statuettes some of them bronzed which he was re arranging before proceeding with them on his way They were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles and comprised divinities of a very different character from those the girl was accustomed to see portrayed among them being a Venus of standard pattern a Diana and of the other sex Apollo Bacchus and Mars Though the figures were many yards away from her the south west sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green herbage that she could discern their contours with luminous distinctness and being almost in a line between herself and the church towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and contrasting set of ideas by comparison The man rose and seeing her politely took off his cap and cried I i i mages in an accent that agreed with his appearance In a moment he dexterously lifted upon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine and human and raised it to the top of his head bringing them on to her and resting the board on the stile First he offered her his smaller wares the busts of kings and queens then a minstrel then a winged Cupid She shook her head How much are these two she said touching with her finger the Venus and the Apollo the largest figures on the tray He said she should have them for ten shillings I cannot afford that said Sue She offered considerably less and to her surprise the image man drew them from their wire stay and handed them over the stile She clasped them as treasures When they were paid for and the man had gone she began to be concerned as to what she should do with them They seemed so very large now that they were in her possession and so very naked Being of a nervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise When she handled them the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and jacket After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came to her and pulling some huge burdock leaves parsley and other rank growths from the hedge she wrapped up her burden as well as she could in these so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous armful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature Well anything is better than those everlasting church fallals she said But she was still in a trembling state and seemed almost to wish she had not bought the figures Occasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus s arm was not broken she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian city in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main one and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to which she was attached Her purchases were taken straight up to her own chamber and she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was her very own property but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped them in large sheets of brown paper and stood them on the floor in a corner The mistress of the house Miss Fontover was an elderly lady in spectacles dressed almost like an abbess a dab at Ritual as become one of her business and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of saint Silas in the suburb of Beersheba before mentioned which Jude also had begun to attend She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced circumstances and at his death which had occurred several years before this date she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little shop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable proportions She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only ornament and knew the Christian Year by heart She now came to call Sue to tea and finding that the girl did not respond for a moment entered the room just as the other was hastily putting a string round each parcel Something you have been buying Miss Bridehead she asked regarding the enwrapped objects Yes just something to ornament my room said Sue Well I should have thought I had put enough here already said Miss Fontover looking round at the Gothic framed prints of saints the Church text scrolls and other articles which having become too stale to sell had been used to furnish this obscure chamber What is it How bulky She tore a little hole about as big as a wafer in the brown paper and tried to peep in Why statuary Two figures Where did you get them Oh I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts Two saints Yes What ones saint Peter and saint saint Mary Magdalen Well now come down to tea and go and finish that organ text if there s light enough afterwards These little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest passing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects and looking at them and at bedtime when she was sure of being undisturbed she unrobed the divinities in comfort Placing the pair of figures on the chest of drawers a candle on each side of them she withdrew to the bed flung herself down thereon and began reading a book she had taken from her box which Miss Fontover knew nothing of It was a volume of Gibbon and she read the chapter dealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate Occasionally she looked up at the statuettes which appeared strange and out of place there happening to be a Calvary print hanging between them and as if the scene suggested the action she at length jumped up and withdrew another book from her box a volume of verse and turned to the familiar poem Thou hast conquered O pale Galilean The world has grown grey from thy breath which she read to the end Presently she put out the candles undressed and finally extinguished her own light She was of an age which usually sleeps soundly yet to night she kept waking up and every time she opened her eyes there was enough diffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures standing on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment of text and martyr and the Gothic framed Crucifix picture that was only discernible now as a Latin cross the figure thereon being obscured by the shades On one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour It fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his books at a not very distant spot in the same city Being Saturday night the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his alarm clock to call him at his usually early time and hence he had stayed up as was his custom two or three hours later than he could afford to do on any other day of the week Just then he was earnestly reading from his Griesbach s text At the very time that Sue was tossing and staring at her figures the policeman and belated citizens passing along under his window might have heard if they had stood still strange syllables mumbled with fervour within words that had for Jude an indescribable enchantment inexplicable sounds something like these All hemin heis Theos ho Pater ex hou ta panta kai hemeis eis auton Till the sounds rolled with reverent loudness as a book was heard to close Kai heis Kurios Iesous Christos di hou ta panta kai hemeis di autou IV He was a handy man at his trade an all round man as artizans in country towns are apt to be In London the man who carves the boss or knob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which merges in that leafage as if it were a degradation to do the second half of one whole When there was not much Gothic moulding for Jude to run or much window tracery on the bankers he would go out lettering monuments or tombstones and take a pleasure in the change of handiwork The next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing a job of this sort inside one of the churches There was a short morning service and when the parson entered Jude came down from his ladder and sat with the half dozen people forming the congregation till the prayer should be ended and he could resume his tapping He did not observe till the service was half over that one of the women was Sue who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover thither Jude sat watching her pretty shoulders her easy curiously nonchalant risings and sittings and her perfunctory genuflexions and thought what a help such an Anglican would have been to him in happier circumstances It was not so much his anxiety to get on with his work that made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began to take their leave it was that he dared not in this holy spot confront the woman who was beginning to influence him in such an indescribable manner Those three enormous reasons why he must not attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead now that his interest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind loomed as stubbornly as ever But it was also obvious that man could not live by work alone that the particular man Jude at any rate wanted something to love Some men would have rushed incontinently to her snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she could hardly refuse and have left the rest to chance Not so Jude at first But as the days and still more particularly the lonely evenings dragged along he found himself to his moral consternation to be thinking more of her instead of thinking less of her and experiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic informal and unexpected Surrounded by her influence all day walking past the spots she frequented he was always thinking of her and was obliged to own to himself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in this battle To be sure she was almost an ideality to him still Perhaps to know her would be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized passion A voice whispered that though he desired to know her he did not desire to be cured There was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of view the situation was growing immoral For Sue to be the loved one of a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella and none other unto his life s end was a pretty bad second beginning when the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed This conviction was so real with him that one day when as was frequent he was at work in a neighbouring village church alone he felt it to be his duty to pray against his weakness But much as he wished to be an exemplar in these things he could not get on It was quite impossible he found to ask to be delivered from temptation when your heart s desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven So he excused himself After all he said it is not altogether an erotolepsy that is the matter with me as at that first time I can see that she is exceptionally bright and it is partly a wish for intellectual sympathy and a craving for loving kindness in my solitude Thus he went on adoring her fearing to realize that it was human perversity For whatever Sue s virtues talents or ecclesiastical saturation it was certain that those items were not at all the cause of his affection for her On an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone mason s yard with some hesitation and lifting her skirts to avoid draggling them in the white dust crossed towards the office That s a nice girl said one of the men known as Uncle Joe Who is she asked another I don t know I ve seen her about here and there Why yes she s the daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought ironwork at saint Silas ten years ago and went away to London afterwards I don t know what he s doing now not much I fancy as she s come back here Meanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if mister Jude Fawley was at work in the yard It so happened that Jude had gone out somewhere or other that afternoon which information she received with a look of disappointment and went away immediately When Jude returned they told him and described her whereupon he exclaimed Why that s my cousin Sue He looked along the street after her but she was out of sight He had no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her and resolved to call upon her that very evening And when he reached his lodging he found a note from her a first note one of those documents which simple and commonplace in themselves are seen retrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences The very unconsciousness of a looming drama which is shown in such innocent first epistles from women to men or vice versa makes them when such a drama follows and they are read over by the purple or lurid light of it all the more impressive solemn and in cases terrible Sue s was of the most artless and natural kind She addressed him as her dear cousin Jude said she had only just learnt by the merest accident that he was living in Christminster and reproached him with not letting her know They might have had such nice times together she said for she was thrown much upon herself and had hardly any congenial friend But now there was every probability of her soon going away so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps for ever A cold sweat overspread Jude at the news that she was going away That was a contingency he had never thought of and it spurred him to write all the more quickly to her He would meet her that very evening he said one hour from the time of writing at the cross in the pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms When he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his hurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors when he might have said he would call upon her It was in fact the country custom to meet thus and nothing else had occurred to him Arabella had been met in the same way unfortunately and it might not seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue However it could not be helped now and he moved towards the point a few minutes before the hour under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps The broad street was silent and almost deserted although it was not late He saw a figure on the other side which turned out to be hers and they both converged towards the crossmark at the same moment Before either had reached it she called out to him I am not going to meet you just there for the first time in my life Come further on The voice though positive and silvery had been tremulous They walked on in parallel lines and waiting her pleasure Jude watched till she showed signs of closing in when he did likewise the place being where the carriers carts stood in the daytime though there was none on the spot then I am sorry that I asked you to meet me and didn t call began Jude with the bashfulness of a lover But I thought it would save time if we were going to walk Oh I don t mind that she said with the freedom of a friend I have really no place to ask anybody in to What I meant was that the place you chose was so horrid I suppose I ought not to say horrid I mean gloomy and inauspicious in its associations But isn t it funny to begin like this when I don t know you yet She looked him up and down curiously though Jude did not look much at her You seem to know me more than I know you she added Yes I have seen you now and then And you knew who I was and didn t speak And now I am going away Yes That s unfortunate I have hardly any other friend I have indeed one very old friend here somewhere but I don t quite like to call on him just yet I wonder if you know anything of him mister Phillotson A parson somewhere about the county I think he is No I only know of one mister Phillotson He lives a little way out in the country at Lumsdon He s a village schoolmaster Ah I wonder if he s the same Surely it is impossible Only a schoolmaster still Do you know his Christian name is it

none	none	Yes it is I ve directed books to him though I ve never seen him Then he couldn t do it Jude s countenance fell for how could he succeed in an enterprise wherein the great Phillotson had failed He would have had a day of despair if the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue s presence but even at this moment he had visions of how Phillotson s failure in the grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone As we are going to take a walk suppose we go and call upon him said Jude suddenly It is not late She agreed and they went along up a hill and through some prettily wooded country Presently the embattled tower and square turret of the church rose into the sky and then the school house They inquired of a person in the street if mister Phillotson was likely to be at home and were informed that he was always at home A knock brought him to the school house door with a candle in his hand and a look of inquiry on his face which had grown thin and careworn since Jude last set eyes on him That after all these years the meeting with mister Phillotson should be of this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had surrounded the school master s figure in Jude s imagination ever since their parting It created in him at the same time a sympathy with Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man Jude told him his name and said he had come to see him as an old friend who had been kind to him in his youthful days I don t remember you in the least said the school master thoughtfully You were one of my pupils you say Yes no doubt but they number so many thousands by this time of my life and have naturally changed so much that I remember very few except the quite recent ones It was out at Marygreen said Jude wishing he had not come Yes I was there a short time And is this an old pupil too No that s my cousin I wrote to you for some grammars if you recollect and you sent them Ah yes I do dimly recall that incident It was very kind of you to do it And it was you who first started me on that course On the morning you left Marygreen when your goods were on the waggon you wished me good bye and said your scheme was to be a university man and enter the Church that a degree was the necessary hall mark of one who wanted to do anything as a theologian or teacher I remember I thought all that privately but I wonder I did not keep my own counsel The idea was given up years ago I have never forgotten it It was that which brought me to this part of the country and out here to see you to night Come in said Phillotson And your cousin too They entered the parlour of the school house where there was a lamp with a paper shade which threw the light down on three or four books Phillotson took it off so that they could see each other better and the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious dark eyes and hair of Sue on the earnest features of her cousin and on the schoolmaster s own maturer face and figure showing him to be a spare and thoughtful personage of five and forty with a thin lipped somewhat refined mouth a slightly stooping habit and a black frock coat which from continued frictions shone a little at the shoulder blades the middle of the back and the elbows The old friendship was imperceptibly renewed the schoolmaster speaking of his experiences and the cousins of theirs He told them that he still thought of the Church sometimes and that though he could not enter it as he had intended to do in former years he might enter it as a licentiate Meanwhile he said he was comfortable in his present position though he was in want of a pupil teacher They did not stay to supper Sue having to be indoors before it grew late and the road was retraced to Christminster Though they had talked of nothing more than general subjects Jude was surprised to find what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him She was so vibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling An exciting thought would make her walk ahead so fast that he could hardly keep up with her and her sensitiveness on some points was such that it might have been misread as vanity It was with heart sickness he perceived that while her sentiments towards him were those of the frankest friendliness only he loved her more than before becoming acquainted with her and the gloom of the walk home lay not in the night overhead but in the thought of her departure Why must you leave Christminster he said regretfully How can you do otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as Newman Pusey Ward Keble loom so large Yes they do Though how large do they loom in the history of the world What a funny reason for caring to stay I should never have thought of it She laughed Well I must go she continued Miss Fontover one of the partners whom I serve is offended with me and I with her and it is best to go How did that happen She broke some statuary of mine Oh Wilfully Yes She found it in my room and though it was my property she threw it on the floor and stamped on it because it was not according to her taste and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures all to bits with her heel a horrid thing Too Catholic Apostolic for her I suppose No doubt she called them popish images and talked of the invocation of saints No No she didn t do that She saw the matter quite differently Ah Then I am surprised Yes It was for quite some other reason that she didn t like my patron saints So I was led to retort upon her and the end of it was that I resolved not to stay but to get into an occupation in which I shall be more independent Why don t you try teaching again You once did I heard I never thought of resuming it for I was getting on as an art designer DO let me ask mister Phillotson to let you try your hand in his school If you like it and go to a training college and become a first class certificated mistress you get twice as large an income as any designer or church artist and twice as much freedom Well ask him Now I must go in Good bye dear Jude I am so glad we have met at last We needn t quarrel because our parents did need we Jude did not like to let her see quite how much he agreed with her and went his way to the remote street in which he had his lodging To keep Sue Bridehead near him was now a desire which operated without regard of consequences and the next evening he again set out for Lumsdon fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note only The school master was unprepared for such a proposal What I rather wanted was a second year s transfer as it is called he said Of course your cousin would do personally but she has had no experience Oh she has has she Does she really think of adopting teaching as a profession Jude said she was disposed to do so he thought and his ingenious arguments on her natural fitness for assisting mister Phillotson of which Jude knew nothing whatever so influenced the schoolmaster that he said he would engage her assuring Jude as a friend that unless his cousin really meant to follow on in the same course and regarded this step as the first stage of an apprenticeship of which her training in a normal school would be the second stage her time would be wasted quite the salary being merely nominal The day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude containing the information that he had again consulted his cousin who took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition and that she had agreed to come It did not occur for a moment to the schoolmaster and recluse that Jude s ardour in promoting the arrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the instinct of company operation common among members of the same family V The schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school both being modern erections and he looked across the way at the old house in which his teacher Sue had a lodging The arrangement had been concluded very quickly A pupil teacher who was to have been transferred to mister Phillotson s school had failed him and Sue had been taken as stop gap All such provisional arrangements as these could only last till the next annual visit of H M Inspector whose approval was necessary to make them permanent Having taught for some two years in London though she had abandoned that vocation of late Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice and Phillotson thought there would be no difficulty in retaining her services which he already wished to do though she had only been with him three or four weeks He had found her quite as bright as Jude had described her and what master tradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who saves him half his labour It was a little over half past eight o clock in the morning and he was waiting to see her cross the road to the school when he would follow At twenty minutes to nine she did cross a light hat tossed on her head and he watched her as a curiosity A new emanation which had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher seemed to surround her this morning He went to the school also and Sue remained governing her class at the other end of the room all day under his eye She certainly was an excellent teacher It was part of his duty to give her private lessons in the evening and some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable elderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and the taught were of different sexes Richard Phillotson thought of the absurdity of the regulation in this case when he was old enough to be the girl s father but he faithfully acted up to it and sat down with her in a room where missus Hawes the widow at whose house Sue lodged occupied herself with sewing The regulation was indeed not easy to evade for there was no other sitting room in the dwelling Sometimes as she figured it was arithmetic that they were working at she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile at him as if she assumed that being the master he must perceive all that was passing in her brain as right or wrong Phillotson was not really thinking of the arithmetic at all but of her in a novel way which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor Perhaps she knew that he was thinking of her thus For a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in itself was a delight to him Then it happened that the children were to be taken to Christminster to see an itinerant exhibition in the shape of a model of Jerusalem to which schools were admitted at a penny a head in the interests of education They marched along the road two and two she beside her class with her simple cotton sunshade her little thumb cocked up against its stem and Phillotson behind in his long dangling coat handling his walking stick genteelly in the musing mood which had come over him since her arrival The afternoon was one of sun and dust and when they entered the exhibition room few people were present but themselves The model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment and the proprietor with a fine religious philanthropy written on his features walked round it with a pointer in his hand showing the young people the various quarters and places known to them by name from reading their Bibles Mount Moriah the Valley of Jehoshaphat the City of Zion the walls and the gates outside one of which there was a large mound like a tumulus and on the mound a little white cross The spot he said was Calvary I think said Sue to the schoolmaster as she stood with him a little in the background that this model elaborate as it is is a very imaginary production How does anybody know that Jerusalem was like this in the time of Christ I am sure this man doesn t It is made after the best conjectural maps based on actual visits to the city as it now exists I fancy we have had enough of Jerusalem she said considering we are not descended from the Jews There was nothing first rate about the place or people after all as there was about Athens Rome Alexandria and other old cities But my dear girl consider what it is to us She was silent for she was easily repressed and then perceived behind the group of children clustered round the model a young man in a white flannel jacket his form being bent so low in his intent inspection of the Valley of Jehoshaphat that his face was almost hidden from view by the Mount of Olives Look at your cousin Jude continued the schoolmaster He doesn t think we have had enough of Jerusalem Ah I didn t see him she cried in her quick light voice Jude how seriously you are going into it Jude started up from his reverie and saw her Oh Sue he said with a glad flush of embarrassment These are your school children of course I saw that schools were admitted in the afternoons and thought you might come but I got so deeply interested that I didn t remember where I was How it carries one back doesn t it I could examine it for hours but I have only a few minutes unfortunately for I am in the middle of a job out here Your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it unmercifully said Phillotson with good humoured satire She is quite sceptical as to its correctness No mister Phillotson I am not altogether I hate to be what is called a clever girl there are too many of that sort now answered Sue sensitively I only meant I don t know what I meant except that it was what you don t understand I know your meaning said Jude ardently although he did not And I think you are quite right That s a good Jude I know YOU believe in me She impulsively seized his hand and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster turned away to Jude her voice revealing a tremor which she herself felt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle She had not the least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at this momentary revelation of feeling and what a complication she was building up thereby in the futures of both The model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not to tire of it soon and a little later in the afternoon they were all marched back to Lumsdon Jude returning to his work He watched the juvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores filing down the street towards the country beside Phillotson and Sue and a sad dissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters lives had possession of him Phillotson had invited him to walk out and see them on Friday evening when there would be no lessons to give to Sue and Jude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the opportunity Meanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards and the next day on looking on the blackboard in Sue s class Phillotson was surprised to find upon it skilfully drawn in chalk a perspective view of Jerusalem with every building shown in its place I thought you took no interest in the model and hardly looked at it he said I hardly did said she but I remembered that much of it It is more than I had remembered myself Her Majesty s school inspector was at that time paying surprise visits in this neighbourhood to test the teaching unawares and two days later in the middle of the morning lessons the latch of the door was softly lifted and in walked my gentleman the king of terrors to pupil teachers To mister Phillotson the surprise was not great like the lady in the story he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared But Sue s class was at the further end of the room and her back was towards the entrance the inspector therefore came and stood behind her and watched her teaching some half minute before she became aware of his presence She turned and realized that an oft dreaded moment had come The effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a cry of fright Phillotson with a strange instinct of solicitude quite beyond his control was at her side just in time to prevent her falling from faintness She soon recovered herself and laughed but when the inspector had gone there was a reaction and she was so white that Phillotson took her into his room and gave her some brandy to bring her round She found him holding her hand You ought to have told me she gasped petulantly that one of the inspector s surprise visits was imminent Oh what shall I do Now he ll write and tell the managers that I am no good and I shall be disgraced for ever He won t do that my dear little girl You are the best teacher ever I had He looked so gently at her that she was moved and regretted that she had upbraided him When she was better she went home Jude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday On both Wednesday and Thursday he had been so much under the influence of his desire to see her that he walked after dark some distance along the road in the direction of the village and on returning to his room to read found himself quite unable to concentrate his mind on the page On Friday as soon as he had got himself up as he thought Sue would like to see him and made a hasty tea he set out notwithstanding that the evening was wet The trees overhead deepened the gloom of the hour and they dripped sadly upon him impressing him with forebodings illogical forebodings for though he knew that he loved her he also knew that he could not be more to her than he was On turning the corner and entering the village the first sight that greeted his eyes was that of two figures under one umbrella coming out of the vicarage gate He was too far back for them to notice him but he knew in a moment that they were Sue and Phillotson The latter was holding the umbrella over her head and they had evidently been paying a visit to the vicar probably on some business connected with the school work And as they walked along the wet and deserted lane Jude saw Phillotson place his arm round the girl s waist whereupon she gently removed it but he replaced it and she let it remain looking quickly round her with an air of misgiving She did not look absolutely behind her and therefore did not see Jude who sank into the hedge like one struck with a blight There he remained hidden till they had reached Sue s cottage and she had passed in Phillotson going on to the school hard by Oh he s too old for her too old cried Jude in all the terrible sickness of hopeless handicapped love He could not interfere Was he not Arabella s He was unable to go on further and retraced his steps towards Christminster Every tread of his feet seemed to say to him that he must on no account stand in the schoolmaster s way with Sue Phillotson was perhaps twenty years her senior but many a happy marriage had been made in such conditions of age The ironical clinch to his sorrow was given by the thought that the intimacy between his cousin and the schoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself VI Jude s old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen and on the following Sunday he went to see her a visit which was the result of a victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the village of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin in which the word nearest his heart could not be spoken and the sight which had tortured him could not be revealed His aunt was now unable to leave her bed and a great part of Jude s short day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort The little bakery business had been sold to a neighbour and with the proceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with necessaries and more a widow of the same village living with her and ministering to her wants It was not till the time had nearly come for him to leave that he obtained a quiet talk with her and his words tended insensibly towards his cousin Was Sue born here She was in this room They were living here at that time What made ee ask that Oh I wanted to know Now you ve been seeing her said the harsh old woman And what did I tell ee Well that I was not to see her Have you gossiped with her Yes Then don t keep it up She was brought up by her father to hate her mother s family and she ll look with no favour upon a working chap like you a townish girl as she s become by now I never cared much about her A pert little thing that s what she was too often with her tight strained nerves Many s the time I ve smacked her for her impertinence Why one day when she was walking into the pond with her shoes and stockings off and her petticoats pulled above her knees afore I could cry out for shame she said Move on Aunty This is no sight for modest eyes She was a little child then She was twelve if a day Well of course But now she s older she s of a thoughtful quivering tender nature and as sensitive as Jude cried his aunt springing up in bed Don t you be a fool about her No no of course not Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man could possibly do for himself by trying hard But she s gone to the other side of the world and med never trouble you again And there ll be a worse thing if you tied and bound as you be should have a fancy for Sue If your cousin is civil to you take her civility for what it is worth But anything more than a relation s good wishes it is stark madness for ee to give her If she s townish and wanton it med bring ee to ruin Don t say anything against her Aunt Don t please A relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse of his aunt who must have been listening to the conversation for she began a commentary on past years introducing Sue Bridehead as a character in her recollections She described what an odd little maid Sue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green opposite before her father went to London how when the vicar arranged readings and recitations she appeared on the platform the smallest of them all in her little white frock and shoes and pink sash how she recited Excelsior There was a sound of revelry by night and The Raven how during the delivery she would knit her little brows and glare round tragically and say to the empty air as if some real creature stood there Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night s Plutonian shore She d bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear corroborated the sick woman reluctantly as she stood there in her little sash and things that you could see un a most before your very eyes You too Jude had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the air The neighbour told also of Sue s accomplishments in other kinds She was not exactly a tomboy you know but she could do things that only boys do as a rule I ve seen her hit in and steer down the long slide on yonder pond with her little curls blowing one of a file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted on glass and up the back slide without stopping All boys except herself and then they d cheer her and then she d say Don t be saucy boys and suddenly run indoors They d try to coax her out again But a wouldn t come These retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable that he was unable to woo her and he left the cottage of his aunt that day with a heavy heart He would fain have glanced into the school to see the room in which Sue s little figure had so glorified itself but he checked his desire and went on It being Sunday evening some villagers who had known him during his residence here were standing in a group in their best clothes Jude was startled by a salute from one of them Ye ve got there right enough then Jude showed that he did not understand Why to the seat of l arning the City of Light you used to talk to us about as a little boy Is it all you expected of it Yes more cried Jude When I was there once for an hour I didn t see much in it for my part auld crumbling buildings half church half almshouse and not much going on at that You are wrong John there is more going on than meets the eye of a man walking through the streets It is a unique centre of thought and religion the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country All that silence and absence of goings on is the stillness of infinite motion the sleep of the spinning top to borrow the simile of a well known writer Oh well it med be all that or it med not As I say I didn t see nothing of it the hour or two I was there so I went in and had a pot o beer and a penny loaf and a ha porth o cheese and waited till it was time to come along home You ve j ined a college by this time I suppose Ah no said Jude I am almost as far off that as ever How so Jude slapped his pocket Just what we thought Such places be not for such as you only for them with plenty o money There you are wrong said Jude with some bitterness They are for such ones Still the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude s attention from the imaginative world he had lately inhabited in which an abstract figure more or less himself was steeping his mind in a sublimation of the arts and sciences and making his calling and election sure to a seat in the paradise of the learned He was set regarding his prospects in a cold northern light He had lately felt that he could not quite satisfy himself in his Greek in the Greek of the dramatists particularly So fatigued was he sometimes after his day s work that he could not maintain the critical attention necessary for thorough application He felt that he wanted a coach a friend at his elbow to tell him in a moment what sometimes would occupy him a weary month in extracting from unanticipative clumsy books It was decidedly necessary to consider facts a little more closely than he had done of late What was the good after all of using up his spare hours in a vague labour called private study without giving an outlook on practicabilities I ought to have thought of this before he said as he journeyed back It would have been better never to have embarked in the scheme at all than to do it without seeing clearly where I am going or what I am aiming at This hovering outside the walls of the colleges as if expecting some arm to be stretched out from them to lift me inside won t do I must get special information The next week accordingly he sought it What at first seemed an opportunity occurred one afternoon when he saw an elderly gentleman who had been pointed out as the head of a particular college walking in the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which Jude chanced to be sitting The gentleman came nearer and Jude looked anxiously at his face It seemed benign considerate yet rather reserved On second thoughts Jude felt that he could not go up and address him but he was sufficiently influenced by the incident to think what a wise thing it would be for him to state his difficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of these old masters and obtain their advice During the next week or two he accordingly placed himself in such positions about the city as would afford him glimpses of several of the most distinguished among the provosts wardens and other heads of houses and from those he ultimately selected five whose physiognomies seemed to say to him that they were appreciative and far seeing men To these five he addressed letters briefly stating his difficulties and asking their opinion on his stranded situation When the letters were posted Jude mentally began to criticize them he wished they had not been sent It is just one of those intrusive vulgar pushing applications which are so common in these days he thought Why couldn t I know better than address utter strangers in such a way I may be an impostor an idle scamp a man with a bad character for all that they know to the contrary Perhaps that s what I am Nevertheless he found himself clinging to the hope of some reply as to his one last chance of redemption He waited day after day saying that it was perfectly absurd to expect yet expecting While he waited he was suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson Phillotson was giving up the school near Christminster for a larger one further south in Mid Wessex What this meant how it would affect his cousin whether as seemed possible it was a practical move of the schoolmaster s towards a larger income in view of a provision for two instead of one he would not allow himself to say And the tender relations between Phillotson and the young girl of whom Jude was passionately enamoured effectually made it repugnant to Jude s tastes to apply to Phillotson for advice on his own scheme Meanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom Jude had written vouchsafed no answer and the young man was thus thrown back entirely on himself as formerly with the added gloom of a weakened hope By indirect inquiries he soon perceived clearly what he had long uneasily suspected that to qualify himself for certain open scholarships and exhibitions was the only brilliant course But to do this a good deal of coaching would be necessary and much natural ability It was next to impossible that a man reading on his own system however widely and thoroughly even over the prolonged period of ten years should be able to compete with those who had passed their lives under trained teachers and had worked to ordained lines The other course that of buying himself in so to speak seemed the only one really open to men like him the difficulty being simply of a material kind With the help of his information he began to reckon the extent of this material obstacle and ascertained to his dismay that at the rate at which with the best of fortune he would be able to save money fifteen years must elapse before he could be in a position to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance to a matriculation examination The undertaking was hopeless He saw what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the place had exercised over him To get there and live there to move among the churches and halls and become imbued with the genius loci had seemed to his dreaming youth as the spot shaped its charms to him from its halo on the horizon the obvious and ideal thing to do Let me only get there he had said with the fatuousness of Crusoe over his big boat and the rest is but a matter of time and energy It would have been far better for him in every way if he had never come within sight and sound of the delusive precincts had gone to some busy commercial town with the sole object of making money by his wits and thence surveyed his plan in true perspective Well all that was clear to him amounted to this that the whole scheme had burst up like an iridescent soap bubble under the touch of a reasoned inquiry He looked back at himself along the vista of his past years and his thought was akin to Heine s Above the youth s inspired and flashing eyes I see the motley mocking fool s cap rise Fortunately he had not been allowed to bring his disappointment into his dear Sue s life by involving her in this collapse And the painful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should now be spared her as far as possible After all she had only known a little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged thus unequipped poor and unforeseeing He always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he awoke from his dream Not quite knowing what to do with himself he went up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built theatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city It had windows all round from which an outlook over the whole town and its edifices could be gained Jude s eyes swept all the views in succession meditatively mournfully yet sturdily Those buildings and their associations and privileges were not for him From the looming roof of the great library into which he hardly ever had time to enter his gaze travelled on to the varied spires halls gables streets chapels gardens quadrangles which composed the ensemble of this unrivalled panorama He saw that his destiny lay not with these but among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he himself occupied unrecognized as part of the city at all by its visitors and panegyrists yet without whose denizens the hard readers could not read nor the high thinkers live He looked over the town into the country beyond to the trees which screened her whose presence had at first been the support of his heart and whose loss was now a maddening torture But for this blow he might have borne with his fate With Sue as companion he could have renounced his ambitions with a smile Without her it was inevitable that the reaction from the long strain to which he had subjected himself should affect him disastrously Phillotson had no doubt passed through a similar intellectual disappointment to that which now enveloped him But the schoolmaster had been since blest with the consolation of sweet Sue while for him there was no consoler Descending to the streets he went listlessly along till he arrived at an inn and entered it Here he drank several glasses of beer in rapid succession and when he came out it was night By the light of the flickering lamps he rambled home to supper and had not long been sitting at table when his landlady brought up a letter that had just arrived for him She laid it down as if impressed with a sense of its possible importance and on looking at it Jude perceived that it bore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he had addressed ONE at last cried Jude The communication was brief and not exactly what he had expected though it really was from the master in person It ran thus BIBLIOLL COLLEGE SIR I have read your letter with interest and judging from your description of yourself as a working man I venture to think that you will have a much better chance of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course That therefore is what I advise you to do Yours faithfully T TETUPHENAY To mister J FAWLEY Stone mason This terribly sensible advice exasperated Jude He had known all that before He knew it was true Yet it seemed a hard slap after ten years of labour and its effect upon him just now was to make him rise recklessly from the table and instead of reading as usual to go downstairs and into the street He stood at a bar and tossed off two or three glasses then unconsciously sauntered along till he came to a spot called The Fourways in the middle of the city gazing abstractedly at the groups of people like one in a trance till coming to himself he began talking to the policeman fixed there That officer yawned stretched out his elbows elevated himself an inch and a half on the balls of his toes smiled and looking humorously at Jude said You ve had a wet young man No I ve only begun he replied cynically Whatever his wetness his brains were dry enough He only heard in part the policeman s further remarks having fallen into thought on what struggling people like himself had stood at that crossway whom nobody ever thought of now It had more history than the oldest college in the city It was literally teeming stratified with the shades of human groups who had met there for tragedy comedy farce real enactments of the intensest kind At Fourways men had stood and talked of Napoleon the loss of America the execution of King Charles the burning of the Martyrs the Crusades the Norman Conquest possibly of the arrival of Caesar Here the two sexes had met for loving hating coupling parting had waited had suffered for each other had triumphed over each other cursed each other in jealousy blessed each other in forgiveness He began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating varied and compendious than the gown life These struggling men and women before him were the reality of Christminster though they knew little of Christ or Minster That was one of the humours of things The floating population of students and teachers who did know both in a way were not Christminster in a local sense at all He looked at his watch and in pursuit of this idea he went on till he came to a public hall where a promenade concert was in progress Jude entered and found the room full of shop youths and girls soldiers apprentices boys of eleven smoking cigarettes and light women of the more respectable and amateur class He had tapped the real Christminster life A band was playing and the crowd walked about and jostled each other and every now and then a man got upon a platform and sang a comic song The spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting and drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances wistful to gain a little joy At ten o clock he came away choosing a circuitous route homeward to pass the gates of the college whose head had just sent him the note The gates were shut and by an impulse he took from his pocket the lump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there and wrote along the wall I have understanding as well as you I am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these Job xii three VII The stroke of scorn relieved his mind and the next morning he laughed at his self conceit But the laugh was not a healthy one He re read the letter from the master and the wisdom in its lines which had at first exasperated him chilled and depressed him now He saw himself as a fool indeed 
1175_126221_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Deprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion he could not proceed to his work 
none	none	Whenever he felt reconciled to his fate as a student there came to disturb his calm his hopeless relations with Sue That the one affined soul he had ever met was lost to him through his marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency till unable to bear it longer he again rushed for distraction to the real Christminster life He now sought it out in an obscure and low ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies of the place and in brighter times would have interested him simply by its quaintness Here he sat more or less all the day convinced that he was at bottom a vicious character of whom it was hopeless to expect anything In the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one Jude still retaining his seat in the corner though his money was all spent and he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit He surveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity and philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly and made friends with several to wit Tinker Taylor a decayed church ironmonger who appeared to have been of a religious turn in earlier years but was somewhat blasphemous now also a red nosed auctioneer also two Gothic masons like himself called Uncle Jim and Uncle Joe There were present too some clerks and a gown and surplice maker s assistant two ladies who sported moral characters of various depths of shade according to their company nicknamed Bower o Bliss and Freckles some horsey men in the know of betting circles a travelling actor from the theatre and two devil may care young men who proved to be gownless undergraduates they had slipped in by stealth to meet a man about bull pups and stayed to drink and smoke short pipes with the racing gents aforesaid looking at their watches every now and then The conversation waxed general Christminster society was criticized the dons magistrates and other people in authority being sincerely pitied for their shortcomings while opinions on how they ought to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly respected were exchanged in a large minded and disinterested manner Jude Fawley with the self conceit effrontery and aplomb of a strong brained fellow in liquor threw in his remarks somewhat peremptorily and his aims having been what they were for so many years everything the others said turned upon his tongue by a sort of mechanical craze to the subject of scholarship and study the extent of his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that would have appeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours I don t care a damn he was saying for any provost warden principal fellow or cursed master of arts in the university What I know is that I d lick em on their own ground if they d give me a chance and show em a few things they are not up to yet Hear hear said the undergraduates from the corner where they were talking privately about the pups You always was fond o books I ve heard said Tinker Taylor and I don t doubt what you state Now with me twas different I always saw there was more to be learnt outside a book than in and I took my steps accordingly or I shouldn t have been the man I am You aim at the Church I believe said Uncle Joe If you are such a scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that why not give us a specimen of your scholarship Canst say the Creed in Latin man That was how they once put it to a chap down in my country I should think so said Jude haughtily Not he Like his conceit screamed one of the ladies Just you shut up Bower o Bliss said one of the undergraduates Silence He drank off the spirits in his tumbler rapped with it on the counter and announced The gentleman in the corner is going to rehearse the Articles of his Belief in the Latin tongue for the edification of the company I won t said Jude Yes have a try said the surplice maker You can t said Uncle Joe Yes he can said Tinker Taylor I ll swear I can said Jude Well come now stand me a small Scotch cold and I ll do it straight off That s a fair offer said the undergraduate throwing down the money for the whisky The barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person compelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species and the glass was handed across to Jude who having drunk the contents stood up and began rhetorically without hesitation Credo in unum Deum Patrem omnipotentem Factorem coeli et terrae visibilium omnium et invisibilium Good Excellent Latin cried one of the undergraduates who however had not the slightest conception of a single word A silence reigned among the rest in the bar and the maid stood still Jude s voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour where the landlord was dozing and bringing him out to see what was going on Jude had declaimed steadily ahead and was continuing Crucifixus etiam pro nobis sub Pontio Pilato passus et sepultus est Et resurrexit tertia die secundum Scripturas That s the Nicene sneered the second undergraduate And we wanted the Apostles You didn t say so And every fool knows except you that the Nicene is the most historic creed Let un go on let un go on said the auctioneer But Jude s mind seemed to grow confused soon and he could not get on He put his hand to his forehead and his face assumed an expression of pain Give him another glass then he ll fetch up and get through it said Tinker Taylor Somebody threw down threepence the glass was handed Jude stretched out his arm for it without looking and having swallowed the liquor went on in a moment in a revived voice raising it as he neared the end with the manner of a priest leading a congregation Et in Spiritum Sanctum Dominum et vivificantem qui ex Patre Filioque procedit Qui cum Patre et Filio simul adoratur et conglorificatur Qui locutus est per prophetas Et unam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam Confiteor unum Baptisma in remissionem peccatorum Et exspecto Resurrectionem mortuorum Et vitam venturi saeculi Amen Well done said several enjoying the last word as being the first and only one they had recognized Then Jude seemed to shake the fumes from his brain as he stared round upon them You pack of fools he cried Which one of you knows whether I have said it or no It might have been the Ratcatcher s Daughter in double Dutch for all that your besotted heads can tell See what I have brought myself to the crew I have come among The landlord who had already had his license endorsed for harbouring queer characters feared a riot and came outside the counter but Jude in his sudden flash of reason had turned in disgust and left the scene the door slamming with a dull thud behind him He hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street which he followed till it merged in the highway and all sound of his late companions had been left behind Onward he still went under the influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world to whom it seemed possible to fly an unreasoning desire whose ill judgement was not apparent to him now In the course of an hour when it was between ten and eleven o clock he entered the village of Lumsdon and reaching the cottage saw that a light was burning in a downstairs room which he assumed rightly as it happened to be hers Jude stepped close to the wall and tapped with his finger on the pane saying impatiently Sue Sue She must have recognized his voice for the light disappeared from the apartment and in a second or two the door was unlocked and opened and Sue appeared with a candle in her hand Is it Jude Yes it is My dear dear cousin what s the matter Oh I am I couldn t help coming Sue said he sinking down upon the doorstep I am so wicked Sue my heart is nearly broken and I could not bear my life as it was So I have been drinking and blaspheming or next door to it and saying holy things in disreputable quarters repeating in idle bravado words which ought never to be uttered but reverently Oh do anything with me Sue kill me I don t care Only don t hate me and despise me like all the rest of the world You are ill poor dear No I won t despise you of course I won t Come in and rest and let me see what I can do for you Now lean on me and don t mind With one hand holding the candle and the other supporting him she led him indoors and placed him in the only easy chair the meagrely furnished house afforded stretching his feet upon another and pulling off his boots Jude now getting towards his sober senses could only say Dear dear Sue in a voice broken by grief and contrition She asked him if he wanted anything to eat but he shook his head Then telling him to go to sleep and that she would come down early in the morning and get him some breakfast she bade him good night and ascended the stairs Almost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber and did not wake till dawn At first he did not know where he was but by degrees his situation cleared to him and he beheld it in all the ghastliness of a right mind She knew the worst of him the very worst How could he face her now She would soon be coming down to see about breakfast as she had said and there would he be in all his shame confronting her He could not bear the thought and softly drawing on his boots and taking his hat from the nail on which she had hung it he slipped noiselessly out of the house His fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide and perhaps pray and the only spot which occurred to him was Marygreen He called at his lodging in Christminster where he found awaiting him a note of dismissal from his employer and having packed up he turned his back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his side and struck southward into Wessex He had no money left in his pocket his small savings deposited at one of the banks in Christminster having fortunately been left untouched To get to Marygreen therefore his only course was walking and the distance being nearly twenty miles he had ample time to complete on the way the sobering process begun in him At some hour of the evening he reached Alfredston Here he pawned his waistcoat and having gone out of the town a mile or two slept under a rick that night At dawn he rose shook off the hayseeds and stems from his clothes and started again breasting the long white road up the hill to the downs which had been visible to him a long way off and passing the milestone at the top whereon he had carved his hopes years ago He reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast Weary and mud bespattered but quite possessed of his ordinary clearness of brain he sat down by the well thinking as he did so what a poor Christ he made Seeing a trough of water near he bathed his face and went on to the cottage of his great aunt whom he found breakfasting in bed attended by the woman who lived with her What out o work asked his relative regarding him through eyes sunken deep under lids heavy as pot covers no other cause for his tumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been a struggle with material things

none	none	heavily I think I must have a little rest Refreshed by some breakfast he went up to his old room and lay down in his shirt sleeves after the manner of the artizan He fell asleep for a short while and when he awoke it was as if he had awakened in hell It WAS hell the hell of conscious failure both in ambition and in love He thought of that previous abyss into which he had fallen before leaving this part of the country the deepest deep he had supposed it then but it was not so deep as this That had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope this was of his second line If he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous tension which he was now undergoing But that relief being denied to his virility he clenched his teeth in misery bringing lines about his mouth like those in the Laocoon and corrugations between his brows A mournful wind blew through the trees and sounded in the chimney like the pedal notes of an organ Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall of the churchless church yard hard by now abandoned pecked its neighbour smartly and the vane on the new Victorian Gothic church in the new spot had already begun to creak Yet apparently it was not always the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs it was a voice He guessed its origin in a moment or two the curate was praying with his aunt in the adjoining room He remembered her speaking of him Presently the sounds ceased and a step seemed to cross the landing Jude sat up and shouted Hoi The step made for his door which was open and a man looked in It was a young clergyman I think you are mister Highridge said Jude My aunt has mentioned you more than once Well here I am just come home a fellow gone to the bad though I had the best intentions in the world at one time Now I am melancholy mad what with drinking and one thing and another Slowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements by an unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious side of his dream and more upon the theological though this had up till now been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement Now I know I have been a fool and that folly is with me added Jude in conclusion And I don t regret the collapse of my university hopes one jot I wouldn t begin again if I were sure to succeed I don t care for social success any more at all But I do feel I should like to do some good thing and I bitterly regret the Church and the loss of my chance of being her ordained minister The curate who was a new man to this neighbourhood had grown deeply interested and at last he said If you feel a real call to the ministry and I won t say from your conversation that you do not for it is that of a thoughtful and educated man you might enter the Church as a licentiate Only you must make up your mind to avoid strong drink I could avoid that easily enough if I had any kind of hope to support me Part Third AT MELCHESTER For there was no other girl O bridegroom like her SAPPHO H T Wharton I It was a new idea the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct from the intellectual and emulative life A man could preach and do good to his fellow creatures without taking double firsts in the schools of Christminster or having anything but ordinary knowledge The old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the bishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all but a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice He feared that his whole scheme had degenerated to even though it might not have originated in a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler instincts which was purely an artificial product of civilization There were thousands of young men on the same self seeking track at the present moment The sensual hind who ate drank and lived carelessly with his wife through the days of his vanity was a more likable being than he But to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way that he could not in any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than that of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village or city slum that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in it that might be true religion and a purgatorial course worthy of being followed by a remorseful man The favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by contrast with his foregone intentions cheered Jude as he sat there shabby and lonely and it may be said to have given during the next few days the coup de grace to his intellectual career a career which had extended over the greater part of a dozen years He did nothing however for some long stagnant time to advance his new desire occupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and lettering headstones about the neighbouring villages and submitting to be regarded as a social failure a returned purchase by the half dozen or so of farmers and other country people who condescended to nod to him The human interest of the new intention and a human interest is indispensable to the most spiritual and self sacrificing was created by a letter from Sue bearing a fresh postmark She evidently wrote with anxiety and told very little about her own doings more than that she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen s Scholarship and was going to enter a training college at Melchester to complete herself for the vocation she had chosen partly by his influence There was a theological college at Melchester Melchester was a quiet and soothing place almost entirely ecclesiastical in its tone a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no establishment where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would perhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not As it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work at his trade while reading up Divinity which he had neglected at Christminster for the ordinary classical grind what better course for him than to get employment at the further city and pursue this plan of reading That his excessive human interest in the new place was entirely of Sue s making while at the same time Sue was to be regarded even less than formerly as proper to create it had an ethical contradictoriness to which he was not blind But that much he conceded to human frailty and hoped to learn to love her only as a friend and kinswoman He considered that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin his ministry at the age of thirty an age which much attracted him as being that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in Galilee This would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study and for acquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the necessary terms at a theological college Christmas had come and passed and Sue had gone to the Melchester Normal School The time was just the worst in the year for Jude to get into new employment and he had written suggesting to her that he should postpone his arrival for a month or so till the days had lengthened She had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not proposed it she evidently did not much care about him though she had never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to her that night and his silent disappearance Neither had she ever said a word about her relations with mister Phillotson Suddenly however quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue She was quite lonely and miserable she told him She hated the place she was in it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer s worse than anywhere She felt utterly friendless could he come immediately though when he did come she would only be able to see him at limited times the rules of the establishment she found herself in being strict to a degree It was mister Phillotson who had advised her to come there and she wished she had never listened to him Phillotson s suit was not exactly prospering evidently and Jude felt unreasonably glad He packed up his things and went to Melchester with a lighter heart than he had known for months This being the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for a temperance hotel and found a little establishment of that description in the street leading from the station When he had had something to eat he walked out into the dull winter light over the town bridge and turned the corner towards the Close The day was foggy and standing under the walls of the most graceful architectural pile in England he paused and looked up The lofty building was visible as far as the roofridge above the dwindling spire rose more and more remotely till its apex was quite lost in the mist drifting across it The lamps now began to be lighted and turning to the west front he walked round He took it as a good omen that numerous blocks of stone were lying about which signified that the cathedral was undergoing restoration or repair to a considerable extent It seemed to him full of the superstitions of his beliefs that this was an exercise of forethought on the part of a ruling Power that he might find plenty to do in the art he practised while waiting for a call to higher labours Then a wave of warmth came over him as he thought how near he now stood to the bright eyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead and pile of dark hair above it the girl with the kindling glance daringly soft at times something like that of the girls he had seen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school She was here actually in this Close in one of the houses confronting this very west facade He went down the broad gravel path towards the building It was an ancient edifice of the fifteenth century once a palace now a training school with mullioned and transomed windows and a courtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall Jude opened the gate and went up to the door through which on inquiring for his cousin he was gingerly admitted to a waiting room and in a few minutes she came Though she had been here such a short while she was not as he had seen her last All her bounding manner was gone her curves of motion had become subdued lines The screens and subtleties of convention had likewise disappeared Yet neither was she quite the woman who had written the letter that summoned him That had plainly been dashed off in an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat regretted thoughts that were possibly of his recent self disgrace Jude was quite overcome with emotion You don t think me a demoralized wretch for coming to you as I was and going so shamefully Sue Oh I have tried not to You said enough to let me know what had caused it I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness my poor Jude And I am glad you have come She wore a murrey coloured gown with a little lace collar It was made quite plain and hung about her slight figure with clinging gracefulness Her hair which formerly she had worn according to the custom of the day was now twisted up tightly and she had altogether the air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline an under brightness shining through from the depths which that discipline had not yet been able to reach She had come forward prettily but Jude felt that she had hardly expected him to kiss her as he was burning to do under other colours than those of cousinship He could not perceive the least sign that Sue regarded him as a lover or ever would do so now that she knew the worst of him even if he had the right to behave as one and this helped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial entanglement which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer dread of losing the bliss of her company Sue came out into the town with him and they walked and talked with tongues centred only on the passing moments Jude said he would like to buy her a little present of some sort and then she confessed with something of shame that she was dreadfully hungry They were kept on very short allowances in the college and a dinner tea and supper all in one was the present she most desired in the world Jude thereupon took her to an inn and ordered whatever the house afforded which was not much The place however gave them a delightful opportunity for a tete a tete nobody else being in the room and they talked freely She told him about the school as it was at that date and the rough living and the mixed character of her fellow students gathered together from all parts of the diocese and how she had to get up and work by gas light in the early morning with all the bitterness of a young person to whom restraint was new To all this he listened but it was not what he wanted especially to know her relations with Phillotson That was what she did not tell When they had sat and eaten Jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers she looked up and smiled and took his quite freely into her own little soft one dividing his fingers and coolly examining them as if they were the fingers of a glove she was purchasing Your hands are rather rough Jude aren t they she said Yes So would yours be if they held a mallet and chisel all day I don t dislike it you know I think it is noble to see a man s hands subdued to what he works in Well I m rather glad I came to this training school after all See how independent I shall be after the two years training I shall pass pretty high I expect and mister Phillotson will use his influence to get me a big school She had touched the subject at last I had a suspicion a fear said Jude that he cared about you rather warmly and perhaps wanted to marry you Now don t be such a silly boy He has said something about it I expect If he had what would it matter An old man like him Oh come Sue he s not so very old And I know what I saw him doing Not kissing me that I m certain No But putting his arm round your waist Ah I remember But I didn t know he was going to You are wriggling out if it Sue and it isn t quite kind Her ever sensitive lip began to quiver and her eye to blink at something this reproof was deciding her to say I know you ll be angry if I tell you everything and that s why I don t want to Very well then dear he said soothingly I have no real right to ask you and I don t wish to know I shall tell you said she with the perverseness that was part of her This is what I have done I have promised I have promised that I will marry him when I come out of the training school two years hence and have got my certificate his plan being that we shall then take a large double school in a great town he the boys and I the girls as married school teachers often do and make a good income between us Oh Sue But of course it is right you couldn t have done better He glanced at her and their eyes met the reproach in his own belying his words Then he drew his hand quite away from hers and turned his face in estrangement from her to the window Sue regarded him passively without moving I knew you would be angry she said with an air of no emotion whatever Very well I am wrong I suppose I ought not to have let you come to see me We had better not meet again and we ll only correspond at long intervals on purely business matters This was just the one thing he would not be able to bear as she probably knew and it brought him round at once Oh yes we will he said quickly Your being engaged can make no difference to me whatever I have a perfect right to see you when I want to and I shall Then don t let us talk of it any more It is quite spoiling our evening together What does it matter about what one is going to do two years hence She was something of a riddle to him and he let the subject drift away Shall we go and sit in the cathedral he asked when their meal was finished Cathedral Yes Though I think I d rather sit in the railway station she answered a remnant of vexation still in her voice That s the centre of the town life now The cathedral has had its day How modern you are So would you be if you had lived so much in the Middle Ages as I have done these last few years The cathedral was a very good place four or five centuries ago but it is played out now I am not modern either I am more ancient than mediaevalism if you only knew Jude looked distressed There I won t say any more of that she cried Only you don t know how bad I am from your point of view or you wouldn t think so much of me or care whether I was engaged or not Now there s just time for us to walk round the Close then I must go in or I shall be locked out for the night He took her to the gate and they parted Jude had a conviction that his unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this marriage engagement and it did anything but add to his happiness Her reproach had taken that shape then and not the shape of words However next day he set about seeking employment which it was not so easy to get as at Christminster there being as a rule less stone cutting in progress in this quiet city and hands being mostly permanent But he edged himself in by degrees His first work was some carving at the cemetery on the hill and ultimately he became engaged on the labour he most desired the cathedral repairs which were very extensive the whole interior stonework having been overhauled to be largely replaced by new It might be a labour of years to get it all done and he had confidence enough in his own skill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of choice with himself how long he would stay The lodgings he took near the Close Gate would not have disgraced a curate the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than mechanics of any sort usually care to pay His combined bed and sitting room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories and deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in her time and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece inscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same serious minded woman by her fellow servants on the occasion of her marriage Jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking photographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he had executed with his own hands and he was deemed a satisfactory acquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment He found an ample supply of theological books in the city book shops and with these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and direction from his former course As a relaxation from the Fathers and such stock works as Paley and Butler he read Newman Pusey and many other modern lights He hired a harmonium set it up in his lodging and practised chants thereon single and double II To morrow is our grand day you know Where shall we go I have leave from three till nine Wherever we can get to and come back from in that time Not ruins Jude I don t care for them Well Wardour Castle And then we can do Fonthill if we like all in the same afternoon Wardour is Gothic ruins and I hate Gothic No Quite otherwise It is a classic building Corinthian I think with a lot of pictures Ah that will do I like the sound of Corinthian We ll go Their conversation had run thus some few weeks later and next morning they prepared to start Every detail of the outing was a facet reflecting a sparkle to Jude and he did not venture to meditate on the life of inconsistency he was leading His Sue s conduct was one lovely conundrum to him he could say no more There duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her her emergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume that was rather enforced than desired the traipsing along to the station the porters B your leave the screaming of the trains everything formed the basis of a beautiful crystallization Nobody stared at Sue because she was so plainly dressed which comforted Jude in the thought that only himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued A matter of ten pounds spent in a drapery shop which had no connection with her real life or her real self would have set all Melchester staring The guard of the train thought they were lovers and put them into a compartment all by themselves That s a good intention wasted said she Jude did not respond He thought the remark unnecessarily cruel and partly untrue They reached the park and castle and wandered through the picture galleries Jude stopping by preference in front of the devotional pictures by Del Sarto Guido Reni Spagnoletto Sassoferrato Carlo Dolci and others Sue paused patiently beside him and stole critical looks into his face as regarding the Virgins Holy Families and Saints it grew reverent and abstracted When she had thoroughly estimated him at this she would move on and wait for him before a Lely or Reynolds It was evident that her cousin deeply interested her as one might be interested in a man puzzling out his way along a labyrinth from which one had one s self escaped When they came out a long time still remained to them and Jude proposed that as soon as they had had something to eat they should walk across the high country to the north of their present position and intercept the train of another railway leading back to Melchester at a station about seven miles off Sue who was inclined for any adventure that would intensify the sense of her day s freedom readily agreed and away they went leaving the adjoining station behind them It was indeed open country wide and high They talked and bounded on Jude cutting from a little covert a long walking stick for Sue as tall as herself with a great crook which made her look like a shepherdess About half way on their journey they crossed a main road running due east and west the old road from London to Land s End They paused and looked up and down it for a moment and remarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively thoroughfare while the wind dipped to earth and scooped straws and hay stems from the ground They crossed the road and passed on but during the next half mile Sue seemed to grow tired and Jude began to be distressed for her They had walked a good distance altogether and if they could not reach the other station it would be rather awkward For a long time there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and turnip land but presently they came to a sheepfold and next to the shepherd pitching hurdles He told them that the only house near was his mother s and his pointing to a little dip ahead from which a faint blue smoke arose and recommended them to go on and rest there This they did and entered the house admitted by an old woman without a single tooth to whom they were as civil as strangers can be when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of the householder A nice little cottage said Jude Oh I don t know about the niceness I shall have to thatch it soon and where the thatch is to come from I can t tell for straw do get that dear that twill soon be cheaper to cover your house wi chainey plates than thatch They sat resting and the shepherd came in Don t ee mind I he said with a deprecating wave of the hand bide here as long as ye will But mid you be thinking o getting back to Melchester to night by train Because you ll never do it in this world since you don t know the lie of the country I don t mind going with ye some o the ways but even then the train mid be gone They started up You can bide here you know over the night can t em Mother The place is welcome to ye Tis hard lying rather but volk may do worse He turned to Jude and asked privately Be you a married couple Hsh no said Jude Oh I meant nothing ba dy not I Well then she can go into Mother s room and you and I can lie in the outer chimmer after they ve gone through I can call ye soon enough to catch the first train back You ve lost this one now On consideration they decided to close with this offer and drew up and shared with the shepherd and his mother the boiled bacon and greens for supper I rather like this said Sue while their entertainers were clearing away the dishes Outside all laws except gravitation and germination You only think you like it you don t you are quite a product of civilization said Jude a recollection of her engagement reviving his soreness a little Indeed I am not Jude I like reading and all that but I crave to get back to the life of my infancy and its freedom Do you remember it so well You seem to me to have nothing unconventional at all about you Oh haven t I You don t know what s inside me What The Ishmaelite An urban miss is what you are She looked severe disagreement and turned away The shepherd aroused them the next morning as he had said It was bright and clear and the four miles to the train were accomplished pleasantly When they had reached Melchester and walked to the Close and the gables of the old building in which she was again to be immured rose before Sue s eyes she looked a little scared I expect I shall catch it she murmured They rang the great bell and waited Oh I bought something for you which I had nearly forgotten she said quickly searching her pocket It is a new little photograph of me Would you like it WOULD I He took it gladly and the porter came There seemed to be an ominous glance on his face when he opened the gate She passed in looking back at Jude and waving her hand III 
985-126224-0000	train-other-500	The seventy young women of ages varying in the main from nineteen to one and twenty though several were older who at this date filled the species of nunnery known as the Training School at Melchester formed a very mixed community
985-126224-0001	train-other-500	which included the daughters of mechanics curates surgeons shopkeepers farmers dairy men soldiers sailors and villagers They sat in the large school room of the establishment on the evening previously described
985-126224-0002	train-other-500	and word was passed round that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing time She went out with her young man said a second year s student who knew about young men And Miss Traceley saw her at the station with him She ll have it hot when she does come
985-126224-0003	train-other-500	She said he was her cousin observed a youthful new girl That excuse has been made a little too often in this school to be effectual in saving our souls said the head girl of the year drily The fact was that only twelve months before
none	none	 there had occurred a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils 
985-126224-0004	train-other-500	who had made the same statement in order to gain meetings with her lover The affair had created a scandal and the management had consequently been rough on cousins ever since
985-126224-0005	train-other-500	At nine o clock the names were called Sue s being pronounced three times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer
none	none	 At a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the Evening Hymn and then knelt down to prayers After prayers they went in to supper 
985-126224-0006	train-other-500	and every girl s thought was Where is Sue Bridehead
none	none	 Some of the students who had seen Jude from the window felt that they would not mind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being kissed 
985-126224-0007	train-other-500	by such a kindly faced young man Hardly one among them believed in the cousinship Half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles their tender feminine faces upturned to the flaring gas jets which at intervals stretched down the long dormitories
985-126224-0008	train-other-500	every face bearing the legend The Weaker upon it as the penalty of the sex wherein they were moulded which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and abilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature remain what they are They formed a pretty suggestive pathetic sight
none	none	 of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious 
985-126224-0009	train-other-500	and would not discover till amid the storms and strains of after years with their injustice loneliness child bearing and bereavement their minds would revert to this experience as to something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently regarded
985-126224-0010	train-other-500	One of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights and before doing so gave a final glance at Sue s cot which remained empty
985-126224-0011	train-other-500	and at her little dressing table at the foot which like all the rest was ornamented with various girlish trifles framed photographs being not the least conspicuous among them Sue s table had a moderate show
985-126224-0012	train-other-500	two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her looking glass Who are these men did she ever say asked the mistress Strictly speaking relations portraits only are allowed on these tables you know One
none	none	 the middle aged man said a student in the next bed 
985-126224-0013	train-other-500	is the schoolmaster she served under mister Phillotson And the other this undergraduate in cap and gown who is he
none	none	 He is a friend or was She has never told his name Was it either of these two who came for her No 
985-126224-0014	train-other-500	You are sure twas not the undergraduate Quite He was a young man with a black beard The lights were promptly extinguished and till they fell asleep the girls indulged in conjectures about Sue
985-126224-0015	train-other-500	and wondered what games she had carried on in London and at Christminster before she came here some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral opposite and the spire rising behind it
985-126224-0016	train-other-500	When they awoke the next morning they glanced into Sue s nook to find it still without a tenant After the early lessons by gas light in half toilet and when they had come up to dress for breakfast the bell of the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly
985-126224-0017	train-other-500	The mistress of the dormitory went away and presently came back to say that the principal s orders were that nobody was to speak to Bridehead without permission
none	none	 When accordingly Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy herself looking flushed and tired she went to her cubicle in silence 
985-126224-0018	train-other-500	none of them coming out to greet her or to make inquiry When they had gone downstairs they found that she did not follow them into the dining hall to breakfast and they then learnt that she had been severely reprimanded and ordered to a solitary room for a week there to be confined and take her meals
985-126224-0019	train-other-500	and do all her reading At this the seventy murmured the sentence being they thought too severe A round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal asking for a remission of Sue s punishment No notice was taken
985-126224-0020	train-other-500	Towards evening when the geography mistress began dictating her subject the girls in the class sat with folded arms You mean that you are not going to work said the mistress at last
985-126224-0021	train-other-500	I may as well tell you that it has been ascertained that the young man Bridehead stayed out with was not her cousin for the very good reason that she has no such relative We have written to Christminster to ascertain We are willing to take her word said the head girl
985-126224-0022	train-other-500	This young man was discharged from his work at Christminster for drunkenness and blasphemy in public houses and he has come here to live entirely to be near her However they remained stolid and motionless and the mistress left the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done
985-126224-0023	train-other-500	Presently towards dusk the pupils as they sat heard exclamations from the first year s girls in an adjoining classroom and one rushed in to say that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the room in which she had been confined escaped in the dark across the lawn
none	none	 and disappeared How she had managed to get out of the garden nobody could tell as it was bounded by the river at the bottom and the side door was locked They went and looked at the empty room the casement between the middle mullions of which stood open 
985-126224-0024	train-other-500	The lawn was again searched with a lantern every bush and shrub being examined but she was nowhere hidden Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated and on reflection he said that he remembered hearing a sort of splashing in the stream at the back but he had taken no notice
985-126224-0025	train-other-500	thinking some ducks had come down the river from above She must have walked through the river said a mistress Or drownded herself said the porter The mind of the matron was horrified not so much at the possible death of Sue
985-126224-0026	train-other-500	as at the possible half column detailing that event in all the newspapers which added to the scandal of the year before would give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to come
985-126224-0027	train-other-500	More lanterns were procured and the river examined and then at last on the opposite shore which was open to the fields some little boot tracks were discerned in the mud which left no doubt that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water reaching nearly to her shoulders
985-126224-0028	train-other-500	for this was the chief river of the county and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself the matron began to speak superciliously of her and to express gladness that she was gone
none	none	 On the self same evening Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate 
985-126224-0029	train-other-500	Often at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent Close and stand opposite the house that contained Sue and watch the shadows of the girls heads passing to and fro upon the blinds
985-126224-0030	train-other-500	and wish he had nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many of the thoughtless inmates despised But to night having finished tea and brushed himself up he was deep in the perusal of the Twenty ninth Volume of Pusey s Library of the Fathers
985-126224-0031	train-other-500	a set of books which he had purchased of a second hand dealer at a price that seemed to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work He fancied he heard something rattle lightly against his window
none	none	 then he heard it again Certainly somebody had thrown gravel 
985-126224-0032	train-other-500	He rose and gently lifted the sash Jude from below Sue Yes it is Can I come up without being seen Oh yes Then don t come down Shut the window Jude waited
985-126224-0033	train-other-500	knowing that she could enter easily enough the front door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn as in most old country towns He palpitated at the thought that she had fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to her in his What counterparts they were
985-126224-0034	train-other-500	He unlatched the door of his room heard a stealthy rustle on the dark stairs and in a moment she appeared in the light of his lamp He went up to seize her hand and found she was clammy as a marine deity and that her clothes clung to her like the robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze
985-126224-0035	train-other-500	I m so cold she said through her chattering teeth
none	none	 Can I come by your fire Jude 
985-126224-0036	train-other-500	She crossed to his little grate and very little fire but as the water dripped from her as she moved the idea of drying herself was absurd Whatever have you done darling he asked with alarm the tender epithet slipping out unawares
985-126224-0037	train-other-500	Walked through the largest river in the county that s what I ve done They locked me up for being out with you and it seemed so unjust that I couldn t bear it so I got out of the window and escaped across the stream
none	none	 She had begun the explanation in her usual slightly independent tones but before she had finished the thin pink lips trembled and she could hardly refrain from crying 
985-126224-0038	train-other-500	Dear Sue he said You must take off all your things And let me see
none	none	 you must borrow some from the landlady I ll ask her 
985-126224-0039	train-other-500	No no Don t let her know for God s sake
none	none	 We are so near the school that they ll come after me 
985-126224-0040	train-other-500	Then you must put on mine You don t mind Oh no My Sunday suit you know It is close here In fact everything was close and handy in Jude s single chamber because there was not room for it to be otherwise He opened a drawer took out his best dark suit
985-126224-0041	train-other-500	and giving the garments a shake said Now how long shall I give you Ten minutes
none	none	 Jude left the room and went into the street where he walked up and down 
985-126224-0042	train-other-500	A clock struck half past seven and he returned Sitting in his only arm chair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as himself on a Sunday so pathetic in her defencelessness that his heart felt big with the sense of it On two other chairs before the fire were her wet garments
985-126224-0043	train-other-500	She blushed as he sat down beside her but only for a moment I suppose Jude it is odd that you should see me like this and all my things hanging there Yet what nonsense They are only a woman s clothes sexless cloth and linen I wish I didn t feel so ill and sick
none	none	 Will you dry my clothes now Please do Jude and I ll get a lodging by and by It is not late yet 
985-126224-0044	train-other-500	No you shan t if you are ill You must stay here Dear dear Sue what can I get for you I don t know I can t help shivering I wish I could get warm Jude put on her his great coat in addition and then ran out to the nearest public house
985-126224-0045	train-other-500	whence he returned with a little bottle in his hand Here s six of best brandy he said Now you drink it dear all of it I can t out of the bottle can I Jude fetched the glass from the dressing table and administered the spirit in some water
985-126224-0046	train-other-500	She gasped a little but gulped it down and lay back in the armchair
none	none	 She then began to relate circumstantially her experiences since they had parted 
985-126224-0047	train-other-500	but in the middle of her story her voice faltered her head nodded and she ceased She was in a sound sleep Jude dying of anxiety lest she should have caught a chill which might permanently injure her
none	none	 was glad to hear the regular breathing 
985-126224-0048	train-other-500	He softly went nearer to her and observed that a warm flush now rosed her hitherto blue cheeks and felt that her hanging hand was no longer cold
none	none	 Then he stood with his back to the fire regarding her and saw in her almost a divinity IV Jude s reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending the stairs He whisked Sue s clothing from the chair where it was drying thrust it under the bed and sat down to his book Somebody knocked and opened the door immediately It was the landlady Oh I didn t know whether you was in or not mister Fawley I wanted to know if you would require supper I see you ve a young gentleman Yes ma am But I think I won t come down to night Will you bring supper up on a tray and I ll have a cup of tea as well It was Jude s custom to go downstairs to the kitchen and eat his meals with the family to save trouble His landlady brought up the supper however on this occasion and he took it from her at the door When she had descended he set the teapot on the hob and drew out Sue s clothes anew but they were far from dry A thick woollen gown he found held a deal of water So he hung them up again and enlarged his fire and mused as the steam from the garments went up the chimney Suddenly she said Jude Yes All right How do you feel now Better Quite well Why I fell asleep didn t I What time is it Not late surely It is past ten Is it really What SHALL I do she said starting up Stay where you are Yes that s what I want to do But I don t know what they would say And what will you do I am going to sit here by the fire all night and read To morrow is Sunday and I haven t to go out anywhere Perhaps you will be saved a severe illness by resting there Don t be frightened I m all right Look here what I have got for you Some supper When she had sat upright she breathed plaintively and said I do feel rather weak still I thought I was well and I ought not to be here ought I But the supper fortified her somewhat and when she had had some tea and had lain back again she was bright and cheerful The tea must have been green or too long drawn for she seemed preternaturally wakeful afterwards though Jude who had not taken any began to feel heavy till her conversation fixed his attention You called me a creature of civilization or something didn t you she said breaking a silence It was very odd you should have done that Why Well because it is provokingly wrong I am a sort of negation of it You are very philosophical A negation is profound talking Is it Do I strike you as being learned she asked with a touch of raillery No not learned Only you don t talk quite like a girl well a girl who has had no advantages I have had advantages I don t know Latin and Greek though I know the grammars of those tongues But I know most of the Greek and Latin classics through translations and other books too I read Lempriere Catullus Martial Juvenal Lucian Beaumont and Fletcher Boccaccio Scarron De Brantome Sterne De Foe Smollett Fielding Shakespeare the Bible and other such and found that all interest in the unwholesome part of those books ended with its mystery You have read more than I he said with a sigh How came you to read some of those queerer ones Well she said thoughtfully it was by accident My life has been entirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me I have no fear of men as such nor of their books I have mixed with them one or two of them particularly almost as one of their own sex I mean I have not felt about them as most women are taught to feel to be on their guard against attacks on their virtue for no average man no man short of a sensual savage will molest a woman by day or night at home or abroad unless she invites him Until she says by a look Come on he is always afraid to and if you never say it or look it he never comes However what I was going to say is that when I was eighteen I formed a friendly intimacy with an undergraduate at Christminster and he taught me a great deal and lent me books which I should never have got hold of otherwise Is your friendship broken off Oh yes He died poor fellow two or three years after he had taken his degree and left Christminster You saw a good deal of him I suppose Yes We used to go about together on walking tours reading tours and things of that sort like two men almost He asked me to live with him and I agreed to by letter But when I joined him in London I found he meant a different thing from what I meant He wanted me to be his mistress in fact but I wasn t in love with him and on my saying I should go away if he didn t agree to MY plan he did so We shared a sitting room for fifteen months and he became a leader writer for one of the great London dailies till he was taken ill and had to go abroad He said I was breaking his heart by holding out against him so long at such close quarters he could never have believed it of woman I might play that game once too often he said He came home merely to die His death caused a terrible remorse in me for my cruelty though I hope he died of consumption and not of me entirely I went down to Sandbourne to his funeral and was his only mourner He left me a little money because I broke his heart I suppose That s how men are so much better than women Good heavens what did you do then Ah now you are angry with me she said a contralto note of tragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice I wouldn t have told you if I had known
899_126232_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 No I am not 
none	none	Tell me all Well I invested his money poor fellow in a bubble scheme and lost it I lived about London by myself for some time and then I returned to Christminster as my father who was also in London and had started as an art metal worker near Long Acre wouldn t have me back and I got that occupation in the artist shop where you found me I said you didn t know how bad I was Jude looked round upon the arm chair and its occupant as if to read more carefully the creature he had given shelter to His voice trembled as he said However you have lived Sue I believe you are as innocent as you are unconventional I am not particularly innocent as you see now that I have twitched the robe From that blank lay figure your fancy draped said she with an ostensible sneer though he could hear that she was brimming with tears But I have never yielded myself to any lover if that s what you mean I have remained as I began I quite believe you But some women would not have remained as they began Perhaps not Better women would not People say I must be cold natured sexless on account of it But I won t have it Some of the most passionately erotic poets have been the most self contained in their daily lives Have you told mister Phillotson about this university scholar friend Yes long ago I have never made any secret of it to anybody What did he say He did not pass any criticism only said I was everything to him whatever I did and things like that Jude felt much depressed she seemed to get further and further away from him with her strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender Aren t you REALLY vexed with me dear Jude she suddenly asked in a voice of such extraordinary tenderness that it hardly seemed to come from the same woman who had just told her story so lightly I would rather offend anybody in the world than you I think I don t know whether I am vexed or not I know I care very much about you I care as much for you as for anybody I ever met You don t care MORE There I ought not to say that Don t answer it There was another long silence He felt that she was treating him cruelly though he could not quite say in what way Her very helplessness seemed to make her so much stronger than he I am awfully ignorant on general matters although I have worked so hard he said to turn the subject I am absorbed in theology you know And what do you think I should be doing just about now if you weren t here I should be saying my evening prayers I suppose you wouldn t like Oh no no she answered I would rather not if you don t mind I should seem so such a hypocrite I thought you wouldn t join so I didn t propose it You must remember that I hope to be a useful minister some day To be ordained I think you said Yes Then you haven t given up the idea I thought that perhaps you had by this time Of course not I fondly thought at first that you felt as I do about that as you were so mixed up in Christminster Anglicanism And mister Phillotson I have no respect for Christminster whatever except in a qualified degree on its intellectual side said Sue Bridehead earnestly My friend I spoke of took that out of me He was the most irreligious man I ever knew and the most moral And intellect at Christminster is new wine in old bottles The mediaevalism of Christminster must go be sloughed off or Christminster itself will have to go To be sure at times one couldn t help having a sneaking liking for the traditions of the old faith as preserved by a section of the thinkers there in touching and simple sincerity but when I was in my saddest rightest mind I always felt O ghastly glories of saints dead limbs of gibbeted Gods Sue you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that Then I won t dear Jude The emotional throat note had come back and she turned her face away I still think Christminster has much that is glorious though I was resentful because I couldn t get there He spoke gently and resisted his impulse to pique her on to tears It is an ignorant place except as to the townspeople artizans drunkards and paupers she said perverse still at his differing from her THEY see life as it is of course but few of the people in the colleges do You prove it in your own person You are one of the very men Christminster was intended for when the colleges were founded a man with a passion for learning but no money or opportunities or friends But you were elbowed off the pavement by the millionaires sons Well I can do without what it confers I care for something higher And I for something broader truer she insisted At present intellect in Christminster is pushing one way and religion the other and so they stand stock still like two rams butting each other What would mister Phillotson It is a place full of fetishists and ghost seers He noticed that whenever he tried to speak of the schoolmaster she turned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending university Jude was extremely morbidly curious about her life as Phillotson s protegee and betrothed yet she would not enlighten him Well that s just what I am too he said I am fearful of life spectre seeing always But you are good and dear she murmured His heart bumped and he made no reply You are in the Tractarian stage just now are you not she added putting on flippancy to hide real feeling a common trick with her Let me see when was I there In the year eighteen hundred and There s a sarcasm in that which is rather unpleasant to me Sue Now will you do what I want you to At this time I read a chapter and then say prayers as I told you Now will you concentrate your attention on any book of these you like and sit with your back to me and leave me to my custom You are sure you won t join me I ll look at you No Don t tease Sue Very well I ll do just as you bid me and I won t vex you Jude she replied in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever after turning her back upon him accordingly A small Bible other than the one he was using lay near her and during his retreat she took it up and turned over the leaves Jude she said brightly when he had finished and come back to her will you let me make you a NEW New Testament like the one I made for myself at Christminster Oh yes

none	none	made I altered my old one by cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into separate brochures and rearranging them in chronological order as written beginning the book with Thessalonians following on with the Epistles and putting the Gospels much further on Then I had the volume rebound My university friend mister but never mind his name poor boy said it was an excellent idea I know that reading it afterwards made it twice as interesting as before and twice as understandable H m said Jude with a sense of sacrilege And what a literary enormity this is she said as she glanced into the pages of Solomon s Song I mean the synopsis at the head of each chapter explaining away the real nature of that rhapsody You needn t be alarmed nobody claims inspiration for the chapter headings Indeed many divines treat them with contempt It seems the drollest thing to think of the four and twenty elders or bishops or whatever number they were sitting with long faces and writing down such stuff Jude looked pained You are quite Voltairean he murmured Indeed Then I won t say any more except that people have no right to falsify the Bible I HATE such hum bug as could attempt to plaster over with ecclesiastical abstractions such ecstatic natural human love as lies in that great and passionate song Her speech had grown spirited and almost petulant at his rebuke and her eyes moist I WISH I had a friend here to support me but nobody is ever on my side But my dear Sue my very dear Sue I am not against you he said taking her hand and surprised at her introducing personal feeling into mere argument Yes you are yes you are she cried turning away her face that he might not see her brimming eyes You are on the side of the people in the training school at least you seem almost to be What I insist on is that to explain such verses as this Whither is thy beloved gone O thou fairest among women by the note The Church professeth her faith is supremely ridiculous Well then let it be You make such a personal matter of everything I am only too inclined just now to apply the words profanely You know YOU are fairest among women to me come to that But you are not to say it now Sue replied her voice changing to its softest note of severity Then their eyes met and they shook hands like cronies in a tavern and Jude saw the absurdity of quarrelling on such a hypothetical subject and she the silliness of crying about what was written in an old book like the Bible I won t disturb your convictions I really won t she went on soothingly for now he was rather more ruffled than she But I did want and long to ennoble some man to high aims and when I saw you and knew you wanted to be my comrade I shall I confess it thought that man might be you But you take so much tradition on trust that I don t know what to say Well dear I suppose one must take some things on trust Life isn t long enough to work out everything in Euclid problems before you believe it I take Christianity Well perhaps you might take something worse Indeed I might Perhaps I have done so He thought of Arabella I won t ask what because we are going to be VERY nice with each other aren t we and never never vex each other any more She looked up trustfully and her voice seemed trying to nestle in his breast I shall always care for you said Jude And I for you Because you are single hearted and forgiving to your faulty and tiresome little Sue He looked away for that epicene tenderness of hers was too harrowing Was it that which had broken the heart of the poor leader writer and was he to be the next one But Sue was so dear If he could only get over the sense of her sex as she seemed to be able to do so easily of his what a comrade she would make for their difference of opinion on conjectural subjects only drew them closer together on matters of daily human experience She was nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met and he could scarcely believe that time creed or absence would ever divide him from her But his grief at her incredulities returned They sat on till she fell asleep again and he nodded in his chair likewise Whenever he aroused himself he turned her things and made up the fire anew About six o clock he awoke completely and lighting a candle found that her clothes were dry Her chair being a far more comfortable one than his she still slept on inside his great coat looking warm as a new bun and boyish as a Ganymede Placing the garments by her and touching her on the shoulder he went downstairs and washed himself by starlight in the yard V

899_126232_000068_000002	train-clean-360	stay there 
none	none	till this has blown over and I get back to the training school again At the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of coffee 
985-126226-0003	train-other-500	in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising to go to his work every day before the household was astir Now a dew bit to eat with it he said and off we go You can have a regular breakfast when you get there They went quietly out of the house Jude accompanying her to the station
none	none	 As they departed along the street a head was thrust out of an upper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn Sue still seemed sorry for her rashness 
985-126226-0004	train-other-500	and to wish she had not rebelled telling him at parting that she would let him know as soon as she got re admitted to the training school They stood rather miserably together on the platform
none	none	 and it was apparent that he wanted to say more 
985-126226-0005	train-other-500	I want to tell you something two things he said hurriedly as the train came up One is a warm one the other a cold one Jude she said I know one of them And you mustn t What You mustn t love me
985-126226-0006	train-other-500	You are to like me that s all Jude s face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was agitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage window And then the train moved on and waving her pretty hand to him she vanished away
985-126226-0007	train-other-500	Melchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her departure and the Close so hateful that he did not go once to the cathedral services The next morning there came a letter from her
985-126226-0008	train-other-500	which with her usual promptitude she had written directly she had reached her friend s house She told him of her safe arrival and comfortable quarters and then added What I really write about dear Jude is something I said to you at parting You had been so very good and kind to me
985-126226-0009	train-other-500	that when you were out of sight I felt what a cruel and ungrateful woman I was to say it and it has reproached me ever since IF YOU WANT TO LOVE ME JUDE YOU MAY I don t mind at all
none	none	 and I ll never say again that you mustn t 
985-126226-0010	train-other-500	Now I won t write any more about that You do forgive your thoughtless friend for her cruelty and won t make her miserable by saying you don t Ever SUE It would be superfluous to say what his answer was
985-126226-0011	train-other-500	and how he thought what he would have done had he been free which should have rendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for Sue He felt he might have been pretty sure of his own victory if it had come to a conflict between Phillotson and himself for the possession of her
985-126226-0012	train-other-500	Yet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue s impulsive note than it really was intended to bear
none	none	 After the lapse of a few days he found himself hoping that she would write again 
985-126226-0013	train-other-500	But he received no further communication and in the intensity of his solicitude he sent another note suggesting that he should pay her a visit some Sunday the distance being under eighteen miles He expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his missive but none came
985-126226-0014	train-other-500	The third morning arrived the postman did not stop This was Saturday
none	none	 and in a feverish state of anxiety about her he sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming the following day 
985-126226-0015	train-other-500	for he felt sure something had happened His first and natural thought had been that she was ill from her immersion
none	none	 but it soon occurred to him that somebody would have written for her in such a case 
985-126226-0016	train-other-500	Conjectures were put an end to by his arrival at the village school house near Shaston on the bright morning of Sunday between eleven and twelve o clock when the parish was as vacant as a desert most of the inhabitants having gathered inside the church whence their voices could occasionally be heard in unison
985-126226-0017	train-other-500	A little girl opened the door Miss Bridehead is up stairs she said And will you please walk up to her Is she ill asked Jude hastily Only a little not very Jude entered and ascended
985-126226-0018	train-other-500	On reaching the landing a voice told him which way to turn the voice of Sue calling his name He passed the doorway and found her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet square Oh Sue he cried sitting down beside her and taking her hand How is this You couldn t write
985-126226-0019	train-other-500	No it wasn t that she answered I did catch a bad cold but I could have written Only I wouldn t Why not frightening me like this
none	none	 Yes that was what I was afraid of But I had decided not to write to you any more 
985-126226-0020	train-other-500	They won t have me back at the school that s why I couldn t write Not the fact but the reason Well They not only won t have me but they gave me a parting piece of advice What She did not answer directly
none	none	 I vowed I never would tell you Jude it is so vulgar and distressing 
985-126226-0021	train-other-500	Is it about us Yes But do tell me Well somebody has sent them baseless reports about us and they say you and I ought to marry as soon as possible for the sake of my reputation There now I have told you and I wish I hadn t
985-126226-0022	train-other-500	Oh poor Sue I don t think of you like that means It did just OCCUR to me to regard you in the way they think I do but I hadn t begun to I HAVE recognized that the cousinship was merely nominal since we met as total strangers But my marrying you dear Jude
none	none	 why of course if I had reckoned upon marrying you I shouldn t have come to you so often 
985-126226-0023	train-other-500	And I never supposed you thought of such a thing as marrying me till the other evening when I began to fancy you did love me a little Perhaps I ought not to have been so intimate with you It is all my fault Everything is my fault always
985-126226-0024	train-other-500	The speech seemed a little forced and unreal and they regarded each other with a mutual distress I was so blind at first she went on I didn t see what you felt at all Oh you have been unkind to me you have
985-126226-0025	train-other-500	to look upon me as a sweetheart without saying a word and leaving me to discover it myself Your attitude to me has become known and naturally they think we ve been doing wrong I ll never trust you again Yes Sue he said simply
985-126226-0026	train-other-500	I am to blame more than you think I was quite aware that you did not suspect till within the last meeting or two what I was feeling about you I admit that our meeting as strangers prevented a sense of relationship and that it was a sort of subterfuge to avail myself of it
985-126226-0027	train-other-500	But don t you think I deserve a little consideration for concealing my wrong very wrong sentiments since I couldn t help having them She turned her eyes doubtfully towards him and then looked away as if afraid she might forgive him
985-126226-0028	train-other-500	By every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that fitted the mood and the moment under the suasion of which Sue s undemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed its temperature Some men would have cast scruples to the winds and ventured it
none	none	 oblivious both of Sue s declaration of her neutral feelings 
985-126226-0029	train-other-500	and of the pair of autographs in the vestry chest of Arabella s parish church Jude did not
none	none	 He had in fact come in part to tell his own fatal story It was upon his lips 
985-126226-0030	train-other-500	yet at the hour of this distress he could not disclose it He preferred to dwell upon the recognized barriers between them Of course I know you don t
none	none	 care about me in any 
985-126226-0031	train-other-500	particular way he sorrowed You ought not and you are right You belong to mister Phillotson I suppose he has been to see you Yes she said shortly her face changing a little Though I didn t ask him to come You are glad of course that he has been
899_126233_000006_000001	train-clean-360	you are right

985-126226-0032	train-other-500	It was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his honest acquiescence in his rival if Jude s feelings of love were deprecated by her He went on to something else This will blow over dear Sue he said
985-126226-0033	train-other-500	The training school authorities are not all the world You can get to be a student in some other no doubt I ll ask mister Phillotson she said decisively Sue s kind hostess now returned from church and there was no more intimate conversation
none	none	 Jude left in the afternoon hopelessly unhappy 
985-126226-0034	train-other-500	But he had seen her and sat with her Such intercourse as that would have to content him for the remainder of his life The lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper that he as a parish priest should learn
985-126226-0035	train-other-500	But the next morning when he awoke he felt rather vexed with her and decided that she was rather unreasonable not to say capricious
none	none	 Then in illustration of what he had begun to discern as one of her redeeming characteristics 
985-126226-0036	train-other-500	there came promptly a note which she must have written almost immediately he had gone from her Forgive me for my petulance yesterday I was horrid to you I know it and I feel perfectly miserable at my horridness It was so dear of you not to be angry Jude
985-126226-0037	train-other-500	please still keep me as your friend and associate with all my faults I ll try not to be like it again

none	none	 Your repentant SUE Jude forgave her straightway and asked her to call for him at the cathedral works when she came VI Meanwhile a middle aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty concerning the writer of the above letter He was Richard Phillotson who had recently removed from the mixed village school at Lumsdon near Christminster to undertake a large boys school in his native town of Shaston which stood on a hill sixty miles to the south west as the crow flies A glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal that the schoolmaster s plans and dreams so long indulged in had been abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor literature had much in common Essentially an unpractical man he was now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose that of keeping a wife who if she chose might conduct one of the girls schools adjoining his own for which purpose he had advised her to go into training since she would not marry him offhand About the time that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester and entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue the schoolmaster was settling down in the new school house at Shaston All the furniture being fixed the books shelved and the nails driven he had begun to sit in his parlour during the dark winter nights and re attempt some of his old studies one branch of which had included Roman Britannic antiquities an unremunerative labour for a national school master but a subject that after his abandonment of the university scheme had interested him as being a comparatively unworked mine practicable to those who like himself had lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant and were seen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on the civilization of that time A resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby of Phillotson at present his ostensible reason for going alone into fields where causeways dykes and tumuli abounded or shutting himself up in his house with a few urns tiles and mosaics he had collected instead of calling round upon his new neighbours who for their part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with him But it was not the real or the whole reason after all Thus on a particular evening in the month when it had grown quite late to near midnight indeed and the light of his lamp shining from his window at a salient angle of the hill top town over infinite miles of valley westward announced as by words a place and person given over to study he was not exactly studying The interior of the room the books the furniture the schoolmaster s loose coat his attitude at the table even the flickering of the fire bespoke the same dignified tale of undistracted research more than creditable to a man who had had no advantages beyond those of his own making And yet the tale true enough till latterly was not true now What he was regarding was not history They were historic notes written in a bold womanly hand at his dictation some months before and it was the clerical rendering of word after word that absorbed him He presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters few very few as correspondence counts nowadays Each was in its envelope just as it had arrived and the handwriting was of the same womanly character as the historic notes He unfolded them one by one and read them musingly At first sight there seemed in these small documents to be absolutely nothing to muse over They were straightforward frank letters signed Sue B just such ones as would be written during short absences with no other thought than their speedy destruction and chiefly concerning books in reading and other experiences of a training school forgotten doubtless by the writer with the passing of the day of their inditing In one of them quite a recent note the young woman said that she had received his considerate letter and that it was honourable and generous of him to say he would not come to see her oftener than she desired the school being such an awkward place for callers and because of her strong wish that her engagement to him should not be known which it would infallibly be if he visited her often Over these phrases the school master pored What precise shade of satisfaction was to be gathered from a woman s gratitude that the man who loved her had not been often to see her The problem occupied him distracted him He opened another drawer and found therein an envelope from which he drew a photograph of Sue as a child long before he had known her standing under trellis work with a little basket in her hand There was another of her as a young woman her dark eyes and hair making a very distinct and attractive picture of her which just disclosed too the thoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods It was a duplicate of the one she had given Jude and would have given to any man Phillotson brought it half way to his lips but withdrew it in doubt at her perplexing phrases ultimately kissing the dead pasteboard with all the passionateness and more than all the devotion of a young man of eighteen The schoolmaster s was an unhealthy looking old fashioned face rendered more old fashioned by his style of shaving A certain gentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature suggesting an inherent wish to do rightly by all His speech was a little slow but his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect His greying hair was curly and radiated from a point in the middle of his crown There were four lines across his forehead and he only wore spectacles when reading at night It was almost certainly a renunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose rather than a distaste for women which had hitherto kept him from closing with one of the sex in matrimony Such silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many and oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys whose quick and penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to the self conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue making him in the grey hours of morning dread to meet anew the gimlet glances lest they should read what the dream within him was He had honourably acquiesced in Sue s announced wish that he was not often to visit her at the training school but at length his patience being sorely tried he set out one Saturday afternoon to pay her an unexpected call There the news of her departure expulsion as it might almost have been considered was flashed upon him without warning or mitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few minutes to behold her face and when he turned away he could hardly see the road before him Sue had in fact never written a line to her suitor on the subject although it was fourteen days old A short reflection told him that this proved nothing a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for silence as any degree of blameworthiness They had informed him at the school where she was living and having no immediate anxiety about her comfort his thoughts took the direction of a burning indignation against the training school committee In his bewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent cathedral just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of the repairs He sat down on a block of freestone regardless of the dusty imprint it made on his breeches and his listless eyes following the movements of the workmen he presently became aware that the reputed culprit Sue s lover Jude was one amongst them Jude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the model of Jerusalem Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson s tentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the younger man s mind a curious dislike to think of the elder to meet him to communicate in any way with him and since Phillotson s success in obtaining at least her promise had become known to Jude he had frankly recognized that he did not wish to see or hear of his senior any more learn anything of his pursuits or even imagine again what excellencies might appertain to his character On this very day of the schoolmaster s visit Jude was expecting Sue as she had promised and when therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave of the building saw moreover that he was coming to speak to him he felt no little embarrassment which Phillotson s own embarrassment prevented his observing Jude joined him and they both withdrew from the other workmen to the spot where Phillotson had been sitting Jude offered him a piece of sackcloth for a cushion and told him it was dangerous to sit on the bare block Yes yes said Phillotson abstractedly as he reseated himself his eyes resting on the ground as if he were trying to remember where he was I won t keep you long It was merely that I have heard that you have seen my little friend Sue recently It occurred to me to speak to you on that account I merely want to ask about her I think I know what Jude hurriedly said About her escaping from the training school and her coming to me Yes Well Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to annihilate his rival at all cost By the exercise of that treachery which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most honourable in every other relation of life he could send off Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true and that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him But his action did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct and what he said was I am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to me about it You know what they say that I ought to marry her What And I wish with all my soul I could Phillotson trembled and his naturally pale face acquired a corpselike sharpness in its lines I had no idea that it was of this nature God forbid No no said Jude aghast I thought you understood I mean that were I in a position to marry her or someone and settle down instead of living in lodgings here and there I should be glad What he had really meant was simply that he loved her But since this painful matter has been opened up what really happened asked Phillotson with the firmness of a man who felt that a sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter Cases arise and this is one when even ungenerous questions must be put to make false assumptions impossible and to kill scandal Jude explained readily giving the whole series of adventures including the night at the shepherd s her wet arrival at his lodging her indisposition from her immersion their vigil of discussion and his seeing her off next morning Well now said Phillotson at the conclusion I take it as your final word and I know I can believe you that the suspicion which led to her rustication is an absolutely baseless one It is said Jude solemnly Absolutely So help me God The schoolmaster rose Each of the twain felt that the interview could not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent experiences after the manner of friends and when Jude had taken him round and shown him some features of the renovation which the old cathedral was undergoing Phillotson bade the young man good day and went away This visit took place about eleven o clock in the morning but no Sue appeared When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved ahead of him in the street leading up from the North Gate walking as if no way looking for him Speedily overtaking her he remarked that he had asked her to come to him at the cathedral and she had promised I have been to get my things from the college she said an observation which he was expected to take as an answer though it was not one Finding her to be in this evasive mood he felt inclined to give her the information so long withheld You have not seen mister Phillotson to day he ventured to inquire I have not But I am not going to be cross examined about him and if you ask anything more I won t answer It is very odd that He stopped regarding her What That you are often not so nice in your real presence as you are in your letters Does it really seem so to you said she smiling with quick curiosity Well that s strange but I feel just the same about you Jude When you are gone away I seem such a coldhearted As she knew his sentiment towards her Jude saw that they were getting upon dangerous ground It was now he thought that he must speak as an honest man But he did not speak and she continued It was that which made me write and say I didn t mind your loving me if you wanted to much The exultation he might have felt at what that implied or seemed to imply was nullified by his intention and he rested rigid till he began I have never told you Yes you have murmured she I mean I have never told you my history all of it But I guess it I know nearly Jude looked up Could she possibly know of that morning performance of his with Arabella which in a few months had ceased to be a marriage more completely than by death He saw that she did not I can t quite tell you here in the street he went on with a gloomy tongue And you had better not come to my lodgings Let us go in here The building by which they stood was the market house it was the only place available and they entered the market being over and the stalls and areas empty He would have preferred a more congenial spot but as usually happens in place of a romantic field or solemn aisle for his tale it was told while they walked up and down over a floor littered with rotten cabbage leaves and amid all the usual squalors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse He began and finished his brief narrative which merely led up to the information that he had married a wife some years earlier and that his wife was living still Almost before her countenance had time to change she hurried out the words Why didn t you tell me before I couldn t It seemed so cruel to tell it To yourself Jude So it was better to be cruel to me No dear darling cried Jude passionately He tried to take her hand but she withdrew it Their old relations of confidence seemed suddenly to have ended and the antagonisms of sex to sex were left without any counter poising predilections She was his comrade friend unconscious sweetheart no longer and her eyes regarded him in estranged silence I was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the marriage he continued I can t explain it precisely now I could have done it if you had taken it differently But how can I she burst out Here I have been saying or writing that that you might love me or something of the sort just out of charity and all the time oh it is perfectly damnable how things are she said stamping her foot in a nervous quiver You take me wrong Sue I never thought you cared for me at all till quite lately so I felt it did not matter Do you care for me Sue you know how I mean I don t like out of charity at all It was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to answer I suppose she your wife is a very pretty woman even if she s wicked she asked quickly She s pretty enough as far as that goes Prettier than I am no doubt You are not the least alike And I have never seen her for years But she s sure to come back they always do How strange of you to stay apart from her like this said Sue her trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony You such a religious man How will the demi gods in your Pantheon I mean those legendary persons you call saints intercede for you after this Now if I had done such a thing it would have been different and not remarkable for I at least don t regard marriage as a sacrament Your theories are not so advanced as your practice Sue you are terribly cutting when you like to be a perfect Voltaire But you must treat me as you will When she saw how wretched he was she softened and trying to blink away her sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness of a heart hurt woman Ah you should have told me before you gave me that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me I had no feeling before that moment at the railway station except For once Sue was as miserable as he in her attempts to keep herself free from emotion and her less than half success Don t cry dear he implored I am not crying because I meant to love you but because of your want of confidence They were quite screened from the market square without and he could not help putting out his arm towards her waist His momentary desire was the means of her rallying No no she said drawing back stringently and wiping her eyes Of course not It would be hypocrisy to pretend that it would be meant as from my cousin and it can t be in any other way They moved on a dozen paces and she showed herself recovered It was distracting to Jude and his heart would have ached less had she appeared anyhow but as she did appear essentially large minded and generous on reflection despite a previous exercise of those narrow womanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex I don t blame you for what you couldn t help she said smiling How should I be so foolish I do blame you a little bit for not telling me before But after all it doesn t matter We should have had to keep apart you see even if this had not been in your life No we shouldn t Sue This is the only obstacle You forget that I must have loved you and wanted to be your wife even if there had been no obstacle said Sue with a gentle seriousness which did not reveal her mind And then we are cousins and it is bad for cousins to marry And I am engaged to somebody else As to our going on together as we were going in a sort of friendly way the people round us would have made it unable to continue Their views of the relations of man and woman are limited as is proved by their expelling me from the school Their philosophy only recognizes relations based on animal desire The wide field of strong attachment where desire plays at least only a secondary part is ignored by them the part of who is it Venus Urania Her being able to talk learnedly showed that she was mistress of herself again and before they parted she had almost regained her vivacious glance her reciprocity of tone her gay manner and her second thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her age and sex He could speak more freely now There were several reasons against my telling you rashly One was what I have said another that it was always impressed upon me that I ought not to marry that I belonged to an odd and peculiar family the wrong breed for marriage Ah who used to say that to you My great aunt She said it always ended badly with us Fawleys That s strange My father used to say the same to me They stood possessed by the same thought ugly enough even as an assumption that a union between them had such been possible would have meant a terrible intensification of unfitness two bitters in one dish Oh but there can t be anything in it she said with nervous lightness Our family have been unlucky of late years in choosing mates that s all And then they pretended to persuade themselves that all that had happened was of no consequence and that they could still be cousins and friends and warm correspondents and have happy genial times when they met even if they met less frequently than before Their parting was in good friendship and yet Jude s last look into her eyes was tinged with inquiry for he felt that he did not even now quite know her mind VII Tidings from Sue a day or two after passed across Jude like a withering blast Before reading the letter he was led to suspect that its contents were of a somewhat serious kind 
985-126228-0000	train-other-500	by catching sight of the signature which was in her full name never used in her correspondence with him since her first note MY DEAR JUDE I have something to tell you which perhaps you will not be surprised to hear though certainly it may strike you as being accelerated
985-126228-0001	train-other-500	as the railway companies say of their trains mister Phillotson and I are to be married quite soon in three or four weeks We had intended as you know to wait till I had gone through my course of training and obtained my certificate so as to assist him if necessary in the teaching
985-126228-0002	train-other-500	But he generously says he does not see any object in waiting
none	none	 now I am not at the training school 
985-126228-0003	train-other-500	It is so good of him because the awkwardness of my situation has really come about by my fault in getting expelled Wish me joy Remember I say you are to and you mustn t refuse Your affectionate cousin
985-126228-0004	train-other-500	SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD Jude staggered under the news could eat no breakfast and kept on drinking tea because his mouth was so dry
985-126228-0005	train-other-500	Then presently he went back to his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted Everything seemed turning to satire And yet what could the poor girl do he asked himself and felt worse than shedding tears
985-126228-0006	train-other-500	O Susanna Florence Mary he said as he worked You don t know what marriage means Could it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had pricked her on to this
none	none	 just as his visit to her when in liquor may have pricked her on to her engagement To be sure there seemed to exist these other and sufficient reasons practical and social for her decision 
985-126228-0007	train-other-500	but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person and he was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret sprung upon her had moved her to give way to Phillotson s probable representations that the best course to prove how unfounded were the suspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him off hand
985-126228-0008	train-other-500	as in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement Sue had in fact been placed in an awkward corner Poor Sue He determined to play the Spartan to make the best of it and support her but he could not write the requested good wishes for a day or two
985-126228-0009	train-other-500	Meanwhile there came another note from his impatient little dear Jude will you give me away I have nobody else who could do it so conveniently as you being the only married relation I have here on the spot even if my father were friendly enough to be willing which he isn t
none	none	 I hope you won t think it a trouble I have been looking at the marriage service in the prayer book and it seems to me very humiliating that a giver away should be required at all 
985-126228-0010	train-other-500	According to the ceremony as there printed my bridegroom chooses me of his own will and pleasure but I don t choose him Somebody GIVES me to him like a she ass or she goat or any other domestic animal Bless your exalted views of woman O churchman
985-126228-0011	train-other-500	But I forget I am no longer privileged to tease you Ever SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD Jude screwed himself up to heroic key and replied MY DEAR SUE Of course I wish you joy
985-126228-0012	train-other-500	And also of course I will give you away What I suggest is that as you have no house of your own you do not marry from your school friend s but from mine
none	none	 It would be more proper I think since I am as you say the person nearest related to you in this part of the world 
985-126228-0013	train-other-500	I don t see why you sign your letter in such a new and terribly formal way Surely you care a bit about me still Ever your affectionate JUDE What had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little sting he had been silent on
985-126228-0014	train-other-500	the phrase married relation What an idiot it made him seem as her lover If Sue had written that in satire he could hardly forgive her if in suffering ah that was another thing His offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson at any rate
985-126228-0015	train-other-500	for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks accepting the convenience Sue also thanked him Jude immediately moved into more commodious quarters as much to escape the espionage of the suspicious landlady who had been one cause of Sue s unpleasant experience
985-126228-0016	train-other-500	as for the sake of room Then Sue wrote to tell him the day fixed for the wedding and Jude decided after inquiry that she should come into residence on the following Saturday which would allow of a ten days stay in the city prior to the ceremony
985-126228-0017	train-other-500	sufficiently representing a nominal residence of fifteen She arrived by the ten o clock train on the day aforesaid Jude not going to meet her at the station by her special request that he should not lose a morning s work and pay she said if this were her true reason
985-126228-0018	train-other-500	But so well by this time did he know Sue that the remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might he thought have weighed with her in this When he came home to dinner she had taken possession of her apartment
985-126228-0019	train-other-500	She lived in the same house with him but on a different floor and they saw each other little an occasional supper being the only meal they took together when Sue s manner was something like that of a scared child What she felt he did not know their conversation was mechanical
985-126228-0020	train-other-500	though she did not look pale or ill Phillotson came frequently but mostly when Jude was absent On the morning of the wedding when Jude had given himself a holiday Sue and her cousin had breakfast together for the first and last time during this curious interval
985-126228-0021	train-other-500	in his room the parlour which he had hired for the period of Sue s residence Seeing as women do how helpless he was in making the place comfortable she bustled about What s the matter Jude she said suddenly
985-126228-0022	train-other-500	He was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his hands looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the tablecloth Oh nothing You are father you know That s what they call the man who gives you away
none	none	 Jude could have said Phillotson s age entitles him to be called that But he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort She talked incessantly as if she dreaded his indulgence in reflection and before the meal was over both he and she wished they had not put such confidence in their new view of things 
985-126228-0023	train-other-500	and had taken breakfast apart What oppressed Jude was the thought that having done a wrong thing of this sort himself he was aiding and abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing instead of imploring and warning her against it It was on his tongue to say
none	none	 You have quite made up your mind 
985-126228-0024	train-other-500	After breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging in unceremonious companionship By the irony of fate
none	none	 and the curious trick in Sue s nature of tempting Providence at critical times 
985-126228-0025	train-other-500	she took his arm as they walked through the muddy street a thing she had never done before in her life and on turning the corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church with a low pitched roof the church of saint Thomas That s the church said Jude
985-126228-0026	train-other-500	Where I am going to be married Yes Indeed she exclaimed with curiosity How I should like to go in and see what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it Again he said to himself
985-126228-0027	train-other-500	She does not realize what marriage means He passively acquiesced in her wish to go in and they entered by the western door The only person inside the gloomy building was a charwoman cleaning
none	none	 Sue still held Jude s arm 
985-126228-0028	train-other-500	almost as if she loved him Cruelly sweet indeed she had been to him that morning but his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an ache
none	none	 I can find no way How a blow should fall such as falls on men 
985-126228-0029	train-other-500	Nor prove too much for your womanhood They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar railing which they stood against in silence turning then and walking down the nave again her hand still on his arm precisely like a couple just married
985-126228-0030	train-other-500	The too suggestive incident entirely of her making nearly broke down Jude I like to do things like this she said in the delicate voice of an epicure in emotions which left no doubt that she spoke the truth I know you do
985-126228-0031	train-other-500	said Jude They are interesting because they have probably never been done before I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in about two hours shan t I No doubt you will Was it like this when you were married
985-126228-0032	train-other-500	Good God Sue don t be so awfully merciless There dear one I didn t mean it Ah you are vexed she said regretfully as she blinked away an access of eye moisture And I promised never to vex you
985-126228-0033	train-other-500	I suppose I ought not to have asked you to bring me in here Oh I oughtn t I see it now My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation always leads me into these scrapes Forgive me You will won t you Jude
985-126228-0034	train-other-500	The appeal was so remorseful that Jude s eyes were even wetter than hers as he pressed her hand for Yes Now we ll hurry away and I won t do it any more she continued humbly and they came out of the building
none	none	 Sue intending to go on to the station to meet Phillotson 
985-126228-0035	train-other-500	But the first person they encountered on entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected There was nothing really to demur to in her leaning on Jude s arm but she withdrew her hand and Jude thought that Phillotson had looked surprised
985-126228-0036	train-other-500	We have been doing such a funny thing said she smiling candidly We ve been to the church rehearsing as it were Haven t we Jude How said Phillotson curiously Jude inwardly deplored what he thought to be unnecessary frankness
985-126228-0037	train-other-500	but she had gone too far not to explain all which she accordingly did telling him how they had marched up to the altar Seeing how puzzled Phillotson seemed Jude said as cheerfully as he could I am going to buy her another little present
none	none	 Will you both come to the shop with me No said Sue I ll go on to the house with him and requesting her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster 
985-126228-0038	train-other-500	Jude soon joined them at his rooms and shortly after they prepared for the ceremony Phillotson s hair was brushed to a painful extent and his shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for the previous twenty years Beyond this he looked dignified and thoughtful
985-126228-0039	train-other-500	and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict that he would make a kind and considerate husband That he adored Sue was obvious and she could almost be seen to feel that she was undeserving his adoration
985-126228-0040	train-other-500	Although the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red Lion and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door when they came out The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown though Jude was getting to be recognized as a citizen
985-126228-0041	train-other-500	and the couple were judged to be some relations of his from a distance nobody supposing Sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school In the carriage Jude took from his pocket his extra little wedding present which turned out to be two or three yards of white tulle
none	none	 which he threw over her bonnet and all as a veil 
985-126228-0042	train-other-500	It looks so odd over a bonnet she said I ll take the bonnet off Oh no let it stay said Phillotson And she obeyed When they had passed up the church and were standing in their places
985-126228-0043	train-other-500	Jude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge of this performance but by the time they were half way on with the service he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the business of giving her away How could Sue have had the temerity to ask him to do it
985-126228-0044	train-other-500	a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him Women were different from men in such matters Was it that they were instead of more sensitive as reputed more callous and less romantic or were they more heroic
985-126228-0045	train-other-500	Or was Sue simply so perverse that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful luxury of practising long suffering in her own person and of being touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it He could perceive that her face was nervously set
985-126228-0046	train-other-500	and when they reached the trying ordeal of Jude giving her to Phillotson she could hardly command herself rather however as it seemed from her knowledge of what her cousin must feel whom she need not have had there at all than from self consideration
none	none	 Possibly she would go on inflicting such pains again and again 
985-126228-0047	train-other-500	and grieving for the sufferer again and again in all her colossal inconsistency Phillotson seemed not to notice to be surrounded by a mist which prevented his seeing the emotions of others As soon as they had signed their names and come away
985-126228-0048	train-other-500	and the suspense was over Jude felt relieved The meal at his lodging was a very simple affair and at two o clock they went off In crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back and there was a frightened light in her eyes Could it be
985-126228-0049	train-other-500	that Sue had acted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she knew not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him of retaliating on him for his secrecy
985-126228-0050	train-other-500	Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome with men because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their natures which wore out women s hearts and lives
none	none	 When her foot was on the carriage step she turned round saying that she had forgotten something 
985-126228-0051	train-other-500	Jude and the landlady offered to get it No she said running back It is my handkerchief I know where I left it Jude followed her back She had found it and came holding it in her hand She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones and her lips suddenly parted as if she were going to avow something
none	none	 But she went on and whatever she had meant to say remained unspoken VIII Jude wondered if she had really left her handkerchief behind or whether it were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love that at the last moment she could not bring herself to express He could not stay in his silent lodging when they were gone and fearing that he might be tempted to drown his misery in alcohol he went upstairs changed his dark clothes for his white his thin boots for his thick and proceeded to his customary work for the afternoon But in the cathedral he seemed to hear a voice behind him and to be possessed with an idea that she would come back She could not possibly go home with Phillotson he fancied The feeling grew and stirred The moment that the clock struck the last of his working hours he threw down his tools and rushed homeward Has anybody been for me he asked Nobody had been there As he could claim the downstairs sitting room till twelve o clock that night he sat in it all the evening and even when the clock had struck eleven and the family had retired he could not shake off the feeling that she would come back and sleep in the little room adjoining his own in which she had slept so many previous days Her actions were always unpredictable why should she not come Gladly would he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and wife by having her live thus as a fellow lodger and friend even on the most distant terms His supper still remained spread and going to the front door and softly setting it open he returned to the room and sat as watchers sit on Old Midsummer eves expecting the phantom of the Beloved But she did not come Having indulged in this wild hope he went upstairs and looked out of the window and pictured her through the evening journey to London whither she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday their rattling along through the damp night to their hotel under the same sky of ribbed cloud as that he beheld through which the moon showed its position rather than its shape and one or two of the larger stars made themselves visible as faint nebulae only It was a new beginning of Sue s history He projected his mind into the future and saw her with children more or less in her own likeness around her But the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of her identity was denied to him as to all such dreamers by the wilfulness of Nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone Every desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy If at the estrangement or death of my lost love I could go and see her child hers solely there would be comfort in it said Jude And then he again uneasily saw as he had latterly seen with more and more frequency the scorn of Nature for man s finer emotions and her lack of interest in his aspirations The oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on the morrow and following days yet more clearly He could no longer endure the light of the Melchester lamps the sunshine was as drab paint and the blue sky as zinc Then he received news that his old aunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen which intelligence almost coincided with a letter from his former employer at Christminster who offered him permanent work of a good class if he would come back The letters were almost a relief to him He started to visit Aunt Drusilla and resolved to go onward to Christminster to see what worth there might be in the builder s offer Jude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow Edlin had led him to expect There was every possibility of her lingering on for weeks or months though little likelihood He wrote to Sue informing her of the state of her aunt and suggesting that she might like to see her aged relative alive He would meet her at Alfredston Road the following evening Monday on his way back from Christminster if she could come by the up train which crossed his down train at that station Next morning according he went on to Christminster intending to return to Alfredston soon enough to keep the suggested appointment with Sue The city of learning wore an estranged look and he had lost all feeling for its associations Yet as the sun made vivid lights and shades of the mullioned architecture of the facades and drew patterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the quadrangles Jude thought he had never seen the place look more beautiful He came to the street in which he had first beheld Sue The chair she had occupied when leaning over her ecclesiastical scrolls a hog hair brush in her hand her girlish figure had arrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes stood precisely in its former spot empty It was as if she were dead and nobody had been found capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit Hers was now the city phantom while those of the intellectual and devotional worthies who had once moved him to emotion were no longer able to assert their presence there However here he was and in fulfilment of his intention he went on to his former lodging in Beersheba near the ritualistic church of saint Silas The old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see him again and bringing some lunch informed him that the builder who had employed him had called to inquire his address Jude went on to the stone yard where he had worked But the old sheds and bankers were distasteful to him he felt it impossible to engage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams He longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston where he might probably meet Sue Then for one ghastly half hour of depression caused by these scenes there returned upon him that feeling which had been his undoing more than once that he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of either by himself or others and during this half hour he met Tinker Taylor the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger at Fourways who proposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together They walked along the street till they stood before one of the great palpitating centres of Christminster life the inn wherein he formerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in Latin now a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance which gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and refitted in modern style since Jude s residence here Tinker Taylor drank off his glass and departed saying it was too stylish a place now for him to feel at home in unless he was drunker than he had money to be just then Jude was longer finishing his and stood abstractedly silent in the for the minute almost empty place The bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout mahogany fixtures having taken the place of the old painted ones while at the back of the standing space there were stuffed sofa benches The room was divided into compartments in the approved manner between which were screens of ground glass in mahogany framing to prevent topers in one compartment being put to the blush by the recognitions of those in the next On the inside of the counter two barmaids leant over the white handled beer engines and the row of little silvered taps inside dripping into a pewter trough Feeling tired and having nothing more to do till the train left Jude sat down on one of the sofas At the back of the barmaids rose bevel edged mirrors with glass shelves running along their front on which stood precious liquids that Jude did not know the name of in bottles of topaz sapphire ruby and amethyst The moment was enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next compartment and the starting of the mechanical tell tale of monies received which emitted a ting ting every time a coin was put in The barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude s direct glance though a reflection of her back in the glass behind her was occasionally caught by his eyes He had only observed this listlessly when she turned her face for a moment to the glass to set her hair tidy Then he was amazed to discover that the face was Arabella s If she had come on to his compartment she would have seen him But she did not this being presided over by the maiden on the other side Abby was in a black gown with white linen cuffs and a broad white collar and her figure more developed than formerly was accentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom In the compartment she served stood an electro plated fountain of water over a spirit lamp whose blue flame sent a steam from the top all this being visible to him only in the mirror behind her which also reflected the faces of the men she was attending to one of them a handsome dissipated young fellow possibly an undergraduate who had been relating to her an experience of some humorous sort Oh mister Cockman now How can you tell such a tale to me in my innocence she cried gaily mister Cockman what do you use to make your moustache curl so beautiful As the young man was clean shaven the retort provoked a laugh at his expense Come said he I ll have a curacao and a light please She served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and striking a match held it to his cigarette with ministering archness while he whiffed Well have you heard from your husband lately my dear he asked Not a sound said she Where is he I left him in Australia and I suppose he s there still Jude s eyes grew rounder What made you part from him Don t you ask questions and you won t hear lies Come then give me my change which you ve been keeping from me for the last quarter of an hour and I ll romantically vanish up the street of this picturesque city She handed the change over the counter in taking which he caught her fingers and held them There was a slight struggle and titter and he bade her good bye and left Jude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher It was extraordinary how far removed from his life Arabella now seemed to be He could not realize their nominal closeness And this being the case in his present frame of mind he was indifferent to the fact that Arabella was his wife indeed The compartment that she served emptied itself of visitors and after a brief thought he entered it and went forward to the counter Arabella did not recognize him for a moment Then their glances met She started till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes and she spoke Well I m blest I thought you were underground years ago Oh I never heard anything of you or I don t know that I should have come here But never mind What shall I treat you to this afternoon A Scotch and soda Come anything that the house will afford for old acquaintance sake Thanks Arabella said Jude without a smile But I don t want anything more than I ve had The fact was that her unexpected presence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for strong liquor as completely as if it had whisked him back to his milk fed infancy That s a pity now you could get it for nothing How long have you been here About six weeks I returned from Sydney three months ago I always liked this business you know I wonder you came to this place Well as I say I thought you were gone to glory and being in London I saw the situation in an advertisement Nobody was likely to know me here even if I had minded for I was never in Christminster in my growing up 
899_126232_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Why did you 
none	none	return from Australia Oh I had my reasons Then you are not a don yet No Not even a reverend No Nor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman I am as I was True you look so She idly allowed her fingers to rest on the pull of the beer engine as she inspected him critically He observed that her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with her and that on the hand which pulled the engine she wore an ornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires which they were indeed and were much admired as such by the young men who frequented the bar So you pass as having a living husband he continued Yes I thought it might be awkward if I called myself a widow as I should have liked True I am known here a little I didn t mean on that account for as I said I didn t expect you It was for other reasons What were they I don t care to go into them she replied evasively I make a very good living and I don t know that I want your company Here a chappie with no chin and a moustache like a lady s eyebrow came and asked for a curiously compounded drink and Arabella was obliged to go and attend to him We can t talk here she said stepping back a moment Can t you wait till nine Say yes and don t be a fool I can get off duty two hours sooner than usual if I ask I am not living in the house at present He reflected and said gloomily I ll come back I suppose we d better arrange something Oh bother arranging I m not going to arrange anything But I must know a thing or two and as you say we can t talk here Very well I ll call for you Depositing his unemptied glass he went out and walked up and down the street Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of his sad attachment to Sue Though Arabella s word was absolutely untrustworthy he thought there might be some truth in her implication that she had not wished to disturb him and had really supposed him dead However there was only one thing now to be done and that was to play a straightforward part the law being the law and the woman between whom and himself there was no more unity than between east and west being in the eye of the Church one person with him Having to meet Arabella here it was impossible to meet Sue at Alfredston as he had promised At every thought of this a pang had gone through him but the conjuncture could not be helped Arabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his unauthorized love Passing the evening therefore in a desultory waiting about the town wherein he avoided the precincts of every cloister and hall because he could not bear to behold them he repaired to the tavern bar while the hundred and one strokes were resounding from the Great Bell of Cardinal College a coincidence which seemed to him gratuitous irony The inn was now brilliantly lighted up and the scene was altogether more brisk and gay The faces of the barmaidens had risen in colour each having a pink flush on her cheek their manners were still more vivacious than before more abandoned more excited more sensuous and they expressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically laughing in a lackadaisical tone without reserve The bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous hour and he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices but the customers were fewer at last He nodded to Arabella and told her that she would find him outside the door when she came away But you must have something with me first she said with great good humour Just an early night cap I always do Then you can go out and wait a minute as it is best we should not be seen going together She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy and though she had evidently from her countenance already taken in enough alcohol either by drinking or more probably from the atmosphere she had breathed for so many hours she finished hers quickly He also drank his and went outside the house In a few minutes she came in a thick jacket and a hat with a black feather I live quite near she said taking his arm and can let myself in by a latch key at any time What arrangement do you want to come to Oh none in particular he answered thoroughly sick and tired his thoughts again reverting to Alfredston and the train he did not go by the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when she arrived and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and lonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen I ought to have gone back really My aunt is on her deathbed I fear I ll go over with you to morrow morning I think I could get a day off There was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella who had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him coming to the bedside of his dying aunt and meeting Sue Yet he said Of course if you d like to you can Well that we ll consider Now until we have come to some agreement it is awkward our being together here where you are known and I am getting known though without any suspicion that I have anything to do with you As we are going towards the station suppose we take the nine forty train to Aldbrickham We shall be there in little more than half an hour and nobody will know us for one night and we shall be quite free to act as we choose till we have made up our minds whether we ll make anything public or not As you like Then wait till I get two or three things This is my lodging Sometimes when late I sleep at the hotel where I am engaged so nobody will think anything of my staying out She speedily returned and they went on to the railway and made the half hour s journey to Aldbrickham where they entered a third rate inn near the station in time for a late supper IX On the morrow between nine and half past they were journeying back to Christminster the only two occupants of a compartment in a third class railway carriage Having like Jude made rather a hasty toilet to catch the train Arabella looked a little frowsy and her face was very far from possessing the animation which had characterized it at the bar the night before When they came out of the station she found that she still had half an hour to spare before she was due at the bar They walked in silence a little way out of the town in the direction of Alfredston Jude looked up the far highway Ah poor feeble me he murmured at last What said she This is the very road by which I came into Christminster years ago full of plans Well whatever the road is I think my time is nearly up as I have to be in the bar by eleven o clock And as I said I shan t ask for the day to go with you to see your aunt So perhaps we had better part here I d sooner not walk up Chief Street with you since we ve come to no conclusion at all Very well But you said when we were getting up this morning that you had something you wished to tell me before I left So I had two things one in particular But you wouldn t promise to keep it a secret I ll tell you now if you promise As an honest woman I wish you to know it It was what I began telling you in the night about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel Arabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her You ll keep it close Yes yes I promise said Jude impatiently Of course I don t want to reveal your secrets Whenever I met him out for a walk he used to say that he was much taken with my looks and he kept pressing me to marry him I never thought of coming back to England again and being out there in Australia with no home of my own after leaving my father I at last agreed and did What marry him Yes Regularly legally in church Yes And lived with him till shortly before I left It was stupid I know but I did There now I ve told you Don t round upon me He talks of coming back to England poor old chap But if he does he won t be likely to find me Jude stood pale and fixed Why the devil didn t you tell me last night he said Well I didn t Won t you make it up with me then So in talking of your husband to the bar gentlemen you meant him of course not me Of course Come don t fuss about it I have nothing more to say replied Jude I have nothing at all to say about the crime you ve confessed to Crime Pooh They don t think much of such as that over there Lots of em do it Well if you take it like that I shall go back to him He was very fond of me and we lived honourable enough and as respectable as any married couple in the colony How did I know where you were I won t go blaming you I could say a good deal but perhaps it would be misplaced What do you wish me to do Nothing There was one thing more I wanted to tell you but I fancy we ve seen enough of one another for the present I shall think over what you said about your circumstances and let you know Thus they parted Jude watched her disappear in the direction of the hotel and entered the railway station close by Finding that it wanted three quarters of an hour of the time at which he could get a train back to Alfredston he strolled mechanically into the city as far as to the Fourways where he stood as he had so often stood before and surveyed Chief Street stretching ahead with its college after college in picturesqueness unrivalled except by such Continental vistas as the Street of Palaces in Genoa the lines of the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an architectural drawing But Jude was far from seeing or criticizing these things they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of Arabella s midnight contiguity a sense of degradation at his revived experiences with her of her appearance as she lay asleep at dawn which set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst If he could only have felt resentment towards her he would have been less unhappy but he pitied while he contemned her Jude turned and retraced his steps Drawing again towards the station he started at hearing his name pronounced less at the name than at the voice To his great surprise no other than Sue stood like a vision before him her look bodeful and anxious as in a dream her little mouth nervous and her strained eyes speaking reproachful inquiry Oh Jude I am so glad to meet you like this she said in quick uneven accents not far from a sob Then she flushed as she observed his thought that they had not met since her marriage They looked away from each other to hide their emotion took each other s hand without further speech and went on together awhile till she glanced at him with furtive solicitude I arrived at Alfredston station last night as you asked me to and there was nobody to meet me But I reached Marygreen alone and they told me Aunt was a trifle better I sat up with her and as you did not come all night I was frightened about you I thought that perhaps when you found yourself back in the old city you were upset at at thinking I was married and not there as I used to be and that you had nobody to speak to so you had tried to drown your gloom as you did at that former time when you were disappointed about entering as a student and had forgotten your promise to me that you never would again And this I thought was why you hadn t come to meet me And you came to hunt me up and deliver me like a good angel I thought I would come by the morning train and try to find you in case in case I did think of my promise to you dear continually I shall never break out again as I did I am sure I may have been doing nothing better but I was not doing that I loathe the thought of it I am glad your staying had nothing to do with that But she said the faintest pout entering into her tone you didn t come back last night and meet me as you engaged to I didn t I am sorry to say I had an appointment at nine o clock too late for me to catch the train that would have met yours or to get home at all Looking at his loved one as she appeared to him now in his tender thought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he had ever had living largely in vivid imaginings so ethereal a creature that her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs he felt heartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had spent in Arabella s company There was something rude and immoral in thrusting these recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who to him was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human wife to any average man And yet she was Phillotson s How she had become such how she lived as such passed his comprehension as he regarded her to day You ll go back with me he said There s a train just now I wonder how my aunt is by this time And so Sue you really came on my account all this way At what an early time you must have started poor thing Yes Sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you and instead of going to bed when it got light I started And now you won t frighten me like this again about your morals for nothing He was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for nothing He released her hand till they had entered the train it seemed the same carriage he had lately got out of with another where they sat down side by side Sue between him and the window He regarded the delicate lines of her profile and the small tight applelike convexities of her bodice so different from Arabella s amplitudes Though she knew he was looking at her she did not turn to him but kept her eyes forward as if afraid that by meeting his own some troublous discussion would be initiated Sue you are married now you know like me and yet we have been in such a hurry that we have not said a word about it There s no necessity she quickly returned Oh well perhaps not But I wish Jude don t talk about ME I wish you wouldn t she entreated It distresses me rather Forgive my saying it Where did you stay last night She had asked the question in perfect innocence to change the topic He knew that and said merely At an inn though it would have been a relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one But the latter s final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered him lest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury Their talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached Alfredston That Sue was not as she had been but was labelled Phillotson paralyzed Jude whenever he wanted to commune with her as an individual Yet she seemed unaltered he could not say why There remained the five mile extra journey into the country which it was just as easy to walk as to drive the greater part of it being uphill Jude had never before in his life gone that road with Sue though he had with another It was now as if he carried a bright light which temporarily banished the shady associations of the earlier time Sue talked but Jude noticed that she still kept the conversation from herself At length he inquired if her husband were well O yes she said He is obliged to be in the school all the day or he would have come with me He is so good and kind that to accompany me he would have dismissed the school for once even against his principles for he is strongly opposed to giving casual holidays only I wouldn t let him I felt it would be better to come alone Aunt Drusilla I knew was so very eccentric and his being almost a stranger to her now would have made it irksome to both Since it turns out that she is hardly conscious I am glad I did not ask him Jude had walked moodily while this praise of Phillotson was being expressed mister Phillotson obliges you in everything as he ought he said Of course You ought to be a happy wife And of course I am Bride I might almost have said as yet It is not so many weeks since I gave you to him and Yes I know I know There was something in her face which belied her late assuring words so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken that they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in The Wife s Guide to Conduct Jude knew the quality of every vibration in Sue s voice could read every symptom of her mental condition and he was convinced that she was unhappy although she had not been a month married But her rushing away thus from home to see the last of a relative whom she had hardly known in her life proved nothing for Sue naturally did such things as those Well you have my good wishes now as always missus Phillotson She reproached him by a glance No you are not missus Phillotson murmured Jude You are dear free Sue Bridehead only you don t know it Wifedom has not yet squashed up and digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no further individuality Sue put on a look of being offended till she answered Nor has husbandom you so far as I can see But it has he said shaking his head sadly When they reached the lone cottage under the firs between the Brown House and Marygreen in which Jude and Arabella had lived and quarrelled he turned to look at it A squalid family lived there now He could not help saying to Sue That s the house my wife and I occupied the whole of the time we lived together I brought her home to that house She looked at it That to you was what the school house at Shaston is to me Yes but I was not very happy there as you are in yours She closed her lips in retortive silence and they walked some way till she glanced at him to see how he was taking it Of course I may have exaggerated your happiness one never knows he continued blandly Don t think that Jude for a moment even though you may have said it to sting me He s as good to me as a man can be and gives me perfect liberty which elderly husbands don t do in general If you think I am not happy because he s too old for me you are wrong I don t think anything against him to you dear And you won t say things to distress me will you I will not He said no more but he knew that from some cause or other in taking Phillotson as a husband Sue felt that she had done what she ought not to have done They plunged into the concave field on the other side of which rose the village the field wherein Jude had received a thrashing from the farmer many years earlier On ascending to the village and approaching the house they found missus Edlin standing at the door who at sight of them lifted her hands deprecatingly She s downstairs if you ll believe me cried the widow Out o bed she got and nothing could turn her What will come o t I do not know On entering there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman wrapped in blankets and turning upon them a countenance like that of Sebastiano s Lazarus They must have looked their amazement for she said in a hollow voice Ah sceered ye have I I wasn t going to bide up there no longer to please nobody Tis more than flesh and blood can bear to be ordered to do this and that by a feller that don t know half as well as you do yourself Ah you ll rue this marrying as well as he she added turning to Sue All our family do and nearly all everybody else s You should have done as I did you simpleton And Phillotson the schoolmaster of all men What made ee marry him What makes most women marry Aunt Ah You mean to say you loved the man I don t meant to say anything definite Do ye love un Don t ask me Aunt I can mind the man very well A very civil honourable liver but Lord I don t want to wownd your feelings but there be certain men here and there that no woman of any niceness can stomach I should have said he was one I don t say so NOW since you must ha known better than I but that s what I SHOULD have said Sue jumped up and went out Jude followed her and found her in the outhouse crying Don t cry dear said Jude in distress She means well but is very crusty and queer now you know Oh no it isn t that said Sue trying to dry her eyes I don t mind her roughness one bit What is it then It is that what she says is is true God what you don t like him asked Jude I don t mean that she said hastily That I ought perhaps I ought not to have married He wondered if she had really been going to say that at first They went back and the subject was smoothed over and her aunt took rather kindly to Sue telling her that not many young women newly married would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her In the afternoon Sue prepared to depart Jude hiring a neighbour to drive her to Alfredston I ll go with you to the station if you d like he said She would not let him The man came round with the trap and Jude helped her into it perhaps with unnecessary attention for she looked at him prohibitively I suppose I may come to see you some day when I am back again at Melchester he half crossly observed She bent down and said softly No dear you are not to come yet I don t think you are in a good mood Very well said Jude 
899_126232_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Good bye Good bye 
none	none	She waved her hand and was gone She s right I won t go he murmured He passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every possible means his wish to see her nearly starving himself in attempts to extinguish by fasting his passionate tendency to love her He read sermons on discipline and hunted up passages in Church history that treated of the Ascetics of the second century Before he had returned from Marygreen to Melchester there arrived a letter from Arabella The sight of it revived a stronger feeling of self condemnation for his brief return to her society than for his attachment to Sue The letter he perceived bore a London postmark instead of the Christminster one Arabella informed him that a few days after their parting in the morning at Christminster she had been surprised by an affectionate letter from her Australian husband formerly manager of the hotel in Sydney He had come to England on purpose to find her and had taken a free fully licensed public in Lambeth where he wished her to join him in conducting the business which was likely to be a very thriving one the house being situated in an excellent densely populated gin drinking neighbourhood and already doing a trade of Ltwo hundred a month which could be easily doubled As he had said that he loved her very much still and implored her to tell him where she was and as they had only parted in a slight tiff and as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary she had just gone to join him as he urged She could not help feeling that she belonged to him more than to Jude since she had properly married him and had lived with him much longer than with her first husband In thus wishing Jude good bye she bore him no ill will and trusted he would not turn upon her a weak woman and inform against her and bring her to ruin now that she had a chance of improving her circumstances and leading a genteel life X Jude returned to Melchester which had the questionable recommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his Sue s now permanent residence At first he felt that this nearness was a distinct reason for not going southward at all but Christminster was too sad a place to bear while the proximity of Shaston to Melchester might afford him the glory of worsting the Enemy in a close engagement such as was deliberately sought by the priests and virgins of the early Church who disdaining an ignominious flight from temptation became even chamber partners with impunity Jude did not pause to remember that in the laconic words of the historian insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her rights in such circumstances He now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the priesthood in the recognition that the single mindedness of his aims and his fidelity to the cause had been more than questionable of late His passion for Sue troubled his soul yet his lawful abandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed instinctively a worse thing even though she had not told him of her Sydney husband till afterwards He had he verily believed overcome all tendency to fly to liquor which indeed he had never done from taste but merely as an escape from intolerable misery of mind Yet he perceived with despondency that taken all round he was a man of too many passions to make a good clergyman the utmost he could hope for was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and spirit the former might not always be victorious As a hobby auxiliary to his readings in Divinity he developed his slight skill in church music and thorough bass till he could join in part singing from notation with some accuracy A mile or two from Melchester there was a restored village church to which Jude had originally gone to fix the new columns and capitals By this means he had become acquainted with the organist and the ultimate result was that he joined the choir as a bass voice He walked out to this parish twice every Sunday and sometimes in the week One evening about Easter the choir met for practice and a new hymn which Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer was to be tried and prepared for the following week It turned out to be a strangely emotional composition As they all sang it over and over again its harmonies grew upon Jude and moved him exceedingly When they had finished he went round to the organist to make inquiries The score was in manuscript the name of the composer being at the head together with the title of the hymn The Foot of the Cross Yes said the organist He is a local man He is a professional musician at Kennetbridge between here and Christminster The vicar knows him He was brought up and educated in Christminster traditions which accounts for the quality of the piece I think he plays in the large church there and has a surpliced choir He comes to Melchester sometimes and once tried to get the cathedral organ when the post was vacant The hymn is getting about everywhere this Easter As he walked humming the air on his way home Jude fell to musing on its composer and the reasons why he composed it What a man of sympathies he must be Perplexed and harassed as he himself was about Sue and Arabella and troubled as was his conscience by the complication of his position how he would like to know that man He of all men would understand my difficulties said the impulsive Jude If there were any person in the world to choose as a confidant this composer would be the one for he must have suffered and throbbed and yearned In brief ill as he could afford the time and money for the journey Fawley resolved like the child that he was to go to Kennetbridge the very next Sunday He duly started early in the morning for it was only by a series of crooked railways that he could get to the town About mid day he reached it and crossing the bridge into the quaint old borough he inquired for the house of the composer They told him it was a red brick building some little way further on Also that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not five minutes before Which way asked Jude with alacrity Straight along homeward from church Jude hastened on and soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a black coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance ahead Stretching out his legs yet more widely he stalked after A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul he said I must speak to that man He could not however overtake the musician before he had entered his own house and then arose the question if this were an expedient time to call Whether or not he decided to do so there and then now that he had got here the distance home being too great for him to wait till late in the afternoon This man of soul would understand scant ceremony and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in which an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained entrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion Jude accordingly rang the bell and was admitted The musician came to him in a moment and being respectably dressed good looking and frank in manner Jude obtained a favourable reception He was nevertheless conscious that there would be a certain awkwardness in explaining his errand I have been singing in the choir of a little church near Melchester he said And we have this week practised The Foot of the Cross which I understand sir that you composed I did a year or so ago I like it I think it supremely beautiful Ah well other people have said so too Yes there s money in it if I could only see about getting it published I have other compositions to go with it too I wish I could bring them out for I haven t made a five pound note out of any of them yet These publishing people they want the copyright of an obscure composer s work such as mine is for almost less than I should have to pay a person for making a fair manuscript copy of the score The one you speak of I have lent to various friends about here and Melchester and so it has got to be sung a little But music is a poor staff to lean on I am giving it up entirely You must go into trade if you want to make money nowadays The wine business is what I am thinking of This is my forthcoming list it is not issued yet but you can take one He handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet shape ornamentally margined with a red line in which were set forth the various clarets champagnes ports sherries and other wines with which he purposed to initiate his new venture It took Jude more than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus and he felt that he could not open up his confidences They talked a little longer but constrainedly for when the musician found that Jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had been while Jude s appearance and address deceived him as to his position and pursuits Jude stammered out something about his feelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted composition and took an embarrassed leave All the way home by the slow Sunday train sitting in the fireless waiting rooms on this cold spring day he was depressed enough at his simplicity in taking such a journey But no sooner did he reach his Melchester lodging than he found awaiting him a letter which had arrived that morning a few minutes after he had left the house It was a contrite little note from Sue in which she said with sweet humility that she felt she had been horrid in telling him he was not to come to see her that she despised herself for having been so conventional and that he was to be sure to come by the eleven forty five train that very Sunday and have dinner with them at half past one Jude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was too late to act upon its contents but he had chastened himself considerably of late and at last his chimerical expedition to Kennetbridge really did seem to have been another special intervention of Providence to keep him away from temptation But a growing impatience of faith which he had noticed in himself more than once of late made him pass over in ridicule the idea that God sent people on fools errands He longed to see her he was angry at having missed her and he wrote instantly telling her what had happened and saying he had not enough patience to wait till the following Sunday but would come any day in the week that she liked to name Since he wrote a little over ardently Sue as her manner was delayed her reply till Thursday before Good Friday when she said he might come that afternoon if he wished this being the earliest day on which she could welcome him for she was now assistant teacher in her husband s school Jude therefore got leave from the cathedral works at the trifling expense of a stoppage of pay and went Part Fourth AT SHASTON

none	none	Oh you goose to do just what I should have done Why did you
899_126232_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Because we are not alike he said drily 
none	none	Now we ll have some tea said Sue Shall we have it here instead of in my house 
899_126232_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It is no trouble to get the kettle and things brought in 
none	none	We don t live at the school you know but in that ancient dwelling across the way called Old Grove Place It is so antique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully Such houses are very well to visit but not to live in I feel crushed into the earth by the weight of so many previous lives there spent 
899_126232_000037_000006	train-clean-360	In a new place like these schools there is only your own life to support 
899_126232_000037_000007	train-clean-360	Sit down and I ll tell Ada to bring the tea things across 
899_126232_000038_000000	train-clean-360	He waited in the light of the stove the door of which she flung open before going out and when she returned followed by the maiden with tea they sat down by the same light assisted by the blue rays of a spirit lamp under the brass kettle on the stand 
899_126232_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 This is one of your wedding presents to me she said signifying the latter 
none	none	Yes said Jude The kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note to his mind and to change the subject he said Do you know of any good readable edition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament 
899_126232_000041_000001	train-clean-360	You don t read them in the school I suppose 
none	none	Oh dear no twould alarm the neighbourhood Yes there is one I am not familiar with it now though I was interested in it when my former friend was alive Cowper s Apocryphal Gospels That sounds like what I want His thoughts however reverted with a twinge to the former friend by whom she meant as he knew the university comrade of her earlier days He wondered if she talked of him to Phillotson The Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice she went on to keep him from his jealous thoughts which she read clearly as she always did Indeed when they talked on an indifferent subject as now there was ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions so perfect was the reciprocity between them
899_126232_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 It is quite like the genuine article 
none	none	All cut up into verses too so that it is like one of the other evangelists read in a dream when things are the same yet not the same But Jude do you take an interest in those questions still Are you getting up Apologetica Yes I am reading Divinity harder than ever 
899_126232_000046_000000	train-clean-360	She regarded him curiously 
899_126232_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Why do you look at me like that said Jude 
none	none	Oh why do you want to know I am sure you can tell me anything I may be ignorant of in that subject You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear dead friend
899_126232_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 We won t get on to that now she coaxed 
none	none	Will you be carving out at that church again next week where you learnt the pretty hymn
899_126232_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes perhaps 
none	none	That will be very nice Shall I come and see you there It is in this direction and I could come any afternoon by train for half an hour
899_126232_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 No Don t come 
none	none	What aren t we going to be friends then any longer as we used to be No
899_126232_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t know that 
none	none	I thought you were always going to be kind to me No I am not What have I done then I am sure I thought we two The tremolo in her voice caused her to break off Sue I sometimes think you are a flirt said he abruptly There was a momentary pause till she suddenly jumped up and to his surprise he saw by the kettle flame that her face was flushed I can t talk to you any longer Jude she said the tragic contralto note having come back as of old It is getting too dark to stay together like this after playing morbid Good Friday tunes that make one feel what one shouldn t We mustn t sit and talk in this way any more Yes you must go away for you mistake me I am very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly Oh Jude it WAS cruel to say that Yet I can t tell you the truth I should shock you by letting you know how I give way to my impulses and how much I feel that I shouldn t have been provided with attractiveness unless it were meant to be exercised Some women s love of being loved is insatiable and so often is their love of loving and in the last case they may find that they can t give it continuously to the chamber officer appointed by the bishop s licence to receive it But you are so straightforward Jude that you can t understand me 
899_126232_000061_000007	train-clean-360	Now you must go 
899_126232_000061_000008	train-clean-360	I am sorry my husband is not at home 
none	none	Are you I perceive I have said that in mere convention Honestly I don t think I am sorry It does not matter either way sad to say As they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner she touched his fingers but lightly when he went out now He had hardly gone from the door when with a dissatisfied look she jumped on a form and opened the iron casement of a window beneath which he was passing in the path without
899_126232_000064_000002	train-clean-360	 When do you leave here to catch your train Jude she asked 
899_126232_000065_000000	train-clean-360	He looked up in some surprise 
none	none	The coach that runs to meet it goes in three quarters of an hour or so
899_126232_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 What will you do with yourself for the time 
none	none	Oh wander about I suppose Perhaps I shall go and sit in the old church It does seem hard of me to pack you off so You have thought enough of churches Heaven knows without going into one in the dark Stay there Where Where you are 
899_126232_000070_000001	train-clean-360	I can talk to you better like this than when you were inside 
none	none	It was so kind and tender of you to give up half a day s work to come to see me 
899_126232_000070_000003	train-clean-360	You are Joseph the dreamer of dreams dear Jude 
899_126232_000070_000004	train-clean-360	And a tragic Don Quixote 
none	none	And sometimes you are saint Stephen who while they were stoning him could see Heaven opened 
899_126232_000070_000006	train-clean-360	Oh my poor friend and comrade you ll suffer yet 
none	none	Now that the high window sill was between them so that he could not get at her she seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she had feared at close quarters I have been thinking she continued still in the tone of one brimful of feeling that the social moulds civilization fits us into have no more relation to our actual shapes than the conventional shapes of the constellations have to the real star patterns I am called missus Richard Phillotson living a calm wedded life with my counterpart of that name But I am not really missus Richard Phillotson but a woman tossed about all alone with aberrant passions and unaccountable antipathies Now you mustn t wait longer or you will lose the coach Come and see me again 
899_126232_000072_000005	train-clean-360	You must come to the house then 
none	none	Yes said Jude
899_126232_000073_000001	train-clean-360	 When shall it be 
899_126232_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 To morrow week 
none	none	Good bye good bye 
899_126232_000074_000002	train-clean-360	She stretched out her hand and stroked his forehead pitifully just once 
899_126232_000074_000003	train-clean-360	Jude said good bye and went away into the darkness 
none	none	Passing along Bimport Street he thought he heard the wheels of the coach departing and truly enough when he reached the Duke s Arms in the Market Place the coach had gone It was impossible for him to get to the station on foot in time for this train and he settled himself perforce to wait for the next the last to Melchester that night He wandered about awhile obtained something to eat and then having another half hour on his hands his feet involuntarily took him through the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church with its avenues of limes in the direction of the schools again 
899_126232_000076_000001	train-clean-360	They were entirely in darkness 
none	none	She had said she lived over the way at Old Grove Place a house which he soon discovered from her description of its antiquity 
899_126232_000077_000000	train-clean-360	A glimmering candlelight shone from a front window the shutters being yet unclosed 
899_126232_000077_000001	train-clean-360	He could see the interior clearly the floor sinking a couple of steps below the road without which had become raised during the centuries since the house was built 
899_126232_000077_000002	train-clean-360	Sue evidently just come in was standing with her hat on in this front parlour or sitting room whose walls were lined with wainscoting of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling the latter being crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head 
899_126232_000077_000003	train-clean-360	The mantelpiece was of the same heavy description carved with Jacobean pilasters and scroll work 
none	none	The centuries did indeed ponderously overhang a young wife who passed her time here She had opened a rosewood work box and was looking at a photograph Having contemplated it a little while she pressed it against her bosom and put it again in its place Then becoming aware that she had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so candle in hand 
899_126232_000079_000001	train-clean-360	It was too dark for her to see Jude without but he could see her face distinctly and there was an unmistakable tearfulness about the dark long lashed eyes 
none	none	She closed the shutters and Jude turned away to pursue his solitary journey home
899_126232_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 Whose photograph was she looking at he said 
899_126232_000080_000002	train-clean-360	He had once given her his but she had others he knew 
none	none	Yet it was his surely He knew he should go to see her again according to her invitation Those earnest men he read of the saints whom Sue with gentle irreverence called his demi gods would have shunned such encounters if they doubted their own strength But he could not He might fast and pray during the whole interval but the human was more powerful in him than the Divine II 
899_126233_000002_000000	train-clean-360	However if God disposed not woman did 
none	none	The next morning but one brought him this note from her Don t come next week On your own account don t We were too free under the influence of that morbid hymn and the twilight Think no more than you can help of SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY The disappointment was keen He knew her mood the look of her face when she subscribed herself at length thus But whatever her mood he could not say she was wrong in her view He replied 
899_126233_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I acquiesce 
none	none	You are right It is a lesson in renunciation which I suppose I ought to learn at this season JUDE He despatched the note on Easter Eve and there seemed a finality in their decisions But other forces and laws than theirs were in operation On Easter Monday morning he received a message from the Widow Edlin whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious happened Your aunt is sinking 
899_126233_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Come at once 
899_126233_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He threw down his tools and went 
none	none	Three and a half hours later he was crossing the downs about Marygreen and presently plunged into the concave field across which the short cut was made to the village As he ascended on the other side a labouring man who had been watching his approach from a gate across the path moved uneasily and prepared to speak
899_126233_000010_000002	train-clean-360	 I can see in his face that she is dead said Jude 
899_126233_000010_000003	train-clean-360	 Poor Aunt Drusilla 
none	none	It was as he had supposed and missus Edlin had sent out the man to break the news to him She wouldn t have knowed ee She lay like a doll wi glass eyes so it didn t matter that you wasn t here said he Jude went on to the house and in the afternoon when everything was done and the layers out had finished their beer and gone he sat down alone in the silent place It was absolutely necessary to communicate with Sue though two or three days earlier they had agreed to mutual severance 
899_126233_000013_000002	train-clean-360	He wrote in the briefest terms 
899_126233_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Aunt Drusilla is dead having been taken almost suddenly The funeral is on Friday afternoon 
none	none	He remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days went out on Friday morning to see that the grave was finished and wondered if Sue would come 
899_126233_000015_000001	train-clean-360	She had not written and that seemed to signify rather that she would come than that she would not 
none	none	Having timed her by her only possible train he locked the door about mid day and crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by the Brown House where he stood and looked over the vast prospect northwards and over the nearer landscape in which Alfredston stood Two miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left to the right of the picture There was a long time to wait even now till he would know if she had arrived He did wait however and at last a small hired vehicle pulled up at the bottom of the hill and a person alighted the conveyance going back while the passenger began ascending the hill He knew her and she looked so slender to day that it seemed as if she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate embrace such as it was not for him to give Two thirds of the way up her head suddenly took a solicitous poise and he knew that she had at that moment recognized him Her face soon began a pensive smile which lasted till having descended a little way he met her I thought she began with nervous quickness that it would be so sad to let you attend the funeral alone 
899_126233_000017_000001	train-clean-360	And so at the last moment I came 
none	none	Dear faithful Sue murmured Jude With the elusiveness of her curious double nature however Sue did not stand still for any further greeting though it wanted some time to the burial A pathos so unusually compounded as that which attached to this hour was unlikely to repeat itself for years if ever and Jude would have paused and meditated and conversed But Sue either saw it not at all or seeing it more than he would not allow herself to feel it The sad and simple ceremony was soon over their progress to the church being almost at a trot the bustling undertaker having a more important funeral an hour later three miles off Drusilla was put into the new ground quite away from her ancestors Sue and Jude had gone side by side to the grave and now sat down to tea in the familiar house their lives united at least in this last attention to the dead She was opposed to marriage from first to last you say murmured Sue
899_126233_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Particularly for members of our family 
none	none	Her eyes met his and remained on him awhile We are rather a sad family don t you think Jude She said we made bad husbands and wives Certainly we make unhappy ones At all events I do for one 
899_126233_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Sue was silent 
none	none	Is it wrong Jude she said with a tentative tremor for a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are unhappy in their marriage If a marriage ceremony is a religious thing it is possibly wrong but if it is only a sordid contract based on material convenience in householding rating and taxing and the inheritance of land and money by children making it necessary that the male parent should be known which it seems to be why surely a person may say even proclaim upon the housetops that it hurts and grieves him or her I have said so anyhow to you Presently she went on Are there many couples do you think where one dislikes the other for no definite fault
899_126233_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I suppose 
none	none	If either cares for another person for instance
899_126233_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 But even apart from that 
none	none	Wouldn t the woman for example be very bad natured if she didn t like to live with her husband merely her voice undulated and he guessed things merely because she had a personal feeling against it a physical objection a fastidiousness or whatever it may be called although she might respect and be grateful to him I am merely putting a case Ought she to try to overcome her pruderies 
899_126233_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Jude threw a troubled look at her 
899_126233_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He said looking away It would be just one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my dogmas 
none	none	Speaking as an order loving man which I hope I am though I fear I am not I should say yes Speaking from experience and unbiased nature I should say no 
899_126233_000031_000004	train-clean-360	Sue I believe you are not happy 
none	none	Of course I am she contradicted How can a woman be unhappy who has only been married eight weeks to a man she
899_126233_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 chose freely 
none	none	Chose freely Why do you repeat it 
899_126233_000034_000001	train-clean-360	But I have to go back by the six o clock train 
none	none	You will be staying on here I suppose For a few days to wind up Aunt s affairs 
899_126233_000035_000001	train-clean-360	This house is gone now Shall I go to the train with you 
none	none	A little laugh of objection came from Sue
899_126233_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 I think not 
899_126233_000036_000002	train-clean-360	You may come part of the way 
899_126233_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 But stop you can t go to night 
none	none	That train won t take you to Shaston 
899_126233_000037_000002	train-clean-360	You must stay and go back to morrow 
none	none	missus Edlin has plenty of room if you don t like to stay here
899_126233_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well she said dubiously 
none	none	I didn t tell him I would come for certain Jude went to the widow s house adjoining to let her know and returning in a few minutes sat down again It is horrible how we are circumstanced Sue horrible he said abruptly with his eyes bent to the floor No Why
899_126233_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t tell you all my part of the gloom 
899_126233_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Your part is that you ought not to have married him 
none	none	I saw it before you had done it but I thought I mustn t interfere I was wrong I ought to have But what makes you assume all this dear Because I can see you through your feathers my poor little bird 
899_126233_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Her hand lay on the table and Jude put his upon it 
none	none	Sue drew hers away That s absurd Sue cried he after what we ve been talking about I am more strict and formal than you if it comes to that and that you should object to such an innocent action shows that you are ridiculously inconsistent Perhaps it was too prudish she said repentantly Only I have fancied it was a sort of trick of ours too frequent perhaps 
899_126233_000047_000002	train-clean-360	There you may hold it as much as you like 
899_126233_000047_000003	train-clean-360	Is that good of me 
899_126233_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes very 
899_126233_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 But I must tell him 
none	none	Who Richard Oh of course if you think it necessary But as it means nothing it may be bothering him needlessly Well are you sure you mean it only as my cousin Absolutely sure I have no feelings of love left in me
899_126233_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 That s news 
899_126233_000055_000001	train-clean-360	How has it come to be 
none	none	I ve seen Arabella 
899_126233_000057_000000	train-clean-360	She winced at the hit then said curiously When did you see her 
899_126233_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 When I was at Christminster 
899_126233_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 So she s come back and you never told me 
none	none	I suppose you will live with her now
899_126233_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course just as you live with your husband 
none	none	She looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses withered for want of attention and through them at the outer distance till her eyes began to grow moist
899_126233_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 What is it said Jude in a softened tone 
none	none	Why should you be so glad to go back to her if if what you used to say to me is still true I mean if it were true then 
899_126233_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Of course it is not now 
none	none	How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon
899_126233_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 A special Providence I suppose helped it on its way 
none	none	Ah it isn t true she said with gentle resentment
899_126233_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 You are teasing me that s all because you think I am not happy 
none	none	I don t know I don t wish to know If I were unhappy it would be my fault my wickedness not that I should have a right to dislike him He is considerate to me in everything and he is very interesting from the amount of general knowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his way 
899_126233_000066_000002	train-clean-360	Do you think Jude that a man ought to marry a woman his own age or one younger than himself eighteen years as I am than he 
none	none	It depends upon what they feel for each other He gave her no opportunity of self satisfaction and she had to go on unaided which she did in a vanquished tone verging on tears I I think I must be equally honest with you as you have been with me Perhaps you have seen what it is I want to say that though I like mister Phillotson as a friend I don t like him it is a torture to me to live with him as a husband There now I have let it out I couldn t help it although I have been pretending I am happy Now you ll have a contempt for me for ever I suppose She bent down her face upon her hands as they lay upon the cloth and silently sobbed in little jerks that made the fragile three legged table quiver I have only been married a month or two she went on still remaining bent upon the table and sobbing into her hands And it is said that what a woman shrinks from in the early days of her marriage she shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a dozen years But that is much like saying that the amputation of a limb is no affliction since a person gets comfortably accustomed to the use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time 
899_126233_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Jude could hardly speak but he said I thought there was something wrong Sue 
none	none	Oh I thought there was But it is not as you think there is nothing wrong except my own wickedness I suppose you d call it a repugnance on my part for a reason I cannot disclose and what would not be admitted as one by the world in general What tortures me so much is the necessity of being responsive to this man whenever he wishes good as he is morally the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a matter whose essence is its voluntariness I wish he would beat me or be faithless to me or do some open thing that I could talk about as a justification for feeling as I do But he does nothing except that he has grown a little cold since he has found out how I feel That s why he didn t come to the funeral Oh I am very miserable I don t know what to do Don t come near me Jude because you mustn t 
899_126233_000072_000006	train-clean-360	Don t don t 
none	none	But he had jumped up and put his face against hers or rather against her ear her face being inaccessible
899_126233_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 I told you not to Jude 
none	none	I know you did I only wish to console you It all arose through my being married before we met didn t it You would have been my wife Sue wouldn t you if it hadn t been for that Instead of replying she rose quickly and saying she was going to walk to her aunt s grave in the churchyard to recover herself went out of the house 
899_126233_000076_000001	train-clean-360	Jude did not follow her 
none	none	Twenty minutes later he saw her cross the village green towards missus Edlin s and soon she sent a little girl to fetch her bag and tell him she was too tired to see him again that night 
899_126233_000077_000000	train-clean-360	In the lonely room of his aunt s house Jude sat watching the cottage of the Widow Edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade He knew that Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and disheartened and again questioned his devotional motto that all was for the best 
none	none	He retired to rest early but his sleep was fitful from the sense that Sue was so near at hand At some time near two o clock when he was beginning to sleep more soundly he was aroused by a shrill squeak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly at Marygreen 
899_126233_000078_000002	train-clean-360	It was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin

none	none	He who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now began to picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg If it were a bad catch by the hind leg the animal would tug during the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap had stripped the leg bone of its flesh when should a weak springed instrument enable it to escape it would die in the fields from the mortification of the limb If it were a good catch namely by the fore leg the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in attempts at an impossible escape Almost half an hour passed and the rabbit repeated its cry Jude could rest no longer till he had put it out of its pain so dressing himself quickly he descended and by the light of the moon went across the green in the direction of the sound 
899_126233_000080_000002	train-clean-360	He reached the hedge bordering the widow s garden when he stood still 
899_126233_000080_000003	train-clean-360	The faint click of the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal guided him now and reaching the spot he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck with the side of his palm and it stretched itself out dead 
none	none	He was turning away when he saw a woman looking out of the open casement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage Jude said a voice timidly Sue s voice
899_126233_000081_000001	train-clean-360	 It is you is it not 
899_126233_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes dear 
none	none	I haven t been able to sleep at all and then I heard the rabbit and couldn t help thinking of what it suffered till I felt I must come down and kill it But I am so glad you got there first 
899_126233_000083_000002	train-clean-360	They ought not to be allowed to set these steel traps ought they 
none	none	Jude had reached the window which was quite a low one so that she was visible down to her waist She let go the casement stay and put her hand upon his her moonlit face regarding him wistfully
899_126233_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 Did it keep you awake he said 
899_126233_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 No I was awake 
none	none	How was that Oh you know now I know you with your religious doctrines think that a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal sin in making a man the confidant of it as I did you I wish I hadn t now Don t wish it dear he said That may have BEEN my view but my doctrines and I begin to part company
899_126233_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 I knew it I knew it 
none	none	And that s why I vowed I wouldn t disturb your belief 
899_126233_000090_000002	train-clean-360	But I am SO GLAD to see you and oh I didn t mean to see you again now the last tie between us Aunt Drusilla is dead 
899_126233_000091_000000	train-clean-360	Jude seized her hand and kissed it 
899_126233_000091_000001	train-clean-360	 There is a stronger one left he said 
none	none	I ll never care about my doctrines or my religion any more 
899_126233_000091_000003	train-clean-360	Let them go 
none	none	Let me help you even if I do love you and even if you
899_126233_000092_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t say it I know what you mean but I can t admit so much as that 
none	none	There

none	none	So few could enter into my feeling they would say twas my fanciful fastidiousness or something of that sort and condemn me It is none of the natural tragedies of love that s love s usual tragedy in civilized life but a tragedy artificially manufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in parting It would have been wrong perhaps for me to tell my distress to you if I had been able to tell it to anybody else But I have nobody 
899_126233_000094_000005	train-clean-360	And I MUST tell somebody 
none	none	Jude before I married him I had never thought out fully what marriage meant even though I knew It was idiotic of me there is no excuse I was old enough and I thought I was very experienced

none	none	I am certain one ought to be allowed to undo what one had done so ignorantly I daresay it happens to lots of women only they submit and I kick When people of a later age look back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times that we have the unhappiness to live in what WILL they say You are very bitter darling Sue 
899_126233_000095_000001	train-clean-360	How I wish I wish 
899_126233_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 You must go in now 
none	none	In a moment of impulse she bent over the sill and laid her face upon his hair weeping and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little kiss upon the top of his head withdrawing quickly so that he could not put his arms round her as otherwise he unquestionably would have done She shut the casement and he returned to his cottage III Sue s distressful confession recurred to Jude s mind all the night as being a sorrow indeed The morning after when it was time for her to go the neighbours saw her companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path which led into the lonely road to Alfredston An hour passed before he returned along the same route and in his face there was a look of exaltation not unmixed with recklessness An incident had occurred They had stood parting in the silent highway and their tense and passionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how far their intimacy ought to go till they had almost quarrelled and she said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in embryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he now wished to do Then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss would be nothing all would depend upon the spirit of it If given in the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection if in the spirit of a lover she could not permit it Will you swear that it will not be in that spirit she had said No he would not And then they had turned from each other in estrangement and gone their several ways till at a distance of twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously That look behind was fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less maintained They had quickly run back and met and embracing most unpremeditatedly kissed close and long When they parted for good it was with flushed cheeks on her side and a beating heart on his The kiss was a turning point in Jude s career Back again in the cottage and left to reflection he saw one thing that though his kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his faultful life as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it was glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the soldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded as at its best a frailty and at its worst damnation What Sue had said in warmth was really the cold truth When to defend his affection tooth and nail to persist with headlong force in impassioned attentions to her was all he thought of he was condemned ipso facto as a professor of the accepted school of morals He was as unfit obviously by nature as he had been by social position to fill the part of a propounder of accredited dogma Strange that his first aspiration towards academical proficiency had been checked by a woman and that his second aspiration towards apostleship had also been checked by a woman Is it he said that the women are to blame or is it the artificial system of things under which the normal sex impulses are turned into devilish domestic gins and springs to noose and hold back those who want to progress It had been his standing desire to become a prophet however humble to his struggling fellow creatures without any thought of personal gain Yet with a wife living away from him with another husband and himself in love erratically the loved one s revolt against her state being possibly on his account he had sunk to be barely respectable according to regulation views It was not for him to consider further he had only to confront the obvious which was that he had made himself quite an impostor as a law abiding religious teacher At dusk that evening he went into the garden and dug a shallow hole to which he brought out all the theological and ethical works that he possessed and had stored here He knew that in this country of true believers most of them were not saleable at a much higher price than waste paper value and preferred to get rid of them in his own way even if he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of thus destroying them Lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with he cut the volumes into pieces as well as he could and with a three pronged fork shook them over the flames They kindled and lighted up the back of the house the pigsty and his own face till they were more or less consumed Though he was almost a stranger here now passing cottagers talked to him over the garden hedge Burning up your awld aunt s rubbidge I suppose Ay a lot gets heaped up in nooks and corners when you ve lived eighty years in one house It was nearly one o clock in the morning before the leaves covers and binding of Jeremy Taylor Butler Doddridge Paley Pusey Newman and the rest had gone to ashes but the night was quiet and as he turned and turned the paper shreds with the fork the sense of being no longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which gave him calm He might go on believing as before but he professed nothing and no longer owned and exhibited engines of faith which as their proprietor he might naturally be supposed to exercise on himself first of all In his passion for Sue he could not stand as an ordinary sinner and not as a whited sepulchre Meanwhile Sue after parting from him earlier in the day had gone along to the station with tears in her eyes for having run back and let him kiss her Jude ought not to have pretended that he was not a lover and made her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally if not wrongly She was inclined to call it the latter for Sue s logic was extraordinarily compounded and seemed to maintain that before a thing was done it might be right to do but that being done it became wrong or in other words that things which were right in theory were wrong in practice I have been too weak I think she jerked out as she pranced on shaking down tear drops now and then It was burning like a lover s oh it was And I won t write to him any more or at least for a long time to impress him with my dignity And I hope it will hurt him very much expecting a letter to morrow morning and the next and the next and no letter coming He ll suffer then with suspense won t he that s all and I am very glad of it Tears of pity for Jude s approaching sufferings at her hands mingled with those which had surged up in pity for herself Then the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable to her the ethereal fine nerved sensitive girl quite unfitted by temperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial relation with Phillotson possibly with scarce any man walked fitfully along and panted and brought weariness into her eyes by gazing and worrying hopelessly Phillotson met her at the arrival station and seeing that she was troubled thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her aunt s death and funeral He began telling her of his day s doings and how his friend Gillingham a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he had not seen for years had called upon him While ascending to the town seated on the top of the omnibus beside him she said suddenly and with an air of self chastisement regarding the white road and its bordering bushes of hazel Richard I let mister Fawley hold my hand a long while I don t know whether you think it wrong He waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould said vaguely Oh did you What did you do that for I don t know He wanted to and I let him I hope it pleased him I should think it was hardly a novelty They lapsed into silence Had this been a case in the court of an omniscient judge he might have entered on his notes the curious fact that Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion and had not said a word about the kiss After tea that evening Phillotson sat balancing the school registers She remained in an unusually silent tense and restless condition and at last saying she was tired went to bed early When Phillotson arrived upstairs weary with the drudgery of the attendance numbers it was a quarter to twelve o clock Entering their chamber which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty miles over the Vale of Blackmoor and even into Outer Wessex he went to the window and pressing his face against the pane gazed with hard breathing fixity into the mysterious darkness which now covered the far reaching scene He was musing I think he said at last without turning his head that I must get the committee to change the school stationer All the copybooks are sent wrong this time There was no reply Thinking Sue was dozing he went on And there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the class room The wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and gives me the ear ache As the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he turned round The heavy gloomy oak wainscot which extended over the walls upstairs and down in the dilapidated Old Grove Place and the massive chimney piece reaching to the ceiling stood in odd contrast to the new and shining brass bedstead and the new suite of birch furniture that he had bought for her the two styles seeming to nod to each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor Soo he said this being the way in which he pronounced her name She was not in the bed though she had apparently been there the clothes on her side being flung back Thinking she might have forgotten some kitchen detail and gone downstairs for a moment to see to it he pulled off his coat and idled quietly enough for a few minutes when finding she did not come he went out upon the landing candle in hand and said again Soo Yes came back to him in her voice from the distant kitchen quarter What are you doing down there at midnight tiring yourself out for nothing I am not sleepy I am reading and there is a larger fire here He went to bed Some time in the night he awoke She was not there even now Lighting a candle he hastily stepped out upon the landing and again called her name She answered Yes as before but the tones were small and confined and whence they came he could not at first understand Under the staircase was a large clothes closet without a window they seemed to come from it The door was shut but there was no lock or other fastening Phillotson alarmed went towards it wondering if she had suddenly become deranged What are you doing in there he asked Not to disturb you I came here as it was so late But there s no bed is there And no ventilation Why you ll be suffocated if you stay all night Oh no I think not Don t trouble about me But Phillotson seized the knob and pulled at the door She had fastened it inside with a piece of string which broke at his pull There being no bedstead she had flung down some rugs and made a little nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet afforded When he looked in upon her she sprang out of her lair great eyed and trembling You ought not to have pulled open the door she cried excitedly It is not becoming in you Oh will you go away please will you She looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the shadowy lumber hole that he was quite worried She continued to beseech him not to disturb her He said I ve been kind to you and given you every liberty and it is monstrous that you should feel in this way Yes said she weeping I know that It is wrong and wicked of me I suppose I am very sorry But it is not I altogether that am to blame Who is then Am I No I don t know The universe I suppose things in general because they are so horrid and cruel Well it is no use talking like that Making a man s house so unseemly at this time o night Eliza will hear if we don t mind He meant the servant Just think if either of the parsons in this town was to see us now I hate such eccentricities Sue There s no order or regularity in your sentiments But I won t intrude on you further only I would advise you not to shut the door too tight or I shall find you stifled to morrow On rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet but Sue had already gone downstairs There was a little nest where she had lain and spiders webs hung overhead What must a woman s aversion be when it is stronger than her fear of spiders he said bitterly He found her sitting at the breakfast table and the meal began almost in silence the burghers walking past upon the pavement or rather roadway pavements being scarce here which was two or three feet above the level of the parlour floor They nodded down to the happy couple their morning greetings as they went on Richard she said all at once would you mind my living away from you Away from me Why that s what you were doing when I married you What then was the meaning of marrying at all You wouldn t like me any the better for telling you I don t object to know Because I thought I could do nothing else You had got my promise a long time before that remember Then as time went on I regretted I had promised you and was trying to see an honourable way to break it off But as I couldn t I became rather reckless and careless about the conventions Then you know what scandals were spread and how I was turned out of the training school you had taken such time and trouble to prepare me for and get me into and this frightened me and it seemed then that the one thing I could do would be to let the engagement stand Of course I of all people ought not to have cared what was said for it was just what I fancied I never did care for But I was a coward as so many women are and my theoretic unconventionality broke down If that had not entered into the case it would have been better to have hurt your feelings once for all then than to marry you and hurt them all my life after And you were so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour I am bound in honesty to tell you that I weighed its probability and inquired of your cousin about it Ah she said with pained surprise I didn t doubt you But you inquired I took his word Her eyes had filled HE wouldn t have inquired she said But you haven t answered me Will you let me go away I know how irregular it is of me to ask it It is irregular But I do ask it Domestic laws should be made according to temperaments which should be classified If people are at all peculiar in character they have to suffer from the very rules that produce comfort in others Will you let me But we married What is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances she burst out if they make you miserable when you know you are committing no sin But you are committing a sin in not liking me I DO like you But I didn t reflect it would be that it would be so much more than that For a man and woman to live on intimate terms when one feels as I do is adultery in any circumstances however legal There I ve said it Will you let me Richard You distress me Susanna by such importunity Why can t we agree to free each other We made the compact and surely we can cancel it not legally of course but we can morally especially as no new interests in the shape of children have arisen to be looked after Then we might be friends and meet without pain to either Oh Richard be my friend and have pity We shall both be dead in a few years and then what will it matter to anybody that you relieved me from constraint for a little while I daresay you think me eccentric or super sensitive or something absurd Well why should I suffer for what I was born to be if it doesn t hurt other people But it does it hurts ME And you vowed to love me Yes that s it I am in the wrong I always am It is as culpable to bind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always and as silly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink And do you mean by living away from me living by yourself Well if you insisted yes But I meant living with Jude As his wife As I choose Phillotson writhed Sue continued She or he who lets the world or his own portion of it choose his plan of life for him has no need of any other faculty than the apelike one of imitation J S Mill s words those are I have been reading it up Why can t you act upon them I wish to always What do I care about J S Mill moaned he I only want to lead a quiet life Do you mind my saying that I have guessed what never once occurred to me before our marriage that you were in love and are in love with Jude Fawley You may go on guessing that I am since you have begun But do you suppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and live with him The ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of replying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being such a convincing argumentum ad verecundiam as she in her loss of courage at the last moment meant it to appear She was beginning to be so puzzling and unstateable that he was ready to throw in with her other little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could make They proceeded to the schools that morning as usual Sue entering the class room where he could see the back of her head through the glass partition whenever he turned his eyes that way As he went on giving and hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from concentrated agitation of thought till at length he tore a scrap from a sheet of scribbling paper and wrote Your request prevents my attending to work at all I don t know what I am doing Was it seriously made He folded the piece of paper very small and gave it to a little boy to take to Sue The child toddled off into the class room Phillotson saw his wife turn and take the note and the bend of her pretty head as she read it her lips slightly crisped to prevent undue expression under fire of so many young eyes He could not see her hands but she changed her position and soon the child returned bringing nothing in reply In a few minutes however one of Sue s class appeared with a little note similar to his own These words only were pencilled therein I am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made Phillotson looked more disturbed than before and the meeting place of his brows twitched again In ten minutes he called up the child he had just sent to her and dispatched another missive God knows I don t want to thwart you in any reasonable way My whole thought is to make you comfortable and happy But I cannot agree to such a preposterous notion as your going to live with your lover You would lose everybody s respect and regard and so should I After an interval a similar part was enacted in the class room and an answer came I know you mean my good But I don t want to be respectable To produce Human development in its richest diversity to quote your Humboldt is to my mind far above respectability No doubt my tastes are low in your view hopelessly low If you won t let me go to him will you grant me this one request allow me to live in your house in a separate way To this he returned no answer She wrote again I know what you think But cannot you have pity on me I beg you to I implore you to be merciful I would not ask if I were not almost compelled by what I can t bear No poor woman has ever wished more than I that Eve had not fallen so that as the primitive Christians believed some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled Paradise But I won t trifle Be kind to me even though I have not been kind to you I will go away go abroad anywhere and never trouble you Nearly an hour passed and then he returned an answer I do not wish to pain you How well you KNOW I don t Give me a little time I am disposed to agree to your last request One line from her Thank you from my heart Richard I do not deserve your kindness All day Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed partition and he felt as lonely as when he had not known her But he was as good as his word and consented to her living apart in the house At first when they met at meals she had seemed more composed under the new arrangement but the irksomeness of their position worked on her temperament and the fibres of her nature seemed strained like harp strings She talked vaguely and indiscriminately to prevent his talking pertinently IV Phillotson was sitting up late as was often his custom trying to get together the materials for his long neglected hobby of Roman antiquities For the first time since reviving the subject he felt a return of his old interest in it He forgot time and place and when he remembered himself and ascended to rest it was nearly two o clock His preoccupation was such that though he now slept on the other side of the house he mechanically went to the room that he and his wife had occupied when he first became a tenant of Old Grove Place which since his differences with Sue had been hers exclusively He entered and unconsciously began to undress There was a cry from the bed and a quick movement Before the schoolmaster had realized where he was he perceived Sue starting up half awake staring wildly and springing out upon the floor on the side away from him which was towards the window This was somewhat hidden by the canopy of the bedstead and in a moment he heard her flinging up the sash Before he had thought that she meant to do more than get air she had mounted upon the sill and leapt out She disappeared in the darkness and he heard her fall below Phillotson horrified ran downstairs striking himself sharply against the newel in his haste Opening the heavy door he ascended the two or three steps to the level of the ground and there on the gravel before him lay a white heap Phillotson seized it in his arms and bringing Sue into the hall seated her on a chair where he gazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set down in the draught on the bottom stair She had certainly not broken her neck She looked at him with eyes that seemed not to take him in and though not particularly large in general they appeared so now She pressed her side and rubbed her arm as if conscious of pain then stood up averting her face in evident distress at his gaze Thank God you are not killed Though it s not for want of trying not much hurt I hope Her fall in fact had not been a serious one probably owing to the lowness of the old rooms and to the high level of the ground without Beyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had apparently incurred little harm I was asleep I think she began her pale face still turned away from him And something frightened me a terrible dream I thought I saw you The actual circumstances seemed to come back to her and she was silent Her cloak was hanging at the back of the door and the wretched Phillotson flung it round her Shall I help you upstairs he asked drearily for the significance of all this sickened him of himself and of everything No thank you Richard I am very little hurt I can walk You ought to lock your door he mechanically said as if lecturing in school Then no one could intrude even by accident I have tried it won t lock All the doors are out of order The aspect of things was not improved by her admission She ascended the staircase slowly the waving light of the candle shining on her Phillotson did not approach her or attempt to ascend himself till he heard her enter her room Then he fastened up the front door and returning sat down on the lower stairs holding the newel with one hand and bowing his face into the other Thus he remained for a long long time a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him till raising his head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that the business of his life must be carried on whether he had a wife or no he took the candle and went upstairs to his lonely room on the other side of the landing No further incident touching the matter between them occurred till the following evening when immediately school was over Phillotson walked out of Shaston saying he required no tea and not informing Sue where he was going He descended from the town level by a steep road in a north westerly direction and continued to move downwards till the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay He was now on the low alluvial beds Where Duncliffe is the traveller s mark And cloty Stour s a rolling dark More than once he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening Against the sky was Shaston dimly visible On the grey topp d height Of Paladore as pale day wore Away William Barnes The new lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine as if watching him one of which windows was his own Above it he could just discern the pinnacled tower of Trinity Church The air down here tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay was not as it had been above but soft and relaxing so that when he had walked a mile or two he was obliged to wipe his face with his handkerchief Leaving Duncliffe Hill on the left he proceeded without hesitation through the shade as a man goes on night or day in a district over which he has played as a boy He had walked altogether about four and a half miles Where Stour receives her strength From six cleere fountains fed Drayton when he crossed a tributary of the Stour and reached Leddenton a little town of three or four thousand inhabitants where he went on to the boys school and knocked at the door of the master s residence A boy pupil teacher opened it and to Phillotson s inquiry if mister Gillingham was at home replied that he was going at once off to his own house and leaving Phillotson to find his way in as he could He discovered his friend putting away some books from which he had been giving evening lessons The light of the paraffin lamp fell on Phillotson s face pale and wretched by contrast with his friend s who had a cool practical look They had been schoolmates in boyhood and fellow students at Wintoncester Training College many years before this time Glad to see you Dick But you don t look well Nothing the matter Phillotson advanced without replying and Gillingham closed the cupboard and pulled up beside his visitor Why you haven t been here let me see since you were married I called you know but you were out and upon my word it is such a climb after dark that I have been waiting till the days are longer before lumpering up again I am glad you didn t wait however Though well trained and even proficient masters they occasionally used a dialect word of their boyhood to each other in private I ve come George to explain to you my reasons for taking a step that I am about to take so that you at least will understand my motives if other people question them anywhen as they may indeed certainly will But anything is better than the present condition of things God forbid that you should ever have such an experience as mine Sit down You don t mean anything wrong between you and missus Phillotson I do My wretched state is that I ve a wife I love who not only does not love me but but Well I won t say I know her feeling I should prefer hatred from her Ssh And the sad part of it is that she is not so much to blame as I She was a pupil teacher under me as you know and I took advantage of her inexperience and toled her out for walks and got her to agree to a long engagement before she well knew her own mind Afterwards she saw somebody else but she blindly fulfilled her engagement Loving the other Yes with a curious tender solicitude seemingly though her exact feeling for him is a riddle to me and to him too I think possibly to herself She is one of the oddest creatures I ever met However I have been struck with these two facts the extraordinary sympathy or similarity between the pair He is her cousin which perhaps accounts for some of it They seem to be one person split in two And with her unconquerable aversion to myself as a husband even though she may like me as a friend tis too much to bear longer She has conscientiously struggled against it but to no purpose I cannot bear it I cannot I can t answer her arguments she has read ten times as much as I Her intellect sparkles like diamonds while mine smoulders like brown paper She s one too many for me She ll get over it good now Never It is but I won t go into it there are reasons why she never will At last she calmly and firmly asked if she might leave me and go to him The climax came last night when owing to my entering her room by accident she jumped out of window so strong was her dread of me She pretended it was a dream but that was to soothe me Now when a woman jumps out of window without caring whether she breaks her neck or no she s not to be mistaken and this being the case I have come to a conclusion that it is wrong to so torture a fellow creature any longer and I won t be the inhuman wretch to do it cost what it may What you ll let her go And with her lover Whom with is her matter I shall let her go with him certainly if she wishes I know I may be wrong I know I can t logically or religiously defend my concession to such a wish of hers or harmonize it with the doctrines I was brought up in Only I know one thing something within me tells me I am doing wrong in refusing her I like other men profess to hold that if a husband gets such a so called preposterous request from his wife the only course that can possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him is to refuse it and put her virtuously under lock and key and murder her lover perhaps But is that essentially right and proper and honourable or is it contemptibly mean and selfish I don t profess to decide I simply am going to act by instinct and let principles take care of themselves If a person who has blindly walked into a quagmire cries for help I am inclined to give it if possible But you see there s the question of neighbours and society what will happen if everybody Oh I am not going to be a philosopher any longer I only see what s under my eyes Well I don t agree with your instinct Dick said Gillingham gravely I am quite amazed to tell the truth that such a sedate plodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a moment You said when I called that she was puzzling and peculiar I think you are Have you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically a good woman while she has pleaded for release been the man she has knelt to and implored indulgence of I am thankful to say I haven t Then I don t think you are in a position to give an opinion I have been that man and it makes all the difference in the world if one has any manliness or chivalry in him I had not the remotest idea living apart from women as I have done for so many years that merely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her finger could by any possibility involve one in such a daily continuous tragedy as that now shared by her and me Well I could admit some excuse for letting her leave you provided she kept to herself But to go attended by a cavalier that makes a difference Not a bit Suppose as I believe she would rather endure her present misery than be made to promise to keep apart from him All that is a question for herself It is not the same thing at all as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him false However she has not distinctly implied living with him as wife though I think she means to And to the best of my understanding it is not an ignoble merely animal feeling between the two that is the worst of it because it makes me think their affection will be enduring I did not mean to confess to you that in the first jealous weeks of my marriage before I had come to my right mind I hid myself in the school one evening when they were together there and I heard what they said I am ashamed of it now though I suppose I was only exercising a legal right I found from their manner that an extraordinary affinity or sympathy entered into their attachment which somehow took away all flavour of grossness Their supreme desire is to be together to share each other s emotions and fancies and dreams Platonic Well no Shelleyan would be nearer to it They remind me of what are their names Laon and Cythna Also of Paul and Virginia a little The more I reflect the more ENTIRELY I am on their side But if people did as you want to do there d be a general domestic disintegration The family would no longer be the social unit Yes I am all abroad I suppose said Phillotson sadly I was never a very bright reasoner you remember And yet I don t see why the woman and the children should not be the unit without the man By the Lord Harry Matriarchy Does SHE say all this too Oh no She little thinks I have out Sued Sue in this all in the last twelve hours It will upset all received opinion hereabout Good God what will Shaston say I don t say that it won t I don t know I don t know As I say I am only a feeler not a reasoner Now said Gillingham let us take it quietly and have something to drink over it He went under the stairs and produced a bottle of cider wine of which they drank a rummer each I think you are rafted and not yourself he continued Do go back and make up your mind to put up with a few whims But keep her I hear on all sides that she s a charming young thing Ah yes That s the bitterness of it Well I won t stay I have a long walk before me Gillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way and at parting expressed his hope that this consultation singular as its subject was would be the renewal of their old comradeship Stick to her were his last words flung into the darkness after Phillotson from which his friend answered Aye aye But when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night and no sound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour he said So Gillingham my friend you had no stronger arguments against it than those I think she ought to be smacked and brought to her senses that s what I think murmured Gillingham as he walked back alone The next morning came and at breakfast Phillotson told Sue You may go with whom you will I absolutely and unconditionally agree Having once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more and more indubitably the true one His mild serenity at the sense that he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost overpowered his grief at relinquishing her Some days passed and the evening of their last meal together had come a cloudy evening with wind which indeed was very seldom absent in this elevated place How permanently it was imprinted upon his vision that look of her as she glided into the parlour to tea a slim flexible figure a face strained from its roundness and marked by the pallors of restless days and nights suggesting tragic possibilities quite at variance with her times of buoyancy a trying of this morsel and that and an inability to eat either Her nervous manner begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course might have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that Phillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes that remained You had better have a slice of ham or an egg or something with your tea You can t travel on a mouthful of bread and butter She took the slice he helped her to and they discussed as they sat trivial questions of housekeeping such as where he would find the key of this or that cupboard what little bills were paid and what not I am a bachelor by nature as you know Sue he said in a heroic attempt to put her at her ease So that being without a wife will not really be irksome to me as it might be to other men who have had one a little while I have too this grand hobby in my head of writing The Roman Antiquities of Wessex which will occupy all my spare hours If you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time as you used to I will do it with so much pleasure she said with amenable gentleness I should much like to be some help to you still as a friend Phillotson mused and said No I think we ought to be really separate if we are to be at all And for this reason that I don t wish to ask you any questions and particularly wish you not to give me information as to your movements or even your address Now what money do you want You must have some you know Oh of course Richard I couldn t think of having any of your money to go away from you with I don t want any either I have enough of my own to last me for a long while and Jude will let me have I would rather not know anything about him if you don t mind You are free absolutely and your course is your own Very well But I ll just say that I have packed only a change or two of my own personal clothing and one or two little things besides that are my very own I wish you would look into my trunk before it is closed Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into Jude s portmanteau Of course I shall do no such thing as examine your luggage I wish you would take three quarters of the household furniture I don t want to be bothered with it I have a sort of affection for a little of it that belonged to my poor mother and father But the rest you are welcome to whenever you like to send for it That I shall never do You go by the six thirty train don t you It is now a quarter to six You You don t seem very sorry I am going Richard Oh no perhaps not I like you much for how you have behaved It is a curious thing that directly I have begun to regard you as not my husband but as my old teacher I like you I won t be so affected as to say I love you because you know I don t except as a friend But you do seem that to me Sue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections and then the station omnibus came round to take her up Phillotson saw her things put on the top handed her in and was obliged to make an appearance of kissing her as he wished her good bye which she quite understood and imitated From the cheerful manner in which they parted the omnibus man had no other idea than that she was going for a short visit When Phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened the window in the direction the omnibus had taken Soon the noise of its wheels died away He came down then his face compressed like that of one bearing pain he put on his hat and went out following by the same route for nearly a mile Suddenly turning round he came home He had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend Gillingham greeted him from the front room I could make nobody hear so finding your door open I walked in and made myself comfortable I said I would call you remember Yes I am much obliged to you Gillingham particularly for coming to night How is missus She is quite well She is gone just gone That s her tea cup that she drank out of only an hour ago And that s the plate she Phillotson s throat got choked up and he could not go on He turned and pushed the tea things aside Have you had any tea by the by he asked presently in a renewed voice No yes never mind said Gillingham preoccupied Gone you say she is Yes I would have died for her but I wouldn t be cruel to her in the name of the law She is as I understand gone to join her lover What they are going to do I cannot say Whatever it may be she has my full consent to There was a stability a ballast in Phillotson s pronouncement which restrained his friend s comment Shall I leave you he asked No no It is a mercy to me that you have come I have some articles to arrange and clear away Would you help me Gillingham assented and having gone to the upper rooms the schoolmaster opened drawers and began taking out all Sue s things that she had left behind and laying them in a large box She wouldn t take all I wanted her to he continued But when I made up my mind to her going to live in her own way I did make up my mind Some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate I ve gone into all that and don t wish to argue it I was and am the most old fashioned man in the world on the question of marriage in fact I had never thought critically about its ethics at all But certain facts stared me in the face and I couldn t go against them They went on with the packing silently When it was done Phillotson closed the box and turned the key There he said To adorn her in somebody s eyes never again in mine V Four and twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following note to Jude It is as I told you and I am leaving to morrow evening Richard and I thought it could be done with less obtrusiveness after dark I feel rather frightened and therefore ask you to be sure you are on the Melchester platform to meet me I arrive at a little to seven I know you will of course dear Jude but I feel so timid that I can t help begging you to be punctual He has been so VERY kind to me through it all Now to our meeting S As she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from the mountain town the single passenger that evening she regarded the receding road with a sad face But no hesitation was apparent therein The up train by which she was departing stopped by signal only To Sue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway train should be brought to a stand still on purpose for her a fugitive from her lawful home The twenty minutes journey drew towards its close and Sue began gathering her things together to alight At the moment that the train came to a stand still by the Melchester platform a hand was laid on the door and she beheld Jude He entered the compartment promptly He had a black bag in his hand and was dressed in the dark suit he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work Altogether he looked a very handsome young fellow his ardent affection for her burning in his eyes Oh Jude She clasped his hand with both hers and her tense state caused her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs I I am so glad I get out here No I get in dear one I ve packed Besides this bag I ve only a big box which is labelled But don t I get out Aren t we going to stay here We couldn t possibly don t you see We are known here I at any rate am well known I ve booked for Aldbrickham and here s your ticket for the same place as you have only one to here I thought we should have stayed here she repeated It wouldn t have done at all Ah Perhaps not There wasn t time for me to write and say the place I had decided on Aldbrickham is a much bigger town sixty or seventy thousand inhabitants and nobody knows anything about us there And you have given up your cathedral work here Yes It was rather sudden your message coming unexpectedly Strictly I might have been made to finish out the week But I pleaded urgency and I was let off I would have deserted any day at your command dear Sue I have deserted more than that for you I fear I am doing you a lot of harm Ruining your prospects of the Church ruining your progress in your trade everything The Church is no more to me Let it lie I am not to be one of The soldier saints who row on row Burn upward each to his point of bliss if any such there be My point of bliss is not upward but here Oh I seem so bad upsetting men s courses like this said she taking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his But she recovered her equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen miles He has been so good in letting me go she resumed And here s a note I found on my dressing table addressed to you Yes He s not an unworthy fellow said Jude glancing at the note And I am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you According to the rule of women s whims I suppose I ought to suddenly love him because he has let me go so generously and unexpectedly she answered smiling But I am so cold or devoid of gratitude or so something that even this generosity hasn t made me love him or repent or want to stay with him as his wife although I do feel I like his large mindedness and respect him more than ever It may not work so well for us as if he had been less kind and you had run away against his will murmured Jude That I NEVER would have done Jude s eyes rested musingly on her face Then he suddenly kissed her and was going to kiss her again No only once now please Jude That s rather cruel he answered but acquiesced Such a strange thing has happened to me Jude continued after a silence Arabella has actually written to ask me to get a divorce from her in kindness to her she says She wants to honestly and legally marry that man she has already married virtually and begs me to enable her to do it What have you done I have agreed I thought at first I couldn t do it without getting her into trouble about that second marriage and I don t want to injure her in any way Perhaps she s no worse than I am after all But nobody knows about it over here and I find it will not be a difficult proceeding at all If she wants to start afresh I have only too obvious reasons for not hindering her Then you ll be free Yes I shall be free Where are we booked for she asked with the discontinuity that marked her to night Aldbrickham as I said But it will be very late when we get there Yes I thought of that and I wired for a room for us at the Temperance Hotel there One Yes one She looked at him Oh Jude Sue bent her forehead against the corner of the compartment I thought you might do it and that I was deceiving you But I didn t mean that In the pause which followed Jude s eyes fixed themselves with a stultified expression on the opposite seat Well he said Well He remained in silence and seeing how discomfited he was she put her face against his cheek murmuring Don t be vexed dear Oh there s no harm done he said But I understood it like that Is this a sudden change of mind You have no right to ask me such a question and I shan t answer she said smiling My dear one your happiness is more to me than anything although we seem to verge on quarrelling so often and your will is law to me I am something more than a mere selfish fellow I hope Have it as you wish On reflection his brow showed perplexity But perhaps it is that you don t love me not that you have become conventional Much as under your teaching I hate convention I hope it IS that not the other terrible alternative Even at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid as to the state of that mystery her heart Put it down to my timidity she said with hurried evasiveness to a woman s natural timidity when the crisis comes I may feel as well as you that I have a perfect right to live with you as you thought from this moment I may hold the opinion that in a proper state of society the father of a woman s child will be as much a private matter of hers as the cut of her underlinen on whom nobody will have any right to question her But partly perhaps because it is by his generosity that I am now free I would rather not be other than a little rigid If there had been a rope ladder and he had run after us with pistols it would have seemed different and I may have acted otherwise But don t press me and criticize me Jude Assume that I haven t the courage of my opinions I know I am a poor miserable creature My nature is not so passionate as yours He repeated simply I thought what I naturally thought But if we are not lovers we are not Phillotson thought so I am sure See here is what he has written to me He opened the letter she had brought and read I make only one condition that you are tender and kind to her I know you love her But even love may be cruel at times You are made for each other it is obvious palpable to any unbiased older person You were all along the shadowy third in my short life with her I repeat take care of Sue He s a good fellow isn t he she said with latent tears On reconsideration she added He was very resigned to letting me go too resigned almost I never was so near being in love with him as when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable on my journey and offering to provide money Yet I was not If I loved him ever so little as a wife I d go back to him even now But you don t do you It is true oh so terribly true I don t Nor me neither I half fear he said pettishly Nor anybody perhaps Sue sometimes when I am vexed with you I think you are incapable of real love That s not good and loyal of you she said and drawing away from him as far as she could looked severely out into the darkness She added in hurt tones without turning round My liking for you is not as some women s perhaps But it is a delight in being with you of a supremely delicate kind and I don t want to go further and risk it by an attempt to intensify it I quite realized that as woman with man it was a risk to come But as me with you I resolved to trust you to set my wishes above your gratification Don t discuss it further dear Jude Of course if it would make you reproach yourself but you do like me very much Sue Say you do Say that you do a quarter a tenth as much as I do you and I ll be content I ve let you kiss me and that tells enough Just once or so Well don t be a greedy boy He leant back and did not look at her for a long time That episode in her past history of which she had told him of the poor Christminster graduate whom she had handled thus returned to Jude s mind and he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing destiny This is a queer elopement he murmured Perhaps you are making a cat s paw of me with Phillotson all this time Upon my word it almost seems so to see you sitting up there so prim Now you mustn t be angry I won t let you she coaxed turning and moving nearer to him You did kiss me just now you know and I didn t dislike you to I own it Jude Only I don t want to let you do it again just yet considering how we are circumstanced don t you see He could never resist her when she pleaded as she well knew And they sat side by side with joined hands till she aroused herself at some thought I can t possibly go to that Temperance Inn after your telegraphing that message Why not You can see well enough Very well there ll be some other one open no doubt I have sometimes thought since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid scandal that under the affectation of independent views you are as enslaved to the social code as any woman I know Not mentally But I haven t the courage of my views as I said before I didn t marry him altogether because of the scandal But sometimes a woman s LOVE OF BEING LOVED gets the better of her conscience and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a man cruelly she encourages him to love her while she doesn t love him at all Then when she sees him suffering her remorse sets in and she does what she can to repair the wrong You simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him poor old chap and then repented and to make reparation married him though you tortured yourself to death by doing it Well if you will put it brutally it was a little like that that and the scandal together and your concealing from me what you ought to have told me before He could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms and soothed her saying There dear don t mind Crucify me if you will You know you are all the world to me whatever you do I am very bad and unprincipled I know you think that she said trying to blink away her tears I think and know you are my dear Sue from whom neither length nor breadth nor things present nor things to come can divide me Though so sophisticated in many things she was such a child in others that this satisfied her and they reached the end of their journey on the best of terms It was about ten o clock when they arrived at Aldbrickham the county town of North Wessex As she would not go to the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram Jude inquired for another and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled their luggage to the George farther on which proved to be the inn at which Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their meeting after their division for years Owing however to their now entering it by another door and to his preoccupation he did not at first recognize the place When they had engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper During Jude s temporary absence the waiting maid spoke to Sue I think ma am I remember your relation or friend or whatever he is coming here once before late just like this with his wife a lady at any rate that wasn t you by no manner of means jest as med be with you now Oh do you said Sue with a certain sickness of heart Though I think you must be mistaken How long ago was it About a month or two A handsome full figured woman They had this room When Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and miserable Jude she said to him plaintively at their parting that night upon the landing it is not so nice and pleasant as it used to be with us I don t like it here I can t bear the place And I don t like you so well as I did How fidgeted you seem dear Why do you change like this Because it was cruel to bring me here Why You were lately here with Arabella There now I have said it Dear me why said Jude looking round him Yes it is the same I really didn t know it Sue Well it is not cruel since we have come as we have two relations staying together How long ago was it you were here Tell me tell me The day before I met you in Christminster when we went back to Marygreen together I told you I had met her Yes you said you had met her but you didn t tell me all Your story was that you had met as estranged people who were not husband and wife at all in Heaven s sight not that you had made it up with her We didn t make it up he said sadly I can t explain Sue You ve been false to me you my last hope And I shall never forget it never But by your own wish dear Sue we are only to be friends not lovers It is so very inconsistent of you to Friends can be jealous I don t see that You concede nothing to me and I have to concede everything to you After all you were on good terms with your husband at that time No I wasn t Jude Oh how can you think so And you have taken me in even if you didn t intend to She was so mortified that he was obliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people should hear Was it this room Yes it was I see by your look it was I won t have it for mine Oh it was treacherous of you to have her again I jumped out of the window But Sue she was after all my legal wife if not Slipping down on her knees Sue buried her face in the bed and wept I never knew such an unreasonable such a dog in the manger feeling said Jude I am not to approach you nor anybody else Oh don t you UNDERSTAND my feeling Why don t you Why are you so gross I jumped out of the window Jumped out of window I can t explain It was true that he did not understand her feelings very well But he did a little and began to love her none the less I I thought you cared for nobody desired nobody in the world but me at that time and ever since continued Sue It is true I did not and don t now said Jude as distressed as she But you must have thought much of her Or No I need not you don t understand me either women never do Why should you get into such a tantrum about nothing Looking up from the quilt she pouted provokingly If it hadn t been for that perhaps I would have gone on to the Temperance Hotel after all as you proposed for I was beginning to think I did belong to you Oh it is of no consequence said Jude distantly I thought of course that she had never been really your wife since she left you of her own accord years and years ago My sense of it was that a parting such as yours from her and mine from him ended the marriage I can t say more without speaking against her and I don t want to do that said he Yet I must tell you one thing which would settle the matter in any case She has married another man really married him I knew nothing about it till after the visit we made here Married another It is a crime as the world treats it but does not believe There now you are yourself again Yes it is a crime as you don t hold but would fearfully concede But I shall never inform against her And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led her to urge me to get a divorce that she may remarry this man legally So you perceive I shall not be likely to see her again And you didn t really know anything of this when you saw her said Sue more gently as she rose I did not Considering all things I don t think you ought to be angry darling I am not But I shan t go to the Temperance Hotel He laughed Never mind he said So that I am near you I am comparatively happy It is more than this earthly wretch called Me deserves you spirit you disembodied creature you dear sweet tantalizing phantom hardly flesh at all so that when I put my arms round you I almost expect them to pass through you as through air Forgive me for being gross as you call it Remember that our calling cousins when really strangers was a snare The enmity of our parents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than the novelty of ordinary new acquaintance Say those pretty lines then from Shelley s Epipsychidion as if they meant me she solicited slanting up closer to him as they stood Don t you know them I know hardly any poetry he replied mournfully Don t you These are some of them There was a Being whom my spirit oft Met on its visioned wanderings far aloft A seraph of Heaven too gentle to be human Veiling beneath that radiant form of woman Oh it is too flattering so I won t go on But say it s me Say it s me It is you dear exactly like you Now I forgive you And you shall kiss me just once there not very long She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek and he did as commanded You do care for me very much don t you in spite of my not you know Yes sweet he said with a sigh and bade her good night VI In returning to his native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson had won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants who though they did not honour him for his miscellaneous aquirements as he would have been honoured elsewhere retained for him a sincere regard When shortly after his arrival he brought home a pretty wife awkwardly pretty for him if he did not take care they said they were glad to have her settle among them For some time after her flight from that home Sue s absence did not excite comment Her place as monitor in the school was taken by another young woman within a few days of her vacating it which substitution also passed without remark Sue s services having been of a provisional nature only When however a month had passed and Phillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know where his wife was staying curiosity began to be aroused till jumping to conclusions people ventured to affirm that Sue had played him false and run away from him The schoolmaster s growing languor and listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea Though Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could except to his friend Gillingham his honesty and directness would not allow him to do so when misapprehensions as to Sue s conduct spread abroad On a Monday morning the chairman of the school committee called and after attending to the business of the school drew Phillotson aside out of earshot of the children You ll excuse my asking Phillotson since everybody is talking of it is this true as to your domestic affairs that your wife s going away was on no visit but a secret elopement with a lover If so I condole with you Don t said Phillotson There was no secret about it She has gone to visit friends No Then what has happened She has gone away under circumstances that usually call for condolence with the husband But I gave my consent The chairman looked as if he had not apprehended the remark What I say is quite true Phillotson continued testily She asked leave to go away with her lover and I let her Why shouldn t I A woman of full age it was a question of her own conscience not for me I was not her gaoler I can t explain any further I don t wish to be questioned The children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of the two men and went home and told their parents that something new had happened about missus Phillotson Then Phillotson s little maidservant who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards said that mister Phillotson had helped in his wife s packing had offered her what money she required and had written a friendly letter to her young man telling him to take care of her The chairman of committee thought the matter over and talked to the other managers of the school till a request came to Phillotson to meet them privately The meeting lasted a long time and at the end the school master came home looking as usual pale and worn Gillingham was sitting in his house awaiting him Well it is as you said observed Phillotson flinging himself down wearily in a chair They have requested me to send in my resignation on account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured wife her liberty or as they call it condoning her adultery But I shan t resign I think I would I won t It is no business of theirs It doesn t affect me in my public capacity at all They may expel me if they like If you make a fuss it will get into the papers and you ll never get appointed to another school You see they have to consider what you did as done by a teacher of youth and its effects as such upon the morals of the town and to ordinary opinion your position is indefensible You must let me say that To this good advice however Phillotson would not listen I don t care he said I don t go unless I am turned out And for this reason that by resigning I acknowledge I have acted wrongly by her when I am more and more convinced every day that in the sight of Heaven and by all natural straightforward humanity I have acted rightly Gillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to maintain such a position as this but he said nothing further and in due time indeed in a quarter of an hour the formal letter of dismissal arrived the managers having remained behind to write it after Phillotson s withdrawal The latter replied that he should not accept dismissal and called a public meeting which he attended although he looked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to stay at home When he stood up to give his reasons for contesting the decision of the managers he advanced them firmly as he had done to his friend and contended moreover that the matter was a domestic theory which did not concern them This they over ruled insisting that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite within their sphere of control as it touched the morals of those he taught Phillotson replied that he did not see how an act of natural charity could injure morals All the respectable inhabitants and well to do fellow natives of the town were against Phillotson to a man But somewhat to his surprise some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from the ground It has been stated that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and interesting group of itinerants who frequented the numerous fairs and markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn months Although Phillotson had never spoken to one of these gentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence The body included two cheap Jacks a shooting gallery proprietor and the ladies who loaded the guns a pair of boxing masters a steam roundabout manager two travelling broom makers who called themselves widows a gingerbread stall keeper a swing boat owner and a test your strength man This generous phalanx of supporters and a few others of independent judgment whose own domestic experiences had been not without vicissitude came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson after which they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that issue was joined the result being a general scuffle wherein a black board was split three panes of the school windows were broken an inkbottle was spilled over a town councillor s shirt front a churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine that his head went right through Samaria and many black eyes and bleeding noses were given one of which to everybody s horror was the venerable incumbent s owing to the zeal of an emancipated chimney sweep who took the side of Phillotson s party When Phillotson saw the blood running down the rector s face he deplored almost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances regretted that he had not resigned when called upon and went home so ill that next morning he could not leave his bed The farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious illness for him and he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state of mind of a middle aged man who perceives at length that his life intellectual and domestic is tending to failure and gloom Gillingham came to see him in the evenings and on one occasion mentioned Sue s name She doesn t care anything about me said Phillotson Why should she She doesn t know you are ill So much the better for both of us Where are her lover and she living At Melchester I suppose at least he was living there some time ago When Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected and at last wrote an anonymous line to Sue on the bare chance of its reaching her the letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the diocesan capital Arriving at that place it was forwarded to Marygreen in North Wessex and thence to Aldbrickham by the only person who knew his present address the widow who had nursed his aunt Three days later in the evening when the sun was going down in splendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor and making the Shaston windows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale the sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house and a few minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door Phillotson did not speak the door was hesitatingly opened and there entered Sue She was in light spring clothing and her advent seemed ghostly like the flitting in of a moth He turned his eyes upon her and flushed but appeared to check his primary impulse to speak I have no business here she said bending her frightened face to him But I heard you were ill very ill and and as I know that you recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical love I have come I am not very ill my dear friend Only unwell I didn t know that and I am afraid that only a severe illness would have justified my coming Yes yes And I almost wish you had not come It is a little too soon that s all I mean Still let us make the best of it You haven t heard about the school I suppose No what about it Only that I am going away from here to another place The managers and I don t agree and we are going to part that s all Sue did not for a moment either now or later suspect what troubles had resulted to him from letting her go it never once seemed to cross her mind and she had received no news whatever from Shaston They talked on slight and ephemeral subjects and when his tea was brought up he told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set for Sue That young person was much more interested in their history than they supposed and as she descended the stairs she lifted her eyes and hands in grotesque amazement While they sipped Sue went to the window and thoughtfully said It is such a beautiful sunset Richard They are mostly beautiful from here owing to the rays crossing the mist of the vale But I lose them all as they don t shine into this gloomy corner where I lie Wouldn t you like to see this particular one It is like heaven opened Ah yes But I can t I ll help you to No the bedstead can t be shifted But see how I mean She went to where a swing glass stood and taking it in her hands carried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine moving the glass till the beams were reflected into Phillotson s face There you can see the great red sun now she said And I am sure it will cheer you I do so hope it will She spoke with a childlike repentant kindness as if she could not do too much for him Phillotson smiled sadly You are an odd creature he murmured as the sun glowed in his eyes The idea of your coming to see me after what has passed Don t let us go back upon that she said quickly I have to catch the omnibus for the train as Jude doesn t know I have come he was out when I started so I must return home almost directly Richard I am so very glad you are better You don t hate me do you You have been such a kind friend to me I am glad to know you think so said Phillotson huskily No I don t hate you It grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent chat and when candles were brought and it was time to leave she put her hand in his or rather allowed it to flit through his for she was significantly light in touch She had nearly closed the door when he said Sue He had noticed that in turning away from him tears were on her face and a quiver in her lip It was bad policy to recall her he knew it while he pursued it But he could not help it She came back Sue he murmured do you wish to make it up and stay I ll forgive you and condone everything Oh you can t you can t she said hastily You can t condone it now HE is your husband now in effect you mean of course You may assume it He is obtaining a divorce from his wife Arabella His wife It is altogether news to me that he has a wife It was a bad marriage Like yours Like mine He is not doing it so much on his own account as on hers She wrote and told him it would be a kindness to her since then she could marry and live respectably And Jude has agreed A wife A kindness to her Ah yes a kindness to her to release her altogether But I don t like the sound of it I can forgive Sue No no You can t have me back now I have been so wicked as to do what I have done There had arisen in Sue s face that incipient fright which showed itself whenever he changed from friend to husband and which made her adopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him I MUST go now I ll come again may I I don t ask you to go even now I ask you to stay I thank you Richard but I must As you are not so ill as I thought I CANNOT stay She s his his from lips to heel said Phillotson but so faintly that in closing the door she did not hear it The dread of a reactionary change in the schoolmaster s sentiments coupled perhaps with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know what a slipshod lack of thoroughness from a man s point of view characterized her transferred allegiance prevented her telling him of her thus far incomplete relations with Jude and Phillotson lay writhing like a man in hell as he pictured the prettily dressed maddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name returning impatiently to the home of her lover Gillingham was so interested in Phillotson s affairs and so seriously concerned about him that he walked up the hill side to Shaston two or three times a week although there and back it was a journey of nine miles which had to be performed between tea and supper after a hard day s work in school When he called on the next occasion after Sue s visit his friend was downstairs and Gillingham noticed that his restless mood had been supplanted by a more fixed and composed one She s been here since you called last said Phillotson Not missus Phillotson Yes Ah You have made it up No She just came patted my pillow with her little white hand played the thoughtful nurse for half an hour and went away Well I m hanged A little hussy What do you say Oh nothing What do you mean I mean what a tantalizing capricious little woman If she were not your wife She is not she s another man s except in name and law And I have been thinking it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with her that in kindness to her I ought to dissolve the legal tie altogether which singularly enough I think I can do now she has been back and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven her I believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it though I did not see it at the moment What s the use of keeping her chained on to me if she doesn t belong to me I know I feel absolutely certain that she would welcome my taking such a step as the greatest charity to her For though as a fellow creature she sympathizes with and pities me and even weeps for me as a husband she cannot endure me she loathes me there s no use in mincing words she loathes me and my only manly and dignified and merciful course is to complete what I have begun And for worldly reasons too it will be better for her to be independent I have hopelessly ruined my prospects because of my decision as to what was best for us though she does not know it I see only dire poverty ahead from my feet to the grave for I can be accepted as teacher no more I shall probably have enough to do to make both ends meet during the remainder of my life now my occupation s gone and I shall be better able to bear it alone I may as well tell you that what has suggested my letting her go is some news she brought me the news that Fawley is doing the same Oh he had a spouse too A queer couple these lovers Well I don t want your opinion on that What I was going to say is that my liberating her can do her no possible harm and will open up a chance of happiness for her which she has never dreamt of hitherto For then they ll be able to marry as they ought to have done at first Gillingham did not hurry to reply I may disagree with your motive he said gently for he respected views he could not share But I think you are right in your determination if you can carry it out I doubt however if you can Part Fifth AT ALDBRICKHAM AND ELSEWHERE Thy aerial part and all the fiery parts which are mingled in thee though by nature they have an upward tendency still in obedience to the disposition of the universe they are over powered here in the compound mass the body M ANTONINUS Long I How Gillingham s doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by passing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed the events of the last chapter and coming on to a Sunday in the February of the year following Sue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham in precisely the same relations that they had established between themselves when she left Shaston to join him the year before The proceedings in the law courts had reached their consciousness but as a distant sound and an occasional missive which they hardly understood They had met as usual to breakfast together in the little house with Jude s name on it that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year with three pounds ten extra for rates and taxes and furnished with his aunt s ancient and lumbering goods which had cost him about their full value to bring all the way from Marygreen Sue kept house and managed everything As he entered the room this morning Sue held up a letter she had just received Well and what is it about he said after kissing her That the decree nisi in the case of Phillotson versus Phillotson and Fawley pronounced six months ago has just been made absolute Ah said Jude as he sat down The same concluding incident in Jude s suit against Arabella had occurred about a month or two earlier Both cases had been too insignificant to be reported in the papers further than by name in a long list of other undefended cases Now then Sue at any rate you can do what you like He looked at his sweetheart curiously Are we you and I just as free now as if we had never married at all Just as free except I believe that a clergyman may object personally to remarry you and hand the job on to somebody else But I wonder do you think it is really so with us I know it is generally But I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has been obtained under false pretences How Well if the truth about us had been known the decree wouldn t have been pronounced It is only is it because we have made no defence and have led them into a false supposition Therefore is my freedom lawful however proper it may be Well why did you let it be under false pretences You have only yourself to blame he said mischievously Jude don t You ought not to be touchy about that still You must take me as I am Very well darling so I will Perhaps you were right As to your question we were not obliged to prove anything That was their business Anyhow we are living together Yes Though not in their sense One thing is certain that however the decree may be brought about a marriage is dissolved when it is dissolved There is this advantage in being poor obscure people like us that these things are done for us in a rough and ready fashion It was the same with me and Arabella I was afraid her criminal second marriage would have been discovered and she punished but nobody took any interest in her nobody inquired nobody suspected it If we d been patented nobilities we should have had infinite trouble and days and weeks would have been spent in investigations By degrees Sue acquired her lover s cheerfulness at the sense of freedom and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields even if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it Jude agreed and Sue went up stairs and prepared to start putting on a joyful coloured gown in observance of her liberty seeing which Jude put on a lighter tie Now we ll strut arm and arm he said like any other engaged couple We ve a legal right to They rambled out of the town and along a path over the low lying lands that bordered it though these were frosty now and the extensive seed fields were bare of colour and produce The pair however were so absorbed in their own situation that their surroundings were little in their consciousness Well my dearest the result of all this is that we can marry after a decent interval Yes I suppose we can said Sue without enthusiasm And aren t we going to I don t like to say no dear Jude but I feel just the same about it now as I have done all along I have just the same dread lest an iron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me and mine for you as it did between our unfortunate parents Still what can we do I do love you as you know Sue I know it abundantly But I think I would much rather go on living always as lovers as we are living now and only meeting by day It is so much sweeter for the woman at least and when she is sure of the man And henceforward we needn t be so particular as we have been about appearances Our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging I own said he with some gloom either owing to our own dissatisfied unpractical natures or by our misfortune But we two Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together which would be twice as bad as before I think I should begin to be afraid of you Jude the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a Government stamp and I was licensed to be loved on the premises by you Ugh how horrible and sordid Although as you are free I trust you more than any other man in the world No no don t say I should change he expostulated yet there was misgiving in his own voice also Apart from ourselves and our unhappy peculiarities it is foreign to a man s nature to go on loving a person when he is told that he must and shall be that person s lover There would be a much likelier chance of his doing it if he were told not to love If the marriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between the parties to cease loving from that day forward in consideration of personal possession being given and to avoid each other s society as much as possible in public there would be more loving couples than there are now Fancy the secret meetings between the perjuring husband and wife the denials of having seen each other the clambering in at bedroom windows and the hiding in closets There d be little cooling then Yes but admitting this or something like it to be true you are not the only one in the world to see it dear little Sue People go on marrying because they can t resist natural forces although many of them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a month s pleasure with a life s discomfort No doubt my father and mother and your father and mother saw it if they at all resembled us in habits of observation But then they went and married just the same because they had ordinary passions But you Sue are such a phantasmal bodiless creature one who if you ll allow me to say it has so little animal passion in you that you can act upon reason in the matter when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance can t Well she sighed you ve owned that it would probably end in misery for us And I am not so exceptional a woman as you think Fewer women like marriage than you suppose only they enter into it for the dignity it is assumed to confer and the social advantages it gains them sometimes a dignity and an advantage that I am quite willing to do without Jude fell back upon his old complaint that intimate as they were he had never once had from her an honest candid declaration that she loved or could love him I really fear sometimes that you cannot he said with a dubiousness approaching anger And you are so reticent I know that women are taught by other women that they must never admit the full truth to a man But the highest form of affection is based on full sincerity on both sides Not being men these women don t know that in looking back on those he has had tender relations with a man s heart returns closest to her who was the soul of truth in her conduct The better class of man even if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying is not retained by them A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of elusiveness too often in the utter contempt for her that sooner or later her old admirers feel under which they allow her to go unlamented to her grave Sue who was regarding the distance had acquired a guilty look and she suddenly replied in a tragic voice I don t think I like you to day so well as I did Jude Don t you Why Oh well you are not nice too sermony Though I suppose I am so bad and worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing No you are not bad You are a dear But as slippery as an eel when I want to get a confession from you Oh yes I am bad and obstinate and all sorts It is no use your pretending I am not People who are good don t want scolding as I do But now that I have nobody but you and nobody to defend me it is very hard that I mustn t have my own way in deciding how I ll live with you and whether I ll be married or no Sue my own comrade and sweetheart I don t want to force you either to marry or to do the other thing of course I don t It is too wicked of you to be so pettish Now we won t say any more about it and go on just the same as we have done and during the rest of our walk we ll talk of the meadows only and the floods and the prospect of the farmers this coming year After this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for several days though living as they were with only a landing between them it was constantly in their minds Sue was assisting Jude very materially now he had latterly occupied himself on his own account in working and lettering headstones which he kept in a little yard at the back of his little house where in the intervals of domestic duties she marked out the letters full size for him and blacked them in after he had cut them It was a lower class of handicraft than were his former performances as a cathedral mason and his only patrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood and knew what a cheap man this Jude Fawley Monumental Mason as he called himself on his front door was to employ for the simple memorials they required for their dead But he seemed more independent than before and it was the only arrangement under which Sue who particularly wished to be no burden on him could render any assistance II It was an evening at the end of the month and Jude had just returned home from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not far off When he entered Sue who had been keeping indoors during his absence laid out supper for him Contrary to custom she did not speak Jude had taken up some illustrated paper which he perused till raising his eyes he saw that her face was troubled Are you depressed Sue he said She paused a moment I have a message for you she answered Somebody has called Yes A woman Sue s voice quavered as she spoke and she suddenly sat down from her preparations laid her hands in her lap and looked into the fire I don t know whether I did right or not she continued I said you were not at home and when she said she would wait I said I thought you might not be able to see her Why did you say that dear I suppose she wanted a headstone Was she in mourning No She wasn t in mourning and she didn t want a headstone and I thought you couldn t see her Sue looked critically and imploringly at him But who was she Didn t she say No She wouldn t give her name But I know who she was I think I do It was Arabella Heaven save us What should Arabella come for What made you think it was she Oh I can hardly tell But I know it was I feel perfectly certain it was by the light in her eyes as she looked at me She was a fleshy coarse woman Well I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly except in speech though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of the public house She was rather handsome when I knew her Handsome But yes so she is I think I heard a quiver in your little mouth Well waiving that as she is nothing to me and virtuously married to another man why should she come troubling us Are you sure she s married Have you definite news of it No not definite news But that was why she asked me to release her She and the man both wanted to lead a proper life as I understood Oh Jude it was it WAS Arabella cried Sue covering her eyes with her hand And I am so miserable It seems such an ill omen whatever she may have come for You could not possibly see her could you I don t really think I could It would be so very painful to talk to her now for her as much as for me However she s gone Did she say she would come again No But she went away very reluctantly Sue whom the least thing upset could not eat any supper and when Jude had finished his he prepared to go to bed He had no sooner raked out the fire fastened the doors and got to the top of the stairs than there came a knock Sue instantly emerged from her room which she had but just entered There she is again Sue whispered in appalled accents How do you know She knocked like that last time They listened and the knocking came again No servant was kept in the house and if the summons were to be responded to one of them would have to do it in person I ll open a window said Jude Whoever it is cannot be expected to be let in at this time He accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash The lonely street of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of one figure that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few yards off Who s there he asked Is that mister Fawley came up from the woman in a voice which was unmistakably Arabella s Jude replied that it was Is it she asked Sue from the door with lips apart Yes dear said Jude What do you want Arabella he inquired I beg your pardon Jude for disturbing you said Arabella humbly But I called earlier I wanted particularly to see you to night if I could I am in trouble and have nobody to help me In trouble are you Yes There was a silence An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in Jude s breast at the appeal But aren t you married he said Arabella hesitated No Jude I am not she returned He wouldn t after all And I am in great difficulty I hope to get another situation as barmaid soon But it takes time and I really am in great distress because of a sudden responsibility that s been sprung upon me from Australia or I wouldn t trouble you believe me I wouldn t I want to tell you about it Sue remained at gaze in painful tension hearing every word but speaking none You are not really in want of money Arabella he asked in a distinctly softened tone I have enough to pay for the night s lodging I have obtained but barely enough to take me back again Where are you living In London still She was about to give the address but she said I am afraid somebody may hear so I don t like to call out particulars of myself so loud If you could come down and walk a little way with me towards the Prince Inn where I am staying to night I would explain all You may as well for old time s sake Poor thing I must do her the kindness of hearing what s the matter I suppose said Jude in much perplexity As she s going back to morrow it can t make much difference But you can go and see her to morrow Jude Don t go now Jude came in plaintive accents from the doorway Oh it is only to entrap you I know it is as she did before Don t go dear She is such a low passioned woman I can see it in her shape and hear it in her voice But I shall go said Jude Don t attempt to detain me Sue God knows I love her little enough now but I don t want to be cruel to her He turned to the stairs But she s not your wife cried Sue distractedly And I And you are not either dear yet said Jude Oh but are you going to her Don t Stay at home Please please stay at home Jude and not go to her now she s not your wife any more than I Well she is rather more than you come to that he said taking his hat determinedly I ve wanted you to be and I ve waited with the patience of Job and I don t see that I ve got anything by my self denial I shall certainly give her something and hear what it is she is so anxious to tell me no man could do less There was that in his manner which she knew it would be futile to oppose She said no more but turning to her room as meekly as a martyr heard him go downstairs unbolt the door and close it behind him With a woman s disregard of her dignity when in the presence of nobody but herself she also trotted down sobbing articulately as she went She listened She knew exactly how far it was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging It would occupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace seven to come back again If he did not return in fourteen minutes he would have lingered She looked at the clock It was twenty five minutes to eleven He MIGHT enter the inn with Arabella as they would reach it before closing time she might get him to drink with her and Heaven only knew what disasters would befall him then In a still suspense she waited on It seemed as if the whole time had nearly elapsed when the door was opened again and Jude appeared Sue gave a little ecstatic cry Oh I knew I could trust you how good you are she began I can t find her anywhere in this street and I went out in my slippers only She has walked on thinking I ve been so hard hearted as to refuse her requests entirely poor woman I ve come back for my boots as it is beginning to rain Oh but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served you so badly said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment But Sue she s a woman and I once cared for her and one can t be a brute in such circumstances She isn t your wife any longer exclaimed Sue passionately excited You MUSTN T go out to find her It isn t right You CAN T join her now she s a stranger to you How can you forget such a thing my dear dear one She seems much the same as ever an erring careless unreflecting fellow creature he said continuing to pull on his boots What those legal fellows have been playing at in London makes no difference in my real relations to her If she was my wife while she was away in Australia with another husband she s my wife now But she wasn t That s just what I hold There s the absurdity Well you ll come straight back after a few minutes won t you dear She is too low too coarse for you to talk to long Jude and was always Perhaps I am coarse too worse luck I have the germs of every human infirmity in me I verily believe that was why I saw it was so preposterous of me to think of being a curate I have cured myself of drunkenness I think but I never know in what new form a suppressed vice will break out in me I do love you Sue though I have danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns All that s best and noblest in me loves you and your freedom from everything that s gross has elevated me and enabled me to do what I should never have dreamt myself capable of or any man a year or two ago It is all very well to preach about self control and the wickedness of coercing a woman But I should just like a few virtuous people who have condemned me in the past about Arabella and other things to have been in my tantalizing position with you through these late weeks they d believe I think that I have exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your wishes living here in one house and not a soul between us Yes you have been good to me Jude I know you have my dear protector Well Arabella has appealed to me for help I must go out and speak to her Sue at least I can t say any more Oh if you must you must she said bursting out into sobs that seemed to tear her heart I have nobody but you Jude and you are deserting me I didn t know you were like this I can t bear it I can t If she were yours it would be different Or if you were Very well then if I must I must Since you will have it so I agree I will be Only I didn t mean to And I didn t want to marry again either But yes I agree I agree I do love you I ought to have known that you would conquer in the long run living like this She ran across and flung her arms round his neck I am not a cold natured sexless creature am I for keeping you at such a distance I am sure you don t think so Wait and see I do belong to you don t I I give in And I ll arrange for our marriage to morrow or as soon as ever you wish Yes Jude Then I ll let her go said he embracing Sue softly I do feel that it would be unfair to you to see her and perhaps unfair to her She is not like you my darling and never was it is only bare justice to say that Don t cry any more There and there and there He kissed her on one side and on the other and in the middle and rebolted the front door The next morning it was wet Now dear said Jude gaily at breakfast as this is Saturday I mean to call about the banns at once so as to get the first publishing done to morrow or we shall lose a week Banns will do We shall save a pound or two Sue absently agreed to banns But her mind for the moment was running on something else A glow had passed away from her and depression sat upon her features I feel I was wickedly selfish last night she murmured It was sheer unkindness in me or worse to treat Arabella as I did I didn t care about her being in trouble and what she wished to tell you Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling you That s some more of my badness I suppose Love has its own dark morality when rivalry enters in at least mine has if other people s hasn t I wonder how she got on I hope she reached the inn all right poor woman Oh yes she got on all right said Jude placidly I hope she wasn t shut out and that she hadn t to walk the streets in the rain Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to see if she got in I ve been thinking of her all the morning Well is it necessary You haven t the least idea how Arabella is able to shift for herself Still darling if you want to go and inquire you can There was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue would meekly undertake when in a contrite mood and this going to see all sorts of extraordinary persons whose relation to her was precisely of a kind that would have made other people shun them was her instinct ever so that the request did not surprise him And when you come back he added I ll be ready to go about the banns You ll come with me Sue agreed and went off under cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss her freely and returning his kisses in a way she had never done before Times had decidedly changed The little bird is caught at last she said a sadness showing in her smile No only nested he assured her She walked along the muddy street till she reached the public house mentioned by Arabella which was not so very far off She was informed that Arabella had not yet left and in doubt how to announce herself so that her predecessor in Jude s affections would recognize her she sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called naming the place of Jude s residence She was asked to step upstairs and on being shown into a room found that it was Arabella s bedroom and that the latter had not yet risen She halted on the turn of her toe till Arabella cried from the bed Come in and shut the door which Sue accordingly did Arabella lay facing the window and did not at once turn her head and Sue was wicked enough despite her penitence to wish for a moment that Jude could behold her forerunner now with the daylight full upon her She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under the lamps but a frowsiness was apparent this morning and the sight of her own fresh charms in the looking glass made Sue s manner bright till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in her and hated herself for it I ve just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night that s all she said gently I was afraid afterwards that you might have met with any mishap Oh how stupid this is I thought my visitor was your friend your husband missus Fawley as I suppose you call yourself said Arabella flinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss and ceasing to retain the dimple she had just taken the trouble to produce Indeed I don t said Sue Oh I thought you might have even if he s not really yours Decency is decency any hour of the twenty four I don t know what you mean said Sue stiffly He is mine if you come to that He wasn t yesterday Sue coloured roseate and said How do you know From your manner when you talked to me at the door Well my dear you ve been quick about it and I expect my visit last night helped it on ha ha But I don t want to get him away from you Sue looked out at the rain and at the dirty toilet cover and at the detached tail of Arabella s hair hanging on the looking glass just as it had done in Jude s time and wished she had not come In the pause there was a knock at the door and the chambermaid brought in a telegram for missus Cartlett Arabella opened it as she lay and her ruffled look disappeared I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me she said blandly when the maid had gone but it is not necessary you should feel it My man finds he can t do without me after all and agrees to stand by the promise to marry again over here that he has made me all along See here This is in answer to one from me She held out the telegram for Sue to read but Sue did not take it He asks me to come back His little corner public in Lambeth would go to pieces without me he says But he isn t going to knock me about when he has had a drop any more after we are spliced by English law than before As for you I should coax Jude to take me before the parson straight off and have done with it if I were in your place I say it as a friend my dear He s waiting to any day returned Sue with frigid pride Then let him in Heaven s name Life with a man is more businesslike after it and money matters work better And then you see if you have rows and he turns you out of doors you can get the law to protect you which you can t otherwise unless he half runs you through with a knife or cracks your noddle with a poker And if he bolts away from you I say it friendly as woman to woman for there s never any knowing what a man med do you ll have the sticks o furniture and won t be looked upon as a thief I shall marry my man over again now he s willing as there was a little flaw in the first ceremony In my telegram last night which this is an answer to I told him I had almost made it up with Jude and that frightened him I expect Perhaps I should quite have done it if it hadn t been for you she said laughing and then how different our histories might have been from to day Never such a tender fool as Jude is if a woman seems in trouble and coaxes him a bit Just as he used to be about birds and things However as it happens it is just as well as if I had made it up and I forgive you And as I say I d advise you to get the business legally done as soon as possible You ll find it an awful bother later on if you don t I have told you he is asking me to marry him to make our natural marriage a legal one said Sue with yet more dignity It was quite by my wish that he didn t the moment I was free Ah yes you are a oneyer too like myself said Arabella eyeing her visitor with humorous criticism Bolted from your first didn t you like me Good morning I must go said Sue hastily And I too must up and off replied the other springing out of bed so suddenly that the soft parts of her person shook Sue jumped aside in trepidation Lord I am only a woman not a six foot sojer Just a moment dear she continued putting her hand on Sue s arm I really did want to consult Jude on a little matter of business as I told him I came about that more than anything else Would he run up to speak to me at the station as I am going You think not Well I ll write to him about it I didn t want to write it but never mind I will III When Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her at the door to take the initial step towards their marriage She clasped his arm and they went along silently together as true comrades oft times do He saw that she was preoccupied and forbore to question her Oh Jude I ve been talking to her she said at last I wish I hadn t And yet it is best to be reminded of things I hope she was civil Yes I I can t help liking her just a little bit She s not an ungenerous nature and I am so glad her difficulties have all suddenly ended She explained how Arabella had been summoned back and would be enabled to retrieve her position I was referring to our old question What Arabella has been saying to me has made me feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal marriage is a sort of trap to catch a man I can t bear to think of it I wish I hadn t promised to let you put up the banns this morning Oh don t mind me Any time will do for me I thought you might like to get it over quickly now Indeed I don t feel any more anxious now than I did before Perhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious but among the very few virtues possessed by your family and mine dear I think I may set staunchness So I am not a bit frightened about losing you now I really am yours and you really are mine In fact I am easier in my mind than I was for my conscience is clear about Richard who now has a right to his freedom I felt we were deceiving him before Sue you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some grand old civilization whom I used to read about in my bygone wasted classical days rather than a denizen of a mere Christian country I almost expect you to say at these times that you have just been talking to some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra about the latest news of Octavia or Livia or have been listening to Aspasia s eloquence or have been watching Praxiteles chiselling away at his latest Venus while Phryne made complaint that she was tired of posing They had now reached the house of the parish clerk Sue stood back while her lover went up to the door His hand was raised to knock when she said Jude He looked round Wait a minute would you mind He came back to her Just let us think she said timidly I had such a horrid dream one night And Arabella What did Arabella say to you he asked Oh she said that when people were tied up you could get the law of a man better if he beat you and how when couples quarrelled Jude do you think that when you must have me with you by law we shall be so happy as we are now The men and women of our family are very generous when everything depends upon their goodwill but they always kick against compulsion Don t you dread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation Don t you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its gratuitousness Upon my word love you are beginning to frighten me too with all this foreboding Well let s go back and think it over Her face brightened Yes so we will said she And they turned from the clerk s door Sue taking his arm and murmuring as they walked on homeward Can you keep the bee from ranging Or the ring dove s neck from changing No Nor fetter d love They thought it over or postponed thinking Certainly they postponed action and seemed to live on in a dreamy paradise At the end of a fortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced and no banns were announced to the ears of any Aldbrickham congregation Whilst they were postponing and postponing thus a letter and a newspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella Seeing the handwriting Jude went up to Sue s room and told her and as soon as she was dressed she hastened down Sue opened the newspaper Jude the letter After glancing at the paper she held across the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph but he was so absorbed in his letter that he did not turn awhile Look said she He looked and read The paper was one that circulated in South London only and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement of a marriage at saint John s Church Waterloo Road under the names CARTLETT DONN the united pair being Arabella and the inn keeper Well it is satisfactory said Sue complacently Though after this it seems rather low to do likewise and I am glad However she is provided for now in a way I suppose whatever her faults poor thing It is nicer that we are able to think that than to be uneasy about her I ought too to write to Richard and ask him how he is getting on perhaps But Jude s attention was still absorbed Having merely glanced at the announcement he said in a disturbed voice Listen to this letter What shall I say or do THE THREE HORNS LAMBETH DEAR JUDE I won t be so distant as to call you mister Fawley I send to day a newspaper from which useful document you will learn that I was married over again to Cartlett last Tuesday So that business is settled right and tight at last But what I write about more particular is that private affair I wanted to speak to you on when I came down to Aldbrickham I couldn t very well tell it to your lady friend and should much have liked to let you know it by word of mouth as I could have explained better than by letter The fact is Jude that though I have never informed you before there was a boy born of our marriage eight months after I left you when I was at Sydney living with my father and mother All that is easily provable As I had separated from you before I thought such a thing was going to happen and I was over there and our quarrel had been sharp I did not think it convenient to write about the birth I was then looking out for a good situation so my parents took the child and he has been with them ever since That was why I did not mention it when I met you in Christminster nor at the law proceedings He is now of an intelligent age of course and my mother and father have lately written to say that as they have rather a hard struggle over there and I am settled comfortably here they don t see why they should be encumbered with the child any longer his parents being alive I would have him with me here in a moment but he is not old enough to be of any use in the bar nor will be for years and years and naturally Cartlett might think him in the way They have however packed him off to me in charge of some friends who happened to be coming home and I must ask you to take him when he arrives for I don t know what to do with him He is lawfully yours that I solemnly swear If anybody says he isn t call them brimstone liars for my sake Whatever I may have done before or afterwards I was honest to you from the time we were married till I went away and I remain yours c ARABELLA CARTLETT Sue s look was one of dismay What will you do dear she asked faintly Jude did not reply and Sue watched him anxiously with heavy breaths It hits me hard said he in an under voice It MAY be true I can t make it out Certainly if his birth was exactly when she says he s mine I cannot think why she didn t tell me when I met her at Christminster and came on here that evening with her Ah I do remember now that she said something about having a thing on her mind that she would like me to know if ever we lived together again The poor child seems to be wanted by nobody Sue replied and her eyes filled Jude had by this time come to himself What a view of life he must have mine or not mine he said I must say that if I were better off I should not stop for a moment to think whose he might be I would take him and bring him up The beggarly question of parentage what is it after all What does it matter when you come to think of it whether a child is yours by blood or not All the little ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of the time and entitled to our general care That excessive regard of parents for their own children and their dislike of other people s is like class feeling patriotism save your own soul ism and other virtues a mean exclusiveness at bottom Sue jumped up and kissed Jude with passionate devotion Yes so it is dearest And we ll have him here And if he isn t yours it makes it all the better I do hope he isn t though perhaps I ought not to feel quite that If he isn t I should like so much for us to have him as an adopted child Well you must assume about him what is most pleasing to you my curious little comrade he said I feel that anyhow I don t like to leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect Just think of his life in a Lambeth pothouse and all its evil influences with a parent who doesn t want him and has indeed hardly seen him and a stepfather who doesn t know him Let the day perish wherein I was born and the night in which it was said There is a man child conceived That s what the boy MY boy perhaps will find himself saying before long Oh no As I was the petitioner I am really entitled to his custody I suppose Whether or no we must have him I see that I ll do the best I can to be a mother to him and we can afford to keep him somehow I ll work harder I wonder when he ll arrive In the course of a few weeks I suppose I wish When shall we have courage to marry Jude Whenever you have it I think I shall It remains with you entirely dear Only say the word and it s done Before the boy comes Certainly It would make a more natural home for him perhaps she murmured Jude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms to request that the boy should be sent on to them as soon as he arrived making no remark whatever on the surprising nature of Arabella s information nor vouchsafing a single word of opinion on the boy s paternity nor on whether had he known all this his conduct towards her would have been quite the same In the down train that was timed to reach Aldbrickham station about ten o clock the next evening a small pale child s face could be seen in the gloom of a third class carriage He had large frightened eyes and wore a white woollen cravat over which a key was suspended round his neck by a piece of common string the key attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight In the band of his hat his half ticket was stuck His eyes remained mostly fixed on the back of the seat opposite and never turned to the window even when a station was reached and called On the other seat were two or three passengers one of them a working woman who held a basket on her lap in which was a tabby kitten The woman opened the cover now and then whereupon the kitten would put out its head and indulge in playful antics At these the fellow passengers laughed except the solitary boy bearing the key and ticket who regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes seemed mutely to say All laughing comes from misapprehension Rightly looked at there is no laughable thing under the sun Occasionally at a stoppage the guard would look into the compartment and say to the boy All right my man Your box is safe in the van The boy would say Yes without animation would try to smile and fail He was Age masquerading as Juvenility and doing it so badly that his real self showed through crevices A ground swell from ancient years of night seemed now and then to lift the child in this his morning life when his face took a back view over some great Atlantic of Time and appeared not to care about what it saw When the other travellers closed their eyes which they did one by one even the kitten curling itself up in the basket weary of its too circumscribed play the boy remained just as before He then seemed to be doubly awake like an enslaved and dwarfed divinity sitting passive and regarding his companions as if he saw their whole rounded lives rather than their immediate figures This was Arabella s boy With her usual carelessness she had postponed writing to Jude about him till the eve of his landing when she could absolutely postpone no longer though she had known for weeks of his approaching arrival and had as she truly said visited Aldbrickham mainly to reveal the boy s existence and his near home coming to Jude This very day on which she had received her former husband s answer at some time in the afternoon the child reached the London Docks and the family in whose charge he had come having put him into a cab for Lambeth and directed the cabman to his mother s house bade him good bye and went their way On his arrival at the Three Horns Arabella had looked him over with an expression that was as good as saying You are very much what I expected you to be had given him a good meal a little money and late as it was getting dispatched him to Jude by the next train wishing her husband Cartlett who was out not to see him The train reached Aldbrickham and the boy was deposited on the lonely platform beside his box The collector took his ticket and with a meditative sense of the unfitness of things asked him where he was going by himself at that time of night Going to Spring Street said the little one impassively Why that s a long way from here a most out in the country and the folks will be gone to bed I ve got to go there You must have a fly for your box No I must walk Oh well you d better leave your box here and send for it There s a bus goes half way but you ll have to walk the rest I am not afraid Why didn t your friends come to meet ee I suppose they didn t know I was coming Who is your friends Mother didn t wish me to say All I can do then is to take charge of this Now walk as fast as you can Saying nothing further the boy came out into the street looking round to see that nobody followed or observed him When he had walked some little distance he asked for the street of his destination He was told to go straight on quite into the outskirts of the place The child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an impersonal quality the movement of the wave or of the breeze or of the cloud He followed his directions literally without an inquiring gaze at anything It could have been seen that the boy s ideas of life were different from those of the local boys Children begin with detail and learn up to the general they begin with the contiguous and gradually comprehend the universal The boy seemed to have begun with the generals of life and never to have concerned himself with the particulars To him the houses the willows the obscure fields beyond were apparently regarded not as brick residences pollards meadows but as human dwellings in the abstract vegetation and the wide dark world He found the way to the little lane and knocked at the door of Jude s house Jude had just retired to bed and Sue was about to enter her chamber adjoining when she heard the knock and came down Is this where Father lives asked the child Who mister Fawley that s his name Sue ran up to Jude s room and told him and he hurried down as soon as he could though to her impatience he seemed long What is it he so soon she asked as Jude came She scrutinized the child s features and suddenly went away into the little sitting room adjoining Jude lifted the boy to a level with himself keenly regarded him with gloomy tenderness and telling him he would have been met if they had known of his coming so soon set him provisionally in a chair whilst he went to look for Sue whose supersensitiveness was disturbed as he knew He found her in the dark bending over an arm chair He enclosed her with his arm and putting his face by hers whispered What s the matter What Arabella says is true true I see you in him Well that s one thing in my life as it should be at any rate But the other half of him is SHE And that s what I can t bear But I ought to I ll try to get used to it yes I ought Jealous little Sue I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness Never mind Time may right things And Sue darling I have an idea We ll educate and train him with a view to the university What I couldn t accomplish in my own person perhaps I can carry out through him They are making it easier for poor students now you know Oh you dreamer said she and holding his hand returned to the child with him The boy looked at her as she had looked at him Is it you who s my REAL mother at last he inquired Why Do I look like your father s wife Well yes cept he seems fond of you and you of him Can I call you Mother Then a yearning look came over the child and he began to cry Sue thereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise being a harp which the least wind of emotion from another s heart could make to vibrate as readily as a radical stir in her own You may call me Mother if you wish to my poor dear she said bending her cheek against his to hide her tears What s this round your neck asked Jude with affected calmness The key of my box that s at the station They bustled about and got him some supper and made him up a temporary bed where he soon fell asleep Both went and looked at him as he lay He called you Mother two or three times before he dropped off murmured Jude Wasn t it odd that he should have wanted to Well it was significant said Sue There s more for us to think about in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the sky I suppose dear we must pluck up courage and get that ceremony over It is no use struggling against the current and I feel myself getting intertwined with my kind Oh Jude you ll love me dearly won t you afterwards I do want to be kind to this child and to be a mother to him and our adding the legal form to our marriage might make it easier for me IV Their next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made though it was begun on the morning following the singular child s arrival at their home Him they found to be in the habit of sitting silent his quaint and weird face set and his eyes resting on things they did not see in the substantial world His face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene said Sue What is your name dear Did you tell us Little Father Time is what they always called me It is a nickname because I look so aged they say And you talk so too said Sue tenderly It is strange Jude that these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new countries But what were you christened I never was Why was that Because if I died in damnation twould save the expense of a Christian funeral Oh your name is not Jude then said his father with some disappointment The boy shook his head Never heerd on it Of course not said Sue quickly since she was hating you all the time We ll have him christened said Jude and privately to Sue The day we are married Yet the advent of the child disturbed him Their position lent them shyness and having an impression that a marriage at a superintendent registrar s office was more private than an ecclesiastical one they decided to avoid a church this time Both Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district to give notice they had become such companions that they could hardly do anything of importance except in each other s company Jude Fawley signed the form of notice Sue looking over his shoulder and watching his hand as it traced the words As she read the four square undertaking never before seen by her into which her own and Jude s names were inserted and by which that very volatile essence their love for each other was supposed to be made permanent her face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive Names and Surnames of the Parties they were to be parties now not lovers she thought Condition a horrid idea Rank or Occupation Age Dwelling at Length of Residence Church or Building in which the Marriage is to be solemnized District and County in which the Parties respectively dwell It spoils the sentiment doesn t it she said on their way home It seems making a more sordid business of it even than signing the contract in a vestry There is a little poetry in a church But we ll try to get through with it dearest now We will For what man is he that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her Let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her So said the Jewish law giver How you know the Scriptures Jude You really ought to have been a parson I can only quote profane writers During the interval before the issuing of the certificate Sue in her housekeeping errands sometimes walked past the office and furtively glancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch to their union She could not bear its aspect Coming after her previous experience of matrimony all the romance of their attachment seemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same category She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand and fancied that people thought him hers and regarded the intended ceremony as the patching up of an old error Meanwhile Jude decided to link his present with his past in some slight degree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on earth who was associated with his early life at Marygreen the aged widow missus Edlin who had been his great aunt s friend and nurse in her last illness He hardly expected that she would come but she did bringing singular presents in the form of apples jam brass snuffers an ancient pewter dish a warming pan and an enormous bag of goose feathers towards a bed She was allotted the spare room in Jude s house whither she retired early and where they could hear her through the ceiling below honestly saying the Lord s Prayer in a loud voice as the Rubric directed As however she could not sleep and discovered that Sue and Jude were still sitting up it being in fact only ten o clock she dressed herself again and came down and they all sat by the fire till a late hour Father Time included though as he never spoke they were hardly conscious of him Well I bain t set against marrying as your great aunt was said the widow And I hope twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all respects this time Nobody can hope it more knowing what I do of your families which is more I suppose than anybody else now living For they have been unlucky that way God knows Sue breathed uneasily They was always good hearted people too wouldn t kill a fly if they knowed it continued the wedding guest But things happened to thwart em and if everything wasn t vitty they were upset No doubt that s how he that the tale is told of came to do what a did if he WERE one of your family What was that said Jude Well that tale ye know he that was gibbeted just on the brow of the hill by the Brown House not far from the milestone between Marygreen and Alfredston where the other road branches off But Lord twas in my grandfather s time and it medn have been one of your folk at all I know where the gibbet is said to have stood very well murmured Jude But I never heard of this What did this man my ancestor and Sue s kill his wife Twer not that exactly She ran away from him with their child to her friends and while she was there the child died He wanted the body to bury it where his people lay but she wouldn t give it up Her husband then came in the night with a cart and broke into the house to steal the coffin away but he was catched and being obstinate wouldn t tell what he broke in for They brought it in burglary and that s why he was hanged and gibbeted on Brown House Hill His wife went mad after he was dead But it medn t be true that he belonged to ye more than to me A small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside as if out of the earth If I was you Mother I wouldn t marry Father It came from little Time and they started for they had forgotten him Oh it is only a tale said Sue cheeringly After this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of the solemnization they rose and wishing their guest good night retired The next morning Sue whose nervousness intensified with the hours took Jude privately into the sitting room before starting Jude I want you to kiss me as a lover incorporeally she said tremulously nestling up to him with damp lashes It won t be ever like this any more will it I wish we hadn t begun the business But I suppose we must go on How horrid that story was last night It spoilt my thoughts of to day It makes me feel as if a tragic doom overhung our family as it did the house of Atreus Or the house of Jeroboam said the quondam theologian Yes And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying I am going to vow to you in the same words I vowed in to my other husband and you to me in the same as you used to your other wife regardless of the deterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments If you are uneasy I am made unhappy said he I had hoped you would feel quite joyful But if you don t you don t It is no use pretending It is a dismal business to you and that makes it so to me It is unpleasantly like that other morning that s all she murmured Let us go on now They started arm in arm for the office aforesaid no witness accompanying them except the Widow Edlin The day was chilly and dull and a clammy fog blew through the town from Royal tower d Thame On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot marks of people who had entered and in the entry were damp umbrellas Within the office several persons were gathered and our couple perceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was just in progress Sue Jude and the widow stood in the background while this was going on Sue reading the notices of marriage on the wall The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament though to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough Law books in musty calf covered one wall and elsewhere were post office directories and other books of reference Papers in packets tied with red tape were pigeon holed around and some iron safes filled a recess while the bare wood floor was like the door step stained by previous visitors The soldier was sullen and reluctant the bride sad and timid she was soon obviously to become a mother and she had a black eye Their little business was soon done and the twain and their friends straggled out one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue in passing as if he had known them before See the couple just come in Ha ha That fellow is just out of gaol this morning She met him at the gaol gates and brought him straight here She s paying for everything Sue turned her head and saw an ill favoured man closely cropped with a broad faced pock marked woman on his arm ruddy with liquor and the satisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire They jocosely saluted the outgoing couple and went forward in front of Jude and Sue whose diffidence was increasing The latter drew back and turned to her lover her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way to grief Jude I don t like it here I wish we hadn t come The place gives me the horrors it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love I wish it had been at church if it had to be at all It is not so vulgar there Dear little girl said Jude How troubled and pale you look It must be performed here now I suppose No perhaps not necessarily He spoke to the clerk and came back No we need not marry here or anywhere unless we like even now he said We can be married in a church if not with the same certificate with another he ll give us I think Anyhow let us go out till you are calmer dear and I too and talk it over They went out stealthily and guiltily as if they had committed a misdemeanour closing the door without noise and telling the widow who had remained in the entry to go home and await them that they would call in any casual passers as witnesses if necessary When in the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they walked up and down as they had done long ago in the market house at Melchester Now darling what shall we do We are making a mess of it it strikes me Still ANYTHING that pleases you will please me But Jude dearest I am worrying you You wanted it to be there didn t you Well to tell the truth when I got inside I felt as if I didn t care much about it The place depressed me almost as much as it did you it was ugly And then I thought of what you had said this morning as to whether we ought They walked on vaguely till she paused and her little voice began anew It seems so weak too to vacillate like this And yet how much better than to act rashly a second time How terrible that scene was to me The expression in that flabby woman s face leading her on to give herself to that gaol bird not for a few hours as she would but for a lifetime as she must And the other poor soul to escape a nominal shame which was owing to the weakness of her character degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant who scorned her a man whom to avoid for ever was her only chance of salvation This is our parish church isn t it This is where it would have to be if we did it in the usual way A service or something seems to be going on Jude went up and looked in at the door Why it is a wedding here too he said Everybody seems to be on our tack to day Sue said she supposed it was because Lent was just over when there was always a crowd of marriages Let us listen she said and find how it feels to us when performed in a church They stepped in and entered a back seat and watched the proceedings at the altar The contracting couple appeared to belong to the well to do middle class and the wedding altogether was of ordinary prettiness and interest They could see the flowers tremble in the bride s hand even at that distance and could hear her mechanical murmur of words whose meaning her brain seemed to gather not at all under the pressure of her self consciousness Sue and Jude listened and severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form of self committal It is not the same to her poor thing as it would be to me doing it over again with my present knowledge Sue whispered You see they are fresh to it and take the proceedings as a matter of course But having been awakened to its awful solemnity as we have or at least as I have by experience and to my own too squeamish feelings perhaps sometimes it really does seem immoral in me to go and undertake the same thing again with open eyes Coming in here and seeing this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the other did from a registry one We are a weak tremulous pair Jude and what others may feel confident in I feel doubts of my being proof against the sordid conditions of a business contract again Then they tried to laugh and went on debating in whispers the object lesson before them And Jude said he also thought they were both too thin skinned that they ought never to have been born much less have come together for the most preposterous of all joint ventures for THEM matrimony His betrothed shuddered and asked him earnestly if he indeed felt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that life undertaking again It is awful if you think we have found ourselves not strong enough for it and knowing this are proposing to perjure ourselves she said I fancy I do think it since you ask me said Jude Remember I ll do it if you wish own darling While she hesitated he went on to confess that though he thought they ought to be able to do it he felt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she did from their peculiarities perhaps because they were unlike other people We are horribly sensitive that s really what s the matter with us Sue he declared I fancy more are like us than we think Well I don t know The intention of the contract is good and right for many no doubt but in our case it may defeat its own ends because we are the queer sort of people we are folk in whom domestic ties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness Sue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them that all were so Everybody is getting to feel as we do We are a little beforehand that s all In fifty a hundred years the descendants of these two will act and feel worse than we They will see weltering humanity still more vividly than we do now as Shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied and will be afraid to reproduce them What a terrible line of poetry though I have felt it myself about my fellow creatures at morbid times Thus they murmured on till Sue said more brightly Well the general question is not our business and why should we plague ourselves about it However different our reasons are we come to the same conclusion that for us particular two an irrevocable oath is risky Then Jude let us go home without killing our dream Yes How good you are my friend you give way to all my whims They accord very much with my own He gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of everybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession entering the vestry and then they came outside the building By the door they waited till two or three carriages which had gone away for a while returned and the new husband and wife came into the open daylight Sue sighed The flowers in the bride s hand are sadly like the garland which decked the heifers of sacrifice in old times Still Sue it is no worse for the woman than for the man That s what some women fail to see and instead of protesting against the conditions they protest against the man the other victim just as a woman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her when he is only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him Yes some are like that instead of uniting with the man against the common enemy coercion The bride and bridegroom had by this time driven off and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers No don t let s do it she continued At least just now They reached home and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow looking out at them Well cried their guest when they entered I said to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door They made up their minds at last then They briefly hinted that they had not What and ha n t ye really done it Chok it all that I should have lived to see a good old saying like marry in haste and repent at leisure spoiled like this by you two Tis time I got back again to Marygreen sakes if tidden if this is what the new notions be leading us to Nobody thought o being afeard o matrimony in my time nor of much else but a cannon ball or empty cupboard Why when I and my poor man were married we thought no more o t than of a game o dibs Don t tell the child when he comes in whispered Sue nervously He ll think it has all gone on right and it will be better that he should not be surprised and puzzled Of course it is only put off for reconsideration If we are happy as we are what does it matter to anybody V The purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him to express his personal views upon the grave controversy above given That the twain were happy between their times of sadness was indubitable And when the unexpected apparition of Jude s child in the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it had looked but one that brought into their lives a new and tender interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind it rather helped than injured their happiness To be sure with such pleasing anxious beings as they were the boy s coming also brought with it much thought for the future particularly as he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual hopes of childhood But the pair tried to dismiss for a while at least a too strenuously forward view There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls the town may be called Stoke Barehills It stands with its gaunt unattractive ancient church and its new red brick suburb amid the open chalk soiled cornlands near the middle of an imaginary triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham and Wintoncester and the important military station of Quartershot The great western highway from London passes through it near a point where the road branches into two merely to unite again some twenty miles further westward Out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to arise among wheeled travellers before railway days endless questions of choice between the respective ways But the question is now as dead as the scot and lot freeholder the road waggoner and the mail coachman who disputed it and probably not a single inhabitant of Stoke Barehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his town ever meet again for nobody now drives up and down the great western highway dally The most familiar object in Stoke Barehills nowadays is its cemetery standing among some picturesque mediaeval ruins beside the railway the modern chapels modern tombs and modern shrubs having a look of intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy covered decay of the ancient walls On a certain day however in the particular year which has now been reached by this narrative the month being early June the features of the town excite little interest though many visitors arrive by the trains some down trains in especial nearly emptying themselves here It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show whose vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents of an investing army Rows of marquees huts booths pavilions arcades porticoes every kind of structure short of a permanent one cover the green field for the space of a square half mile and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass and make straight for the exhibition ground The way thereto is lined with shows stalls and hawkers on foot who make a market place of the whole roadway to the show proper and lead some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see It is the popular day the shilling day and of the fast arriving excursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute One like several which have preceded it comes from London the other by a cross line from Aldbrickham and from the London train alights a couple a short rather bloated man with a globular stomach and small legs resembling a top on two pegs accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and rather red face dressed in black material and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt that made her glisten as if clad in chain mail They cast their eyes around The man was about to hire a fly as some others had done when the woman said Don t be in such a hurry Cartlett It isn t so very far to the show yard Let us walk down the street into the place Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of furniture or old china It is years since I was here never since I lived as a girl at Aldbrickham and used to come across for a trip sometimes with my young man You can t carry home furniture by excursion train said in a thick voice her husband the landlord of The Three Horns Lambeth for they had both come down from the tavern in that excellent densely populated gin drinking neighbourhood which they had occupied ever since the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither The configuration of the landlord showed that he too like his customers was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed Then I ll get it sent if I see any worth having said his wife They sauntered on but had barely entered the town when her attention was attracted by a young couple leading a child who had come out from the second platform into which the train from Aldbrickham had steamed They were walking just in front of the inn keepers Sakes alive said Arabella What s that said Cartlett Who do you think that couple is Don t you recognize the man No Not from the photos I have showed you Is it Fawley Yes of course Oh well I suppose he was inclined for a little sight seeing like the rest of us Cartlett s interest in Jude whatever it might have been when Arabella was new to him had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies her supernumerary hair coils and her optional dimples were becoming as a tale that is told Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband s as to keep just in the rear of the other three which it was easy to do without notice in such a stream of pedestrians Her answers to Cartlett s remarks were vague and slight for the group in front interested her more than all the rest of the spectacle They are rather fond of one another and of their child seemingly continued the publican THEIR child Tisn t their child said Arabella with a curious sudden covetousness They haven t been married long enough for it to be theirs But although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her to lead her to quash her husband s conjecture she was not disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary mister Cartlett had no other idea than that his wife s child by her first husband was with his grandparents at the Antipodes Oh I suppose not She looks quite a girl They are only lovers or lately married and have the child in charge as anybody can see All continued to move ahead The unwitting Sue and Jude the couple in question had determined to make this agricultural exhibition within twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day s excursion which should combine exercise and amusement with instruction at small expense Not regardful of themselves alone they had taken care to bring Father Time to try every means of making him kindle and laugh like other boys though he was to some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed But they soon ceased to consider him an observer and went along with that tender attention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise and which these among entire strangers as they imagined took less trouble to disguise than they might have done at home Sue in her new summer clothes flexible and light as a bird her little thumb stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade went along as if she hardly touched ground and as if a moderately strong puff of wind would float her over the hedge into the next field Jude in his light grey holiday suit was really proud of her companionship not more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words and ways That complete mutual understanding in which every glance and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence between them made them almost the two parts of a single whole The pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles Arabella and her husband not far behind them When inside the enclosure the publican s wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble with the youngster pointing out and explaining the many objects of interest alive and dead and a passing sadness would touch their faces at their every failure to disturb his indifference How she sticks to him said Arabella Oh no I fancy they are not married or they wouldn t be so much to one another as that I wonder But I thought you said he did marry her I heard he was going to that s all going to make another attempt after putting it off once or twice As far as they themselves are concerned they are the only two in the show I should be ashamed of making myself so silly if I were he I don t see as how there s anything remarkable in their behaviour I should never have noticed their being in love if you hadn t said so You never see anything she rejoined Nevertheless Cartlett s view of the lovers or married pair s conduct was undoubtedly that of the general crowd whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by what Arabella s sharpened vision discerned He s charmed by her as if she were some fairy continued Arabella See how he looks round at her and lets his eyes rest on her I am inclined to think that she don t care for him quite so much as he does for her She s not a particular warm hearted creature to my thinking though she cares for him pretty middling much as much as she s able to and he could make her heart ache a bit if he liked to try which he s too simple to do There now they are going across to the cart horse sheds Come along I don t want to see the cart horses It is no business of ours to follow these two If we have come to see the show let us see it in our own way as they do in theirs Well suppose we agree to meet somewhere in an hour s time say at that refreshment tent over there and go about independent Then you can look at what you choose to and so can I Cartlett was not loath to agree to this and they parted he proceeding to the shed where malting processes were being exhibited and Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue Before however she had regained their wake a laughing face met her own and she was confronted by Anny the friend of her girlhood Anny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance encounter I am still living down there she said as soon as she was composed I am soon going to be married but my intended couldn t come up here to day But there s lots of us come by excursion though I ve lost the rest of em for the present Have you met Jude and his young woman or wife or whatever she is I saw em by now No Not a glimpse of un for years Well they are close by here somewhere Yes there they are by that grey horse Oh that s his present young woman wife did you say Has he married again I don t know She s pretty isn t she Yes nothing to complain of or jump at Not much to depend on though a slim fidgety little thing like that He s a nice looking chap too You ought to ha stuck to un Arabella I don t know but I ought murmured she Anny laughed That s you Arabella Always wanting another man than your own Well and what woman don t I should like to know As for that body with him she don t know what love is at least what I call love I can see in her face she don t And perhaps Abby dear you don t know what she calls love I m sure I don t wish to Ah they are making for the art department I should like to see some pictures myself Suppose we go that way Why if all Wessex isn t here I verily believe There s doctor Vilbert Haven t seen him for years and he s not looking a day older than when I used to know him How do you do Physician I was just saying that you don t look a day older than when you knew me as a girl Simply the result of taking my own pills regular ma am Only two and threepence a box warranted efficacious by the Government stamp Now let me advise you to purchase the same immunity from the ravages of time by following my example Only two and three The physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket and Arabella was induced to make the purchase At the same time continued he when the pills were paid for you have the advantage of me missus Surely not missus Fawley once Miss Donn of the vicinity of Marygreen Yes But missus Cartlett now Ah you lost him then Promising young fellow A pupil of mine you know I taught him the dead languages And believe me he soon knew nearly as much as I I lost him but not as you think said Arabella dryly The lawyers untied us There he is look alive and lusty along with that young woman entering the art exhibition Ah dear me Fond of her apparently They SAY they are cousins Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings I should say Yes So her husband thought no doubt when he divorced her Shall we look at the pictures too The trio followed across the green and entered Jude and Sue with the child unaware of the interest they were exciting had gone up to a model at one end of the building which they regarded with considerable attention for a long while before they went on Arabella and her friends came to it in due course and the inscription it bore was Model of Cardinal College Christminster by J Fawley and S F M Bridehead Admiring their own work said Arabella How like Jude always thinking of colleges and Christminster instead of attending to his business They glanced cursorily at the pictures and proceeded to the band stand When they had stood a little while listening to the music of the military performers Jude Sue and the child came up on the other side Arabella did not care if they should recognize her but they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives as translated into emotion by the military band to perceive her under her beaded veil She walked round the outside of the listening throng passing behind the lovers whose movements had an unexpected fascination for her to day Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed that Jude s hand sought Sue s as they stood the two standing close together so as to conceal as they supposed this tacit expression of their mutual responsiveness Silly fools like two children Arabella whispered to herself morosely as she rejoined her companions with whom she preserved a preoccupied silence Anny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella s hankering interest in her first husband Now said the physician to Arabella apart do you want anything such as this missus Cartlett It is not compounded out of my regular pharmacopoeia but I am sometimes asked for such a thing He produced a small phial of clear liquid A love philtre such as was used by the ancients with great effect I found it out by study of their writings and have never known it to fail What is it made of asked Arabella curiously Well a distillation of the juices of doves hearts otherwise pigeons is one of the ingredients It took nearly a hundred hearts to produce that small bottle full How do you get pigeons enough To tell a secret I get a piece of rock salt of which pigeons are inordinately fond and place it in a dovecot on my roof In a few hours the birds come to it from all points of the compass east west north and south and thus I secure as many as I require You use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take about ten drops of it in his drink But remember all this is told you because I gather from your questions that you mean to be a purchaser You must keep faith with me Very well I don t mind a bottle to give some friend or other to try it on her young man She produced five shillings the price asked and slipped the phial in her capacious bosom Saying presently that she was due at an appointment with her husband she sauntered away towards the refreshment bar Jude his companion and the child having gone on to the horticultural tent where Arabella caught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom She waited a few minutes observing them and then proceeded to join her spouse with no very amiable sentiments She found him seated on a stool by the bar talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had served him with spirits I should think you had enough of this business at home Arabella remarked gloomily Surely you didn t come fifty miles from your own bar to stick in another Come take me round the show as other men do their wives Dammy one would think you were a young bachelor with nobody to look after but yourself But we agreed to meet here and what could I do but wait Well now we have met come along she returned ready to quarrel with the sun for shining on her And they left the tent together this pot bellied man and florid woman in the antipathetic recriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom In the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still lingered in the pavilion of flowers an enchanted palace to their appreciative taste Sue s usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of the tinted roses at which she gazed for the gay sights the air the music and the excitement of a day s outing with Jude had quickened her blood and made her eyes sparkle with vivacity She adored roses and what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that and put her face within an inch of their blooms to smell them I should like to push my face quite into them the dears she had said But I suppose it is against the rules to touch them isn t it Jude Yes you baby said he and then playfully gave her a little push so that her nose went among the petals The policeman will be down on us and I shall say it was my husband s fault Then she looked up at him and smiled in a way that told so much to Arabella Happy he murmured She nodded Why Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural Show or because WE have come You are always trying to make me confess to all sorts of absurdities Because I am improving my mind of course by seeing all these steam ploughs and threshing machines and chaff cutters and cows and pigs and sheep Jude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion But when he had forgotten that he had put the question and because he no longer wished for an answer she went on I feel that we have returned to Greek joyousness and have blinded ourselves to sickness and sorrow and have forgotten what twenty five centuries have taught the race since their time as one of your Christminster luminaries says There is one immediate shadow however only one And she looked at the aged child whom though they had taken him to everything likely to attract a young intelligence they had utterly failed to interest He knew what they were saying and thinking I am very very sorry Father and Mother he said But please don t mind I can t help it I should like the flowers very very much if I didn t keep on thinking they d be all withered in a few days VI The unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began from the day of the suspended wedding onwards to be observed and discussed by other persons than Arabella The society of Spring Street and the neighbourhood generally did not understand and probably could not have been made to understand Sue and Jude s private minds emotions positions and fears The curious facts of a child coming to them unexpectedly who called Jude Father and Sue Mother and a hitch in a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a registrar s office together with rumours of the undefended cases in the law courts bore only one translation to plain minds Little Time for though he was formally turned into Jude the apt nickname stuck to him would come home from school in the evening and repeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him by the other boys and cause Sue and Jude when he heard them a great deal of pain and sadness The result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrar s the pair went off to London it was believed for several days hiring somebody to look to the boy When they came back they let it be understood indirectly and with total indifference and weariness of mien that they were legally married at last Sue who had previously been called missus Bridehead now openly adopted the name of missus Fawley Her dull cowed and listless manner for days seemed to substantiate all this But the mistake as it was called of their going away so secretly to do the business kept up much of the mystery of their lives and they found that they made not such advances with their neighbours as they had expected to do thereby A living mystery was not much less interesting than a dead scandal The baker s lad and the grocer s boy who at first had used to lift their hats gallantly to Sue when they came to execute their errands in these days no longer took the trouble to render her that homage and the neighbouring artizans wives looked straight along the pavement when they encountered her Nobody molested them it is true but an oppressive atmosphere began to encircle their souls particularly after their excursion to the show as if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on them And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from this atmosphere and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and open statements Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too late to be effective The headstone and epitaph orders fell off and two or three months later when autumn came Jude perceived that he would have to return to journey work again a course all the more unfortunate just now in that he had not as yet cleared off the debt he had unavoidably incurred in the payment of the law costs of the previous year One evening he sat down to share the common meal with Sue and the child as usual I am thinking he said to her that I ll hold on here no longer The life suits us certainly but if we could get away to a place where we are unknown we should be lighter hearted and have a better chance And so I am afraid we must break it up here however awkward for you poor dear Sue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of pity and she saddened Well I am not sorry said she presently I am much depressed by the way they look at me here And you have been keeping on this house and furniture entirely for me and the boy You don t want it yourself and the expense is unnecessary But whatever we do wherever we go you won t take him away from me Jude dear I could not let him go now The cloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me I do hope to lift it some day And he loves me so You won t take him away from me Certainly I won t dear little girl We ll get nice lodgings wherever we go I shall be moving about probably getting a job here and a job there I shall do something too of course till till Well now I can t be useful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something else Don t hurry about getting employment he said regretfully I don t want you to do that I wish you wouldn t Sue The boy and yourself are enough for you to attend to There was a knock at the door and Jude answered it Sue could hear the conversation Is mister Fawley at home Biles and Willis the building contractors sent me to know if you ll undertake the relettering of the ten commandments in a little church they ve been restoring lately in the country near here Jude reflected and said he could undertake it It is not a very artistic job continued the messenger The clergyman is a very old fashioned chap and he has refused to let anything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing Excellent old man said Sue to herself who was sentimentally opposed to the horrors of over restoration The Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end the messenger went on and they want doing up with the rest of the wall there since he won t have them carted off as old materials belonging to the contractor in the usual way of the trade A bargain as to terms was struck and Jude came indoors There you see he said cheerfully One more job yet at any rate and you can help in it at least you can try We shall have all the church to ourselves as the rest of the work is finished Next day Jude went out to the church which was only two miles off He found that what the contractor s clerk had said was true The tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of Christian grace as the chief ornament of the chancel end in the fine dry style of the last century And as their framework was constructed of ornamental plaster they could not be taken down for repair A portion crumbled by damp required renewal and when this had been done and the whole cleansed he began to renew the lettering On the second morning Sue came to see what assistance she could render and also because they liked to be together The silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence and standing on a safe low platform erected by Jude which she was nevertheless timid at mounting she began painting in the letters of the first Table while he set about mending a portion of the second She was quite pleased at her powers she had acquired them in the days she painted illumined texts for the church fitting shop at Christminster Nobody seemed likely to disturb them and the pleasant twitter of birds and rustle of October leafage came in through an open window and mingled with their talk They were not however to be left thus snug and peaceful for long About half past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without The old vicar and his churchwarden entered and coming up to see what was being done seemed surprised to discover that a young woman was assisting They passed on into an aisle at which time the door again opened and another figure entered a small one that of little Time who was crying Sue had told him where he might find her between school hours if he wished She came down from her perch and said What s the matter my dear I couldn t stay to eat my dinner in school because they said He described how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother and Sue grieved expressed her indignation to Jude aloft The child went into the churchyard and Sue returned to her work Meanwhile the door had opened again and there shuffled in with a businesslike air the white aproned woman who cleaned the church Sue recognized her as one who had friends in Spring Street whom she visited The church cleaner looked at Sue gaped and lifted her hands she had evidently recognized Jude s companion as the latter had recognized her Next came two ladies and after talking to the charwoman they also moved forward and as Sue stood reaching upward watched her hand tracing the letters and critically regarded her person in relief against the white wall till she grew so nervous that she trembled visibly They went back to where the others were standing talking in undertones and one said Sue could not hear which She s his wife I suppose Some say Yes some say No was the reply from the charwoman Not Then she ought to be or somebody s that s very clear They ve only been married a very few weeks whether or no A strange pair to be painting the Two Tables I wonder Biles and Willis could think of such a thing as hiring those The churchwarden supposed that Biles and Willis knew of nothing wrong and then the other who had been talking to the old woman explained what she meant by calling them strange people The probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was made plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote in a voice that everybody in the church could hear though obviously suggested by the present situation Well now it is a curious thing but my grandfather told me a strange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of the Commandments in a church out by Gaymead which is quite within a walk of this one In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt letters on a black ground and that s how they were out where I say before the owld church was rebuilded It must have been somewhere about a hundred years ago that them Commandments wanted doing up just as ours do here and they had to get men from Aldbrickham to do em Now they wished to get the job finished by a particular Sunday so the men had to work late Saturday night against their will for overtime was not paid then as tis now There was no true religion in the country at that date neither among pa sons clerks nor people and to keep the men up to their work the vicar had to let em have plenty of drink during the afternoon As evening drawed on they sent for some more themselves rum by all account It got later and later and they got more and more fuddled till at last they went a putting their rum bottle and rummers upon the communion table and drawed up a trestle or two and sate round comfortable and poured out again right hearty bumpers No sooner had they tossed off their glasses than so the story goes they fell down senseless one and all How long they bode so they didn t know but when they came to themselves there was a terrible thunder storm a raging and they seemed to see in the gloom a dark figure with very thin legs and a curious voot a standing on the ladder and finishing their work When it got daylight they could see that the work was really finished and couldn t at all mind finishing it themselves They went home and the next thing they heard was that a great scandal had been caused in the church that Sunday morning for when the people came and service began all saw that the Ten Commandments wez painted with the nots left out Decent people wouldn t attend service there for a long time and the Bishop had to be sent for to reconsecrate the church That s the tradition as I used to hear it as a child You must take it for what it is wo th but this case to day has reminded me o t as I say The visitors gave one more glance as if to see whether Jude and Sue had left the nots out likewise and then severally left the church even the old woman at last Sue and Jude who had not stopped working sent back the child to school and remained without speaking till looking at her narrowly he found she had been crying silently Never mind comrade he said I know what it is I can t BEAR that they and everybody should think people wicked because they may have chosen to live their own way It is really these opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless and actually become immoral Never be cast down It was only a funny story Ah but we suggested it I am afraid I have done you mischief Jude instead of helping you by coming To have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating in a serious view of their position However in a few minutes Sue seemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side and wiping her eyes she laughed It is droll after all she said that we two of all people with our queer history should happen to be here painting the Ten Commandments You a reprobate and I in my condition O dear And with her hand over her eyes she laughed again silently and intermittently till she was quite weak That s better said Jude gaily Now we are right again aren t we little girl Oh but it is serious all the same she sighed as she took up the brush and righted herself But do you see they don t think we are married They WON T believe it It is extraordinary I don t care whether they think so or not said Jude I shan t take any more trouble to make them They sat down to lunch which they had brought with them not to hinder time and having eaten it were about to set to work anew when a man entered the church and Jude recognized in him the contractor Willis He beckoned to Jude and spoke to him apart Here I ve just had a complaint about this he said with rather breathless awkwardness I don t wish to go into the matter as of course I didn t know what was going on but I am afraid I must ask you and her to leave off and let somebody else finish this It is best to avoid all unpleasantness I ll pay you for the week all the same Jude was too independent to make any fuss and the contractor paid him and left Jude picked up his tools and Sue cleansed her brush Then their eyes met How could we be so simple as to suppose we might do this said she dropping to her tragic note Of course we ought not I ought not to have come I had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely place and see us Jude returned Well it can t be helped dear and of course I wouldn t wish to injure Willis s trade connection by staying They sat down passively for a few minutes proceeded out of the church and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way to Aldbrickham Fawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education and as was natural with his experiences he was active in furthering equality of opportunity by any humble means open to him He had joined an Artizans Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about the time of his arrival there its members being young men of all creeds and denominations including Churchmen Congregationalists Baptists Unitarians Positivists and others agnostics had scarcely been heard of at this time their one common wish to enlarge their minds forming a sufficiently close bond of union The subscription was small and the room homely and Jude s activity uncustomary acquirements and above all singular intuition on what to read and how to set about it begotten of his years of struggle against malignant stars had led to his being placed on the committee A few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs and before he had obtained any more work to do he went to attend a meeting of the aforesaid committee It was late when he arrived all the others had come and as he entered they looked dubiously at him and hardly uttered a word of greeting He guessed that something bearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted Some ordinary business was transacted and it was disclosed that the number of subscriptions had shown a sudden falling off for that quarter One member a really well meaning and upright man began speaking in enigmas about certain possible causes that it behoved them to look well into their constitution for if the committee were not respected and had not at least in their differences a common standard of CONDUCT they would bring the institution to the ground Nothing further was said in Jude s presence but he knew what this meant and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office there and then Thus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go away And then bills were sent in and the question arose what could Jude do with his great aunt s heavy old furniture if he left the town to travel he knew not whither This and the necessity of ready money compelled him to decide on an auction much as he would have preferred to keep the venerable goods The day of the sale came on and Sue for the last time cooked her own the child s and Jude s breakfast in the little house he had furnished It chanced to be a wet day moreover Sue was unwell and not wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances for he was compelled to stay awhile she acted on the suggestion of the auctioneer s man and ensconced herself in an upper room which could be emptied of its effects and so kept closed to the bidders Here Jude discovered her and with the child and their few trunks baskets and bundles and two chairs and a table that were not in the sale the two sat in meditative talk Footsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs the comers inspecting the goods some of which were of so quaint and ancient a make as to acquire an adventitious value as art Their door was tried once or twice and to guard themselves against intrusion Jude wrote Private on a scrap of paper and stuck it upon the panel They soon found that instead of the furniture their own personal histories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected and intolerable extent by the intending bidders It was not till now that they really discovered what a fools paradise of supposed unrecognition they had been living in of late Sue silently took her companion s hand and with eyes on each other they heard these passing remarks the quaint and mysterious personality of Father Time being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and innuendoes At length the auction began in the room below whence they could hear each familiar article knocked down the highly prized ones cheaply the unconsidered at an unexpected price People don t understand us he sighed heavily I am glad we have decided to go The question is where to It ought to be to London There one can live as one chooses No not London dear I know it well We should be unhappy there Why Can t you think Because Arabella is there That s the chief reason But in the country I shall always be uneasy lest there should be some more of our late experience And I don t care to lessen it by explaining for one thing all about the boy s history To cut him off from his past I have determined to keep silence I am sickened of ecclesiastical work now and I shouldn t like to accept it if offered me You ought to have learnt classic Gothic is barbaric art after all Pugin was wrong and Wren was right Remember the interior of Christminster Cathedral almost the first place in which we looked in each other s faces Under the picturesqueness of those Norman details one can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people trying to imitate the vanished Roman forms remembered by dim tradition only Yes you have half converted me to that view by what you have said before But one can work and despise what one does I must do something if not church gothic I wish we could both follow an occupation in which personal circumstances don t count she said smiling up wistfully I am as disqualified for teaching as you are for ecclesiastical art You must fall back upon railway stations bridges theatres music halls hotels everything that has no connection with conduct I am not skilled in those I ought to take to bread baking I grew up in the baking business with aunt you know But even a baker must be conventional to get customers Unless he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs where people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the quality of the goods Their thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer Now this antique oak settle a unique example of old English furniture worthy the attention of all collectors That was my great grandfather s said Jude I wish we could have kept the poor old thing One by one the articles went and the afternoon passed away Jude and the other two were getting tired and hungry but after the conversation they had heard they were shy of going out while the purchasers were in their line of retreat However the later lots drew on and it became necessary to emerge into the rain soon to take on Sue s things to their temporary lodging Now the next lot two pairs of pigeons all alive and plump a nice pie for somebody for next Sunday s dinner The impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense of the whole afternoon They were Sue s pets and when it was found that they could not possibly be kept more sadness was caused than by parting from all the furniture Sue tried to think away her tears as she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth advanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally knocked down The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer and they were unquestionably doomed to die before the next market day Noting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her and said it was time to go and see if the lodgings were ready He would go on with the boy and fetch her soon When she was left alone she waited patiently but Jude did not come back At last she started the coast being clear and on passing the poulterer s shop not far off she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the door An emotion at sight of them assisted by the growing dusk of evening caused her to act on impulse and first looking around her quickly she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover and went on The cover was lifted from within and the pigeons flew away with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and swearing to the door Sue reached the lodging trembling and found Jude and the boy making it comfortable for her Do the buyers pay before they bring away the things she asked breathlessly Yes I think Why Because then I ve done such a wicked thing And she explained in bitter contrition I shall have to pay the poulterer for them if he doesn t catch them said Jude But never mind Don t fret about it dear It was so foolish of me Oh why should Nature s law be mutual butchery Is it so Mother asked the boy intently Yes said Sue vehemently Well they must take their chance now poor things said Jude As soon as the sale account is wound up and our bills paid we go Where do we go to asked Time in suspense We must sail under sealed orders that nobody may trace us We mustn t go to Alfredston or to Melchester or to Shaston or to Christminster Apart from those we may go anywhere Why mustn t we go there Father Because of a cloud that has gathered over us though we have wronged no man corrupted no man defrauded no man Though perhaps we have done that which was right in our own eyes VII From that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of Aldbrickham Whither they had gone nobody knew chiefly because nobody cared to know Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such an obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that they had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship to enter on a shifting almost nomadic life which was not without its pleasantness for a time Wherever Jude heard of free stone work to be done thither he went choosing by preference places remote from his old haunts and Sue s He laboured at a job long or briefly till it was finished and then moved on Two whole years and a half passed thus Sometimes he might have been found shaping the mullions of a country mansion sometimes setting the parapet of a town hall sometimes ashlaring an hotel at Sandbourne sometimes a museum at Casterbridge sometimes as far down as Exonbury sometimes at Stoke Barehills Later still he was at Kennetbridge a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of Marygreen this being his nearest approach to the village where he was known for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his life and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during his ardent young manhood of study and promise and his brief and unhappy married life at that time At some of these places he would be detained for months at others only a few weeks His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical work both episcopal and noncomformist which had risen in him when suffering under a smarting sense of misconception remained with him in cold blood less from any fear of renewed censure than from an ultra conscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living out of those who would disapprove of his ways also too from a sense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present practice hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first gone up to Christminster now remaining with him He was mentally approaching the position which Sue had occupied when he first met her On a Saturday evening in May nearly three years after Arabella s recognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show some of those who there encountered each other met again It was the spring fair at Kennetbridge and though this ancient trade meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times the long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene about midday At this hour a light trap among other vehicles was driven into the town by the north road and up to the door of a temperance inn There alighted two women one the driver an ordinary country person the other a finely built figure in the deep mourning of a widow Her sombre suit of pronounced cut caused her to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a provincial fair I will just find out where it is Anny said the widow lady to her companion when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came forward and then I ll come back and meet you here and we ll go in and have something to eat and drink I begin to feel quite a sinking With all my heart said the other Though I would sooner have put up at the Chequers or The Jack You can t get much at these temperance houses Now don t you give way to gluttonous desires my child said the woman in weeds reprovingly This is the proper place Very well we ll meet in half an hour unless you come with me to find out where the site of the new chapel is I don t care to You can tell me The companions then went their several ways the one in crape walking firmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous surroundings Making inquiries she came to a hoarding within which were excavations denoting the foundations of a building and on the boards without one or two large posters announcing that the foundation stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that afternoon at three o clock by a London preacher of great popularity among his body Having ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her steps and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair By and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and ginger breads standing between the more pretentious erections of trestles and canvas It was covered with an immaculate cloth and tended by a young woman apparently unused to the business she being accompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face who assisted her Upon my senses murmured the widow to herself His wife Sue if she is so She drew nearer to the stall How do you do missus Fawley she said blandly Sue changed colour and recognized Arabella through the crape veil How are you missus Cartlett she said stiffly And then perceiving Arabella s garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself What you have lost My poor husband Yes He died suddenly six weeks ago leaving me none too well off though he was a kind husband to me But whatever profit there is in public house keeping goes to them that brew the liquors and not to them that retail em And you my little old man You don t know me I expect Yes I do You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit till I found you wasn t replied Father Time who had learned to use the Wessex tongue quite naturally by now All right Never mind I am a friend Juey said Sue suddenly go down to the station platform with this tray there s another train coming in I think When he was gone Arabella continued He ll never be a beauty will he poor chap Does he know I am his mother really No He thinks there is some mystery about his parentage that s all Jude is going to tell him when he is a little older But how do you come to be doing this I am surprised It is only a temporary occupation a fancy of ours while we are in a difficulty Then you are living with him still Yes Married Of course Any children Two And another coming soon I see Sue writhed under the hard and direct questioning and her tender little mouth began to quiver Lord I mean goodness gracious what is there to cry about Some folks would be proud enough It is not that I am ashamed not as you think But it seems such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world so presumptuous that I question my right to do it sometimes Take it easy my dear But you don t tell me why you do such a thing as this Jude used to be a proud sort of chap above any business almost leave alone keeping a standing Perhaps my husband has altered a little since then I am sure he is not proud now And Sue s lips quivered again I am doing this because he caught a chill early in the year while putting up some stonework of a music hall at Quartershot which he had to do in the rain the work having to be executed by a fixed day He is better than he was but it has been a long weary time We have had an old widow friend with us to help us through it but she s leaving soon Well I am respectable too thank God and of a serious way of thinking since my loss Why did you choose to sell gingerbreads That s a pure accident He was brought up to the baking business and it occurred to him to try his hand at these which he can make without coming out of doors We call them Christminster cakes They are a great success I never saw any like em Why they are windows and towers and pinnacles And upon my word they are very nice She had helped herself and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes Yes They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges Traceried windows and cloisters you see It was a whim of his to do them in pastry Still harping on Christminster even in his cakes laughed Arabella Just like Jude A ruling passion What a queer fellow he is and always will be Sue sighed and she looked her distress at hearing him criticized Don t you think he is Come now you do though you are so fond of him Of course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him which I suppose he ll never be cured of believing in He still thinks it a great centre of high and fearless thought instead of what it is a nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid obsequiousness to tradition Arabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking than of what she was saying How odd to hear a woman selling cakes talk like that she said Why don t you go back to school keeping She shook her head They won t have me Because of the divorce I suppose That and other things And there is no reason to wish it We gave up all ambition and were never so happy in our lives till his illness came Where are you living I don t care to say Here in Kennetbridge Sue s manner showed Arabella that her random guess was right Here comes the boy back again continued Arabella My boy and Jude s Sue s eyes darted a spark You needn t throw that in my face she cried Very well though I half feel as if I should like to have him with me But Lord I don t want to take him from ee ever I should sin to speak so profane though I should think you must have enough of your own He s in very good hands that I know and I am not the woman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained I ve reached a more resigned frame of mind Indeed I wish I had been able to do so You should try replied the widow from the serene heights of a soul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority I make no boast of my awakening but I m not what I was After Cartlett s death I was passing the chapel in the street next ours and went into it for shelter from a shower of rain I felt a need of some sort of support under my loss and as twas righter than gin I took to going there regular and found it a great comfort But I ve left London now you know and at present I am living at Alfredston with my friend Anny to be near my own old country I m not come here to the fair to day There s to be the foundation stone of a new chapel laid this afternoon by a popular London preacher and I drove over with Anny Now I must go back to meet her Then Arabella wished Sue good bye and went on VIII In the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down the street Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of persons in broadcloth with hymn books in their hands standing round the excavations for the new chapel walls Arabella Cartlett and her weeds stood among them She had a clear powerful voice which could be distinctly heard with the rest rising and falling to the tune her inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and missus Cartlett having had tea at the Temperance Hotel started on their return journey across the high and open country which stretches between Kennetbridge and Alfredston Arabella was in a thoughtful mood but her thoughts were not of the new chapel as Anny at first surmised No it is something else at last said Arabella sullenly I came here to day never thinking of anybody but poor Cartlett or of anything but spreading the Gospel by means of this new tabernacle they ve begun this afternoon But something has happened to turn my mind another way quite Anny I ve heard of un again and I ve seen HER Who I ve heard of Jude and I ve seen his wife And ever since do what I will and though I sung the hymns wi all my strength I have not been able to help thinking about n which I ve no right to do as a chapel member Can t ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher to day and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way I do But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself Well I know what it is to have a wanton mind o my own too If you on y knew what I do dream sometimes o nights quite against my wishes you d say I had my struggles Anny too had grown rather serious of late her lover having jilted her What shall I do about it urged Arabella morbidly You could take a lock of your late lost husband s hair and have it made into a mourning brooch and look at it every hour of the day I haven t a morsel and if I had twould be no good After all that s said about the comforts of this religion I wish I had Jude back again You must fight valiant against the feeling since he s another s And I ve heard that another good thing for it when it afflicts volupshious widows is to go to your husband s grave in the dusk of evening and stand a long while a bowed down Pooh I know as well as you what I should do only I don t do it They drove in silence along the straight road till they were within the horizon of Marygreen which lay not far to the left of their route They came to the junction of the highway and the cross lane leading to that village whose church tower could be seen athwart the hollow When they got yet farther on and were passing the lonely house in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of their marriage and where the pig killing had taken place she could control herself no longer He s more mine than hers she burst out What right has she to him I should like to know I d take him from her if I could Fie Abby And your husband only six weeks gone Pray against it Be damned if I do Feelings are feelings I won t be a creeping hypocrite any longer so there Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which she had brought with her to distribute at the fair and of which she had given away several As she spoke she flung the whole remainder of the packet into the hedge I ve tried that sort o physic and have failed wi it I must be as I was born Hush You be excited dear Now you come along home quiet and have a cup of tea and don t let us talk about un no more We won t come out this road again as it leads to where he is because it inflames ee so You ll be all right again soon Arabella did calm herself down by degrees and they crossed the ridge way When they began to descend the long straight hill they saw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature and thoughtful gait In his hand he carried a basket and there was a touch of slovenliness in his attire together with that indefinable something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his own housekeeper purveyor confidant and friend through possessing nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him The remainder of the journey was down hill and guessing him to be going to Alfredston they offered him a lift which he accepted Arabella looked at him and looked again till at length she spoke If I don t mistake I am talking to mister Phillotson The wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn Yes my name is Phillotson he said But I don t recognize you ma am I remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at Marygreen and I one of your scholars I used to walk up there from Cresscombe every day because we had only a mistress down at our place and you taught better But you wouldn t remember me as I should you Arabella Donn He shook his head No he said politely I don t recall the name And I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim school child no doubt you were then Well I always had plenty of flesh on my bones However I am staying down here with some friends at present You know I suppose who I married No Jude Fawley also a scholar of yours at least a night scholar for some little time I think And known to you afterwards if I am not mistaken Dear me dear me said Phillotson starting out of his stiffness YOU Fawley s wife To be sure he had a wife And he I understood Divorced her as you did yours perhaps for better reasons Indeed Well he med have been right in doing it right for both for I soon married again and all went pretty straight till my husband died lately But you you were decidedly wrong No said Phillotson with sudden testiness I would rather not talk of this but I am convinced I did only what was right and just and moral I have suffered for my act and opinions but I hold to them though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one You lost your school and good income through her did you not I don t care to talk of it I have recently come back here to Marygreen I mean You are keeping the school there again just as formerly The pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him I am there he replied Just as formerly no Merely on sufferance It was a last resource a small thing to return to after my move upwards and my long indulged hopes a returning to zero with all its humiliations But it is a refuge I like the seclusion of the place and the vicar having known me before my so called eccentric conduct towards my wife had ruined my reputation as a schoolmaster he accepted my services when all other schools were closed against me However although I take fifty pounds a year here after taking above two hundred elsewhere I prefer it to running the risk of having my old domestic experiences raked up against me as I should do if I tried to make a move Right you are A contented mind is a continual feast She has done no better She is not doing well you mean I met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day and she is anything but thriving Her husband is ill and she anxious You made a fool of a mistake about her I tell ee again and the harm you did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right excusing the liberty How She was innocent But nonsense They did not even defend the case That was because they didn t care to She was quite innocent of what obtained you your freedom at the time you obtained it I saw her just afterwards and proved it to myself completely by talking to her Phillotson grasped the edge of the spring cart and appeared to be much stressed and worried by the information Still she wanted to go he said Yes But you shouldn t have let her That s the only way with these fanciful women that chaw high innocent or guilty She d have come round in time We all do Custom does it It s all the same in the end However I think she s fond of her man still whatever he med be of her You were too quick about her I shouldn t have let her go I should have kept her chained on her spirit for kicking would have been broke soon enough There s nothing like bondage and a stone deaf taskmaster for taming us women Besides you ve got the laws on your side Moses knew Don t you call to mind what he says Not for the moment ma am I regret to say Call yourself a schoolmaster I used to think o t when they read it in church and I was carrying on a bit Then shall the man be guiltless but the woman shall bear her iniquity Damn rough on us women but we must grin and put up wi it Haw haw Well she s got her deserts now Yes said Phillotson with biting sadness Cruelty is the law pervading all nature and society and we can t get out of it if we would Well don t you forget to try it next time old man I cannot answer you madam I have never known much of womankind They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston and passing through the outskirts approached a mill to which Phillotson said his errand led him whereupon they drew up and he alighted bidding them good night in a preoccupied mood In the meantime Sue though remarkably successful in her cake selling experiment at Kennetbridge fair had lost the temporary brightness which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success When all her Christminster cakes had been disposed of she took upon her arm the empty basket and the cloth which had covered the standing she had hired and giving the other things to the boy left the street with him They followed a lane to a distance of half a mile till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes and leading a toddler in the other hand Sue kissed the children and said How is he now Still better returned missus Edlin cheerfully Before you are upstairs again your husband will be well enough don t ee trouble They turned and came to some old dun tiled cottages with gardens and fruit trees Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch without knocking and were at once in the general living room Here they greeted Jude who was sitting in an arm chair the increased delicacy of his normally delicate features and the childishly expectant look in his eyes being alone sufficient to show that he had been passing through a severe illness What you have sold them all he said a gleam of interest lighting up his face Yes Arcades gables east windows and all She told him the pecuniary results and then hesitated At last when they were left alone she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella and the latter s widowhood Jude was discomposed What is she living here he said No at Alfredston said Sue Jude s countenance remained clouded I thought I had better tell you she continued kissing him anxiously Yes Dear me Arabella not in the depths of London but down here It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston What is she doing there She told him all she knew She has taken to chapel going Sue added and talks accordingly Well said Jude perhaps it is for the best that we have almost decided to move on I feel much better to day and shall be well enough to leave in a week or two Then missus Edlin can go home again dear faithful old soul the only friend we have in the world Where do you think to go to Sue asked a troublousness in her tones Then Jude confessed what was in his mind He said it would surprise her perhaps after his having resolutely avoided all the old places for so long But one thing and another had made him think a great deal of Christminster lately and if she didn t mind he would like to go back there Why should they care if they were known It was oversensitive of them to mind so much They could go on selling cakes there for that matter if he couldn t work He had no sense of shame at mere poverty and perhaps he would be as strong as ever soon and able to set up stone cutting for himself there Why should you care so much for Christminster she said pensively Christminster cares nothing for you poor dear Well I do I can t help it I love the place although I know how it hates all men like me the so called self taught how it scorns our laboured acquisitions when it should be the first to respect them how it sneers at our false quantities and mispronunciations when it should say I see you want help my poor friend Nevertheless it is the centre of the universe to me because of my early dream and nothing can alter it Perhaps it will soon wake up and be generous I pray so I should like to go back to live there perhaps to die there In two or three weeks I might I think It will then be June and I should like to be there by a particular day His hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories were actually treading its pavements receiving the reflection of the sunshine from its wasting walls Part Sixth AT CHRISTMINSTER AGAIN And she humbled her body greatly and all the places of her joy she filled with her torn hair ESTHER Apoc There are two who decline a woman and I And enjoy our death in the darkness here R BROWNING I On their arrival the station was lively with straw hatted young men welcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their welcomers and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of raiment The place seems gay said Sue Why it is Remembrance Day Jude how sly of you you came to day on purpose Yes said Jude quietly as he took charge of the small child and told Arabella s boy to keep close to them Sue attending to their own eldest I thought we might as well come to day as on any other But I am afraid it will depress you she said looking anxiously at him up and down Oh I mustn t let it interfere with our business and we have a good deal to do before we shall be settled here The first thing is lodgings Having left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded on foot up the familiar street the holiday people all drifting in the same direction Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn off to where accommodation was likely to be found when looking at the clock and the hurrying crowd Jude said Let us go and see the procession and never mind the lodgings just now We can get them afterwards Oughtn t we to get a house over our heads first she asked But his soul seemed full of the anniversary and together they went down Chief Street their smallest child in Jude s arms Sue leading her little girl and Arabella s boy walking thoughtfully and silently beside them Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes and meekly ignorant parents who had known no college in their youth were under convoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion written large on them that no properly qualified human beings had lived on earth till they came to grace it here and now My failure is reflected on me by every one of those young fellows said Jude A lesson on presumption is awaiting me to day Humiliation Day for me If you my dear darling hadn t come to my rescue I should have gone to the dogs with despair She saw from his face that he was getting into one of his tempestuous self harrowing moods It would have been better if we had gone at once about our own affairs dear she answered I am sure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you and do no good Well we are near we will see it now said he They turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch whose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers and pursued the lane till there arose on Jude s sight the circular theatre with that well known lantern above it which stood in his mind as the sad symbol of his abandoned hopes for it was from that outlook that he had finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his great meditation which convinced him at last of the futility of his attempt to be a son of the university To day in the open space stretching between this building and the nearest college stood a crowd of expectant people A passage was kept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber extending from the door of the college to the door of the large building between it and the theatre Here is the place they are just going to pass cried Jude in sudden excitement And pushing his way to the front he took up a position close to the barrier still hugging the youngest child in his arms while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him The crowd filled in at their back and fell to talking joking and laughing as carriage after carriage drew up at the lower door of the college and solemn stately figures in blood red robes began to alight The sky had grown overcast and livid and thunder rumbled now and then Father Time shuddered It do seem like the Judgment Day he whispered They are only learned doctors said Sue While they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and shoulders and the delay grew tedious Sue again wished not to stay They won t be long now said Jude without turning his head But the procession did not come forth and somebody in the crowd to pass the time looked at the facade of the nearest college and said he wondered what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst Jude who stood near the inquirer explained it and finding that the people all round him were listening with interest went on to describe the carving of the frieze which he had studied years before and to criticize some details of masonry in other college fronts about the city The idle crowd including the two policemen at the doors stared like the Lycaonians at Paul for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over any subject in hand and they seemed to wonder how the stranger should know more about the buildings of their town than they themselves did till one of them said Why I know that man he used to work here years ago Jude Fawley that s his name Don t you mind he used to be nicknamed Tutor of saint Slums d ye mind because he aimed at that line o business He s married I suppose then and that s his child he s carrying Taylor would know him as he knows everybody The speaker was a man named Jack Stagg with whom Jude had formerly worked in repairing the college masonries Tinker Taylor was seen to be standing near Having his attention called the latter cried across the barriers to Jude You ve honoured us by coming back again my friend Jude nodded An you don t seem to have done any great things for yourself by going away Jude assented to this also Except found more mouths to fill This came in a new voice and Jude recognized its owner to be Uncle Joe another mason whom he had known Jude replied good humouredly that he could not dispute it and from remark to remark something like a general conversation arose between him and the crowd of idlers during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude if he remembered the Apostles Creed in Latin still and the night of the challenge in the public house But Fortune didn t lie that way threw in Joe Yer powers wasn t enough to carry ee through Don t answer them any more entreated Sue I don t think I like Christminster murmured little Time mournfully as he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd But finding himself the centre of curiosity quizzing and comment Jude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he had no great reason to be ashamed of and in a little while was stimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally It is a difficult question my friends for any young man that question I had to grapple with and which thousands are weighing at the present moment in these uprising times whether to follow uncritically the track he finds himself in without considering his aptness for it or to consider what his aptness or bent may be and re shape his course accordingly I tried to do the latter and I failed But I don t admit that my failure proved my view to be a wrong one or that my success would have made it a right one though that s how we appraise such attempts nowadays I mean not by their essential soundness but by their accidental outcomes If I had ended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black that we saw dropping in here by now everybody would have said See how wise that young man was to follow the bent of his nature But having ended no better than I began they say See what a fool that fellow was in following a freak of his fancy However it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be beaten It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do in one and my impulses affections vices perhaps they should be called were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages who should be as cold blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a really good chance of being one of his country s worthies You may ridicule me I am quite willing that you should I am a fit subject no doubt But I think if you knew what I have gone through these last few years you would rather pity me And if they knew he nodded towards the college at which the dons were severally arriving it is just possible they would do the same He do look ill and worn out it is true said a woman Sue s face grew more emotional but though she stood close to Jude she was screened I may do some good before I am dead be a sort of success as a frightful example of what not to do and so illustrate a moral story continued Jude beginning to grow bitter though he had opened serenely enough I was perhaps after all a paltry victim to the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many unhappy in these days Don t tell them that whispered Sue with tears at perceiving Jude s state of mind You weren t that You struggled nobly to acquire knowledge and only the meanest souls in the world would blame you Jude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm and concluded And what I appear a sick and poor man is not the worst of me I am in a chaos of principles groping in the dark acting by instinct and not after example Eight or nine years ago when I came here first I had a neat stock of fixed opinions but they dropped away one by one and the further I get the less sure I am I doubt if I have anything more for my present rule of life than following inclinations which do me and nobody else any harm and actually give pleasure to those I love best There gentlemen since you wanted to know how I was getting on I have told you Much good may it do you I cannot explain further here I perceive there is something wrong somewhere in our social formulas what it is can only be discovered by men or women with greater insight than mine if indeed they ever discover it at least in our time For who knoweth what is good for man in this life and who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun Hear hear said the populace Well preached said Tinker Taylor And privately to his neighbours Why one of them jobbing pa sons swarming about here that takes the services when our head reverends want a holiday wouldn t ha discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down Hey I ll take my oath not one o em would And then he must have had it wrote down for n And this only a working man As a sort of objective commentary on Jude s remarks there drove up at this moment with a belated doctor robed and panting a cab whose horse failed to stop at the exact point required for setting down the hirer who jumped out and entered the door The driver alighting began to kick the animal in the belly If that can be done said Jude at college gates in the most religious and educational city in the world what shall we say as to how far we ve got Order said one of the policemen who had been engaged with a comrade in opening the large doors opposite the college Keep yer tongue quiet my man while the procession passes The rain came on more heavily and all who had umbrellas opened them Jude was not one of these and Sue only possessed a small one half sunshade She had grown pale though Jude did not notice it then Let us go on dear she whispered endeavouring to shelter him We haven t any lodgings yet remember and all our things are at the station and you are by no means well yet I am afraid this wet will hurt you They are coming now Just a moment and I ll go said he A peal of six bells struck out human faces began to crowd the windows around and the procession of heads of houses and new doctors emerged their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of Jude s vision like inaccessible planets across an object glass As they went their names were called by knowing informants and when they reached the old round theatre of Wren a cheer rose high Let s go that way cried Jude and though it now rained steadily he seemed not to know it and took them round to the theatre Here they stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise of wheels where the quaint and frost eaten stone busts encircling the building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings and in particular at the bedraggled Jude Sue and their children as at ludicrous persons who had no business there I wish I could get in he said to her fervidly Listen I may catch a few words of the Latin speech by staying here the windows are open However beyond the peals of the organ and the shouts and hurrahs between each piece of oratory Jude s standing in the wet did not bring much Latin to his intelligence more than now and then a sonorous word in um or ibus Well I m an outsider to the end of my days he sighed after a while Now I ll go my patient Sue How good of you to wait in the rain all this time to gratify my infatuation I ll never care any more about the infernal cursed place upon my soul I won t But what made you tremble so when we were at the barrier And how pale you are Sue I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side Ah did you He is evidently come up to Jerusalem to see the festival like the rest of us and on that account is probably living not so very far away He had the same hankering for the university that you had in a milder form I don t think he saw me though he must have heard you speaking to the crowd But he seemed not to notice Well suppose he did Your mind is free from worries about him now my Sue Yes I suppose so But I am weak Although I know it is all right with our plans I felt a curious dread of him an awe or terror of conventions I don t believe in It comes over me at times like a sort of creeping paralysis and makes me so sad You are getting tired Sue Oh I forgot darling Yes we ll go on at once They started in quest of the lodging and at last found something that seemed to promise well in Mildew Lane a spot which to Jude was irresistible though to Sue it was not so fascinating a narrow lane close to the back of a college but having no communication with it The little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate buildings within which life was so far removed from that of the people in the lane as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe yet only a thickness of wall divided them Two or three of the houses had notices of rooms to let and the newcomers knocked at the door of one which a woman opened Ah listen said Jude suddenly instead of addressing her What Why the bells what church can that be The tones are familiar Another peal of bells had begun to sound out at some distance off I don t know said the landlady tartly Did you knock to ask that No for lodgings said Jude coming to himself The householder scrutinized Sue s figure a moment We haven t any to let said she shutting the door Jude looked discomfited and the boy distressed Now Jude said Sue let me try You don t know the way They found a second place hard by but here the occupier observing not only Sue but the boy and the small children said civilly I am sorry to say we don t let where there are children and also closed the door The small child squared its mouth and cried silently with an instinct that trouble loomed The boy sighed I don t like Christminster he said Are the great old houses gaols No colleges said Jude which perhaps you ll study in some day I d rather not the boy rejoined Now we ll try again said Sue I ll pull my cloak more round me Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from Caiaphas to Pilate How do I look now dear Nobody would notice it now said Jude There was one other house and they tried a third time The woman here was more amiable but she had little room to spare and could only agree to take in Sue and the children if her husband could go elsewhere This arrangement they perforce adopted in the stress from delaying their search till so late They came to terms with her though her price was rather high for their pockets But they could not afford to be critical till Jude had time to get a more permanent abode and in this house Sue took possession of a back room on the second floor with an inner closet room for the children Jude stayed and had a cup of tea and was pleased to find that the window commanded the back of another of the colleges Kissing all four he went to get a few necessaries and look for lodgings for himself When he was gone the landlady came up to talk a little with Sue and gather something of the circumstances of the family she had taken in Sue had not the art of prevarication and after admitting several facts as to their late difficulties and wanderings she was startled by the landlady saying suddenly Are you really a married woman Sue hesitated and then impulsively told the woman that her husband and herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages after which terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union and lest the conditions of the contract should kill their love yet wishing to be together they had literally not found the courage to repeat it though they had attempted it two or three times Therefore though in her own sense of the words she was a married woman in the landlady s sense she was not The housewife looked embarrassed and went downstairs Sue sat by the window in a reverie watching the rain Her quiet was broken by the noise of someone entering the house and then the voices of a man and woman in conversation in the passage below The landlady s husband had arrived and she was explaining to him the incoming of the lodgers during his absence His voice rose in sudden anger Now who wants such a woman here and perhaps a confinement Besides didn t I say I wouldn t have children The hall and stairs fresh painted to be kicked about by them You must have known all was not straight with em coming like that Taking in a family when I said a single man The wife expostulated but as it seemed the husband insisted on his point for presently a tap came to Sue s door and the woman appeared I am sorry to tell you ma am she said that I can t let you have the room for the week after all My husband objects and therefore I must ask you to go I don t mind your staying over to night as it is getting late in the afternoon but I shall be glad if you can leave early in the morning Though she knew that she was entitled to the lodging for a week Sue did not wish to create a disturbance between the wife and husband and she said she would leave as requested When the landlady had gone Sue looked out of the window again Finding that the rain had ceased she proposed to the boy that after putting the little ones to bed they should go out and search about for another place and bespeak it for the morrow so as not to be so hard driven then as they had been that day Therefore instead of unpacking her boxes which had just been sent on from the station by Jude they sallied out into the damp though not unpleasant streets Sue resolving not to disturb her husband with the news of her notice to quit while he was perhaps worried in obtaining a lodging for himself In the company of the boy she wandered into this street and into that but though she tried a dozen different houses she fared far worse alone than she had fared in Jude s company and could get nobody to promise her a room for the following day Every householder looked askance at such a woman and child inquiring for accommodation in the gloom I ought not to be born ought I said the boy with misgiving Thoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she was not welcome but where at least she had temporary shelter In her absence Jude had left his address but knowing how weak he still was she adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next day II Sue sat looking at the bare floor of the room the house being little more than an old intramural cottage and then she regarded the scene outside the uncurtained window At some distance opposite the outer walls of Sarcophagus College silent black and windowless threw their four centuries of gloom bigotry and decay into the little room she occupied shutting out the moonlight by night and the sun by day The outlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the other and the tower of a third farther off still She thought of the strange operation of a simple minded man s ruling passion that it should have led Jude who loved her and the children so tenderly to place them here in this depressing purlieu because he was still haunted by his dream Even now he did not distinctly hear the freezing negative that those scholared walls had echoed to his desire The failure to find another lodging and the lack of room in this house for his father had made a deep impression on the boy a brooding undemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him The silence was broken by his saying Mother WHAT shall we do to morrow I don t know said Sue despondently I am afraid this will trouble your father I wish Father was quite well and there had been room for him Then it wouldn t matter so much Poor Father It wouldn t Can I do anything No All is trouble adversity and suffering Father went away to give us children room didn t he Partly It would be better to be out o the world than in it wouldn t it It would almost dear Tis because of us children too isn t it that you can t get a good lodging Well people do object to children sometimes Then if children make so much trouble why do people have em Oh because it is a law of nature But we don t ask to be born No indeed And what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother and you needn t have had me unless you liked I oughtn t to have come to ee that s the real truth I troubled em in Australia and I trouble folk here I wish I hadn t been born You couldn t help it my dear I think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they should be killed directly before their souls come to em and not allowed to grow big and walk about Sue did not reply She was doubtfully pondering how to treat this too reflective child She at last concluded that so far as circumstances permitted she would be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties like an aged friend There is going to be another in our family soon she hesitatingly remarked How There is going to be another baby What The boy jumped up wildly Oh God Mother you ve never a sent for another and such trouble with what you ve got Yes I have I am sorry to say murmured Sue her eyes glistening with suspended tears The boy burst out weeping Oh you don t care you don t care he cried in bitter reproach How EVER could you Mother be so wicked and cruel as this when you needn t have done it till we was better off and Father well To bring us all into MORE trouble No room for us and Father a forced to go away and we turned out to morrow and yet you be going to have another of us soon Tis done o purpose tis tis He walked up and down sobbing Y you must forgive me little Jude she pleaded her bosom heaving now as much as the boy s I can t explain I will when you are older It does seem as if I had done it on purpose now we are in these difficulties I can t explain dear But it is not quite on purpose I can t help it Yes it is it must be For nobody would interfere with us like that unless you agreed I won t forgive you ever ever I ll never believe you care for me or Father or any of us any more He got up and went away into the closet adjoining her room in which a bed had been spread on the floor There she heard him say If we children was gone there d be no trouble at all Don t think that dear she cried rather peremptorily But go to sleep The following morning she awoke at a little past six and decided to get up and run across before breakfast to the inn which Jude had informed her to be his quarters to tell him what had happened before he went out She arose softly to avoid disturbing the children who as she knew must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday She found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a counterpoise to the expense of her lodging and she explained to him her homelessness He had been so anxious about her all night he said Somehow now it was morning the request to leave the lodgings did not seem such a depressing incident as it had seemed the night before nor did even her failure to find another place affect her so deeply as at first Jude agreed with her that it would not be worth while to insist upon her right to stay a week but to take immediate steps for removal You must all come to this inn for a day or two he said It is a rough place and it will not be so nice for the children but we shall have more time to look round There are plenty of lodgings in the suburbs in my old quarter of Beersheba Have breakfast with me now you are here my bird You are sure you are well There will be plenty of time to get back and prepare the children s meal before they wake In fact I ll go with you She joined Jude in a hasty meal and in a quarter of an hour they started together resolving to clear out from Sue s too respectable lodging immediately On reaching the place and going upstairs she found that all was quiet in the children s room and called to the landlady in timorous tones to please bring up the tea kettle and something for their breakfast This was perfunctorily done and producing a couple of eggs which she had brought with her she put them into the boiling kettle and summoned Jude to watch them for the youngsters while she went to call them it being now about half past eight o clock Jude stood bending over the kettle with his watch in his hand timing the eggs so that his back was turned to the little inner chamber where the children lay A shriek from Sue suddenly caused him to start round He saw that the door of the room or rather closet which had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she pushed it back was open and that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it Hastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little bed spread on the boards no children were there He looked in bewilderment round the room At the back of the door were fixed two hooks for hanging garments and from these the forms of the two youngest children were suspended by a piece of box cord round each of their necks while from a nail a few yards off the body of little Jude was hanging in a similar manner An overturned chair was near the elder boy and his glazed eyes were slanted into the room but those of the girl and the baby boy were closed Half paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene he let Sue lie cut the cords with his pocket knife and threw the three children on the bed but the feel of their bodies in the momentary handling seemed to say that they were dead He caught up Sue who was in fainting fits and put her on the bed in the other room after which he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a doctor When he got back Sue had come to herself and the two helpless women bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them and the triplet of little corpses formed a sight which overthrew his self command The nearest surgeon came in but as Jude had inferred his presence was superfluous The children were past saving for though their bodies were still barely cold it was conjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour The probability held by the parents later on when they were able to reason on the case was that the elder boy on waking looked into the outer room for Sue and finding her absent was thrown into a fit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the evening before had induced in his morbid temperament Moreover a piece of paper was found upon the floor on which was written in the boy s hand with the bit of lead pencil that he carried Done because we are too menny At sight of this Sue s nerves utterly gave way an awful conviction that her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the tragedy throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no abatement They carried her away against her wish to a room on the lower floor and there she lay her slight figure shaken with her gasps and her eyes staring at the ceiling the woman of the house vainly trying to soothe her They could hear from this chamber the people moving about above and she implored to be allowed to go back and was only kept from doing so by the assurance that if there were any hope her presence might do harm and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of herself lest she should endanger a coming life Her inquiries were incessant and at last Jude came down and told her there was no hope As soon as she could speak she informed him what she had said to the boy and how she thought herself the cause of this No said Jude It was in his nature to do it The doctor says there are such boys springing up amongst us boys of a sort unknown in the last generation the outcome of new views of life They seem to see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying power to resist them He says it is the beginning of the coming universal wish not to live He s an advanced man the doctor but he can give no consolation to Jude had kept back his own grief on account of her but he now broke down and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in some degree distracted her from her poignant self reproach When everybody was gone she was allowed to see the children The boy s face expressed the whole tale of their situation On that little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow which had darkened the first union of Jude and all the accidents mistakes fears errors of the last He was their nodal point their focus their expression in a single term For the rashness of those parents he had groaned for their ill assortment he had quaked and for the misfortunes of these he had died When the house was silent and they could do nothing but await the coroner s inquest a subdued large low voice spread into the air of the room from behind the heavy walls at the back What is it said Sue her spasmodic breathing suspended The organ of the college chapel The organist practising I suppose It s the anthem from the seventy third Psalm Truly God is loving unto Israel She sobbed again Oh oh my babies They had done no harm Why should they have been taken away and not I There was another stillness broken at last by two persons in conversation somewhere without They are talking about us no doubt moaned Sue We are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men Jude listened No they are not talking of us he said They are two clergymen of different views arguing about the eastward position Good God the eastward position and all creation groaning Then another silence till she was seized with another uncontrollable fit of grief There is something external to us which says You shan t First it said You shan t learn Then it said You shan t labour Now it says You shan t love He tried to soothe her by saying That s bitter of you darling But it s true Thus they waited and she went back again to her room The baby s frock shoes and socks which had been lying on a chair at the time of his death she would not now have removed though Jude would fain have got them out of her sight But whenever he touched them she implored him to let them lie and burst out almost savagely at the woman of the house when she also attempted to put them away Jude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her paroxysms Why don t you speak to me Jude she cried out after one of these Don t turn away from me I can t BEAR the loneliness of being out of your looks There dear here I am he said putting his face close to hers Yes Oh my comrade our perfect union our two in oneness is now stained with blood Shadowed by death that s all Ah but it was I who incited him really though I didn t know I was doing it I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of mature age I said the world was against us that it was better to be out of life than in it at this price and he took it literally And I told him I was going to have another child It upset him Oh how bitterly he upbraided me Why did you do it Sue I can t tell It was that I wanted to be truthful I couldn t bear deceiving him as to the facts of life And yet I wasn t truthful for with a false delicacy I told him too obscurely Why was I half wiser than my fellow women And not entirely wiser Why didn t I tell him pleasant untruths instead of half realities It was my want of self control so that I could neither conceal things nor reveal them Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases only in our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps He must have known sooner or later And I was just making my baby darling a new frock and now I shall never see him in it and never talk to him any more My eyes are so swollen that I can scarcely see and yet little more than a year ago I called myself happy We went about loving each other too much indulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other We said do you remember that we would make a virtue of joy I said it was Nature s intention Nature s law and raison d etre that we should be joyful in what instincts she afforded us instincts which civilization had taken upon itself to thwart What dreadful things I said And now Fate has given us this stab in the back for being such fools as to take Nature at her word She sank into a quiet contemplation till she said It is best perhaps that they should be gone Yes I see it is Better that they should be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably Yes replied Jude Some say that the elders should rejoice when their children die in infancy But they don t know Oh my babies my babies could you be alive now You may say the boy wished to be out of life or he wouldn t have done it It was not unreasonable for him to die it was part of his incurably sad nature poor little fellow But then the others my OWN children and yours Again Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and shoes and her figure quivered like a string I am a pitiable creature she said good neither for earth nor heaven any more I am driven out of my mind by things What ought to be done She stared at Jude and tightly held his hand Nothing can be done he replied Things are as they are and will be brought to their destined issue She paused Yes Who said that she asked heavily It comes in the chorus of the Agamemnon It has been in my mind continually since this happened My poor Jude how you ve missed everything you more than I for I did get you To think you should know that by your unassisted reading and yet be in poverty and despair After such momentary diversions her grief would return in a wave The jury duly came and viewed the bodies the inquest was held and next arrived the melancholy morning of the funeral Accounts in the newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers who stood apparently counting the window panes and the stones of the walls Doubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their curiosity Sue had declared that she would follow the two little ones to the grave but at the last moment she gave way and the coffins were quietly carried out of the house while she was lying down Jude got into the vehicle and it drove away much to the relief of the landlord who now had only Sue and her luggage remaining on his hands which he hoped to be also clear of later on in the day and so to have freed his house from the exasperating notoriety it had acquired during the week through his wife s unlucky admission of these strangers In the afternoon he privately consulted with the owner of the house and they agreed that if any objection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there they would try to get its number changed When Jude had seen the two little boxes one containing little Jude and the other the two smallest deposited in the earth he hastened back to Sue who was still in her room and he therefore did not disturb her just then Feeling anxious however he went again about four o clock The woman thought she was still lying down but returned to him to say that she was not in her bedroom after all Her hat and jacket too were missing she had gone out Jude hurried off to the public house where he was sleeping She had not been there Then bethinking himself of possibilities he went along the road to the cemetery which he entered and crossed to where the interments had recently taken place The idlers who had followed to the spot by reason of the tragedy were all gone now A man with a shovel in his hands was attempting to earth in the common grave of the three children but his arm was held back by an expostulating woman who stood in the half filled hole It was Sue whose coloured clothing which she had never thought of changing for the mourning he had bought suggested to the eye a deeper grief than the conventional garb of bereavement could express He s filling them in and he shan t till I ve seen my little ones again she cried wildly when she saw Jude I want to see them once more Oh Jude please Jude I want to see them I didn t know you would let them be taken away while I was asleep You said perhaps I should see them once more before they were screwed down and then you didn t but took them away Oh Jude you are cruel to me too She s been wanting me to dig out the grave again and let her get to the coffins said the man with the spade She ought to be took home by the look o her She is hardly responsible poor thing seemingly Can t dig em up again now ma am Do ye go home with your husband and take it quiet and thank God that there ll be another soon to swage yer grief But Sue kept asking piteously Can t I see them once more just once Can t I Only just one little minute Jude It would not take long And I should be so glad Jude I will be so good and not disobey you ever any more Jude if you will let me I would go home quietly afterwards and not want to see them any more Can t I Why can t I Thus she went on Jude was thrown into such acute sorrow that he almost felt he would try to get the man to accede But it could do no good and might make her still worse and he saw that it was imperative to get her home at once So he coaxed her and whispered tenderly and put his arm round her to support her till she helplessly gave in and was induced to leave the cemetery He wished to obtain a fly to take her back in but economy being so imperative she deprecated his doing so and they walked along slowly Jude in black crape she in brown and red clothing They were to have gone to a new lodging that afternoon but Jude saw that it was not practicable and in course of time they entered the now hated house Sue was at once got to bed and the doctor sent for Jude waited all the evening downstairs At a very late hour the intelligence was brought to him that a child had been prematurely born and that it like the others was a corpse III Sue was convalescent though she had hoped for death and Jude had again obtained work at his old trade They were in other lodgings now in the direction of Beersheba and not far from the Church of Ceremonies Saint Silas They would sit silent more bodeful of the direct antagonism of things than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness Vague and quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days when her intellect scintillated like a star that the world resembled a stanza or melody composed in a dream it was wonderfully excellent to the half aroused intelligence but hopelessly absurd at the full waking that the first cause worked automatically like a somnambulist and not reflectively like a sage that at the framing of the terrestrial conditions there seemed never to have been contemplated such a development of emotional perceptiveness among the creatures subject to those conditions as that reached by thinking and educated humanity But affliction makes opposing forces loom anthropomorphous and those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of Jude and herself fleeing from a persecutor We must conform she said mournfully All the ancient wrath of the Power above us has been vented upon us His poor creatures and we must submit There is no choice We must It is no use fighting against God It is only against man and senseless circumstance said Jude True she murmured What have I been thinking of I am getting as superstitious as a savage But whoever or whatever our foe may be I am cowed into submission I have no more fighting strength left no more enterprise I am beaten beaten We are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men I am always saying that now I feel the same What shall we do You are in work now but remember it may only be because our history and relations are not absolutely known Possibly if they knew our marriage had not been formalized they would turn you out of your job as they did at Aldbrickham I hardly know Perhaps they would hardly do that However I think that we ought to make it legal now as soon as you are able to go out You think we ought Certainly And Jude fell into thought I have seemed to myself lately he said to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the virtuous the men called seducers It amazes me when I think of it I have not been conscious of it or of any wrongdoing towards you whom I love more than myself Yet I am one of those men I wonder if any other of them are the same purblind simple creatures as I Yes Sue that s what I am I seduced you You were a distinct type a refined creature intended by Nature to be left intact But I couldn t leave you alone No no Jude she said quickly Don t reproach yourself with being what you are not If anybody is to blame it is I I supported you in your resolve to leave Phillotson and without me perhaps you wouldn t have urged him to let you go I should have just the same As to ourselves the fact of our not having entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our union We have thereby avoided insulting as it were the solemnity of our first marriages Solemnity Jude looked at her with some surprise and grew conscious that she was not the Sue of their earlier time Yes she said with a little quiver in her words I have had dreadful fears a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action I have thought that I am still his wife Whose Richard s Good God dearest why Oh I can t explain Only the thought comes to me It is your weakness a sick fancy without reason or meaning Don t let it trouble you Sue sighed uneasily As a set off against such discussions as these there had come an improvement in their pecuniary position which earlier in their experience would have made them cheerful Jude had quite unexpectedly found good employment at his old trade almost directly he arrived the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution and outwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which is in itself so grateful after vicissitude People seemed to have forgotten that he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies and he daily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges he could never enter and renewed the crumbling freestones of mullioned windows he would never look from as if he had known no wish to do otherwise There was this change in him that he did not often go to any service at the churches now One thing troubled him more than any other that Sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions since the tragedy events which had enlarged his own views of life laws customs and dogmas had not operated in the same manner on Sue s She was no longer the same as in the independent days when her intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and formalities which he at that time respected though he did not now On a particular Sunday evening he came in rather late She was not at home but she soon returned when he found her silent and meditative What are you thinking of little woman he asked curiously Oh I can t tell clearly I have thought that we have been selfish careless even impious in our courses you and I Our life has been a vain attempt at self delight But self abnegation is the higher road We should mortify the flesh the terrible flesh the curse of Adam Sue he murmured What has come over you We ought to be continually sacrificing ourselves on the altar of duty But I have always striven to do what has pleased me I well deserved the scourging I have got I wish something would take the evil right out of me and all my monstrous errors and all my sinful ways Sue my own too suffering dear there s no evil woman in you Your natural instincts are perfectly healthy not quite so impassioned perhaps as I could wish but good and dear and pure And as I have often said you are absolutely the most ethereal least sensual woman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness Why do you talk in such a changed way We have not been selfish except when no one could profit by our being otherwise You used to say that human nature was noble and long suffering not vile and corrupt and at last I thought you spoke truly And now you seem to take such a much lower view I want a humble heart and a chastened mind and I have never had them yet You have been fearless both as a thinker and as a feeler and you deserved more admiration than I gave I was too full of narrow dogmas at that time to see it Don t say that Jude I wish my every fearless word and thought could be rooted out of my history Self renunciation that s everything I cannot humiliate myself too much I should like to prick myself all over with pins and bleed out the badness that s in me Hush he said pressing her little face against his breast as if she were an infant It is bereavement that has brought you to this Such remorse is not for you my sensitive plant but for the wicked ones of the earth who never feel it I ought not to stay like this she murmured when she had remained in the position a long while Why not It is indulgence Still on the same tack But is there anything better on earth than that we should love one another Yes It depends on the sort of love and yours ours is the wrong I won t have it Sue Come when do you wish our marriage to be signed in a vestry She paused and looked up uneasily Never she whispered Not knowing the whole of her meaning he took the objection serenely and said nothing Several minutes elapsed and he thought she had fallen asleep but he spoke softly and found that she was wide awake all the time She sat upright and sighed There is a strange indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you to night Sue he said I mean not only mentally but about your clothes also A sort of vegetable scent which I seem to know yet cannot remember It is incense Incense I have been to the service at saint Silas and I was in the fumes of it Oh saint Silas Yes I go there sometimes Indeed You go there You see Jude it is lonely here in the weekday mornings when you are at work and I think and think of of my She stopped till she could control the lumpiness of her throat And I have taken to go in there as it is so near Oh well of course I say nothing against it Only it is odd for you They little think what sort of chiel is amang them What do you mean Jude Well a sceptic to be plain How can you pain me so dear Jude in my trouble Yet I know you didn t mean it But you ought not to say that I won t But I am much surprised Well I want to tell you something else Jude You won t be angry will you I have thought of it a good deal since my babies died I don t think I ought to be your wife or as your wife any longer What But you ARE From your point of view but Of course we were afraid of the ceremony and a good many others would have been in our places with such strong reasons for fears But experience has proved how we misjudged ourselves and overrated our infirmities and if you are beginning to respect rites and ceremonies as you seem to be I wonder you don t say it shall be carried out instantly You certainly ARE my wife Sue in all but law What do you mean by what you said I don t think I am Not But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony Would you feel that you were then No I should not feel even then that I was I should feel worse than I do now Why so in the name of all that s perverse my dear Because I am Richard s Ah you hinted that absurd fancy to me before It was only an impression with me then I feel more and more convinced as time goes on that I belong to him or to nobody My good heavens how we are changing places Yes Perhaps so Some few days later in the dusk of the summer evening they were sitting in the same small room downstairs when a knock came to the front door of the carpenter s house where they were lodging and in a few moments there was a tap at the door of their room Before they could open it the comer did so and a woman s form appeared Is mister Fawley here Jude and Sue started as he mechanically replied in the affirmative for the voice was Arabella s He formally requested her to come in and she sat down in the window bench where they could distinctly see her outline against the light but no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her general aspect and air Yet something seemed to denote that she was not quite so comfortably circumstanced nor so bouncingly attired as she had been during Cartlett s lifetime The three attempted an awkward conversation about the tragedy of which Jude had felt it to be his duty to inform her immediately though she had never replied to his letter I have just come from the cemetery she said I inquired and found the child s grave I couldn t come to the funeral thank you for inviting me all the same I read all about it in the papers and I felt I wasn t wanted No I couldn t come to the funeral repeated Arabella who seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of a catastrophic manner fumbled with iterations But I am glad I found the grave As tis your trade Jude you ll be able to put up a handsome stone to em I shall put up a headstone said Jude drearily He was my child and naturally I feel for him I hope so We all did The others that weren t mine I didn t feel so much for as was natural Of course A sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat I had often wished I had mine with me continued missus Cartlett Perhaps twouldn t have happened then But of course I didn t wish to take him away from your wife I am not his wife came from Sue The unexpectedness of her words struck Jude silent Oh I beg your pardon I m sure said Arabella I thought you were Jude had known from the quality of Sue s tone that her new and transcendental views lurked in her words but all except their obvious meaning was naturally missed by Arabella The latter after evincing that she was struck by Sue s avowal recovered herself and went on to talk with placid bluntness about her boy for whom though in his lifetime she had shown no care at all she now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness that was apparently sustaining to the conscience She alluded to the past and in making some remark appealed again to Sue There was no answer Sue had invisibly left the room She said she was not your wife resumed Arabella in another voice Why should she do that I cannot inform you said Jude shortly She is isn t she She once told me so I don t criticize what she says Ah I see Well my time is up I am staying here to night and thought I could do no less than call after our mutual affliction I am sleeping at the place where I used to be barmaid and to morrow I go back to Alfredston Father is come home again and I am living with him He has returned from Australia said Jude with languid curiosity Yes Couldn t get on there Had a rough time of it Mother died of dys what do you call it in the hot weather and Father and two of the young ones have just got back He has got a cottage near the old place and for the present I am keeping house for him Jude s former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good breeding even now that Sue was gone and limited her stay to a number of minutes that should accord with the highest respectability When she had departed Jude much relieved went to the stairs and called Sue feeling anxious as to what had become of her There was no answer and the carpenter who kept the lodgings said she had not come in Jude was puzzled and became quite alarmed at her absence for the hour was growing late The carpenter called his wife who conjectured that Sue might have gone to saint Silas church as she often went there Surely not at this time o night said Jude It is shut She knows somebody who keeps the key and she has it whenever she wants it How long has she been going on with this Oh some few weeks I think Jude went vaguely in the direction of the church which he had never once approached since he lived out that way years before when his young opinions were more mystical than they were now The spot was deserted but the door was certainly unfastened he lifted the latch without noise and pushing to the door behind him stood absolutely still inside The prevalent silence seemed to contain a faint sound explicable as a breathing or a sobbing which came from the other end of the building The floor cloth deadened his footsteps as he moved in that direction through the obscurity which was broken only by the faintest reflected night light from without High overhead above the chancel steps Jude could discern a huge solidly constructed Latin cross as large probably as the original it was designed to commemorate It seemed to be suspended in the air by invisible wires it was set with large jewels which faintly glimmered in some weak ray caught from outside as the cross swayed to and fro in a silent and scarcely perceptible motion Underneath upon the floor lay what appeared to be a heap of black clothes and from this was repeated the sobbing that he had heard before It was his Sue s form prostrate on the paving Sue he whispered Something white disclosed itself she had turned up her face What do you want with me here Jude she said almost sharply You shouldn t come I wanted to be alone Why did you intrude here How can you ask he retorted in quick reproach for his full heart was wounded to its centre at this attitude of hers towards him Why do I come Who has a right to come I should like to know if I have not I who love you better than my own self better far better than you have loved me What made you leave me to come here alone Don t criticize me Jude I can t bear it I have often told you so You must take me as I am I am a wretch broken by my distractions I couldn t BEAR it when Arabella came I felt so utterly miserable I had to come away She seems to be your wife still and Richard to be my husband But they are nothing to us Yes dear friend they are I see marriage differently now My babies have been taken from me to show me this Arabella s child killing mine was a judgement the right slaying the wrong What WHAT shall I do I am such a vile creature too worthless to mix with ordinary human beings This is terrible said Jude verging on tears It is monstrous and unnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no wrong Ah you don t know my badness He returned vehemently I do Every atom and dreg of it You make me hate Christianity or mysticism or Sacerdotalism or whatever it may be called if it s that which has caused this deterioration in you That a woman poet a woman seer a woman whose soul shone like a diamond whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of if they could have known you should degrade herself like this I am glad I had nothing to do with Divinity damn glad if it s going to ruin you in this way You are angry Jude and unkind to me and don t see how things are Then come along home with me dearest and perhaps I shall I am overburdened and you too are unhinged just now He put his arm round her and lifted her but though she came she preferred to walk without his support I don t dislike you Jude she said in a sweet and imploring voice I love you as much as ever Only I ought not to love you any more Oh I must not any more I can t own it But I have made up my mind that I am not your wife I belong to him I sacramentally joined myself to him for life Nothing can alter it But surely we are man and wife if ever two people were in this world Nature s own marriage it is unquestionably But not Heaven s Another was made for me there and ratified eternally in the church at Melchester Sue Sue affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state After converting me to your views on so many things to find you suddenly turn to the right about like this for no reason whatever confounding all you have formerly said through sentiment merely You root out of me what little affection and reverence I had left in me for the Church as an old acquaintance What I can t understand in you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic Is it peculiar to you or is it common to woman Is a woman a thinking unit at all or a fraction always wanting its integer How you argued that marriage was only a clumsy contract which it is how you showed all the objections to it all the absurdities If two and two made four when we were happy together surely they make four now I can t understand it I repeat Ah dear Jude that s because you are like a totally deaf man observing people listening to music You say What are they regarding Nothing is there But something is That is a hard saying from you and not a true parallel You threw off old husks of prejudices and taught me to do it and now you go back upon yourself I confess I am utterly stultified in my estimate of you Dear friend my only friend don t be hard with me I can t help being as I am I am convinced I am right that I see the light at last But oh how to profit by it They walked along a few more steps till they were outside the building and she had returned the key Can this be the girl said Jude when she came back feeling a slight renewal of elasticity now that he was in the open street can this be the girl who brought the pagan deities into this most Christian city who mimicked Miss Fontover when she crushed them with her heel quoted Gibbon and Shelley and Mill Where are dear Apollo and dear Venus now Oh don t don t be so cruel to me Jude and I so unhappy she sobbed I can t bear it I was in error I cannot reason with you I was wrong proud in my own conceit Arabella s coming was the finish Don t satirize me it cuts like a knife He flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately there in the silent street before she could hinder him They went on till they came to a little coffee house Jude she said with suppressed tears would you mind getting a lodging here I will if if you really wish But do you Let me go to our door and understand you He went and conducted her in She said she wanted no supper and went in the dark upstairs and struck a light Turning she found that Jude had followed her and was standing at the chamber door She went to him put her hand in his and said Good night But Sue Don t we live here You said you would do as I wished Yes Very well Perhaps it was wrong of me to argue distastefully as I have done Perhaps as we couldn t conscientiously marry at first in the old fashioned way we ought to have parted Perhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as ours Who were we to think we could act as pioneers I am so glad you see that much at any rate I never deliberately meant to do as I did I slipped into my false position through jealousy and agitation But surely through love you loved me Yes But I wanted to let it stop there and go on always as mere lovers until But people in love couldn t live for ever like that Women could men can t because they won t An average woman is in this superior to an average man that she never instigates only responds We ought to have lived in mental communion and no more I was the unhappy cause of the change as I have said before Well as you will But human nature can t help being itself Oh yes that s just what it has to learn self mastery I repeat if either were to blame it was not you but I No it was I Your wickedness was only the natural man s desire to possess the woman Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy stimulated me to oust Arabella I had thought I ought in charity to let you approach me that it was damnably selfish to torture you as I did my other friend But I shouldn t have given way if you hadn t broken me down by making me fear you would go back to her But don t let us say any more about it Jude will you leave me to myself now Yes But Sue my wife as you are he burst out my old reproach to you was after all a true one You have never loved me as I love you never never Yours is not a passionate heart your heart does not burn in a flame You are upon the whole a sort of fay or sprite not a woman At first I did not love you Jude that I own When I first knew you I merely wanted you to love me I did not exactly flirt with you but that inborn craving which undermines some women s morals almost more than unbridled passion the craving to attract and captivate regardless of the injury it may do the man was in me and when I found I had caught you I was frightened And then I don t know how it was I couldn t bear to let you go possibly to Arabella again and so I got to love you Jude But you see however fondly it ended it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me Ah yes The further I flounder the more harm I do O Sue said he with a sudden sense of his own danger Do not do an immoral thing for moral reasons You have been my social salvation Stay with me for humanity s sake You know what a weak fellow I am My two arch enemies you know my weakness for womankind and my impulse to strong liquor Don t abandon me to them Sue to save your own soul only They have been kept entirely at a distance since you became my guardian angel Since I have had you I have been able to go into any temptations of the sort without risk Isn t my safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle I am in terror lest if you leave me it will be with me another case of the pig that was washed turning back to his wallowing in the mire Sue burst out weeping Oh but you must not Jude You won t I ll pray for you night and day Well never mind don t grieve said Jude generously I did suffer God knows about you at that time and now I suffer again But perhaps not so much as you The woman mostly gets the worst of it in the long run She does Unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible And this one is not that anyhow Sue drew a nervous breath or two She is I fear Now Jude good night please I mustn t stay Not just once more As it has been so many times O Sue my wife why not No no not wife I am in your hands Jude don t tempt me back now I have advanced so far Very well I do your bidding I owe that to you darling in penance for how I overruled it at the first time My God how selfish I was Perhaps perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and purest loves that ever existed between man and woman Then let the veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour He went to the bed removed one of the pair of pillows thereon and flung it to the floor Sue looked at him and bending over the bed rail wept silently You don t see that it is a matter of conscience with me and not of dislike to you she brokenly murmured Dislike to you But I can t say any more it breaks my heart it will be undoing all I have begun Jude good night Good night he said and turned to go Oh but you shall kiss me said she starting up I can t bear He clasped her and kissed her weeping face as he had scarcely ever done before and they remained in silence till she said Good bye good bye And then gently pressing him away she got free trying to mitigate the sadness by saying We ll be dear friends just the same Jude won t we And we ll see each other sometimes yes and forget all this and try to be as we were long ago Jude did not permit himself to speak but turned and descended the stairs IV The man whom Sue in her mental volte face was now regarding as her inseparable husband lived still at Marygreen On the day before the tragedy of the children Phillotson had seen both her and Jude as they stood in the rain at Christminster watching the procession to the theatre But he had said nothing of it at the moment to his companion Gillingham who being an old friend was staying with him at the village aforesaid and had indeed suggested the day s trip to Christminster What are you thinking of said Gillingham as they went home The university degree you never obtained No no said Phillotson gruffly Of somebody I saw to day In a moment he added Susanna I saw her too You said nothing I didn t wish to draw your attention to her But as you did see her you should have said How d ye do my dear that was Ah well I might have But what do you think of this I have good reason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her that I was all wrong Yes indeed Awkward isn t it She has taken care to set you right since anyhow apparently H m That s a cheap sneer I ought to have waited unquestionably At the end of the week when Gillingham had gone back to his school near Shaston Phillotson as was his custom went to Alfredston market ruminating again on Arabella s intelligence as he walked down the long hill which he had known before Jude knew it though his history had not beaten so intensely upon its incline Arrived in the town he bought his usual weekly local paper and when he had sat down in an inn to refresh himself for the five miles walk back he pulled the paper from his pocket and read awhile The account of the strange suicide of a stone mason s children met his eye Unimpassioned as he was it impressed him painfully and puzzled him not a little for he could not understand the age of the elder child being what it was stated to be However there was no doubt that the newspaper report was in some way true Their cup of sorrow is now full he said and thought and thought of Sue and what she had gained by leaving him Arabella having made her home at Alfredston and the schoolmaster coming to market there every Saturday it was not wonderful that in a few weeks they met again the precise time being just after her return from Christminster where she had stayed much longer than she had at first intended keeping an interested eye on Jude though Jude had seen no more of her Phillotson was on his way homeward when he encountered Arabella and she was approaching the town You like walking out this way missus Cartlett he said I ve just begun to again she replied It is where I lived as maid and wife and all the past things of my life that are interesting to my feelings are mixed up with this road And they have been stirred up in me too lately for I ve been visiting at Christminster Yes I ve seen Jude Ah How do they bear their terrible affliction In a ve ry strange way ve ry strange She don t live with him any longer I only heard of it as a certainty just before I left though I had thought things were drifting that way from their manner when I called on them Not live with her husband Why I should have thought twould have united them more He s not her husband after all She has never really married him although they have passed as man and wife so long And now instead of this sad event making em hurry up and get the thing done legally she s took in a queer religious way just as I was in my affliction at losing Cartlett only hers is of a more sterical sort than mine And she says so I was told that she s your wife in the eye of Heaven and the Church yours only and can t be anybody else s by any act of man Ah indeed Separated have they You see the eldest boy was mine Oh yours Yes poor little fellow born in lawful wedlock thank God And perhaps she feels over and above other things that I ought to have been in her place I can t say However as for me I am soon off from here I ve got Father to look after now and we can t live in such a hum drum place as this I hope soon to be in a bar again at Christminster or some other big town They parted When Phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he stopped hastened back and called her What is or was their address Arabella gave it Thank you Good afternoon Arabella smiled grimly as she resumed her way and practised dimple making all along the road from where the pollard willows begin to the old almshouses in the first street of the town Meanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen and for the first time during a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye On crossing under the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which he had been reduced he stood a moment and pictured Sue coming out of the door to meet him No man had ever suffered more inconvenience from his own charity Christian or heathen than Phillotson had done in letting Sue go He had been knocked about from pillar to post at the hands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance he had been nearly starved and was now dependent entirely upon the very small stipend from the school of this village where the parson had got ill spoken of for befriending him He had often thought of Arabella s remarks that he should have been more severe with Sue that her recalcitrant spirit would soon have been broken Yet such was his obstinate and illogical disregard of opinion and of the principles in which he had been trained that his convictions on the rightness of his course with his wife had not been disturbed Principles which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were liable to the same catastrophe in another The instincts which had allowed him to give Sue her liberty now enabled him to regard her as none the worse for her life with Jude He wished for her still in his curious way if he did not love her and apart from policy soon felt that he would be gratified to have her again as his always provided that she came willingly But artifice was necessary he had found for stemming the cold and inhumane blast of the world s contempt And here were the materials ready made By getting Sue back and remarrying her on the respectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her and gained his divorce wrongfully he might acquire some comfort resume his old courses perhaps return to the Shaston school if not even to the Church as a licentiate He thought he would write to Gillingham to inquire his views and what he thought of his Phillotson s sending a letter to her Gillingham replied naturally that now she was gone it were best to let her be and considered that if she were anybody s wife she was the wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed such tragical adventures Probably as his attachment to her seemed unusually strong the singular pair would make their union legal in course of time and all would be well and decent and in order But they won t Sue won t exclaimed Phillotson to himself Gillingham is so matter of fact She s affected by Christminster sentiment and teaching I can see her views on the indissolubility of marriage well enough and I know where she got them They are not mine but I shall make use of them to further mine He wrote a brief reply to Gillingham I know I am entirely wrong but I don t agree with you As to her having lived with and had three children by him my feeling is though I can advance no logical or moral defence of it on the old lines that it has done little more than finish her education I shall write to her and learn whether what that woman said is true or no As he had made up his mind to do this before he had written to his friend there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at all However it was Phillotson s way to act thus He accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue and knowing her emotional temperament threw a Rhadamanthine strictness into the lines here and there carefully hiding his heterodox feelings not to frighten her He stated that it having come to his knowledge that her views had considerably changed he felt compelled to say that his own too were largely modified by events subsequent to their parting He would not conceal from her that passionate love had little to do with his communication It arose from a wish to make their lives if not a success at least no such disastrous failure as they threatened to become through his acting on what he had considered at the time a principle of justice charity and reason To indulge one s instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and right was not he had found permitted with impunity in an old civilization like ours It was necessary to act under an acquired and cultivated sense of the same if you wished to enjoy an average share of comfort and honour and to let crude loving kindness take care of itself He suggested that she should come to him there at Marygreen On second thoughts he took out the last paragraph but one and having rewritten the letter he dispatched it immediately and in some excitement awaited the issue A few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped the Beersheba suburb of Christminster towards the quarter in which Jude Fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from Sue A timid knock sounded upon the door of his abode It was evening so he was at home and by a species of divination he jumped up and rushed to the door himself Will you come out with me I would rather not come in I want to to talk with you and to go with you to the cemetery It had been in the trembling accents of Sue that these words came Jude put on his hat It is dreary for you to be out he said But if you prefer not to come in I don t mind Yes I do I shall not keep you long Jude was too much affected to go on talking at first she too was now such a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed to have left her and they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic shades for a long while without sound or gesture I want to tell you she presently said her voice now quick now slow so that you may not hear of it by chance I am going back to Richard He has so magnanimously agreed to forgive all Going back How can you go He is going to marry me again That is for form s sake and to satisfy the world which does not see things as they are But of course I AM his wife already Nothing has changed that He turned upon her with an anguish that was well nigh fierce But you are MY wife Yes you are You know it I have always regretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come back legally married to save appearances I loved you and you loved me and we closed with each other and that made the marriage We still love you as well as I KNOW it Sue Therefore our marriage is not cancelled Yes I know how you see it she answered with despairing self suppression But I am going to marry him again as it would be called by you Strictly speaking you too don t mind my saying it Jude you should take back Arabella I should Good God what next But how if you and I had married legally as we were on the point of doing I should have felt just the same that ours was not a marriage And I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament if he asked me But the world and its ways have a certain worth I suppose therefore I concede a repetition of the ceremony Don t crush all the life out of me by satire and argument I implore you I was strongest once I know and perhaps I treated you cruelly But Jude return good for evil I am the weaker now Don t retaliate upon me but be kind Oh be kind to me a poor wicked woman who is trying to mend He shook his head hopelessly his eyes wet The blow of her bereavement seemed to have destroyed her reasoning faculty The once keen vision was dimmed All wrong all wrong he said huskily Error perversity It drives me out of my senses Do you care for him Do you love him You know you don t It will be a fanatic prostitution God forgive me yes that s what it will be I don t love him I must must own it in deepest remorse But I shall try to learn to love him by obeying him Jude argued urged implored but her conviction was proof against all It seemed to be the one thing on earth on which she was firm and that her firmness in this had left her tottering in every other impulse and wish she possessed I have been considerate enough to let you know the whole truth and to tell it you myself she said in cut tones that you might not consider yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand I have even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him I did not think you would be so rough with me for doing so I was going to ask you To give you away No To send my boxes to me if you would But I suppose you won t Why of course I will What isn t he coming to fetch you to marry you from here He won t condescend to do that No I won t let him I go to him voluntarily just as I went away from him We are to be married at his little church at Marygreen She was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong headedness that Jude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of her I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances as you Sue No sooner does one expect you to go straight on as the one rational proceeding than you double round the corner Ah well let that go Jude I must say good bye But I wanted you to go to the cemetery with me Let our farewell be there beside the graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my views They turned in the direction of the place and the gate was opened to them on application Sue had been there often and she knew the way to the spot in the dark They reached it and stood still It is here I should like to part said she So be it Don t think me hard because I have acted on conviction Your generous devotion to me is unparalleled Jude Your worldly failure if you have failed is to your credit rather than to your blame Remember that the best and greatest among mankind are those who do themselves no worldly good Every successful man is more or less a selfish man The devoted fail Charity seeketh not her own In that chapter we are at one ever beloved darling and on it we ll part friends Its verses will stand fast when all the rest that you call religion has passed away Well don t discuss it Good bye Jude my fellow sinner and kindest friend Good bye my mistaken wife Good bye V The next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all things Sue s slim shape was only just discernible going towards the station Jude had no heart to go to his work that day Neither could he go anywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass He went in an opposite one to a dreary strange flat scene where boughs dripped and coughs and consumption lurked and where he had never been before Sue s gone from me gone he murmured miserably She in the meantime had left by the train and reached Alfredston Road where she entered the steam tram and was conveyed into the town It had been her request to Phillotson that he should not meet her She wished she said to come to him voluntarily to his very house and hearthstone It was Friday evening which had been chosen because the schoolmaster was disengaged at four o clock that day till the Monday morning following The little car she hired at the Bear to drive her to Marygreen set her down at the end of the lane half a mile from the village by her desire and preceded her to the schoolhouse with such portion of her luggage as she had brought On its return she encountered it and asked the driver if he had found the master s house open The man informed her that he had and that her things had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself She could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation She crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school on the other side and lifted the latch of the dwelling without knocking Phillotson stood in the middle of the room awaiting her as requested I ve come Richard said she looking pale and shaken and sinking into a chair I cannot believe you forgive your wife Everything darling Susanna said Phillotson She started at the endearment though it had been spoken advisedly without fervour Then she nerved herself again My children are dead and it is right that they should be I am glad almost They were sin begotten They were sacrificed to teach me how to live Their death was the first stage of my purification That s why they have not died in vain You will take me back He was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone that he did more than he had meant to do He bent and kissed her cheek Sue imperceptibly shrank away her flesh quivering under the touch of his lips Phillotson s heart sank for desire was renascent in him You still have an aversion to me Oh no dear I have been driving through the damp and I was chilly she said with a hurried smile of apprehension When are we going to have the marriage Soon To morrow morning early I thought if you really wish I am sending round to the vicar to let him know you are come I have told him all and he highly approves he says it will bring our lives to a triumphant and satisfactory issue But are you sure of yourself It is not too late to refuse now if you think you can t bring yourself to it you know Yes yes I can I want it done quick Tell him tell him at once My strength is tried by the undertaking I can t wait long Have something to eat and drink then and go over to your room at missus Edlin s I ll tell the vicar half past eight to morrow before anybody is about if that s not too soon for you My friend Gillingham is here to help us in the ceremony He s been good enough to come all the way from Shaston at great inconvenience to himself Unlike a woman in ordinary whose eye is so keen for material things Sue seemed to see nothing of the room they were in or any detail of her environment But on moving across the parlour to put down her muff she uttered a little Oh and grew paler than before Her look was that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin What said Phillotson The flap of the bureau chanced to be open and in placing her muff upon it her eye had caught a document which lay there Oh only a funny surprise she said trying to laugh away her cry as she came back to the table Ah Yes said Phillotson The licence It has just come Gillingham now joined them from his room above and Sue nervously made herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought likely to interest him except herself though that interested him most of all She obediently ate some supper and prepared to leave for her lodging hard by Phillotson crossed the green with her bidding her good night at missus Edlin s door The old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters and helped her to unpack Among other things she laid out a night gown tastefully embroidered Oh I didn t know THAT was put in said Sue quickly I didn t mean it to be Here is a different one She handed a new and absolutely plain garment of coarse and unbleached calico But this is the prettiest said missus Edlin That one is no better than very sackcloth o Scripture Yes I meant it to be Give me the other She took it and began rending it with all her might the tears resounding through the house like a screech owl But my dear dear whatever It is adulterous It signifies what I don t feel I bought it long ago to please Jude It must be destroyed missus Edlin lifted her hands and Sue excitedly continued to tear the linen into strips laying the pieces in the fire You med ha give it to me said the widow It do make my heart ache to see such pretty open work as that a burned by the flames not that ornamental night rails can be much use to a ould ooman like I My days for such be all past and gone It is an accursed thing it reminds me of what I want to forget Sue repeated It is only fit for the fire Lord you be too strict What do ye use such words for and condemn to hell your dear little innocent children that s lost to ee Upon my life I don t call that religion Sue flung her face upon the bed sobbing Oh don t don t That kills me She remained shaken with her grief and slipped down upon her knees I ll tell ee what you ought not to marry this man again said missus Edlin indignantly You are in love wi t other still Yes I must I am his already Pshoo You be t other man s If you didn t like to commit yourselves to the binding vow again just at first twas all the more credit to your consciences considering your reasons and you med ha lived on and made it all right at last After all it concerned nobody but your own two selves Richard says he ll have me back and I m bound to go If he had refused it might not have been so much my duty to give up Jude But She remained with her face in the bed clothes and missus Edlin left the room Phillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend Gillingham who still sat over the supper table They soon rose and walked out on the green to smoke awhile A light was burning in Sue s room a shadow moving now and then across the blind Gillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of Sue and after a silence he said Well you ve all but got her again at last She can t very well go a second time The pear has dropped into your hand Yes I suppose I am right in taking her at her word I confess there seems a touch of selfishness in it Apart from her being what she is of course a luxury for a fogy like me it will set me right in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity who have never forgiven me for letting her go So I may get back in some degree into my old track Well if you ve got any sound reason for marrying her again do it now in God s name I was always against your opening the cage door and letting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way You might have been a school inspector by this time or a reverend if you hadn t been so weak about her I did myself irreparable damage I know it Once you ve got her housed again stick to her Phillotson was more evasive to night He did not care to admit clearly that his taking Sue to him again had at bottom nothing to do with repentance of letting her go but was primarily a human instinct flying in the face of custom and profession He said Yes I shall do that I know woman better now Whatever justice there was in releasing her there was little logic for one holding my views on other subjects Gillingham looked at him and wondered whether it would ever happen that the reactionary spirit induced by the world s sneers and his own physical wishes would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her than he had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind I perceive it won t do to give way to impulse Phillotson resumed feeling more and more every minute the necessity of acting up to his position I flew in the face of the Church s teaching but I did it without malice prepense Women are so strange in their influence that they tempt you to misplaced kindness However I know myself better now A little judicious severity perhaps Yes but you must tighten the reins by degrees only Don t be too strenuous at first She ll come to any terms in time The caution was unnecessary though Phillotson did not say so I remember what my vicar at Shaston said when I left after the row that was made about my agreeing to her elopement The only thing you can do to retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error in not restraining her with a wise and strong hand and to get her back again if she ll come and be firm in the future But I was so headstrong at that time that I paid no heed And that after the divorce she should have thought of doing so I did not dream The gate of missus Edlin s cottage clicked and somebody began crossing in the direction of the school Phillotson said Good night Oh is that mister Phillotson said missus Edlin I was going over to see ee I ve been upstairs with her helping her to unpack her things and upon my word sir I don t think this ought to be What the wedding Yes She s forcing herself to it poor dear little thing and you ve no notion what she s suffering I was never much for religion nor against it but it can t be right to let her do this and you ought to persuade her out of it Of course everybody will say it was very good and forgiving of ee to take her to ee again But for my part I don t It s her wish and I am willing said Phillotson with grave reserve opposition making him illogically tenacious now A great piece of laxity will be rectified I don t believe it She s his wife if anybody s She s had three children by him and he loves her dearly and it s a wicked shame to egg her on to this poor little quivering thing She s got nobody on her side The one man who d be her friend the obstinate creature won t allow to come near her What first put her into this mood o mind I wonder I can t tell Not I certainly It is all voluntary on her part Now that s all I have to say Phillotson spoke stiffly You ve turned round missus Edlin It is unseemly of you Well I knowed you d be affronted at what I had to say but I don t mind that The truth s the truth I m not affronted missus Edlin You ve been too kind a neighbour for that But I must be allowed to know what s best for myself and Susanna I suppose you won t go to church with us then No Be hanged if I can I don t know what the times be coming to Matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one really do feel afeard to move in it at all In my time we took it more careless and I don t know that we was any the worse for it When I and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all the week and drunk the parish dry and had to borrow half a crown to begin housekeeping When missus Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson spoke moodily I don t know whether I ought to do it at any rate quite so rapidly Why If she is really compelling herself to this against her instincts merely from this new sense of duty or religion I ought perhaps to let her wait a bit Now you ve got so far you ought not to back out of it That s my opinion I can t very well put it off now that s true But I had a qualm when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence Now never you have qualms old boy I mean to give her away to morrow morning and you mean to take her It has always been on my conscience that I didn t urge more objections to your letting her go and now we ve got to this stage I shan t be content if I don t help you to set the matter right Phillotson nodded and seeing how staunch his friend was became more frank No doubt when it gets known what I ve done I shall be thought a soft fool by many But they don t know Sue as I do Though so elusive hers is such an honest nature at bottom that I don t think she has ever done anything against her conscience The fact of her having lived with Fawley goes for nothing At the time she left me for him she thought she was quite within her right Now she thinks otherwise The next morning came and the self sacrifice of the woman on the altar of what she was pleased to call her principles was acquiesced in by these two friends each from his own point of view Phillotson went across to the Widow Edlin s to fetch Sue a few minutes after eight o clock The fog of the previous day or two on the low lands had travelled up here by now and the trees on the green caught armfuls and turned them into showers of big drops The bride was waiting ready bonnet and all on She had never in her life looked so much like the lily her name connoted as she did in that pallid morning light Chastened world weary remorseful the strain on her nerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones and she appeared smaller in outline than she had formerly done though Sue had not been a large woman in her days of rudest health Prompt said the schoolmaster magnanimously taking her hand But he checked his impulse to kiss her remembering her start of yesterday which unpleasantly lingered in his mind Gillingham joined them and they left the house Widow Edlin continuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony Where is the church said Sue She had not lived there for any length of time since the old church was pulled down and in her preoccupation forgot the new one Up here said Phillotson and presently the tower loomed large and solemn in the fog The vicar had already crossed to the building and when they entered he said pleasantly We almost want candles You do wish me to be yours Richard gasped Sue in a whisper Certainly dear above all things in the world Sue said no more and for the second or third time he felt he was not quite following out the humane instinct which had induced him to let her go There they stood five altogether the parson the clerk the couple and Gillingham and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith In the nave of the edifice were two or three villagers and when the clergyman came to the words What God hath joined a woman s voice from among these was heard to utter audibly God hath jined indeed It was like a re enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of the similar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before When the books were signed the vicar congratulated the husband and wife on having performed a noble and righteous and mutually forgiving act All s well that ends well he said smiling May you long be happy together after thus having been saved as by fire They came down the nearly empty building and crossed to the schoolhouse Gillingham wanted to get home that night and left early He too congratulated the couple Now he said in parting from Phillotson who walked out a little way I shall be able to tell the people in your native place a good round tale and they ll all say Well done depend on it When the schoolmaster got back Sue was making a pretence of doing some housewifery as if she lived there But she seemed timid at his approach and compunction wrought on him at sight of it Of course my dear I shan t expect to intrude upon your personal privacy any more than I did before he said gravely It is for our good socially to do this and that s its justification if it was not my reason Sue brightened a little VI The place was the door of Jude s lodging in the out skirts of Christminster far from the precincts of saint Silas where he had formerly lived which saddened him to sickness The rain was coming down A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to Jude who held the door in his hand I am lonely destitute and houseless that s what I am Father has turned me out of doors after borrowing every penny I d got to put it into his business and then accusing me of laziness when I was only waiting for a situation I am at the mercy of the world If you can t take me and help me Jude I must go to the workhouse or to something worse Only just now two undergraduates winked at me as I came along Tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where there s so many young men The woman in the rain who spoke thus was Arabella the evening being that of the day after Sue s remarriage with Phillotson I am sorry for you but I am only in lodgings said Jude coldly Then you turn me away I ll give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days Oh but can t you have the kindness to take me in I cannot endure going to a public house to lodge and I am so lonely Please Jude for old times sake No no said Jude hastily I don t want to be reminded of those things and if you talk about them I shall not help you Then I suppose I must go said Arabella She bent her head against the doorpost and began sobbing The house is full said Jude And I have only a little extra room to my own not much more than a closet where I keep my tools and templates and the few books I have left That would be a palace for me There is no bedstead in it A bit of a bed could be made on the floor It would be good enough for me Unable to be harsh with her and not knowing what to do Jude called the man who let the lodgings and said this was an acquaintance of his in great distress for want of temporary shelter You may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly spoke up Arabella My father has insulted me this afternoon and I ve left him though without a penny The householder said he could not recall her features But still if you are a friend of mister Fawley s we ll do what we can for a day or two if he ll make himself answerable Yes yes said Jude She has really taken me quite unawares but I should wish to help her out of her difficulty And an arrangement was ultimately come to under which a bed was to be thrown down in Jude s lumber room to make it comfortable for Arabella till she could get out of the strait she was in not by her own fault as she declared and return to her father s again While they were waiting for this to be done Arabella said You know the news I suppose I guess what you mean but I know nothing I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to day She had just heard that the wedding was to be yesterday but she didn t know if it had come off I don t wish to talk of it No no of course you don t Only it shows what kind of woman Don t speak of her I say She s a fool And she s an angel too poor dear If it s done he ll have a chance of getting back to his old position by everybody s account so Anny says All his well wishers will be pleased including the bishop himself Do spare me Arabella Arabella was duly installed in the little attic and at first she did not come near Jude at all She went to and fro about her own business which when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the passage she informed him was that of obtaining another place in the occupation she understood best When Jude suggested London as affording the most likely opening in the liquor trade she shook her head No the temptations are too many she said Any humble tavern in the country before that for me On the Sunday morning following when he breakfasted later than on other days she meekly asked him if she might come in to breakfast with him as she had broken her teapot and could not replace it immediately the shops being shut Yes if you like he said indifferently While they sat without speaking she suddenly observed You seem all in a brood old man I m sorry for you I am all in a brood It is about her I know It s no business of mine but I could find out all about the wedding if it really did take place if you wanted to know How could you I wanted to go to Alfredston to get a few things I left there And I could see Anny who ll be sure to have heard all about it as she has friends at Marygreen Jude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal but his suspense pitted itself against his discretion and won in the struggle You can ask about it if you like he said I ve not heard a sound from there It must have been very private if they have married I am afraid I haven t enough cash to take me there and back or I should have gone before I must wait till I have earned some Oh I can pay the journey for you he said impatiently And thus his suspense as to Sue s welfare and the possible marriage moved him to dispatch for intelligence the last emissary he would have thought of choosing deliberately Arabella went Jude requesting her to be home not later than by the seven o clock train When she had gone he said Why should I have charged her to be back by a particular time She s nothing to me nor the other neither But having finished work he could not help going to the station to meet Arabella dragged thither by feverish haste to get the news she might bring and know the worst Arabella had made dimples most successfully all the way home and when she stepped out of the railway carriage she smiled He merely said Well with the very reverse of a smile They are married Yes of course they are he returned She observed however the hard strain upon his lip as he spoke Anny says she has heard from Belinda her relation out at Marygreen that it was very sad and curious How do you mean sad She wanted to marry him again didn t she And he her Yes that was it She wanted to in one sense but not in the other missus Edlin was much upset by it all and spoke out her mind at Phillotson But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her best embroidery that she d worn with you to blot you out entirely Well if a woman feels like it she ought to do it I commend her for it though others don t Arabella sighed She felt he was her only husband and that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of God A mighty while he lived Perhaps another woman feels the same about herself too Arabella sighed again I don t want any cant exclaimed Jude It isn t cant said Arabella I feel exactly the same as she He closed that issue by remarking abruptly Well now I know all I wanted to know Many thanks for your information I am not going back to my lodgings just yet And he left her straightway In his misery and depression Jude walked to well nigh every spot in the city that he had visited with Sue thence he did not know whither and then thought of going home to his usual evening meal But having all the vices of his virtues and some to spare he turned into a public house for the first time during many months Among the possible consequences of her marriage Sue had not dwelt on this Arabella meanwhile had gone back The evening passed and Jude did not return At half past nine Arabella herself went out first proceeding to an outlying district near the river where her father lived and had opened a small and precarious pork shop lately Well she said to him for all your rowing me that night I ve called in for I have something to tell you I think I shall get married and settled again Only you must help me and you can do no less after what I ve stood ee I ll do anything to get thee off my hands Very well I am now going to look for my young man He s on the loose I m afraid and I must get him home All I want you to do to night is not to fasten the door in case I should want to sleep here and should be late I thought you d soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping away Well don t do the door That s all I say She then sallied out again and first hastening back to Jude s to make sure that he had not returned began her search for him A shrewd guess as to his probable course took her straight to the tavern which Jude had formerly frequented and where she had been barmaid for a brief term She had no sooner opened the door of the Private Bar than her eyes fell upon him sitting in the shade at the back of the compartment with his eyes fixed on the floor in a blank stare He was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then He did not observe her and she entered and sat beside him Jude looked up and said without surprise You ve come to have something Arabella I m trying to forget her that s all But I can t and I am going home She saw that he was a little way on in liquor but only a little as yet I ve come entirely to look for you dear boy You are not well Now you must have something better than that Arabella held up her finger to the barmaid You shall have a liqueur that s better fit for a man of education than beer You shall have maraschino or curacao dry or sweet or cherry brandy I ll treat you poor chap I don t care which Say cherry brandy Sue has served me badly very badly I didn t expect it of Sue I stuck to her and she ought to have stuck to me I d have sold my soul for her sake but she wouldn t risk hers a jot for me To save her own soul she lets mine go damn But it isn t her fault poor little girl I am sure it isn t How Arabella had obtained money did not appear but she ordered a liqueur each and paid for them When they had drunk these Arabella suggested another and Jude had the pleasure of being as it were personally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation by one who knew the landmarks well Arabella kept very considerably in the rear of Jude but though she only sipped where he drank she took as much as she could safely take without losing her head which was not a little as the crimson upon her countenance showed Her tone towards him to night was uniformly soothing and cajoling and whenever he said I don t care what happens to me a thing he did continually she replied But I do very much The closing hour came and they were compelled to turn out whereupon Arabella put her arm round his waist and guided his unsteady footsteps When they were in the streets she said I don t know what our landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state I expect we are fastened out so that he ll have to come down and let us in I don t know I don t know That s the worst of not having a home of your own I tell you Jude what we had best do Come round to my father s I made it up with him a bit to day I can let you in and nobody will see you at all and by to morrow morning you ll be all right Anything anywhere replied Jude What the devil does it matter to me They went along together like any other fuddling couple her arm still round his waist and his at last round hers though with no amatory intent but merely because he was weary unstable and in need of support This is th Martyrs burning place he stammered as they dragged across a broad street I remember in old Fuller s Holy State and I am reminded of it by our passing by here old Fuller in his Holy State says that at the burning of Ridley Doctor Smith preached sermon and took as his text Though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing Often think of it as I pass here Ridley was a Yes Exactly Very thoughtful of you deary even though it hasn t much to do with our present business Why yes it has I m giving my body to be burned But ah you don t understand it wants Sue to understand such things And I was her seducer poor little girl And she s gone and I don t care about myself Do what you like with me And yet she did it for conscience sake poor little Sue Hang her I mean I think she was right hiccuped Arabella I ve my feelings too like her and I feel I belong to you in Heaven s eye and to nobody else till death us do part It is hic never too late hic to mend They had reached her father s house and she softly unfastened the door groping about for a light within The circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry into the cottage at Cresscombe such a long time before Nor were perhaps Arabella s motives But Jude did not think of that though she did I can t find the matches dear she said when she had fastened up the door But never mind this way As quiet as you can please It is as dark as pitch said Jude Give me your hand and I ll lead you That s it Just sit down here and I ll pull off your boots I don t want to wake him Who Father He d make a row perhaps She pulled off his boots Now she whispered take hold of me never mind your weight Now first stair second stair But are we out in our old house by Marygreen asked the stupefied Jude I haven t been inside it for years till now Hey And where are my books That s what I want to know We are at my house dear where there s nobody to spy out how ill you are Now third stair fourth stair that s it Now we shall get on VII Arabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this small recently hired tenement of her father s She put her head into the little pork shop in front and told mister Donn it was ready Donn endeavouring to look like a master pork butcher in a greasy blue blouse and with a strap round his waist from which a steel dangled came in promptly You must mind the shop this morning he said casually I ve to go and get some inwards and half a pig from Lumsdon and to call elsewhere If you live here you must put your shoulder to the wheel at least till I get the business started Well for to day I can t say She looked deedily into his face I ve got a prize upstairs Oh What s that A husband almost No Yes It s Jude He s come back to me Your old original one Well I m damned Well I always did like him that I will say But how does he come to be up there said Donn humour struck and nodding to the ceiling Don t ask inconvenient questions Father What we ve to do is to keep him here till he and I are as we were How was that Married Ah Well it is the rummest thing I ever heard of marrying an old husband again and so much new blood in the world He s no catch to my thinking I d have had a new one while I was about it It isn t rum for a woman to want her old husband back for respectability though for a man to want his old wife back well perhaps it is funny rather And Arabella was suddenly seized with a fit of loud laughter in which her father joined more moderately Be civil to him and I ll do the rest she said when she had recovered seriousness He told me this morning that his head ached fit to burst and he hardly seemed to know where he was And no wonder considering how he mixed his drink last night We must keep him jolly and cheerful here for a day or two and not let him go back to his lodging Whatever you advance I ll pay back to you again But I must go up and see how he is now poor deary Arabella ascended the stairs softly opened the door of the first bedroom and peeped in Finding that her shorn Samson was asleep she entered to the bedside and stood regarding him The fevered flush on his face from the debauch of the previous evening lessened the fragility of his ordinary appearance and his long lashes dark brows and curly back hair and beard against the white pillow completed the physiognomy of one whom Arabella as a woman of rank passions still felt it worth while to recapture highly important to recapture as a woman straitened both in means and in reputation Her ardent gaze seemed to affect him his quick breathing became suspended and he opened his eyes How are you now dear said she It is I Arabella Ah where oh yes I remember You gave me shelter I am stranded ill demoralized damn bad That s what I am Then do stay here There s nobody in the house but father and me and you can rest till you are thoroughly well I ll tell them at the stoneworks that you are knocked up I wonder what they are thinking at the lodgings I ll go round and explain Perhaps you had better let me pay up or they ll think we ve run away Yes You ll find enough money in my pocket there Quite indifferent and shutting his eyes because he could not bear the daylight in his throbbing eye balls Jude seemed to doze again Arabella took his purse softly left the room and putting on her outdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the evening before Scarcely half an hour had elapsed ere she reappeared round the corner walking beside a lad wheeling a truck on which were piled all Jude s household possessions and also the few of Arabella s things which she had taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there Jude was in such physical pain from his unfortunate break down of the previous night and in such mental pain from the loss of Sue and from having yielded in his half somnolent state to Arabella that when he saw his few chattels unpacked and standing before his eyes in this strange bedroom intermixed with woman s apparel he scarcely considered how they had come there or what their coming signalized Now said Arabella to her father downstairs we must keep plenty of good liquor going in the house these next few days I know his nature and if he once gets into that fearfully low state that he does get into sometimes he ll never do the honourable thing by me in this world and I shall be left in the lurch He must be kept cheerful He has a little money in the savings bank and he has given me his purse to pay for anything necessary Well that will be the licence for I must have that ready at hand to catch him the moment he s in the humour You must pay for the liquor A few friends and a quiet convivial party would be the thing if we could get it up It would advertise the shop and help me too That can be got up easy enough by anybody who ll afford victuals and drink Well yes it would advertise the shop that s true Three days later when Jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful throbbing of his eyes and brain but was still considerably confused in his mind by what had been supplied to him by Arabella during the interval to keep him jolly as she expressed it the quiet convivial gathering suggested by her to wind Jude up to the striking point took place Donn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage shop which had as yet scarce any customers nevertheless that party advertised it well and the Donns acquired a real notoriety among a certain class in Christminster who knew not the colleges nor their works nor their ways Jude was asked if he could suggest any guest in addition to those named by Arabella and her father and in a saturnine humour of perfect recklessness mentioned Uncle Joe and Stagg and the decayed auctioneer and others whom he remembered as having been frequenters of the well known tavern during his bout therein years before He also suggested Freckles and Bower o Bliss Arabella took him at his word so far as the men went but drew the line at the ladies Another man they knew Tinker Taylor though he lived in the same street was not invited but as he went homeward from a late job on the evening of the party he had occasion to call at the shop for trotters There were none in but he was promised some the next morning While making his inquiry Taylor glanced into the back room and saw the guests sitting round card playing and drinking and otherwise enjoying themselves at Donn s expense He went home to bed and on his way out next morning wondered how the party went off He thought it hardly worth while to call at the shop for his provisions at that hour Donn and his daughter being probably not up if they caroused late the night before However he found in passing that the door was open and he could hear voices within though the shutters of the meat stall were not down He went and tapped at the sitting room door and opened it Well to be sure he said astonished Hosts and guests were sitting card playing smoking and talking precisely as he had left them eleven hours earlier the gas was burning and the curtains drawn though it had been broad daylight for two hours out of doors Yes cried Arabella laughing Here we are just the same We ought to be ashamed of ourselves oughtn t we But it is a sort of housewarming you see and our friends are in no hurry Come in mister Taylor and sit down The tinker or rather reduced ironmonger was nothing loath and entered and took a seat I shall lose a quarter but never mind he said Well really I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked in It seemed as if I was flung back again into last night all of a sudden So you are Pour out for mister Taylor He now perceived that she was sitting beside Jude her arm being round his waist Jude like the rest of the company bore on his face the signs of how deeply he had been indulging Well we ve been waiting for certain legal hours to arrive to tell the truth she continued bashfully and making her spirituous crimson look as much like a maiden blush as possible Jude and I have decided to make up matters between us by tying the knot again as we find we can t do without one another after all So as a bright notion we agreed to sit on till it was late enough and go and do it off hand Jude seemed to pay no great heed to what she was announcing or indeed to anything whatever The entrance of Taylor infused fresh spirit into the company and they remained sitting till Arabella whispered to her father Now we may as well go But the parson don t know Yes I told him last night that we might come between eight and nine as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and quiet as possible on account of it being our second marriage which might make people curious to look on if they knew He highly approved Oh very well I m ready said her father getting up and shaking himself Now old darling she said to Jude Come along as you promised When did I promise anything asked he whom she had made so tipsy by her special knowledge of that line of business as almost to have made him sober again or to seem so to those who did not know him Why said Arabella affecting dismay You ve promised to marry me several times as we ve sat here to night These gentlemen have heard you I don t remember it said Jude doggedly There s only one woman but I won t mention her in this Capharnaum Arabella looked towards her father Now mister Fawley be honourable said Donn You and my daughter have been living here together these three or four days quite on the understanding that you were going to marry her Of course I shouldn t have had such goings on in my house if I hadn t understood that As a point of honour you must do it now Don t say anything against my honour enjoined Jude hotly standing up I d marry the W of Babylon rather than do anything dishonourable No reflection on you my dear It is a mere rhetorical figure what they call in the books hyperbole Keep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you said Donn If I am bound in honour to marry her as I suppose I am though how I came to be here with her I know no more than a dead man marry her I will so help me God I have never behaved dishonourably to a woman or to any living thing I am not a man who wants to save himself at the expense of the weaker among us There never mind him deary said she putting her cheek against Jude s Come up and wash your face and just put yourself tidy and off we ll go Make it up with Father They shook hands Jude went upstairs with her and soon came down looking tidy and calm Arabella too had hastily arranged herself and accompanied by Donn away they went Don t go she said to the guests at parting I ve told the little maid to get the breakfast while we are gone and when we come back we ll all have some A good strong cup of tea will set everybody right for going home When Arabella Jude and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial errand the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake and discussed the situation with great interest Tinker Taylor being the most sober reasoned the most lucidly I don t wish to speak against friends he said But it do seem a rare curiosity for a couple to marry over again If they couldn t get on the first time when their minds were limp they won t the second by my reckoning Do you think he ll do it He s been put upon his honour by the woman so he med He d hardly do it straight off like this He s got no licence nor anything She s got that bless you Didn t you hear her say so to her father Well said Tinker Taylor relighting his pipe at the gas jet Take her all together limb by limb she s not such a bad looking piece particular by candlelight To be sure halfpence that have been in circulation can t be expected to look like new ones from the mint But for a woman that s been knocking about the four hemispheres for some time she s passable enough A little bit thick in the flitch perhaps but I like a woman that a puff o wind won t blow down Their eyes followed the movements of the little girl as she spread the breakfast cloth on the table they had been using without wiping up the slops of the liquor The curtains were undrawn and the expression of the house made to look like morning Some of the guests however fell asleep in their chairs One or two went to the door and gazed along the street more than once Tinker Taylor was the chief of these and after a time he came in with a leer on his face By Gad they are coming I think the deed s done No said Uncle Joe following him in Take my word he turned rusty at the last minute They are walking in a very unusual way and that s the meaning of it They waited in silence till the wedding party could be heard entering the house First into the room came Arabella boisterously and her face was enough to show that her strategy had succeeded missus Fawley I presume said Tinker Taylor with mock courtesy Certainly missus Fawley again replied Arabella blandly pulling off her glove and holding out her left hand There s the padlock see Well he was a very nice gentlemanly man indeed I mean the clergyman He said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done missus Fawley I congratulate you heartily he says For having heard your history and that of your husband I think you have both done the right and proper thing And for your past errors as a wife and his as a husband I think you ought now to be forgiven by the world as you have forgiven each other says he Yes he was a very nice gentlemanly man The Church don t recognize divorce in her dogma strictly speaking he says and bear in mind the words of the service in your goings out and your comings in What God hath joined together let no man put asunder Yes he was a very nice gentlemanly man But Jude my dear you were enough to make a cat laugh You walked that straight and held yourself that steady that one would have thought you were going prentice to a judge though I knew you were seeing double all the time from the way you fumbled with my finger I said I d do anything to save a woman s honour muttered Jude And I ve done it Well now old deary come along and have some breakfast I want some more whisky said Jude stolidly Nonsense dear Not now There s no more left The tea will take the muddle out of our heads and we shall be as fresh as larks All right I ve married you She said I ought to marry you again and I have straightway It is true religion Ha ha ha VIII Michaelmas came and passed and Jude and his wife who had lived but a short time in her father s house after their remarriage were in lodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the city He had done a few days work during the two or three months since the event but his health had been indifferent and it was now precarious He was sitting in an arm chair before the fire and coughed a good deal I ve got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over again Arabella was saying to him I shall have to keep ee entirely that s what twill come to I shall have to make black pot and sausages and hawk em about the street all to support an invalid husband I d no business to be saddled with at all Why didn t you keep your health deceiving one like this You were well enough when the wedding was Ah yes said he laughing acridly I have been thinking of my foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our first marriage I feel now that the greatest mercy that could be vouchsafed to me would be that something should serve me as I served that animal This was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day now The landlord of the lodging who had heard that they were a queer couple had doubted if they were married at all especially as he had seen Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a little cordial and he was about to give them notice to quit till by chance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head he recognized the note of genuine wedlock and concluding that they must be respectable said no more Jude did not get any better and one day he requested Arabella with considerable hesitation to execute a commission for him She asked him indifferently what it was To write to Sue What in the name do you want me to write to her for To ask how she is and if she ll come to see me because I m ill and should like to see her once again It is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing It is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it You know I love Sue I don t wish to mince the matter there stands the fact I love her I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to her without your knowledge But I wish to be quite above board with you and with her husband A message through you asking her to come is at least free from any odour of intrigue If she retains any of her old nature at all she ll come You ve no respect for marriage whatever or its rights and duties What DOES it matter what my opinions are a wretch like me Can it matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an hour here with one foot in the grave Come please write Arabella he pleaded Repay my candour by a little generosity I should think NOT Not just once Oh do He felt that his physical weakness had taken away all his dignity What do you want HER to know how you are for She don t want to see ee She s the rat that forsook the sinking ship Don t don t And I stuck to un the more fool I Have that strumpet in the house indeed Almost as soon as the words were spoken Jude sprang from the chair and before Arabella knew where she was he had her on her back upon a little couch which stood there he kneeling above her Say another word of that sort he whispered and I ll kill you here and now I ve everything to gain by it my own death not being the least part So don t think there s no meaning in what I say What do you want me to do gasped Arabella Promise never to speak of her Very well I do I take your word he said scornfully as he loosened her But what it is worth I can t say You couldn t kill the pig but you could kill me Ah there you have me No I couldn t kill you even in a passion Taunt away He then began coughing very much and she estimated his life with an appraiser s eye as he sank back ghastly pale I ll send for her Arabella murmured if you ll agree to my being in the room with you all the time she s here The softer side of his nature the desire to see Sue made him unable to resist the offer even now provoked as he had been and he replied breathlessly Yes I agree Only send for her In the evening he inquired if she had written Yes she said I wrote a note telling her you were ill and asking her to come to morrow or the day after I haven t posted it yet The next day Jude wondered if she really did post it but would not ask her and foolish Hope that lives on a drop and a crumb made him restless with expectation He knew the times of the possible trains and listened on each occasion for sounds of her She did not come but Jude would not address Arabella again thereon He hoped and expected all the next day but no Sue appeared neither was there any note of reply Then Jude decided in the privacy of his mind that Arabella had never posted hers although she had written it There was something in her manner which told it His physical weakness was such that he shed tears at the disappointment when she was not there to see His suspicions were in fact well founded Arabella like some other nurses thought that your duty towards your invalid was to pacify him by any means short of really acting upon his fancies He never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture A silent undiscerned resolve grew up in him which gave him if not strength stability and calm One midday when after an absence of two hours she came into the room she beheld the chair empty Down she flopped on the bed and sitting meditated Now where the devil is my man gone to she said A driving rain from the north east had been falling with more or less intermission all the morning and looking from the window at the dripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man would have ventured out to almost certain death Yet a conviction possessed Arabella that he had gone out and it became a certainty when she had searched the house If he s such a fool let him be she said I can do no more Jude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to Alfredston oddly swathed pale as a monumental figure in alabaster and much stared at by other passengers An hour later his thin form in the long great coat and blanket he had come with but without an umbrella could have been seen walking along the five mile road to Marygreen On his face showed the determined purpose that alone sustained him but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation By the up hill walk he was quite blown but he pressed on and at half past three o clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen The rain was keeping everybody indoors Jude crossed the green to the church without observation and found the building open Here he stood looking forth at the school whence he could hear the usual sing song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation s groan He waited till a small boy came from the school one evidently allowed out before hours for some reason or other Jude held up his hand and the child came Please call at the schoolhouse and ask missus Phillotson if she will be kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes The child departed and Jude heard him knock at the door of the dwelling He himself went further into the church Everything was new except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked old fabric now fixed against the new walls He stood by these they seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his ancestors and Sue s A light footstep which might have been accounted no more than an added drip to the rainfall sounded in the porch and he looked round Oh I didn t think it was you I didn t Oh Jude A hysterical catch in her breath ended in a succession of them He advanced but she quickly recovered and went back Don t go don t go he implored This is my last time I thought it would be less intrusive than to enter your house And I shall never come again Don t then be unmerciful Sue Sue We are acting by the letter and the letter killeth I ll stay I won t be unkind she said her mouth quivering and her tears flowing as she allowed him to come closer But why did you come and do this wrong thing after doing such a right thing as you have done What right thing Marrying Arabella again It was in the Alfredston paper She has never been other than yours Jude in a proper sense And therefore you did so well Oh so well in recognizing it and taking her to you again God above and is that all I ve come to hear If there is anything more degrading immoral unnatural than another in my life it is this meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing the right thing And you too you call yourself Phillotson s wife HIS wife You are mine Don t make me rush away from you I can t bear much But on this point I am decided I cannot understand how you did it how you think it I cannot Never mind that He is a kind husband to me And I I ve wrestled and struggled and fasted and prayed I have nearly brought my body into complete subjection And you mustn t will you wake Oh you darling little fool where is your reason You seem to have suffered the loss of your faculties I would argue with you if I didn t know that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all appeals to her brains Or is it that you are humbugging yourself as so many women do about these things and don t actually believe what you pretend to and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion raised by an affected belief Luxury How can you be so cruel You dear sad soft most melancholy wreck of a promising human intellect that it has ever been my lot to behold Where is your scorn of convention gone I WOULD have died game You crush almost insult me Jude Go away from me She turned off quickly I will I would never come to see you again even if I had the strength to come which I shall not have any more Sue Sue you are not worth a man s love Her bosom began to go up and down I can t endure you to say that she burst out and her eye resting on him a moment she turned back impulsively Don t don t scorn me Kiss me oh kiss me lots of times and say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug I can t bear it She rushed up to him and with her mouth on his continued I must tell you oh I must my darling Love It has been only a church marriage an apparent marriage I mean He suggested it at the very first How I mean it is a nominal marriage only It hasn t been more than that at all since I came back to him Sue he said Pressing her to him in his arms he bruised her lips with kisses If misery can know happiness I have a moment s happiness now Now in the name of all you hold holy tell me the truth and no lie You do love me still I do You know it too well But I MUSTN T do this I mustn t kiss you back as I would But do And yet you are so dear and you look so ill And so do you There s one more in memory of our dead little children yours and mine The words struck her like a blow and she bent her head I MUSTN T I CAN T go on with this she gasped presently But there there darling I give you back your kisses I do I do And now I ll HATE myself for ever for my sin No let me make my last appeal Listen to this We ve both remarried out of our senses I was made drunk to do it You were the same I was gin drunk you were creed drunk Either form of intoxication takes away the nobler vision Let us then shake off our mistakes and run away together No again no Why do you tempt me so far Jude It is too merciless But I ve got over myself now Don t follow me don t look at me Leave me for pity s sake She ran up the church to the east end and Jude did as she requested He did not turn his head but took up his blanket which she had not seen and went straight out As he passed the end of the church she heard his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows and in a last instinct of human affection even now unsubdued by her fetters she sprang up as if to go and succour him But she knelt down again and stopped her ears with her hands till all possible sound of him had passed away He was by this time at the corner of the green from which the path ran across the fields in which he had scared rooks as a boy He turned and looked back once at the building which still contained Sue and then went on knowing that his eyes would light on that scene no more There are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather but the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing is the crest of the down by the Brown House where the road to Alfredston crosses the old Ridgeway Here the first winter sleets and snows fall and lie and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed Here in the teeth of the north east wind and rain Jude now pursued his way wet through the necessary slowness of his walk from lack of his former strength being insufficent to maintain his heat He came to the milestone and raining as it was spread his blanket and lay down there to rest Before moving on he went and felt at the back of the stone for his own carving It was still there but nearly obliterated by moss He passed the spot where the gibbet of his ancestor and Sue s had stood and descended the hill It was dark when he reached Alfredston where he had a cup of tea the deadly chill that began to creep into his bones being too much for him to endure fasting To get home he had to travel by a steam tram car and two branches of railway with much waiting at a junction He did not reach Christminster till ten o clock IX On the platform stood Arabella She looked him up and down You ve been to see her she asked I have said Jude literally tottering with cold and lassitude Well now you d best march along home The water ran out of him as he went and he was compelled to lean against the wall to support himself while coughing You ve done for yourself by this young man said she I don t know whether you know it Of course I do I meant to do for myself What to commit suicide Certainly Well I m blest Kill yourself for a woman Listen to me Arabella You think you are the stronger and so you are in a physical sense now You could push me over like a nine pin You did not send that letter the other day and I could not resent your conduct But I am not so weak in another way as you think I made up my mind that a man confined to his room by inflammation of the lungs a fellow who had only two wishes left in the world to see a particular woman and then to die could neatly accomplish those two wishes at one stroke by taking this journey in the rain That I ve done I have seen her for the last time and I ve finished myself put an end to a feverish life which ought never to have been begun Lord you do talk lofty Won t you have something warm to drink No thank you Let s get home They went along by the silent colleges and Jude kept stopping What are you looking at Stupid fancies I see in a way those spirits of the dead again on this my last walk that I saw when I first walked here What a curious chap you are I seem to see them and almost hear them rustling But I don t revere all of them as I did then I don t believe in half of them The theologians the apologists and their kin the metaphysicians the high handed statesmen and others no longer interest me All that has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality The expression of Jude s corpselike face in the watery lamplight was indeed as if he saw people where there was nobody At moments he stood still by an archway like one watching a figure walk out then he would look at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind it He seemed to hear voices whose words he repeated as if to gather their meaning They seem laughing at me Who Oh I was talking to myself The phantoms all about here in the college archways and windows They used to look friendly in the old days particularly Addison and Gibbon and Johnson and doctor Browne and Bishop Ken Come along do Phantoms There s neither living nor dead hereabouts except a damn policeman I never saw the streets emptier Fancy The Poet of Liberty used to walk here and the great Dissector of Melancholy there I don t want to hear about em They bore me Walter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that lane Wycliffe Harvey Hooker Arnold and a whole crowd of Tractarian Shades I DON T WANT to know their names I tell you What do I care about folk dead and gone Upon my soul you are more sober when you ve been drinking than when you have not I must rest a moment he said and as he paused holding to the railings he measured with his eye the height of a college front This is old Rubric And that Sarcophagus and Up that lane Crozier and Tudor and all down there is Cardinal with its long front and its windows with lifted eyebrows representing the polite surprise of the university at the efforts of such as I Come along and I ll treat you Very well It will help me home for I feel the chilly fog from the meadows of Cardinal as if death claws were grabbing me through and through As Antigone said I am neither a dweller among men nor ghosts But Arabella when I am dead you ll see my spirit flitting up and down here among these Pooh You mayn t die after all You are tough enough yet old man It was night at Marygreen and the rain of the afternoon showed no sign of abatement About the time at which Jude and Arabella were walking the streets of Christminster homeward the Widow Edlin crossed the green and opened the back door of the schoolmaster s dwelling which she often did now before bedtime to assist Sue in putting things away Sue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen for she was not a good housewife though she tried to be and grew impatient of domestic details Lord love ee what do ye do that yourself for when I ve come o purpose You knew I should come Oh I don t know I forgot No I didn t forget I did it to discipline myself I have scrubbed the stairs since eight o clock I MUST practise myself in my household duties I ve shamefully neglected them Why should ye He ll get a better school perhaps be a parson in time and you ll keep two servants Tis a pity to spoil them pretty hands Don t talk of my pretty hands missus Edlin This pretty body of mine has been the ruin of me already Pshoo you ve got no body to speak of You put me more in mind of a sperrit But there seems something wrong to night my dear Husband cross No He never is He s gone to bed early Then what is it I cannot tell you I have done wrong to day And I want to eradicate it Well I will tell you this Jude has been here this afternoon and I find I still love him oh grossly I cannot tell you more Ah said the widow I told ee how twould be But it shan t be I have not told my husband of his visit it is not necessary to trouble him about it as I never mean to see Jude any more But I am going to make my conscience right on my duty to Richard by doing a penance the ultimate thing I must I wouldn t since he agrees to it being otherwise and it has gone on three months very well as it is Yes he agrees to my living as I choose but I feel it is an indulgence I ought not to exact from him It ought not to have been accepted by me To reverse it will be terrible but I must be more just to him O why was I so unheroic What is it you don t like in him asked missus Edlin curiously I cannot tell you It is something I cannot say The mournful thing is that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as I do so that no excuse is left me Did you ever tell Jude what it was Never I ve heard strange tales o husbands in my time observed the widow in a lowered voice They say that when the saints were upon the earth devils used to take husbands forms o nights and get poor women into all sorts of trouble But I don t know why that should come into my head for it is only a tale What a wind and rain it is to night Well don t be in a hurry to alter things my dear Think it over No no I ve screwed my weak soul up to treating him more courteously and it must be now at once before I break down I don t think you ought to force your nature No woman ought to be expected to It is my duty I will drink my cup to the dregs Half an hour later when missus Edlin put on her bonnet and shawl to leave Sue seemed to be seized with vague terror No no don t go missus Edlin she implored her eyes enlarged and with a quick nervous look over her shoulder But it is bedtime child Yes but there s the little spare room my room that was It is quite ready Please stay missus Edlin I shall want you in the morning Oh well I don t mind if you wish Nothing will happen to my four old walls whether I be there or no She then fastened up the doors and they ascended the stairs together Wait here missus Edlin said Sue I ll go into my old room a moment by myself Leaving the widow on the landing Sue turned to the chamber which had been hers exclusively since her arrival at Marygreen and pushing to the door knelt down by the bed for a minute or two She then arose and taking her night gown from the pillow undressed and came out to missus Edlin A man could be heard snoring in the room opposite She wished missus Edlin good night and the widow entered the room that Sue had just vacated Sue unlatched the other chamber door and as if seized with faintness sank down outside it Getting up again she half opened the door and said Richard As the word came out of her mouth she visibly shuddered The snoring had quite ceased for some time but he did not reply Sue seemed relieved and hurried back to missus Edlin s chamber Are you in bed missus Edlin she asked No dear said the widow opening the door I be old and slow and it takes me a long while to un ray I han t unlaced my jumps yet I don t hear him And perhaps perhaps What child Perhaps he s dead she gasped And then I should be FREE and I could go to Jude Ah no I forgot HER and God Let s go and hearken No he s snoring again But the rain and the wind is so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between whiles Sue had dragged herself back missus Edlin good night again I am sorry I called you out The widow retreated a second time The strained resigned look returned to Sue s face when she was alone I must do it I must I must drink to the dregs she whispered Richard she said again Hey what Is that you Susanna Yes What do you want Anything the matter Wait a moment He pulled on some articles of clothing and came to the door Yes When we were at Shaston I jumped out of the window rather than that you should come near me I have never reversed that treatment till now when I have come to beg your pardon for it and ask you to let me in Perhaps you only think you ought to do this I don t wish you to come against your impulses as I have said But I beg to be admitted She waited a moment and repeated I beg to be admitted I have been in error even to day I have exceeded my rights I did not mean to tell you but perhaps I ought I sinned against you this afternoon How I met Jude I didn t know he was coming And Well I kissed him and let him kiss me Oh the old story Richard I didn t know we were going to kiss each other till we did How many times A good many I don t know I am horrified to look back on it and the least I can do after it is to come to you like this Come this is pretty bad after what I ve done Anything else to confess No She had been intending to say I called him my darling love But as a contrite woman always keeps back a little that portion of the scene remained untold She went on I am never going to see him any more He spoke of some things of the past and it overcame me He spoke of the children But as I have said I am glad almost glad I mean that they are dead Richard It blots out all that life of mine Well about not seeing him again any more Come you really mean this There was something in Phillotson s tone now which seemed to show that his three months of remarriage with Sue had somehow not been so satisfactory as his magnanimity or amative patience had anticipated Yes yes Perhaps you ll swear it on the New Testament I will He went back to the room and brought out a little brown Testament Now then So help you God She swore Very good Now I supplicate you Richard to whom I belong and whom I wish to honour and obey as I vowed to let me in Think it over well You know what it means Having you back in the house was one thing this another So think again I have thought I wish this That s a complaisant spirit and perhaps you are right With a lover hanging about a half marriage should be completed But I repeat my reminder this third and last time It is my wish O God What did you say O God for I don t know Yes you do But He gloomily considered her thin and fragile form a moment longer as she crouched before him in her night clothes Well I thought it might end like this he said presently I owe you nothing after these signs but I ll take you in at your word and forgive you He put his arm round her to lift her up Sue started back What s the matter he asked speaking for the first time sternly You shrink from me again just as formerly No Richard I I was not thinking You wish to come in here Yes You still bear in mind what it means Yes It is my duty Placing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through the doorway and lifting her bodily kissed her A quick look of aversion passed over her face but clenching her teeth she uttered no cry missus Edlin had by this time undressed and was about to get into bed when she said to herself Ah perhaps I d better go and see if the little thing is all right How it do blow and rain The widow went out on the landing and saw that Sue had disappeared Ah Poor soul Weddings be funerals a b lieve nowadays Fifty five years ago come Fall since my man and I married Times have changed since then X Despite himself Jude recovered somewhat and worked at his trade for several weeks After Christmas however he broke down again With the money he had earned he shifted his lodgings to a yet more central part of the town But Arabella saw that he was not likely to do much work for a long while and was cross enough at the turn affairs had taken since her remarriage to him I m hanged if you haven t been clever in this last stroke she would say to get a nurse for nothing by marrying me Jude was absolutely indifferent to what she said and indeed often regarded her abuse in a humorous light Sometimes his mood was more earnest and as he lay he often rambled on upon the defeat of his early aims Every man has some little power in some one direction he would say I was never really stout enough for the stone trade particularly the fixing Moving the blocks always used to strain me and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows are in always gave me colds and I think that began the mischief inside But I felt I could do one thing if I had the opportunity I could accumulate ideas and impart them to others I wonder if the founders had such as I in their minds a fellow good for nothing else but that particular thing I hear that soon there is going to be a better chance for such helpless students as I was There are schemes afoot for making the university less exclusive and extending its influence I don t know much about it And it is too late too late for me Ah and for how many worthier ones before me How you keep a mumbling said Arabella I should have thought you d have got over all that craze about books by this time And so you would if you d had any sense to begin with You are as bad now as when we were first married On one occasion while soliloquizing thus he called her Sue unconsciously I wish you d mind who you are talking to said Arabella indignantly Calling a respectable married woman by the name of that She remembered herself and he did not catch the word But in the course of time when she saw how things were going and how very little she had to fear from Sue s rivalry she had a fit of generosity I suppose you want to see your Sue she said Well I don t mind her coming You can have her here if you like I don t wish to see her again Oh that s a change And don t tell her anything about me that I m ill or anything She has chosen her course Let her go One day he received a surprise missus Edlin came to see him quite on her own account Jude s wife whose feelings as to where his affections were centred had reached absolute indifference by this time went out leaving the old woman alone with Jude He impulsively asked how Sue was and then said bluntly remembering what Sue had told him I suppose they are still only husband and wife in name missus Edlin hesitated Well no it s different now She s begun it quite lately all of her own free will When did she begin he asked quickly The night after you came But as a punishment to her poor self He didn t wish it but she insisted Sue my Sue you darling fool this is almost more than I can endure missus Edlin don t be frightened at my rambling I ve got to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone she was once a woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp who saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away with a word Then bitter affliction came to us and her intellect broke and she veered round to darkness Strange difference of sex that time and circumstance which enlarge the views of most men narrow the views of women almost invariably And now the ultimate horror has come her giving herself like this to what she loathes in her enslavement to forms She so sensitive so shrinking that the very wind seemed to blow on her with a touch of deference As for Sue and me when we were at our own best long ago when our minds were clear and our love of truth fearless the time was not ripe for us Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us And so the resistance they met with brought reaction in her and recklessness and ruin on me There this missus Edlin is how I go on to myself continually as I lie here I must be boring you awfully Not at all my dear boy I could hearken to ee all day As Jude reflected more and more on her news and grew more restless he began in his mental agony to use terribly profane language about social conventions which started a fit of coughing Presently there came a knock at the door downstairs As nobody answered it missus Edlin herself went down The visitor said blandly The doctor The lanky form was that of Physician Vilbert who had been called in by Arabella How is my patient at present asked the physician Oh bad very bad Poor chap he got excited and do blaspeam terribly since I let out some gossip by accident the more to my blame But there you must excuse a man in suffering for what he says and I hope God will forgive him Ah I ll go up and see him missus Fawley at home She s not in at present but she ll be here soon Vilbert went but though Jude had hitherto taken the medicines of that skilful practitioner with the greatest indifference whenever poured down his throat by Arabella he was now so brought to bay by events that he vented his opinion of Vilbert in the physician s face and so forcibly and with such striking epithets that Vilbert soon scurried downstairs again At the door he met Arabella missus Edlin having left Arabella inquired how he thought her husband was now and seeing that the doctor looked ruffled asked him to take something He assented I ll bring it to you here in the passage she said There s nobody but me about the house to day She brought him a bottle and a glass and he drank Arabella began shaking with suppressed laughter What is this my dear he asked smacking his lips Oh a drop of wine and something in it Laughing again she said I poured your own love philtre into it that you sold me at the agricultural show don t you re member I do I do Clever woman But you must be prepared for the consequences Putting his arm round her shoulders he kissed her there and then Don t don t she whispered laughing good humouredly My man will hear She let him out of the house and as she went back she said to herself Well Weak women must provide for a rainy day And if my poor fellow upstairs do go off as I suppose he will soon it s well to keep chances open And I can t pick and choose now as I could when I was younger And one must take the old if one can t get the young XI The last pages to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the reader s attention are concerned with the scene in and out of Jude s bedroom when leafy summer came round again His face was now so thin that his old friends would hardly have known him It was afternoon and Arabella was at the looking glass curling her hair which operation she performed by heating an umbrella stay in the flame of a candle she had lighted and using it upon the flowing lock When she had finished this practised a dimple and put on her things she cast her eyes round upon Jude He seemed to be sleeping though his position was an elevated one his malady preventing him lying down Arabella hatted gloved and ready sat down and waited as if expecting some one to come and take her place as nurse Certain sounds from without revealed that the town was in festivity though little of the festival whatever it might have been could be seen here Bells began to ring and the notes came into the room through the open window and travelled round Jude s head in a hum They made her restless and at last she said to herself Why ever doesn t Father come She looked again at Jude critically gauged his ebbing life as she had done so many times during the late months and glancing at his watch which was hung up by way of timepiece rose impatiently Still he slept and coming to a resolution she slipped from the room closed the door noiselessly and descended the stairs The house was empty The attraction which moved Arabella to go abroad had evidently drawn away the other inmates long before It was a warm cloudless enticing day She shut the front door and hastened round into Chief Street and when near the theatre could hear the notes of the organ a rehearsal for a coming concert being in progress She entered under the archway of Oldgate College where men were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the hall that evening People who had come up from the country for the day were picnicking on the grass and Arabella walked along the gravel paths and under the aged limes But finding this place rather dull she returned to the streets and watched the carriages drawing up for the concert numerous dons and their wives and undergraduates with gay female companions crowding up likewise When the doors were closed and the concert began she moved on The powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging yellow blinds of the open windows over the housetops and into the still air of the lanes They reached so far as to the room in which Jude lay and it was about this time that his cough began again and awakened him As soon as he could speak he murmured his eyes still closed A little water please Nothing but the deserted room received his appeal and he coughed to exhaustion again saying still more feebly Water some water Sue Arabella The room remained still as before Presently he gasped again Throat water Sue darling drop of water please oh please No water came and the organ notes faint as a bee s hum rolled in as before While he remained his face changing shouts and hurrahs came from somewhere in the direction of the river Ah yes The Remembrance games he murmured And I here And Sue defiled The hurrahs were repeated drowning the faint organ notes Jude s face changed more he whispered slowly his parched lips scarcely moving Let the day perish wherein I was born and the night in which it was said There is a man child conceived Hurrah Let that day be darkness let not God regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it Lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein Hurrah Why died I not from the womb Why did i not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly For now should I have lain still and been quiet I should have slept then had I been at rest Hurrah There the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor The small and the great are there and the servant is free from his master Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul Meanwhile Arabella in her journey to discover what was going on took a short cut down a narrow street and through an obscure nook into the quad of Cardinal It was full of bustle and brilliant in the sunlight with flowers and other preparations for a ball here also A carpenter nodded to her one who had formerly been a fellow workman of Jude s A corridor was in course of erection from the entrance to the hall staircase of gay red and buff bunting Waggon loads of boxes containing bright plants in full bloom were being placed about and the great staircase was covered with red cloth She nodded to one workman and another and ascended to the hall on the strength of their acquaintance where they were putting down a new floor and decorating for the dance The cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five o clock service I should not mind having a spin there with a fellow s arm round my waist she said to one of the men But Lord I must be getting home again there s a lot to do No dancing for me When she reached home she was met at the door by Stagg and one or two other of Jude s fellow stoneworkers We are just going down to the river said the former to see the boat bumping But we ve called round on our way to ask how your husband is He s sleeping nicely thank you said Arabella That s right Well now can t you give yourself half an hour s relaxation missus Fawley and come along with us Twould do you good I should like to go said she I ve never seen the boat racing and I hear it is good fun Come along How I WISH I could She looked longingly down the street Wait a minute then I ll just run up and see how he is now Father is with him I believe so I can most likely come They waited and she entered Downstairs the inmates were absent as before having in fact gone in a body to the river where the procession of boats was to pass When she reached the bedroom she found that her father had not even now come Why couldn t he have been here she said impatiently He wants to see the boats himself that s what it is However on looking round to the bed she brightened for she saw that Jude was apparently sleeping though he was not in the usual half elevated posture necessitated by his cough He had slipped down and lay flat A second glance caused her to start and she went to the bed His face was quite white and gradually becoming rigid She touched his fingers they were cold though his body was still warm She listened at his chest All was still within The bumping of near thirty years had ceased After her first appalled sense of what had happened the faint notes of a military or other brass band from the river reached her ears and in a provoked tone she exclaimed To think he should die just now Why did he die just now Then meditating another moment or two she went to the door softly closed it as before and again descended the stairs Here she is said one of the workmen We wondered if you were coming after all Come along we must be quick to get a good place Well how is he Sleeping well still Of course we don t want to drag ee away if Oh yes sleeping quite sound He won t wake yet she said hurriedly They went with the crowd down Cardinal Street where they presently reached the bridge and the gay barges burst upon their view Thence they passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside path now dusty hot and thronged Almost as soon as they had arrived the grand procession of boats began the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the face of the stream as they were lowered from the perpendicular Oh I say how jolly I m glad I ve come said Arabella And it can t hurt my husband my being away On the opposite side of the river on the crowded barges were gorgeous nosegays of feminine beauty fashionably arrayed in green pink blue and white The blue flag of the boat club denoted the centre of interest beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the notes she had already heard in the death chamber Collegians of all sorts in canoes with ladies watching keenly for our boat darted up and down While she regarded the lively scene somebody touched Arabella in the ribs and looking round she saw Vilbert That philtre is operating you know he said with a leer Shame on ee to wreck a heart so I shan t talk of love to day Why not It is a general holiday She did not reply Vilbert s arm stole round her waist which act could be performed unobserved in the crowd An arch expression overspread Arabella s face at the feel of the arm but she kept her eyes on the river as if she did not know of the embrace The crowd surged pushing Arabella and her friends sometimes nearly into the river and she would have laughed heartily at the horse play that succeeded if the imprint on her mind s eye of a pale statuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her a little The fun on the water reached the acme of excitement there were immersions there were shouts the race was lost and won the pink and blue and yellow ladies retired from the barges and the people who had watched began to move Well it s been awfully good cried Arabella But I think I must get back to my poor man Father is there so far as I know but I had better get back What s your hurry Well I must go Dear dear this is awkward At the narrow gangway where the people ascended from the riverside path to the bridge the crowd was literally jammed into one hot mass Arabella and Vilbert with the rest and here they remained motionless Arabella exclaiming Dear dear more and more impatiently for it had just occurred to her mind that if Jude were discovered to have died alone an inquest might be deemed necessary What a fidget you are my love said the physician who being pressed close against her by the throng had no need of personal effort for contact Just as well have patience there s no getting away yet It was nearly ten minutes before the wedged multitude moved sufficiently to let them pass through As soon as she got up into the street Arabella hastened on forbidding the physician to accompany her further that day She did not go straight to her house but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary offices for the poorer dead where she knocked My husband has just gone poor soul she said Can you come and lay him out Arabella waited a few minutes and the two women went along elbowing their way through the stream of fashionable people pouring out of Cardinal meadow and being nearly knocked down by the carriages I must call at the sexton s about the bell too said Arabella It is just round here isn t it I ll meet you at my door By ten o clock that night Jude was lying on the bedstead at his lodging covered with a sheet and straight as an arrow Through the partly opened window the joyous throb of a waltz entered from the ball room at Cardinal Two days later when the sky was equally cloudless and the air equally still two persons stood beside Jude s open coffin in the same little bedroom On one side was Arabella on the other the Widow Edlin They were both looking at Jude s face the worn old eyelids of missus Edlin being red How beautiful he is said she Yes He s a andsome corpse said Arabella The window was still open to ventilate the room and it being about noontide the clear air was motionless and quiet without From a distance came voices and an apparent noise of persons stamping What s that murmured the old woman Oh that s the doctors in the theatre conferring honorary degrees on the Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that sort It s Remembrance Week you know The cheers come from the young men Aye young and strong lunged Not like our poor boy here An occasional word as from some one making a speech floated from the open windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner at which there seemed to be a smile of some sort upon the marble features of Jude while the old superseded Delphin editions of Virgil and Horace and the dog eared Greek Testament on the neighbouring shelf and the few other volumes of the sort that he had not parted with roughened with stone dust where he had been in the habit of catching them up for a few minutes between his labours seemed to pale to a sickly cast at the sounds The bells struck out joyously and their reverberations travelled round the bed room Arabella s eyes removed from Jude to missus Edlin D ye think she will come she asked I could not say She swore not to see him again How is she looking Tired and miserable poor heart Years and years older than when you saw her last Quite a staid worn woman now Tis the man she can t stomach un even now If Jude had been alive to see her he would hardly have cared for her any more perhaps That s what we don t know Didn t he ever ask you to send for her since he came to see her in that strange way No Quite the contrary I offered to send and he said I was not to let her know how ill he was Did he forgive her Not as I know Well poor little thing tis to be believed she s found forgiveness somewhere She said she had found peace She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace till she s hoarse but it won t be true said Arabella She s never found peace since she left his arms and never will again till she s as he is now END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JUDE THE OBSCURE This file should be
