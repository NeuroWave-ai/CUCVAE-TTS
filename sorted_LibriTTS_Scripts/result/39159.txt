none	none	who once had an adventure with Dorothy in Oz and without Button Bright and his Magic Umbrella you will see that the story of Sky Island could never have been written As Polychrome the Rainbow s Daughter lives in the sky it is natural that Trot and Button Bright meet her during their adventures there This story of Sky Island has astonished me considerably and I think it will also astonish you The sky country is certainly a remarkable fairyland but after reading about it I am sure you will agree with me that our old Mother Earth is a very good place to live upon and that Trot and Button Bright and Cap n Bill were fortunate to get back to it again By the way one of my little correspondents has suggested that I print my address in this book so that the children may know where letters will reach me I am doing this as you see and hope that many will write to me and tell me how they like Sky Island My greatest treasures are these letters from my readers and I am always delighted to receive them L FRANK BAUM OZCOT at HOLLYWOOD in CALIFORNIA Illustration LIST OF CHAPTERS CHAPTER one A MYSTERIOUS ARRIVAL thirteen two THE MAGIC UMBRELLA twenty three three A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE thirty seven four THE ISLAND IN THE SKY forty eight five THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES fifty five six THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES sixty five seven GHIP GHISIZZLE PROVES FRIENDLY seventy four eight THE BLUE CITY eighty nine THE TRIBULATION OF TROT ninety one ten THE KING S TREASURE CHAMBER one hundred one eleven BUTTON BRIGHT ENCOUNTERS THE BLUE WOLF one hundred twelve twelve

7276_284424_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello said the boy 
7276_284424_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Hello answered Trot looking up surprised 
7276_284424_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Where did you come from 
7276_284424_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Philadelphia said he 
7276_284424_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear me said Trot you re a long way from home then 
7276_284424_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Bout as far as I can get in this country the boy replied gazing out over the water 
7276_284424_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Isn t this the Pacific Ocean 
7276_284424_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course 
none	none	Why of course he asked
7276_284424_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Because it s the biggest lot of water in all the world 
7276_284424_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you know 
7276_284424_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Cap n Bill told me she said 
7276_284424_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Who s Cap n Bill 
none	none	An old sailorman who s a friend of mine 
7276_284424_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He lives at my house too the white house you see over there on the bluff 
7276_284424_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh is that your home 
7276_284424_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
7276_284424_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Trot 
7276_284424_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Trot proudly 
none	none	Isn t it pretty It s pretty small seems to me answered the boy But it s big enough for mother and me an for Cap n Bill said Trot
7276_284424_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Haven t you any father 
7276_284424_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes ndeed Cap n Griffith is my father but he s gone most of the time sailin on his ship 
none	none	You mus be a stranger in these parts little boy not to know bout Cap n Griffith she added looking at her new acquaintance intently 
7276_284424_000028_000000	train-clean-360	Trot wasn t very big herself but the boy was not quite as big as Trot He was thin with a rather pale complexion and his blue eyes were round and earnest 
7276_284424_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He wore a blouse waist a short jacket and knickerbockers Under his arm he held an old umbrella that was as tall as he was 
none	none	Its covering had once been of thick brown cloth but the color had faded to a dull drab except in the creases and Trot thought it looked very old fashioned and common The handle though was really curious 
7276_284424_000028_000004	train-clean-360	It was of wood and carved to resemble an elephant s head 
7276_284424_000028_000005	train-clean-360	The long trunk of the elephant was curved to make a crook for the handle 
7276_284424_000028_000006	train-clean-360	The eyes of the beast were small red stones and it had two tiny tusks of ivory 
7276_284424_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The boy s dress was rich and expensive even to his fine silk stockings and tan shoes but the umbrella looked old and disreputable 
none	none	It isn t the rainy season now remarked Trot with a smile The boy glanced at his umbrella and hugged it tighter No he said but umbrellas are good for other things sides rain Fraid of gett n sun struck asked Trot 
7276_284424_000034_000000	train-clean-360	He shook his head still gazing far out over the water 
7276_284424_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t b lieve this is bigger than any other ocean said he 
7276_284424_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t see any more of it than I can of the Atlantic 
7276_284424_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 You d find out if you had to sail across it she declared 
7276_284424_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 When I was in Chicago I saw Lake Michigan he went on dreamily and it looked just as big as this water does 
7276_284424_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Looks don t count with oceans she asserted 
none	none	Your eyes can only see jus so far whether you re lookin at a pond or a great sea
7276_284424_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Then it doesn t make any difference how big an ocean is he replied What are those buildings over there pointing to the right along the shore of the bay 
7276_284424_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the town said Trot 
none	none	Most of the people earn their living by fishing The town is half a mile from here an my house is almost a half mile the other way so it s bout a mile from my house to the town 
7276_284424_000041_000000	train-clean-360	The boy sat down beside her on the flat rock 
none	none	Do you like girls asked Trot making room for him
7276_284424_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Not very well the boy replied 
none	none	Some of em are pretty good fellows but not many The girls with brothers are bossy an the girls without brothers haven t any go to em But the world s full o both kinds and so I try to take em as they come 
7276_284424_000043_000004	train-clean-360	They can t help being girls of course 
none	none	Do you like boys When they don t put on airs or get rough house replied Trot
7276_284424_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 My sperience with boys is that they don t know much but think they do 
7276_284424_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 That s true he answered 
none	none	I don t like boys much better than I do girls but some are all right and you seem to be one of em
7276_284424_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Much obliged laughed Trot 
none	none	You aren t so bad either an if we don t both turn out worse than we seem we ought to be friends 
7276_284424_000047_000000	train-clean-360	He nodded rather absently and tossed a pebble into the water 
none	none	Been to town he asked Yes Mother wanted some yarn from the store She s knittin Cap n Bill a stocking Doesn t he wear but one
7276_284424_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 That s all 
none	none	Cap n Bill has one wooden leg she explained
7276_284424_000051_000002	train-clean-360	 That s why he don t sailor any more 
7276_284424_000051_000003	train-clean-360	I m glad of it cause Cap n Bill knows ev rything 
7276_284424_000051_000004	train-clean-360	I s pose he knows more than anyone else in all the world 
none	none	Whew said the boy that s taking a good deal for granted 
7276_284424_000052_000001	train-clean-360	A one legged sailor can t know much 
7276_284424_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not asked Trot a little indignantly 
7276_284424_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Folks don t learn things with their legs do they 
7276_284424_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 No but they can t get around without legs to find out things 
none	none	Cap n Bill got round lively nough once when he had two meat legs she said He s sailed to most ev ry country on
8057_284428_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 the earth 
none	none	an found out all that the people in em knew and a lot besides He was shipwrecked on a desert island once and another time a cannibal king tried to boil him for dinner an one day a shark chased him seven leagues through the water an
7276_284424_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 What s a league asked the boy 
none	none	It s a a distance like a mile is but a league isn t a mile you know
7276_284424_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 What is it then 
none	none	You ll have to ask Cap n Bill he knows ever thing Not ever thing objected the boy I know some things Cap n Bill don t know
7276_284424_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 If you do you re pretty smart said Trot 
7276_284424_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 No I m not smart 
7276_284424_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Some folks think I m stupid 
7276_284424_000062_000002	train-clean-360	I guess I am 
7276_284424_000062_000003	train-clean-360	But I know a few things that are wonderful 
none	none	Cap n Bill may know more n I do a good deal more but I m sure he can t know the same things 
7276_284424_000062_000005	train-clean-360	Say what s your name 
none	none	I m Mayre Griffith but ever body calls me Trot It s a nickname I got when I was a baby cause I trotted so fast when I walked an it seems to stick What s your name Button Bright
7276_284424_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 How did it happen 
7276_284424_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 How did what happen 
7276_284424_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Such a funny name 
7276_284424_000068_000000	train-clean-360	The boy scowled a little 
7276_284424_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Just like your own nickname happened he answered gloomily 
7276_284424_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 My father once said I was bright as a button an it made ever body laugh 
7276_284424_000069_000002	train-clean-360	So they always call me Button Bright 
7276_284424_000070_000000	train-clean-360	 What s your real name she inquired 
none	none	Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith
7276_284424_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 Guess I ll call you Button Bright said Trot sighing 
none	none	The only other thing would be Salad an I don t like salads Don t you find it hard work to member all of your name
7276_284424_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t try to he said 
none	none	There s a lot more of it but I ve forgotten the rest
7276_284424_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank you said Trot 
7276_284424_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 Oh here comes Cap n Bill as she glanced over her shoulder 
7276_284424_000075_000000	train-clean-360	Button Bright turned also and looked solemnly at the old sailor who came stumping along the path toward them 
none	none	Cap n Bill wasn t a very handsome man 
7276_284424_000075_000002	train-clean-360	He was old not very tall somewhat stout and chubby with a round face a bald head and a scraggly fringe of reddish whisker underneath his chin 
none	none	But his blue eyes were frank and merry and his smile like a ray of sunshine He wore a sailor shirt with a broad collar a short peajacket and wide bottomed sailor trousers one leg of which covered his wooden limb but did not hide it As he came pegging along the path as he himself described his hobbling walk his hands were pushed into his coat pockets a pipe was in his mouth and his black neckscarf was fluttering behind him in the breeze like a sable banner 
7276_284424_000076_000000	train-clean-360	Button Bright liked the sailor s looks 
7276_284424_000076_000001	train-clean-360	There was something very winning something jolly and care free and honest and sociable about the ancient seaman that made him everybody s friend so the strange boy was glad to meet him 
7276_284424_000077_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well Trot he said coming up is this the way you hurry to town 
7276_284424_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 No for I m on my way back said she 
none	none	I did hurry when I was going Cap n Bill but on my way home I sat down here to rest an watch the gulls the gulls seem awful busy to day Cap n Bill an then I found this boy 
7276_284424_000079_000000	train-clean-360	Cap n Bill looked at the boy curiously 
none	none	Don t think as ever I sawr him at the village he remarked
7276_284424_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 Guess as you re a stranger my lad 
7276_284424_000081_000000	train-clean-360	Button Bright nodded 
none	none	Hain t walked the nine mile from the railroad station hev ye asked Cap n Bill
7276_284424_000083_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Button Bright 
7276_284424_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Button Bright 
7276_284424_000084_000000	train-clean-360	The sailor glanced around him

7276_284424_000088_000000	train-clean-360	Button Bright shook his head 
none	none	A boat can t land here the rocks is too thick an too sharp continued Cap n Bill peering down toward the foot of the bluff on which they sat and against which the waves broke in foam
7276_284424_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Button Bright I didn t come by water 
7276_284424_000091_000000	train-clean-360	Trot laughed 
none	none	He must a dropped from the sky Cap n Bill she exclaimed 
7276_284424_000093_000000	train-clean-360	Button Bright nodded very seriously 
7276_284424_000094_000000	train-clean-360	 That s it he said

none	none	Both Trot and Cap n Bill now looked at the boy in astonishment Now then lemme think a minute said the sailor reflectively Here s a riddle for us to guess Trot He dropped from the sky he says an yet he did nt come in a airship
7276_284424_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 Riddlecum riddlecum ree What can the answer be 
7276_284424_000100_000000	train-clean-360	Trot looked the boy over carefully 
none	none	She didn t see any wings on him 
7276_284424_000100_000002	train-clean-360	The only queer thing about him was his big umbrella 
7276_284424_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh she said suddenly clapping her hands together I know now 
none	none	Do you asked Cap n Bill doubtfully Then you re some smarter ner I am mate He sailed down with the umbrel she cried He used his umbrel as a para para
7276_284424_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 Shoot said Cap n Bill 
7276_284424_000104_000001	train-clean-360	 They re called parashoots mate but why I can t say 
7276_284424_000104_000002	train-clean-360	Did you drop down in that way my lad he asked the boy 
8190_284433_000080_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Button Bright 
7276_284424_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Button Bright that was the way 
none	none	But how did you get up there asked Trot
7276_284424_000106_000001	train-clean-360	 You had to get up in the air before you could drop down an oh Cap n Bill he says he s from Phillydelfy which is a big city way at the other end of America 
none	none	Are you asked the sailor surprised 
7276_284424_000108_000000	train-clean-360	Button Bright nodded again 
7276_284424_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 I ought to tell you my story he said and then you d understand 
7276_284424_000109_000001	train-clean-360	But I m afraid you won t believe me and he suddenly broke off and looked toward the white house in the distance Didn t you say you lived over there he inquired 
none	none	Yes said Trot
7276_284424_000110_000001	train-clean-360	 Won t you come home with us

7276_284424_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 All right let s go then said the girl jumping up 
7276_284424_000113_000000	train-clean-360	The three walked silently along the path 
7276_284424_000113_000001	train-clean-360	The old sailorman had refilled his pipe and lighted it again and he smoked thoughtfully as he pegged along beside the children 
none	none	Know anyone around here he asked Button Bright
7276_284424_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 No one but you two said the boy following after Trot with his umbrella tucked carefully underneath his arm

none	none	I said I wish I could fly through the air to Uncle Bob s I was holding up the open umbrella when I said that and as soon as I spoke the umbrella began lifting me up into the air I was awful scared at first but I held on tight to the handle and it didn t pull very much either I was going pretty fast for when I looked down all the big buildings were sliding past me so swift that it made me dizzy and before I really knew what had happened the umbrella settled down and stood me on my feet at Uncle Bob s front gate I didn t tell anybody about the wonderful thing that had happened cause I thought no one would believe me Uncle Bob looked sharp at the thing an said Button Bright how did your father happen to let you take that umbrella He didn t I said Father was away at the office so I found it in the attic an I jus took it Then Uncle Bob shook his head an said I ought to leave it alone He said it was a fam ly relic that had been handed down from father to son for many generations But I told him my father had never handed it to me though I m his son Uncle Bob said our fam ly always believed that it brought em good luck to own this umbrella He couldn t say why not knowing its early history but he was afraid that if I lost the umbrella bad luck would happen to us So he made me go right home to put the umbrella back where I got it I was sorry Uncle Bob was so cross and I didn t want to go home yet where the governess was crosser n he was I wonder why folks get cross when it rains But by that time it had stopped raining for awhile anyhow and Uncle Bob told me to go straight home and put the umbrella in the attic an never touch it again When I was around the corner I thought I d see if I could fly as I had before I d heard of Buffalo but I didn t know just where it was so I said to the umbrella Take me to Buffalo Up in the air I went just as soon as I said it and the umbrella sailed so fast that I felt as if I was in a gale of wind It was a long long trip and I got awful tired holding onto the handle but just as I thought I d have to let go I began to drop down slowly and then I found myself in the streets of a big city I put down the umbrella and asked a man what the name of the city was and he said Buffalo How wonderful gasped Trot Cap n Bill kept on smoking and said nothing It was magic I m sure said Button Bright It surely couldn t have been anything else P raps suggested Trot the umbrella can do other magic things No said the boy I ve tried it When I landed in Buffalo I was hot and thirsty I had ten cents car fare but I was afraid to spend it So I held up the umbrella and wished I had an ice cream soda but I didn t get it Then I wished for a nickel to buy an ice cream soda with but I didn t get that either I got frightened and was afraid the umbrella didn t have any magic left so to try it I said Take me to Chicago I didn t want to go to Chicago but that was the first place I thought of and so I said it Up again I flew swifter than a bird and I soon saw this was going to be another long journey so I called out to the umbrella Never mind stop I guess I won t go to Chicago I ve changed my mind so take me home again But the umbrella wouldn t It kept right on flying and I shut my eyes and held on At last I landed in Chicago and then I was in a pretty fix It was nearly dark and I was too tired and hungry to make the trip home again I knew I d get an awful scolding too for running away and taking the family luck with me so I thought that as long as I was in for it I d better see a good deal of the country while I had the chance I wouldn t be allowed to come away again you know No of course not said Trot I bought some buns and milk with my ten cents and then I walked around the streets of Chicago for a time and afterward slept on a bench in one of the parks In the morning I tried to get the umbrella to give me a magic breakfast but it won t do anything but fly I went to a house and asked a woman for something to eat and she gave me all I wanted and advised me to go straight home before my mother worried about me She didn t know I lived in Philadelphia That was this morning This mornin exclaimed Cap n Bill Why lad it takes three or four days for the railroad trains to get to this coast from Chicago I know replied Button Bright but I didn t come on a railroad train This umbrella goes faster than any train ever did This morning I flew from Chicago to Denver but no one there would give me any lunch A policeman said he d put me in jail if he caught me begging so I got away and told the umbrella to take me to the Pacific Ocean When I stopped I landed over there by the big rock I shut up the umbrella and saw a girl sitting on the rock so I went up and spoke to her That s all Goodness me said Trot if that isn t a fairy story I never heard one It is a fairy story agreed Button Bright Anyhow it s a magic story and the funny part of it is it s true I hope you believe me but I don t know as I d believe it myself if it hadn t been me that it happened to I believe ev ry word of it declared Trot earnestly As fer me said Cap n Bill slowly I m goin to believe it too by m by when I ve seen the umbrel fly once You ll see me fly away with it asserted the boy But at present it s pretty late in the day and Philadelphia is a good way off Do you s pose Trot your mother would let me stay here all night Course she would answered Trot We ve got an extra room with a nice bed in it and we d love to have you stay just as long as you want to wouldn t we Cap n Bill Right you are mate replied the old man nodding his bald head Whether the umbrel is magic or not Butt n Bright is welcome missus Griffith came out soon after and seconded the invitation so the boy felt quite at home in the little cottage It was not long before supper was on the table and in spite of all the bread and butter he had eaten Button Bright had a fine appetite for the good things Trot s mother had cooked missus Griffith was very kind to the children but not quite so agreeable toward poor Cap n Bill When the old sailorman at one time spilled some tea on the tablecloth Trot s mother flew angry and gave the culprit such a tongue lashing that Button Bright was sorry for him But Cap n Bill was meek and made no reply He s used to it you know whispered Trot to her new friend and indeed Cap n Bill took it all cheerfully and never minded a bit Then it came Trot s turn to get a scolding When she opened the parcel she had bought at the village it was found she had selected the wrong color of yarn and missus Griffith was so provoked that Trot s scolding was almost as severe as that of Cap n Bill Tears came to the little girl s eyes and to comfort her the boy promised to take her to the village next morning with his magic umbrella so she could exchange the yarn for the right color Trot quickly brightened at this promise although Cap n Bill looked grave and shook his head solemnly When supper was over and Trot had helped with the dishes she joined Button Bright and the sailorman on the little porch again Dusk had fallen and the moon was just rising They all sat in silence for a time and watched the silver trail that topped the crests of the waves far out to sea Oh Button Bright cried the little girl presently I m so glad you re going to let me fly with you way to town and back to morrow Won t it be fine Cap n Bill Dunno Trot said he I can t figger how both o you can hold on to the handle o that umbrel Trot s face fell I ll hold on to the handle said Button Bright and she can hold on to me It doesn t pull hard at all You ve no idea how easy it is to fly that way after you get used to it But Trot ain t used to it objected the sailor If she happened to lose her hold and let go it s good bye Trot I don t like to risk it for Trot s my chum an I can t afford to lose her Can t you tie us together then asked the boy We ll see we ll see replied Cap n Bill and began to think very deeply He forgot that he didn t believe the umbrella could fly and after Button Bright and Trot had both gone to bed the old sailor went out into the shed and worked awhile before he too turned into his bunk The sandman wasn t around and Cap n Bill lay awake for hours thinking of the strange tale of the Magic Umbrella before he finally sank into slumber Then he dreamed about it and waking or dreaming he found the tale hard to believe Illustration A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE CHAPTER three They had early breakfasts at Trot s house because they all went to bed early and it is possible to sleep only a certain number of hours if one is healthy in body and mind And right after breakfast Trot claimed Button Bright s promise to take her to town with the Magic Umbrella Any time suits me said the boy He had taken his precious umbrella to bed with him and even carried it to the breakfast table where he stood it between his knees as he ate so now he held it close to him and said he was ready to fly at a moment s notice This confidence impressed Cap n Bill who said with a sigh Well if you must go Trot I ve pervided a machine that ll carry you both comf table I m summat of an inventor myself though there ain t any magic about me Then he brought from the shed the contrivance he had made the night before It was merely a swing seat He had taken a wide board that was just long enough for both the boy and girl to sit upon and had bored six holes in it two holes at each end and two in the middle Through these holes he had run stout ropes in such a way that the seat could not turn and the occupants could hold on to the ropes on either side of them The ropes were all knotted together at the top where there was a loop that could be hooked upon the crooked handle of the umbrella Illustration Button Bright and Trot both thought Cap n Bill s invention very clever The sailor placed the board upon the ground while they sat in their places Button Bright at the right of Trot and then the boy hooked the rope loop to the handle of the umbrella which he spread wide open I want to go to the town over yonder he said pointing with his finger to the roofs of the houses that showed around the bend in the cliff At once the umbrella rose into the air slowly at first but quickly gathering speed Trot and Button Bright held fast to the ropes and were carried along very easily and comfortably It seemed scarcely a minute before they were in the town and when the umbrella set them down just in front of the store for it seemed to know just where they wanted to go a wondering crowd gathered around them Trot ran in and changed the yarn while Button Bright stayed outside and stared at the people who stared at him They asked questions too wanting to know what sort of an aeroplane this was and where his power was stored and lots of other things but the boy answered not a word When the little girl came back and took her seat Button Bright said I want to go to Trot s house The simple villagers could not understand how the umbrella suddenly lifted the two children into the air and carried them away They had read of airships but here was something wholly beyond their comprehension Cap n Bill had stood in front of the house watching with a feeling akin to bewilderment the flight of the Magic Umbrella He could follow its course until it descended in the village and he was so amazed and absorbed that his pipe went out He had not moved from his position when the umbrella started back The sailor s big blue eyes watched it draw near and settle down with its passengers upon just the spot it had started from Trot was joyous and greatly excited Oh Cap n it s gal lor ious she cried in ecstasy It beats ridin in a boat or or in anything else You feel so light an free an an glad I m sorry the trip didn t last longer though Only trouble is you go too fast Button Bright was smiling contentedly He had proved to both Trot and Cap n Bill that he had told the truth about the Magic Umbrella however marvelous his tale had seemed to them I ll take you on another trip if you like said he I m in no hurry to go home and if you will let me stay with you another day we can make two or three little trips with the family luck You mus stay a whole week said Trot decidedly An you mus take Cap n Bill for an air ride too Oh Trot I dunno as I d like it protested Cap n Bill nervously Yes you would You re sure to like it I guess I m too heavy he said I m sure the umbrella could carry twenty people if they could be fastened to the handle said Button Bright Solid land s pretty good to hold on to decided Cap n Bill A rope might break you know Oh Cap n Bill You re scared stiff said Trot I ain t mate it ain t that at all But I don t see that human critters has any call to fly in the air anyhow The air were made for the birds an an muskeeters an An flyin fishes added Trot I know all that Cap n but why wasn t it made for humans too if they can manage to fly in it We breathe the air an we can breathe it high up just as well as down on the earth Seein as you like it so much Trot it would be cruel for me to go with Butt n Bright an leave you at home said the sailor When I were younger which is ancient history an afore I had a wooden leg I could climb a ship s ropes with the best of em an walk out on a boom or stand atop a mast So you know very well I ain t skeert about the highupness Why can t we all go together asked the boy Make another seat Cap n and swing it right under ours then we can all three ride anywhere we want to go Yes do exclaimed Trot And see here Cap n let s take a day off and have a picnic Mother is a little cross to day and she wants to finish knitting your new stockin so I guess she ll be glad to get rid of us Where ll we go he asked shifting on his wooden leg uneasily Anywhere I don t care There ll be the air ride there an the air ride back an that s the main thing with me If you say you ll go Cap n I ll run in an pack a basket of lunch How ll we carry it Swing it to the bottom of your seat The old sailor stood silent a moment He really longed to take the air ride but was fearful of danger However Trot had gone safely to town and back and had greatly enjoyed the experience All right he said I ll risk it mate although I guess I m an old fool for temptin fate by tryin to make a bird o myself Get the lunch Trot if your mother ll let you have it and I ll rig up the seat He went into the shed and Trot went to her mother missus Griffith busy with her work knew nothing of what was going on in regard to the flight of the Magic Umbrella She never objected when Trot wanted to go away with Cap n Bill for a day s picnicking She knew the child was perfectly safe with the old sailor who cared for Trot even better than her mother would have done If she had asked any questions to day and had found out they intended to fly in the air she might have seriously objected but missus Griffith had her mind on other things and merely told the girl to take what she wanted from the cupboard and not bother her So Trot remembering that Button Bright would be with them and had proved himself to be a hearty eater loaded the basket with all the good things she could find By the time she came out lugging the basket with both hands Cap n Bill appeared with the new seat he had made for his own use which he attached by means of ropes to the double seat of the boy and girl Now then where ll we go asked Trot Anywhere suits me replied Cap n Bill They had walked to the high bluff overlooking the sea where a gigantic acacia tree stood on the very edge A seat had been built around the trunk of the tree for this was a favorite spot for Trot and Cap n Bill to sit and talk and watch the fleet of fishing boats sail to and from the village When they came to this tree Trot was still trying to think of the most pleasant place to picnic She and Cap n Bill had been every place that was desirable and near by but to day they didn t want a near by spot They must decide upon one far enough away to afford them a fine trip through the air Looking far out over the Pacific the girl s eyes fell upon a dim island lying on the horizon line just where the sky and water seemed to meet and the sight gave her an idea Oh Cap n Bill she exclaimed let s go to that island for our picnic We ve never been there yet you know The sailor shook his head It s a good many miles away Trot he said further than it looks to be from here That won t matter remarked Button Bright the umbrella will carry us there in no time Let s go repeated Trot We ll never have another such chance Cap n It s too far to sail or row and I ve always wanted to visit that island What s the name of it inquired Button Bright while the sailor hesitated how to decide Oh it s got an awful hard name to pernounce replied the girl so Cap n Bill and I jus call it Sky Island cause it looks as if it was half in the sky We ve been told it s a very pretty island and a few people live there and keep cows and goats and fish for a living There are woods and pastures and springs of clear water and I m sure we would find it a fine place for a picnic If anything happened on the way observed Cap n Bill we d drop in the water Of course said Trot and if anything happened while we were flyin over the land we d drop there But nothing s goin to happen Cap n Didn t Button Bright come safe all the way from Philydelfy I think I d like to go to Sky Island said the boy I ve always flown above the land so far and it will be something new to fly over the ocean All right I m agree ble decided Cap n Bill But afore we starts on such a long journey s pose we make a little trial trip along the coast I want to see if the new seat fits me an make certain the umbrel will carry all three of us Very well said Button Bright Where shall we go Let s go as far as Smuggler s Cove an then turn round an come back If all s right an shipshape then we can start for the island They put the broad double seat on the ground and then the boy and girl sat in their places and Button Bright spread open the Magic Umbrella Cap n Bill sat in his seat just in front of them all being upon the ground Don t we look funny said Trot with a chuckle of glee But hold fast the ropes Cap n an take care of your wooden leg Button Bright addressed the umbrella speaking to it very respectfully for it was a thing to inspire awe I want to go as far as Smuggler s Cove and then turn around in the air and come back here he said At once the umbrella rose into the air lifting after it first the seat in which the children sat and then Cap n Bill s seat Don t kick your heels Trot cried the sailor in a voice that proved he was excited by his novel experience you might bump me in the nose All right she called back I ll be careful It was really a wonderful exhilarating ride and Cap n Bill wasn t long making up his mind he liked the sensation When about fifty feet above the ground the umbrella began moving along the coast toward Smuggler s Cove which it soon reached Looking downward Cap n Bill suddenly exclaimed Why there s a boat cast loose an it s goin to smash on the rocks Hold on a minute Butt n Bright till we can land an drag it ashore Hold on a minute Umbrella cried the boy But the Magic Umbrella kept steadily upon its way It made a circle over the Cove and then started straight back the way it had come It s no use sir said Button Bright to the sailor If I once tell it to go to a certain place the umbrella will go there and nowhere else I ve found that out before this You simply can t stop it Won t let you change your mind eh replied Cap n Bill Well that has its advantidges an its disadvantidges If your ol umbrel hadn t been so obstinate we could have saved that boat Never mind said Trot briskly here we are safe back again Wasn t it jus the the fascinatingest ride you ever took Cap n It s pretty good fun admitted Cap n Bill Beats them aeroplanes an things all holler cause it don t need any regulatin If we re going to that island we may as well start right away said Button Bright when they had safely landed All right I ll tie on the lunch basket answered the sailor He fastened it so it would swing underneath his own seat and then they all took their places again Ready asked the boy Let er go my lad I want to go to Sky Island said Button Bright to the umbrella using the name Trot had given him The umbrella started promptly It rose higher than before carrying the three voyagers with it and then started straight away over the ocean Illustration Illustration THE ISLAND IN THE SKY CHAPTER four They clung tightly to the ropes but the breeze was with them so after a few moments when they became accustomed to the motion they began to enjoy the ride immensely Larger and larger grew the island and although they were headed directly toward it the umbrella seemed to rise higher and higher into the air the farther it traveled They had not journeyed ten minutes before they came directly over the island and looking down they could see the forests and meadows far below them But the umbrella kept up its rapid flight Hold on there cried Cap n Bill If it ain t keerful the ol thing will pass way by the island I I m sure it has passed it already exclaimed Trot What s wrong Button Bright Why don t we stop Button Bright seemed astonished too Perhaps I didn t say it right he replied after a moment s thought Then looking up at the umbrella he repeated distinctly I said I wanted to go to Sky Island Sky Island don t you understand The umbrella swept steadily along getting farther and farther out to sea and rising higher and higher toward the clouds Mack rel an herrings roared Cap n Bill now really frightened ain t there any blamed way at all to stop her None that I know of said Button Bright anxiously P raps said Trot after a pause during which she tried hard to think p raps Sky Island isn t the name of that island at all Why we know very well it ain t the name of it yelled Cap n Bill from below We jus called it that cause its right name is too hard to say That s the whole trouble then returned Button Bright Somewhere in the world there s a real Sky Island and having told the Magic Umbrella to take us there it s going to do so Well I declare gasped the sailorman can t we land anywhere else Not unless you care to tumble off said the boy I ve told the umbrella to take us to Sky Island so that s the exact place we re bound for I m sorry It was your fault for giving me the wrong name They glided along in silence for a while The island was now far behind them growing small in the distance Where do you s pose the real Sky Island can be asked Trot presently We can t tell anything about it until we get there Button Bright answered Seems to me I ve heard of the Isle of Skye but that s over in Great Britain somewhere the other side of the world and it isn t Sky Island anyhow This miser ble ol umbrel is too pertic ler growled Cap n Bill It won t let you change your mind an it goes ezzac ly where you say If it didn t said Trot we d never know where we were going We don t know now said the sailor One thing s certain folks we re gett n a long way from home And see how the clouds are rolling just above us remarked the boy who was almost as uneasy as Cap n Bill We re in the sky all right said the girl If there could be an island up here among the clouds I d think it was there we re going Couldn t there be one asked Button Bright Why couldn t there be an island in the sky that would be named Sky Island Of course not declared Cap n Bill There wouldn t be anything to hold it up you know What s holding us up asked Trot Magic I guess Then magic might hold an island in the sky Whee e e e what a black cloud It grew suddenly dark for they were rushing through a thick cloud that rolled around them in billows Trot felt little drops of moisture striking her face and knew her clothing was getting damp and soggy Illustration It s a rain cloud she said to Button Bright and it seems like an awful big one cause it takes so long for us to pass through it The umbrella never hesitated a moment It made a path through the length of the heavy black cloud at last and carried its passengers into a misty billowy bank of white which seemed as soft and fleecy as a lady s veil When this broke away they caught sight of a majestic rainbow spanning the heavens its gorgeous colors glinting brightly in the sun its arch perfect and unbroken from end to end But it was only a glimpse they had for quickly they dove into another bank of clouds and the rainbow disappeared Here the clouds were not black nor heavy but they assumed queer shapes Some were like huge ships some like forest trees and others piled themselves into semblances of turreted castles and wonderful palaces The shapes shifted here and there continually and the voyagers began to be bewildered by the phantoms Seems to me we re goin down called Trot Down where asked Cap n Bill Who knows said Button Bright But we re dropping all right It was a gradual descent The Magic Umbrella maintained a uniform speed swift and unfaltering but its path through the heavens was now in the shape of an arch as a flying arrow falls The queer shapes of the clouds continued for some time and once or twice Trot was a little frightened when a monstrous airy dragon passed beside them or a huge giant stood upon a peak of cloud and stared savagely at the intruders into his domain But none of these fanciful vapory creatures seemed inclined to molest them or to interfere with their flight and after a while the umbrella dipped below this queer cloudland and entered a clear space where the sky was of an exquisite blue color Oh look called Cap n Bill There s land below us The boy and girl leaned over and tried to see this land but Cap n Bill was also leaning over and his big body hid all that was just underneath them Is it an island asked Trot anxiously Seems so the old sailor replied The blue is around all one side of it an a pink sunshine around the other side There s a big cloud just over the middle but I guess it s surely an island Trot an bein as it s in the sky it s likely to be Sky Island Then we shall land there said the boy confidently I knew the umbrella couldn t make a mistake Presently Cap n Bill spoke again We re goin down on the blue part o the island he said I can see trees an ponds an houses Hold tight Trot Hold tight Butt n Bright I m afeared we re a goin to bump somethin They were certainly dropping very quickly now and the rush of air made their eyes fill with water so that they could not see much below them Suddenly the basket that was dangling below Cap n Bill s seat struck something with a loud thud and this was followed by a yell of anger Cap n Bill sat flat upon the ground landing with a force that jarred the sailorman and made his teeth click together while down upon him came the seat that Trot and Button Bright occupied so that for a moment they were all tangled up Get off from me Get off from my feet I say cried an excited voice What in the Sky do you mean by sitting on my feet Get off Get off at once Illustration Illustration THE BOOLOOROO OF THE BLUES CHAPTER five Cap n Bill suspected that these remarks were addressed to him but he couldn t move just then because the seat was across him and a boy and girl were sprawling on the seat As the Magic Umbrella was now as motionless as any ordinary umbrella might be Button Bright first released the catch and closed it up after which he unhooked the crooked handle from the rope and rose to his feet Trot had managed by this time to stand up and she pulled the board off from Cap n Bill All this time the shrill excited voice was loudly complaining because the sailor was on his feet and Trot looked to see who was making the protest while Cap n Bill rolled over and got on his hands and knees so he could pull his meat leg and his wooden leg into an upright position which wasn t a very easy thing to do Button Bright and Trot were staring with all their might at the queerest person they had ever seen They decided it must be a man because he had two long legs a body as round as a ball a neck like an ostrich and a comical little head set on the top of it But the most curious thing about him was his skin which was of a lovely sky blue tint His eyes were also sky blue and his hair which was trained straight up and ended in a curl at the top of his head was likewise blue in color and matched his skin and his eyes He wore tight fitting clothes made of sky blue silk with a broad blue ruffle around his long neck and on his breast glittered a magnificent jewel in the form of a star set with splendid blue stones If the blue man astonished the travelers they were no less surprised by his surroundings for look where they might everything they beheld was of the same blue color as the sky above They seemed to have landed in a large garden surrounded by a high wall of blue stone The trees were all blue the grass was blue the flowers were blue and even the pebbles in the paths were blue There were many handsomely carved benches and seats of blue wood scattered about the garden and near them stood a fountain made of blue marble which shot lovely sprays of blue water into the blue air But the angry inhabitant of this blue place would not permit them to look around them in peace for as soon as Cap n Bill rolled off his toes he began dancing around in an excited way and saying very disrespectful things of his visitors

none	none	Your country exclaimed the Boolooroo looking at them more carefully and seeming interested in their appearance
8057_284428_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 Where in the Sky did you come from then and where is your country located 
8057_284428_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 We live on the Earth when we re at home replied the girl 
none	none	The Earth Nonsense 
8057_284428_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I ve heard of the Earth my child but it isn t inhabited 
none	none	No one can live there because it s just a round cold barren ball of mud and water declared the Blueskin
8057_284428_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh you re wrong about that said Button Bright 
8057_284428_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 You surely are added Cap n Bill 
none	none	Why we live there ourselves cried Trot
8057_284428_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe it 
none	none	I believe you are living in Sky Island where you have no right to be with your horrid white skins And you ve intruded into the private garden of the palace of the Greatly Stately Irately Boolooroo which is a criminal offense and you ve bumped my head with your basket and smashed my toes with your boards and bodies which is a crime unparalleled in all the history of Sky Island 
8057_284428_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Aren t you sorry for yourselves 
none	none	I m sorry for you replied Trot cause you don t seem to know the proper way to treat visitors But we won t stay long 
8057_284428_000022_000002	train-clean-360	We ll go home pretty soon 
none	none	Not until you have been punished exclaimed the Boolooroo sternly You are my prisoners Beg parding your Majesty said Cap n Bill but you re takin a good deal for granted We ve tried to be friendly an peaceable an we ve poligized for hurtin you but if that don t satisfy you you ll have to make the most of it You may be the Boolooroo of the Blues but you ain t even a tin whistle to us an you can t skeer us for half a minute 
8057_284428_000024_000003	train-clean-360	I m an ol man myself but if you don t behave I ll spank you like I would a baby an it won t be any trouble at all to do it thank e 
none	none	As a matter o fact we ve captured your whole bloomin blue island but we don t like the place very much and I guess we ll give it back It gives us the blues don t it Trot so as soon as we eat a bite o lunch from our basket we ll
8057_284428_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 sail away 
none	none	again Sail away 
8057_284428_000025_000001	train-clean-360	How asked the Boolooroo 
none	none	With the Magic Umbrel said Cap n Bill pointing to the umbrella that Button Bright was holding underneath his arm Oh ho I see I see said the Boolooroo nodding his funny head
8057_284428_000027_000002	train-clean-360	 Go ahead then and eat your lunch 
8057_284428_000028_000000	train-clean-360	He retreated a little way to a marble seat beside the fountain but watched the strangers carefully 
none	none	Cap n Bill feeling sure he had won the argument whispered to the boy and girl that they must eat and get away as soon as possible as this might prove a dangerous country for them to remain in Trot longed to see more of the strange blue island and especially wanted to explore the magnificent blue palace that adjoined the garden and which had six hundred tall towers and turrets but she felt that her old friend was wise in advising them to get away quickly So she opened the basket and they all three sat in a row on a stone bench and began to eat sandwiches and cake and pickles and cheese and all the good things that were packed in the lunch basket They were hungry from the long ride and while they ate they kept their eyes busily employed in examining all the queer things around them The Boolooroo seemed quite the queerest of anything and Trot noticed that when he pulled the long curl that stuck up from the top of his head a bell tinkled somewhere in the palace He next pulled at the bottom of his right ear and another far away bell tinkled then he touched the end of his nose and still another bell was faintly heard The Boolooroo said not a word while he was ringing the bells and Trot wondered if that was the way he amused himself But now the frown died away from his face and was replaced by a look of satisfaction
8057_284428_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you nearly finished he inquired 
8057_284428_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Trot we ve got to eat our apples yet 
8057_284428_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Apples apples 
8057_284428_000032_000001	train-clean-360	What are apples he asked 
8057_284428_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Trot took some from the basket 
none	none	Have one she said
8057_284428_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 They re awful good 
none	none	The Boolooroo advanced a step and took the apple which he regarded with much curiosity
8057_284428_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Guess they don t grow anywhere but on the Earth remarked Cap n Bill 
8057_284428_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Are they good to eat asked the Boolooroo 
8057_284428_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Try it and see answered Trot biting into an apple herself 
none	none	The Blueskin sat down on the end of their bench next to Button Bright and began to eat his apple He seemed to like it for he finished it in a hurry and when it was gone he picked up the Magic Umbrella Let that alone said Button Bright making a grab for it But the Boolooroo jerked it away in an instant and standing up he held the umbrella behind him and laughed aloud Now then said he you can t get away until I m willing to let you go You are my prisoners I guess not returned Cap n Bill and reaching out one of his long arms the sailorman suddenly grasped the Boolooroo around his long thin neck and shook him until his whole body fluttered like a flag Drop that umbrel drop it yelled Cap n Bill and the Boolooroo quickly obeyed 
8057_284428_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The Magic Umbrella fell to the ground and Button Bright promptly seized it 
8057_284428_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Then the sailor let go his hold and the King staggered to a seat choking and coughing to get his breath back 
8057_284428_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I told you to let things alone growled Cap n Bill 
8057_284428_000044_000001	train-clean-360	 If you don t behave your Majesty this Blue Island ll have to get another Boolooroo 
8057_284428_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Why asked the Blueskin 
none	none	Because I ll prob ly spoil you for a king an mebbe for anything else Anyhow you ll get badly damaged if you try to interfere with us an that s a fact Don t kill him Cap n Bill said Trot cheerfully
8057_284428_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Kill me 
8057_284428_000048_000001	train-clean-360	Why he couldn t do that observed the King who was trying to rearrange the ruffle around his neck 
8057_284428_000048_000002	train-clean-360	 Nothing can kill me 
8057_284428_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not asked Cap n Bill 
none	none	Because I haven t lived my six hundred years yet Perhaps you don t know that every Blueskin in Sky Island lives exactly six hundred years from the time he is born No I didn t know that admitted the sailor
8057_284428_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a fact said the King 
none	none	Nothing can kill us until we ve lived to the last day of our appointed lives 
8057_284428_000052_000002	train-clean-360	When the final minute is up we die but we re obliged to live all of the six hundred years whether we want to or not 
none	none	So you needn t think of trying to kill anybody on Sky Island 
8057_284428_000052_000004	train-clean-360	It can t be done 
none	none	Never mind said Cap n Bill
8057_284428_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 I m no murderer thank goodness and I wouldn t kill you if I could much as you deserve it 
none	none	But isn t six hundred years an awful long time to live questioned Trot It seems like it at first replied the King but I notice that whenever any of my subjects get near the end of their six hundred they grow nervous and say the life is altogether too short
8057_284428_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 How long have you lived asked Button Bright 
none	none	The King coughed again and turned a bit bluer That is considered an impertinent question in Sky Island he answered but I will say that every Boolooroo is elected to reign three hundred years and I ve reigned not quite ahem two hundred Are your kings elected then asked Cap n Bill Yes of course this is a Republic you know The people elect all their officers from the King down Every man and every woman is a voter 
8057_284428_000060_000003	train-clean-360	The Boolooroo tells them whom to vote for and if they don t obey they are severely punished 
none	none	It s a fine system of government and the only thing I object to is electing the Boolooroo for only three hundred years 
8057_284428_000060_000005	train-clean-360	It ought to be for life 
none	none	My successor has already been elected but he can t reign for a hundred years to come I think three hundred years is plenty long enough said Trot It gives some one else a chance to rule an I wouldn t be s prised if the next king is a better one Seems to me you re not much of a Boolooroo That replied the King indignantly is a matter of opinion I like myself very much but I can t expect you to like me because you re deformed and ignorant I m not cried Trot
8057_284428_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes you are 
none	none	Your legs are too short and your neck is nothing at all Your color is most peculiar but there isn t a shade of blue about any of you except the deep blue color of the clothes the old ape that choked me wears Also you are ignorant because you know nothing of Sky Island which is the Center of the Universe and the only place anyone would care to live Don t listen to him Trot said Button Bright he s an ignorant himself Cap n Bill packed up the lunch basket One end of the rope was still tied to the handle of the basket and the other end to his swing seat which lay on the ground before them
8057_284428_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said he let s go home 
none	none	We ve seen enough of this Blue Country and its Blue Boolooroo I guess an it s a long journey back again
8057_284428_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 All right agreed Trot jumping up 
none	none	Button Bright stood on the bench and held up the Magic Umbrella so he could open it and the sailor had just attached the ropes when a thin blue line shot out from behind them and in a twinkling wound itself around the umbrella At the same instant another blue cord wound itself around the boy s body and others caught Trot and Cap n Bill in their coils so that all had their arms pinned fast to their sides and found themselves absolutely helpless Illustration THE SIX SNUBNOSED PRINCESSES CHAPTER six The Boolooroo was laughing and dancing around in front of them as if well pleased For a moment the prisoners could not imagine what had happened to them but presently half a dozen Blueskins resembling in shape and costume their ruler but less magnificently dressed stepped in front of them and bowed low to the Boolooroo Your orders most Mighty Flighty Tight and Righty Monarch have been obeyed said the leader Very well Captain 
5471-284429-0000	train-other-500	Take that umbrella and carry it to my Royal Treasury See that it is safely locked up Here s the key and if you don t return it to me within five minutes I ll have you patched The Captain took the key and the Magic Umbrella
5471-284429-0001	train-other-500	and hastened away to the palace Button Bright had already hooked the ropes to the elephant trunk handle so that when the Captain carried away the umbrella he dragged after him first the double seat then Cap n Bill s seat which was fastened to it
5471-284429-0002	train-other-500	and finally the lunch basket which was attached to the lower seat At every few steps some of these would trip up the Captain and cause him to take a tumble
none	none	 but as he had only five minutes time in which to perform his errand 
5471-284429-0003	train-other-500	he would scramble to his feet again and dash along the path until a board or the basket tripped him again
none	none	 They all watched him with interest until he had disappeared within the palace 
5471-284429-0004	train-other-500	when the King turned to his men and said Release the prisoners They are now quite safe and cannot escape me So the men unwound the long cords that were twined around the bodies of our three friends and set them free
5471-284429-0005	train-other-500	These men seemed to be soldiers although they bore no arms except the cords Each cord had a weight at the end and when the weight was skillfully thrown by a soldier it wound the cord around anything in the twinkling of an eye
5471-284429-0006	train-other-500	and held fast until it was unwound again Trot decided these Blueskins must have stolen into the garden when summoned by the bells the Boolooroo had rung but they had kept out of sight and crept up behind the bench on which our friends were seated
5471-284429-0007	train-other-500	until a signal from the king aroused them to action The little girl was greatly surprised by the suddenness of her capture and so was Button Bright Cap n Bill shook his head and said he was afeared they d get into trouble Our mistake he added
5471-284429-0008	train-other-500	was in stoppin to eat our lunch But it s too late now to cry over spilt milk I don t mind not much anyhow asserted Trot bravely
none	none	 We re in no hurry to get back are we Button Bright Illustration I m not said the boy 
5471-284429-0009	train-other-500	If they hadn t taken the umbrella I wouldn t care how long we stopped in this funny island Do you think it s a fairy country Trot Can t say I m sure she answered I haven t seen anything here yet that reminds me of fairies
5471-284429-0010	train-other-500	but Cap n Bill said a floating island in the sky was sure to be a fairyland I think so yet mate returned the sailor But there s all sorts o fairies I ve heard Some is good an some is bad
5471-284429-0011	train-other-500	an if all the Blueskins are like their Boolooroo they can t be called fust class Don t let me hear any more impudence prisoners called the Boolooroo sternly
none	none	 You are already condemned to severe punishment and if I have any further trouble with you 
5471-284429-0012	train-other-500	you are liable to be patched What s being patched inquired the girl The soldiers all laughed at this question but the King did not reply Just then a door in the palace opened and out trooped a group of girls
5471-284429-0013	train-other-500	There were six of them all gorgeously dressed in silken gowns with many puffs and tucks and ruffles and flounces and laces and ribbons everything being in some shade of blue
5471-284429-0014	train-other-500	grading from light blue to deep blue Their blue hair was elaborately dressed and came to a point at the top of their heads The girls approached in a line along the garden path all walking with mincing steps and holding their chins high
5471-284429-0015	train-other-500	Their skirts prevented their long legs from appearing as grotesque as did those of the men but their necks were so thin and long that the ruffles around them only made them seem the more absurd Ah said the King with a frown
5471-284429-0016	train-other-500	here come the Six Snubnosed Princesses the most beautiful and aristocratic ladies in Sky Island They re snubnosed all right observed Trot looking at the girls with much interest
5471-284429-0017	train-other-500	but I should think it would make em mad to call em that Why asked the Boolooroo in surprise
none	none	 Is not a snubnose the highest mark of female beauty 
5471-284429-0018	train-other-500	Is it asked the girl Most certainly In this favored island which is the Center of the Universe
none	none	 a snubnose is an evidence of high breeding which any lady would be proud to possess Illustration The Six Snubnosed Princesses now approached the fountain and stood in a row staring with haughty looks at the strangers 
5471-284429-0019	train-other-500	Goodness me your Majesty exclaimed the first what queer dreadful looking creatures are these Where in all the Sky did they come from
none	none	 They say they came from the Earth Cerulia answered the Boolooroo 
5471-284429-0020	train-other-500	But that is impossible said another Princess Our scientists have proved that the Earth is not inhabited Your scientists ll have to guess again then said Trot But how did they get to Sky Island
5471-284429-0021	train-other-500	inquired the third snubnosed one By means of a Magic Umbrella which I have captured and put away in my Treasure Chamber replied the Boolooroo
none	none	 What will you do with the monsters papa 
5471-284429-0022	train-other-500	asked the fourth Princess I haven t decided yet said the Boolooroo They re curiosities you see and may serve to amuse us But as they re only half civilized I shall make them my slaves What are they good for
5471-284429-0023	train-other-500	Can they do anything useful asked the fifth We ll see returned the King impatiently I can t decide in a hurry Give me time Azure give me time If there s anything I hate it s a hurry
5471-284429-0024	train-other-500	I ve an idea your Majesty announced the sixth Snubnosed Princess whose complexion was rather darker than that of her sisters and it has come to me quite deliberately without any hurry at all
none	none	 Let us take the little girl to be our maid 
5471-284429-0025	train-other-500	to wait upon us and amuse us when we re dull
none	none	 All the other ladies of the court will be wild with envy and if the child doesn t prove of use to us 
5471-284429-0026	train-other-500	we can keep her for a living pincushion Oh Ah That will be fine cried all the other five and the Boolooroo said Very well Indigo it shall be as you desire Then he turned to Trot and added
8591_284444_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 That will be fine 
none	none	cried all the other five and the Boolooroo said Very well Indigo it shall be as you desire Then he turned to Trot and added 
5471-284429-0027	train-other-500	I present you to the Six Lovely Snubnosed Princesses to be their slave If you are good and obedient you won t get your ears boxed oftener than once an hour I won t be anybody s slave protested Trot
5471-284429-0028	train-other-500	I don t like these snubnosed fussy females an I won t have anything to do with em How impudent cried Cerulia How vulgar cried Turquoise How unladylike cried Sapphire
5471-284429-0029	train-other-500	How silly cried Azure How absurd cried Cobalt How wicked cried Indigo And then all six held up their hands as if horrified The Boolooroo laughed
5471-284429-0030	train-other-500	You ll know how to bring her to time I imagine he remarked and if the girl isn t reasonable and obedient send her to me and I ll have her patched Now then take her away But Trot was obstinate and wouldn t budge a step
5471-284429-0031	train-other-500	Keep us together your Majesty begged Cap n Bill If we re to be slaves don t separate us but make us all the same kind o slaves I shall do what pleases me declared the Boolooroo angrily Don t try to dictate old Moonface
none	none	 for there s only one Royal Will in Sky Island and that s my own He then gave a command to a soldier who hastened away to the palace and soon returned with a number of long blue ribbons 
5471-284429-0032	train-other-500	One he tied around Trot s waist
none	none	 and then attached to it six other ribbons 
5471-284429-0033	train-other-500	Each of the Six Snubnosed Princesses held the end of a ribbon
none	none	 and then they turned and marched haughtily away to the palace 
5471-284429-0034	train-other-500	dragging the little girl after them Don t worry Trot cried Button Bright we ll get you out of this trouble pretty soon Trust to us mate added Cap n Bill we ll manage to take care o you
5471-284429-0035	train-other-500	Oh I m all right answered Trot with fine courage I m not afraid of these gawkies But the princesses pulled her after them and soon they had all disappeared into one of the entrances to the Blue Palace Now then said the Boolooroo
5471-284429-0036	train-other-500	I will instruct you two in your future duties I shall make old Moonface My name s Cap n Bill Weedles interrupted the sailor I don t care what your name is
5471-284429-0037	train-other-500	I shall call you old Moonface replied the king for that suits you quite well I shall appoint you the Royal Nectar Mixer to the Court of Sky Island and if you don t mix our nectar properly I ll have you patched
5471-284429-0038	train-other-500	How do you mix it asked Cap n Bill I don t mix it it s not the Boolooroo s place to mix nectar was the stern reply But you may inquire of the palace servants and perhaps the Royal Chef or the Majordomo will condescend to tell you
none	none	 Take him to the servants quarters Captain Ultramarine 
5471-284429-0039	train-other-500	and give him a suit of the royal livery So Cap n Bill was led away by the chief of the soldiers and when he had gone the king said to Button Bright You slave shall be the Royal Bootblue
5471-284429-0040	train-other-500	Your duty will be to keep the boots and shoes of the royal family nicely polished with blue I don t know how answered Button Bright surlily You ll soon learn The Royal Steward will supply you with blue paste
none	none	 and when you ve brushed this on our shoes you must shine them with Q rays of Moonshine 
8190_284433_000079_000002	train-clean-360	Do you understand 
5471-284429-0041	train-other-500	Do you understand No said Button Bright
none	none	 Then the Boolooroo told one of the soldiers to take the boy to the shoeblue den and have him instructed in his duties and the soldier promptly obeyed and dragged Button Bright away to the end of the palace where the servants lived Illustration GHIP GHISIZZLE PROVES FRIENDLY CHAPTER seven The Royal Palace was certainly a magnificent building with large and lofty rooms and superb furnishings all being in shades of blue The soldier and the boy passed through several broad corridors and then came to a big hall where many servants were congregated These were staring in bewilderment at Cap n Bill who had been introduced to them by Captain Ultramarine Now they turned in no less surprise to examine the boy and their looks expressed not only astonishment but dislike The servants were all richly attired in blue silk liveries and they seemed disposed to resent the fact that these strangers had been added to their ranks They scowled and muttered and behaved in a very unfriendly way even after Captain Ultramarine had explained that the newcomers were merely base slaves and not to be classed with the free royal servants of the palace One of those present however showed no especial enmity to Button Bright and Cap n Bill and this Blueskin attracted the boy s notice because his appearance was so strange He looked as if he were made of two separate men each cut through the middle and then joined together half of one to half of the other One side of his blue hair was curly and the other half straight one ear was big and stuck out from the side of his head while the other ear was small and flat one eye was half shut and twinkling while the other was big and staring his nose was thin on one side and flat on the other while one side of his mouth curled up and the other down Button Bright also noticed that he limped as he walked because one leg was a trifle longer than the other and that one hand was delicate and slender and the other thick and hardened by use Don t stare at him a voice whispered in the boy s ear the poor fellow has been patched that s all Button Bright turned to see who had spoken and found by his side a tall young Blueskin with a blue gold chain around his neck He was quite the best looking person the boy had seen in Sky Island and he spoke in a pleasant way and seemed quite friendly But the two sided man had overheard the remark and he now stepped forward and said in a careless tone Never mind it s no disgrace to be patched in a country ruled by such a cruel Boolooroo as we have Let the boy look at me if he wants to I m not pretty but that s not my fault Blame the Boolooroo I I m glad to meet you sir stammered Button Bright What is your name please I m now named Jimfred Jonesjinks and my partner is called Fredjim Jinksjones He s busy at present guarding the Treasure Chamber but I ll introduce you to him when he comes back We ve had the misfortune to be patched you know What is being patched asked the boy They cut two of us in halves and mismatch the halves half of one to half of the other you know and then the other two halves are patched together It destroys our individuality and makes us complex creatures so it s the worst punishment than can be inflicted in Sky Island Oh said Button Bright alarmed at such dreadful butchery doesn t it hurt No it doesn t hurt replied Jimfred but it makes one frightfully nervous They stand you under a big knife which drops and slices you neatly in two exactly in the middle Then they match half of you to another person who has likewise been sliced and there you are patched to someone you don t care about and haven t much interest in If your half wants to do something the other half is likely to want to do something different and the funny part of it is you don t quite know which is your half and which is the other half It s a terrible punishment and in a country where one can t die or be killed until he has lived his six hundred years to be patched is a great misfortune I m sure it is said Button Bright earnestly But can t you ever get get un patched again If the Boolooroo would consent I think it could be done Jimfred replied but he never will consent This is about the meanest Boolooroo who ever ruled this land and he was the first to invent patching people as a punishment I think we will all be glad when his three hundred years of rule are ended When will that be inquired the boy Hush sh sh cried everyone in a chorus and they all looked over their shoulders as if frightened by the question The officer with the blue gold chain pulled Button Bright s sleeve and whispered Follow me please And then he beckoned to Cap n Bill and led the two slaves to another room where they were alone I must instruct you in your duties said he when they were all comfortably seated in cosy chairs with blue cushions You must learn how to obey the Boolooroo s commands so he won t become angry and have you patched How could he patch us asked the sailorman curiously Oh he d just slice you all in halves and then patch half of the boy to half of the girl and the other half to half of you and the other half of you to the other half of the girl See Can t say I do said Cap n Bill much bewildered It s a reg lar mix up That s what it s meant to be explained the young officer An seein as we re Earth folks an not natives of Sky Island I ve an idea the slicing machine would about end us without bein patched continued the sailor Oh said Button Bright so it would While you are in this country you can t die till you ve lived six hundred years declared the officer Oh said Button Bright that s different of course But who are you please My name is Ghip Ghi siz zle Can you remember it I can member the sizzle said the boy but I m fraid the Gwip Grip Glip Ghip Ghi siz zle repeated the officer slowly I want you to remember my name because if you are going to live here you are sure to hear of me a great many times Can you keep a secret I can try said Button Bright I ve kep secrets once in a while asserted Cap n Bill Well try to keep this one I m to be the next Boolooroo of Sky Island Good for you cried the sailor I wish you was the Boolooroo now sir But it seems you ve got to wait a hundred years or more afore you can take his place Ghip Ghisizzle rose to his feet and paced up and down the room for a time a frown upon his blue face Then he halted and faced Cap n Bill Sir said he there lies all my trouble I m quite sure the present Boolooroo has reigned three hundred years next Thursday but he claims it is only two hundred years and as he holds the Royal Book of Records under lock and key in the Royal Treasury there is no way for us to prove he is wrong Oh said Button Bright How old is the Boolooroo He was two hundred years old when he was elected replied Ghip Ghisizzle If he has already reigned three hundred years as I suspect then he is now five hundred years old You see he is trying to steal another hundred years of rule so as to remain a tyrant all his life He don t seem as old as that observed Cap n Bill thoughtfully Why I m only sixty myself an I guess I look twice as old as your king does We do not show our age in looks the officer answered I am just about your own age sir sixty two my next birth day but I m sure I don t look as old as you That s a fact agreed Cap n Bill Then he turned to Button Bright and added Don t that prove Sky Island is a fairy country as I said Oh I ve known that all along said the boy The slicing and patching proves it and so do lots of other things Now then said Ghip Ghisizzle let us talk over your duties It seems you must mix the royal nectar Cap n Bill Do you know how to do that I m free to say as I don t friend Sizzle The Boolooroo is very particular about his nectar I think he has given you this job so he can find fault with you and have you punished But we will fool him You are strangers here and I don t want you imposed upon I ll send Tiggle to the royal pantry and keep him there to mix the nectar Then when the Boolooroo or the Queen or any of the Snubnosed Princesses call for a drink you can carry it to them and it will be sure to suit them Thank e sir said Cap n Bill that s real kind of you Your job Button Bright is easier continued Ghip Ghisizzle I m no bootblack declared the boy The Boolooroo has no right to make me do his dirty work You re a slave the officer reminded him and a slave must obey Why asked Button Bright Because he can t help himself No slave ever wants to obey but he just has to And it isn t dirty work at all You don t black the royal boots and shoes you merely blue them with a finely perfumed blue paste Then you shine them neatly and your task is done You will not be humiliated by becoming a bootblack You ll be a bootblue Oh said Button Bright I don t see much difference but perhaps it s a little more respectable Yes the Royal Bootblue is considered a high official in Sky Island You do your work at evening or early morning and the rest of the day you are at liberty to do as you please It won t last long Button Bright said Cap n Bill consolingly Somethin s bound to happen pretty soon you know I think so myself answered the boy And now remarked Ghip Ghisizzle since you understand your new duties perhaps you d like to walk out with me and see the Blue City and the glorious Blue Country of Sky Island We would that cried Cap n Bill promptly So they accompanied their new friend through a maze of passages for the palace was very big and then through a high arched portal into the streets of the City So rapid had been their descent when the umbrella landed them in the royal garden that they had not even caught a glimpse of the Blue City so now they gazed with wonder and interest at the splendid sights that met their eyes Illustration THE BLUE CITY CHAPTER eight The Blue City was quite extensive and consisted of many broad streets paved with blue marble and lined with splendid buildings of the same beautiful material There were houses and castles and shops for the merchants and all were prettily designed and had many slender spires and imposing turrets that rose far into the blue air Everything was blue here just as was everything in the Royal Palace and gardens and a blue haze overhung all the city 
6735-284431-0000	train-other-500	Doesn t the sun ever shine asked Cap n Bill Not in the blue part of Sky Island replied Ghip Ghisizzle The moon shines here every night but we never see the sun I am told however that on the other half of the Island
6735-284431-0001	train-other-500	which I have never seen the sun shines brightly but there is no moon at all Oh said Button Bright is there another half to Sky Island Yes a dreadful place called the Pink Country
none	none	 I m told everything there is pink instead of blue 
6735-284431-0002	train-other-500	A fearful place it must be indeed said the Blueskin with a shudder
none	none	 I dunno bout that remarked Cap n Bill That Pink Country sounds kind o cheerful to me Is your Blue Country very big Illustration It is immense 
6735-284431-0003	train-other-500	was the proud reply This enormous City extends a half mile in all directions from the center and the country outside the City is fully a half mile further in extent That s very big isn t it
6735-284431-0004	train-other-500	Not very replied Cap n Bill with a smile We ve cities on the Earth ten times bigger an then some big besides We d call this a small town in our country
6735-284431-0005	train-other-500	Our Country is thousands of miles wide and thousands of miles long it s the great United States of America added the boy earnestly Ghip Ghisizzle seemed astonished He was silent a moment and then he said
6735-284431-0006	train-other-500	Here in Sky Island we prize truthfulness very highly Our Boolooroo is not very truthful I admit for he is trying to misrepresent the length of his reign
none	none	 but our people as a rule speak only the truth So do we asserted Cap n Bill 
6735-284431-0007	train-other-500	What Button Bright said is the honest truth every word of it But we have been led to believe that Sky Island is the greatest country in the universe meaning of course our half of it the Blue Country It may be for you perhaps
6735-284431-0008	train-other-500	the sailor stated politely an I don t imagine any island floatin in the sky is any bigger But the Universe is a big place an you can t be sure of what s in it till you ve traveled like we have
6735-284431-0009	train-other-500	Perhaps you are right mused the Blueskin but he still seemed to doubt them Is the Pink side of Sky Island bigger than the Blue side asked Button Bright No it is supposed to be the same size was the reply
none	none	 Then why haven t you ever been there Seems to me you could walk across the whole island in an hour said the boy The two parts are separated by an impassable barrier answered Ghip Ghisizzle 
6735-284431-0010	train-other-500	Between them lies the Great Fog Bank A fog bank Why that s no barrier exclaimed Cap n Bill
none	none	 It is indeed returned the Blueskin The Fog Bank is so thick and heavy that it blinds one and if once you got into the Bank you might wander forever and not find your way out again 
6735-284431-0011	train-other-500	Also it is full of dampness that wets your clothes and your hair until you become miserable It is furthermore said that those who enter the Fog Bank forfeit the six hundred years allowed them to live and are liable to die at any time
6735-284431-0012	train-other-500	Here we do not die you know we merely pass away How s that asked the sailor Isn t pass n away jus the same as dyin
none	none	 No indeed When our six hundred years are ended we march into the Great Blue Grotto through the Arch of Phinis and are never seen again 
6735-284431-0013	train-other-500	That s queer said Button Bright What would happen if you didn t march through the Arch I do not know for no one has ever refused to do so It is the Law and we all obey it It saves funeral expenses anyhow
6735-284431-0014	train-other-500	remarked Cap n Bill Where is this Arch Just outside the gates of the City There is a mountain in the center of the Blue land and the entrance to the Great Blue Grotto is at the foot of the mountain
6735-284431-0015	train-other-500	According to our figures the Boolooroo ought to march into this Grotto a hundred years from next Thursday
none	none	 but he is trying to steal a hundred years and so perhaps he won t enter the Arch of Phinis 
6735-284431-0016	train-other-500	Therefore if you will please be patient for about a hundred years you will discover what happens to one who breaks the Law Thank e remarked Cap n Bill I don t expect to be very curious a hundred years from now
6735-284431-0017	train-other-500	Nor I added Button Bright laughing at the whimsical speech But I don t see how the Boolooroo is able to fool you all Can t any of you remember two or three hundred years back when he first began to rule No
6735-284431-0018	train-other-500	said Ghip Ghisizzle that s a long time to remember and we Blueskins try to forget all we can especially whatever is unpleasant Those who remember are usually the unhappy ones
6735-284431-0019	train-other-500	only those able to forget find the most joy in life
none	none	 During this conversation they had been walking along the streets of the Blue City where many of the Blueskin inhabitants stopped to gaze wonderingly at the sailor and the boy whose strange appearance surprised them They were a nervous restless people and their egg shaped heads 
6735-284431-0020	train-other-500	set on the ends of long thin necks seemed so grotesque to the strangers that they could scarcely forbear laughing at them
6735-284431-0021	train-other-500	The bodies of these people were short and round and their legs exceptionally long so when a Blueskin walked he covered twice as much ground at one step as Cap n Bill or Button Bright did
6735-284431-0022	train-other-500	The women seemed just as repellent as the men and Button Bright began to understand that the Six
none	none	 Snubnosed Princesses were after all rather better looking than most of the females of the Blue Country and so had a certain right to be proud and haughty 
6735-284431-0023	train-other-500	There were no horses nor cows in this land but there were plenty of blue goats from which the people got their milk Children tended the goats
6735-284431-0024	train-other-500	wee Blueskin boys and girls whose appearance was so comical that Button Bright laughed whenever he saw one of them Although the natives had never seen before this any human beings made as Button Bright and Cap n Bill were
6735-284431-0025	train-other-500	they took a strong dislike to the strangers and several times threatened to attack them
none	none	 Perhaps if Ghip Ghisizzle who was their favorite had not been present they would have mobbed our friends with vicious ill will and might have seriously injured them 
6735-284431-0026	train-other-500	But Ghip Ghisizzle s friendly protection made them hold aloof By and by they passed through a City gate and their guide showed them the outer walls which protected the City from the country beyond
6735-284431-0027	train-other-500	There were several of these gates and from their recesses stone steps led to the top of the wall
none	none	 They mounted a flight of these steps and from their elevation plainly saw the low mountain where the Arch of Phinis was located and beyond that the thick blue gray Fog Bank 
6735-284431-0028	train-other-500	which constantly rolled like billows of the ocean and really seemed from a distance quite forbidding But it wouldn t take long to get there decided Button Bright and if you were close up it might not be worse than any other fog
6735-284431-0029	train-other-500	Is the Pink Country on the other side of it So we are told in the Book of Records replied Ghip Ghisizzle None of us now living know anything about it but the Book of Records calls it the Sunset Country
6735-284431-0030	train-other-500	and says that at evening the pink shades are drowned by terrible colors
none	none	 of orange and crimson and golden yellow 
6735-284431-0031	train-other-500	and red Wouldn t it be horrible to be obliged to look upon such a sight It must give the poor people who live there dreadful headaches
6735-284431-0032	train-other-500	I d like to see that Book of Records mused Cap n Bill who didn t think the discription of the Sunset Country at all dreadful I d like to see it myself returned Ghip Ghisizzle with a sigh but no one can lay hands on it
6735-284431-0033	train-other-500	because the Boolooroo keeps it safely locked up in his Treasure Chamber Where s the key to the Treasure Chamber asked Button Bright The Boolooroo keeps it in his pocket night and day was the reply
none	none	 He is afraid to let anyone see the Book because it would prove he has already reigned three hundred years next Thursday and then he would have to resign the throne to me 
6735-284431-0034	train-other-500	and leave the Palace and live in a common house My Magic Umbrella is in that Treasure Chamber said Button Bright and I m going to try to get it Are you inquired Ghip Ghisizzle eagerly
6735-284431-0035	train-other-500	Well if you manage to enter the Treasure Chamber be sure to bring me the Book of Records If you can do that I will be the best and most grateful friend you ever had
6735-284431-0036	train-other-500	I ll see said the boy It ought not to be hard work to break into the Treasure Chamber Is it guarded Yes the outside guard is Jimfred Jinksjones
6735-284431-0037	train-other-500	the double patch of the Fredjim whom you have met and the inside guard is a ravenous creature known as the Blue Wolf which has teeth a foot long and as sharp as needles Oh
none	none	 said Button Bright But never mind the Blue Wolf I must manage to get my umbrella somehow or other They now walked back to the palace still objects of much curiosity to the natives who sneered at them and mocked them but dared not interfere with their progress At the palace they found that dinner was about to be served in the big dining hall of the servants and dependents and household officers of the royal Boolooroo Ghip Ghisizzle was the Majordomo and Master of Ceremonies so he took his seat at the end of the long table and placed Cap n Bill on one side of him and Button Bright on the other to the great annoyance of the other Blueskins present who favored the strangers with nothing pleasanter than envious scowls The Boolooroo and his Queen and daughters the Six Snubnosed Princesses dined in formal state in the Banquet Hall where they were waited upon by favorite soldiers of the Royal Bodyguard Here in the servants hall there was one vacant seat next to Button Bright which was reserved for Trot but the little girl had not yet appeared and the sailorman and the boy were beginning to be uneasy about her Illustration Illustration THE TRIBULATION OF TROT CHAPTER nine The apartments occupied by the Six Snubnosed Princesses were so magnificent that when Trot first entered them led by her haughty captors she thought they must be the most beautiful rooms in all the world There was a long and broad reception room with forty seven windows in it and opening out of it were six lovely bedchambers each furnished in the greatest luxury Adjoining each sleeping room was a marble bath and each Princess had a separate boudoir and a dressing room The furnishings were of the utmost splendor blue gold and blue gems being profusely used in the decorations while the divans and chairs were of richly carved bluewood upholstered in blue satins and silks The draperies were superbly embroidered and the rugs upon the marble floors were woven with beautiful scenes in every conceivable shade of blue When they first reached the reception room Princess Azure cast herself upon a divan while her five sisters sat or reclined in easy chairs with their heads thrown back and their blue chins scornfully elevated Trot who was much annoyed at the treatment she had received did not hesitate to seat herself also in a big easy chair Slave cried Princess Cerulia fetch me a mirror Slave cried Princess Turquoise a lock of my hair is loosened bind it up Slave cried Princess Cobalt unfasten my shoes they re too tight Slave cried Princess Sapphire bring hither my box of blue chocolates Slave cried Princess Azure stand by my side and fan me Slave cried Princess Indigo get out of that chair How dare you sit in our presence If you re saying all those things to me replied Trot you may as well save your breath I m no slave And she cuddled down closer in the chair You are a slave shouted the six all together I m not Our father the Revered and Resplendent Royal Ruler of the Blues has made you our slave asserted Indigo with a yawn But he can t objected the little girl I m some Royal an Rapturous an Ridic lous myself an I won t allow any cheap Boolooroo to order me round Are you of royal birth asked Azure seeming surprised Royal Why I m an American Snubnoses and if there s anything royaler than an American I d like to know what it is The Princesses seemed uncertain what reply to make to this speech and began whispering together Finally Indigo said to Trot We do not think it matters what you were in your own country for having left there you have forfeited your rank By recklessly intruding into our domain you have become a slave and being a slave you must obey us or suffer the consequences What cons quences asked the girl Dare to disobey us and you will quickly find out snapped Indigo swaying her head from side to side on its long swan like neck like the pendulum of a clock I don t want any trouble said Trot gravely We came to Sky Island by mistake and wanted to go right away again but your father wouldn t let us It isn t our fault we re still here an I m free to say you re a very dis gree ble an horrid lot of people with no manners to speak of or you d treat us nicely No impertinence cried Indigo savagely Why it s the truth replied Trot Indigo made a rush and caught Trot by both shoulders The Princess was twice the little girl s size and she shook her victim so violently that Trot s teeth rattled together Then Princess Cobalt came up and slapped one side of the slave s face and Princess Turquoise ran forward and slapped the other side Cerulia gave Trot a push one way and Sapphire pushed her the other way so the little girl was quite out of breath and very angry when finally her punishment ceased She had not been much hurt though and she was wise enough to understand that these Princesses were all cruel and vindictive so that her safest plan was to pretend to obey them Now then commanded Princess Indigo go and feed my little blue dog that crows like a rooster And feed my pretty blue cat that sings like a bird said Princess Azure And feed my soft blue lamb that chatters like a monkey said Princess Cobalt And feed my poetic blue parrot that barks like a dog said Princess Sapphire And feed my fuzzy blue rabbit that roars like a lion said Princess Turquoise And feed my lovely blue peacock that mews like a cat said Princess Cerulia Anything else asked Trot drawing a long breath Not until you have properly fed our pets replied Azure with a scowl What do they eat then Meat Milk Clover Seeds Bread Carrots All right said Trot where do you keep the menagerie Our pets are in our boudoirs said Indigo harshly What a little fool you are Perhaps said Trot pausing as she was about to leave the room when I grow up I ll be as big a fool as any of you Then she ran away to escape another shaking and in the first boudoir she found the little blue dog curled up on a blue cushion in a corner Trot patted his head gently and this surprised the dog who was accustomed to cuffs and kicks So he licked Trot s hand and wagged his funny little tail and then straightened up and crowed like a rooster The girl was delighted with the queer doggie and she found some meat in a cupboard and fed him out of her hand patting the tiny creature and stroking his soft blue hair The doggie had never in his life known anyone so kind and gentle so when Trot went into the next boudoir the animal followed close at her heels wagging his tail every minute The blue cat was asleep on a window seat but it woke up when Trot tenderly took it in her lap and fed it milk from a blue gold dish It was a pretty cat and instantly knew the little girl was a friend vastly different from its own bad tempered mistress so it sang beautifully as a bird sings and both the cat and the dog followed Trot into the third boudoir Here was a tiny baby lamb with fleece as blue as a larkspur and as soft as silk Oh you darling cried Trot hugging the little lamb tight in her arms At once the lamb began chattering just as a monkey chatters only in the most friendly and grateful way and Trot fed it a handful of fresh blue clover and smoothed and petted it until the lamb was eager to follow her wherever she might go When she came to the fourth boudoir a handsome blue parrot sat on a blue perch and began barking as if it were nearly starved Then it cried out Rub a dub dub Gimme some grub Trot laughed and gave it some seeds and while the parrot ate them she stroked gently his soft feathers The bird seemed much astonished at the unusual caress and turned upon the girl first one little eye and then the other as if trying to discover why she was so kind He had never experienced kind treatment in all his life So it was no wonder that when the little girl entered the fifth boudoir she was followed by the parrot the lamb the cat and the dog who all stood beside her and watched her feed the peacock which she found strutting around and mewing like a cat for his dinner Said the parrot I spy a peacock s eye On every feather I wonder why The peacock soon came to love Trot as much as the other bird and all the beasts did and it spread its tail and strutted after her into the next boudoir the sixth one As she entered this room Trot gave a start of fear for a terrible roar like the roar of a lion greeted her But there was no lion there a fuzzy blue rabbit was making all the noise For goodness sake keep quiet said Trot Here s a nice blue carrot for you The color seems all wrong but it may taste jus as good as if it was red Evidently it did taste good for the rabbit ate it greedily When it was not roaring the creature was so soft and fluffy that Trot played with it and fondled it a long time after it had finished eating and the rabbit played with the cat and the dog and the lamb and did not seem a bit afraid of the parrot or the peacock But all of a sudden in pounced Princess Indigo with a yell of anger So this is how you waste your time is it exclaimed the Princess and grabbing Trot s arm she jerked the girl to her feet and began pushing her from the room All the pets began to follow her and seeing this Indigo yelled at them to keep back As they paid no attention to this command the princess seized a basin of water and dashed the fluid over the beasts and birds after which she renewed her attempt to push Trot from the room The pets rebelled at such treatment and believing they ought to protect Trot whom they knew to be their friend they proceeded to defend her The little blue dog dashed at Indigo and bit her right ankle while the blue cat scratched her left leg with its claws and the parrot flew upon her shoulder and pecked her ear The lamb ran up and butted Indigo so that she stumbled forward on her face when the peacock proceeded to pound her head with his wings Indigo screaming with fright sprang to her feet again but the rabbit ran between her legs and tripped her up all the time roaring loudly like a lion and the dog crowed triumphantly as a rooster crows while the cat warbled noisily and the lamb chattered and the parrot barked and the peacock screeched me ow Altogether Indigo was as Trot said scared stiff and she howled for help until her sisters ran in and rescued her pulling her through the bedchamber into the reception room When she was alone Trot sat down on the floor and laughed until the tears came to her eyes and she hugged all the pets and kissed them every one and thanked them for protecting her That s all right We like a fight declared the parrot in reply The Princesses were horrified to find Indigo so scratched and bitten and they were likewise amazed at the rebellion of their six pets which they had never petted indeed but kept in their boudoirs so they could abuse them whenever they felt especially wicked or ill natured None of the snubnosed ones dared enter the room where the girl was but they called through a crack in the door for Trot to come out instantly Trot pretending not to hear paid no attention to these commands Finding themselves helpless and balked of their revenge the Six Snubnosed Princesses finally recovered from their excitement and settled down to a pleasant sisterly quarrel as was their customary amusement Indigo wanted to have Trot patched and Cerulia wanted her beaten with knotted cords and Cobalt wanted her locked up in a dark room and Sapphire wanted her fed on sand and Turquoise wanted her bound to a windmill and so between these various desires they quarrelled and argued until dinner time arrived Trot was occupying Indigo s room so that Princess was obliged to dress with Azure not daring to enter her own chamber and the two sisters quarrelled so enthusiastically that they almost came to blows before they were ready for dinner Before the Six Snubnosed Princesses went to the Royal Banquet Hall Cobalt stuck her head through a crack of the door and said to Trot If you want any dinner you ll find it in the servants hall I advise you to eat for after our dinner we will decide upon a fitting punishment for you and then I m sure you won t have much appetite Thank you replied the girl I m right hungry jus now She waited until the snubnosed sextette had pranced haughtily away and then she came out followed by all the pets and found her way to the servants quarters Illustration Illustration THE KING S TREASURE CHAMBER Chapter ten All the Blueskins assembled in the servants hall were amazed to see the pets of the Princesses trailing after the strange little girl but Trot took her place next to Button Bright at the table and the parrot perched upon her shoulder while the peacock stood upon one side of her chair and the lamb upon the other and the cat and dog lay at her feet and the blue rabbit climbed into her lap and cuddled down there Some of the Blueskins insisted that the animals and birds must be put out of the room but Ghip Ghisizzle said they could remain as they were the favored pets of the lovely Snubnosed Princesses Cap n Bill was delighted to see his dear little friend again and so was Button Bright and now that they were reunited for a time at least they paid little heed to the sour looks and taunting remarks of the ugly Blueskins and ate heartily of the dinner which was really very good The meal was no sooner over than Ghip Ghisizzle was summoned to the chamber of his Majesty the Boolooroo but before he went away he took Trot and Cap n Bill and Button Bright into a small room and advised them to stay there until he returned so that the servants and soldiers would not molest them
8190_284433_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 My people seem to dislike strangers said the Majordomo thoughtfully and that surprises me because you are the first strangers they have ever seen 
none	none	I think they imagine you will become favorites of the Boolooroo and of the Princesses and that is why they are jealous and hate you
8190_284433_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 They needn t worry bout that replied Trot the Snubnoses hate me worse than the people do 
none	none	I can t imagine a bootblue becoming a royal favorite grumbled Button Bright
8190_284433_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Or a necktie mixer added Cap n Bill 
none	none	You don t mix neckties you re a nectar mixer said Ghip Ghisizzle correcting the sailor I ll not be gone long for I m no favorite of the Boolooroo either so please stay quietly in this room until my return 
8190_284433_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The Majordomo found the Boolooroo in a bad temper 
none	none	He had finished his dinner where his six daughters had bitterly denounced Trot all through the meal and implored their father to invent some new and terrible punishment for her 
8190_284433_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Also his wife the Queen had made him angry by begging for gold to buy ribbons with 
none	none	Then when he had retired to his own private room he decided to send for the umbrella he had stolen from Button Bright and test its magic powers 
8190_284433_000016_000004	train-clean-360	But the umbrella in his hands proved just as common as any other umbrella might 
8190_284433_000016_000005	train-clean-360	He opened it and closed it and turned it this way and that commanding it to do all sorts of things but of course the Magic Umbrella would obey no one but a member of the family that rightfully owned it 
none	none	At last the Boolooroo threw it down and stamped upon it and then kicked it into a corner where it rolled underneath a cabinet Then he sent for Ghip Ghisizzle Do you know how to work that Magic Umbrella he asked the Majordomo
8190_284433_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No your Majesty I do not was the reply 
none	none	Well find out 
8190_284433_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Make the Whiteskins tell you so that I can use it for my own amusement 
none	none	I ll do my best your Majesty said Ghip Ghisizzle
8190_284433_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 You ll do more than that or I ll have you patched roared the angry Boolooroo 
none	none	And don t waste any time either for as soon as we find out the secret of the umbrella I m going to have the three strangers marched through the Arch of Phinis and that will be the end of them You can t do that your Majesty said the Majordomo
8190_284433_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Why can t I 
none	none	They haven t lived six hundred years yet and only those who have lived that length of time are allowed to march through the Arch of Phinis into the Great Blue Grotto 
8190_284433_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The King looked at him with a sneer 
8190_284433_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Has anyone ever come out of that Arch alive he asked 
none	none	No said Ghip Ghisizzle But no one has ever gone into the Blue Grotto until his allotted time was up
8190_284433_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I m going to try the experiment declared the Boolooroo 
none	none	I shall march these three strangers through the Arch and if by any chance they come out alive I ll do a new sort of patching I ll chop off their heads and mix em up putting the wrong head on each of em Ha ha Won t it be funny to see the old Moonface s head on the little girl Ho Ho 
8190_284433_000028_000004	train-clean-360	I really hope they ll come out of the Great Blue Grotto alive 
none	none	I also hope they will replied Ghip Ghisizzle Then I ll bet you four button holes they don t I ve a suspicion that once they enter the Great Blue Grotto that s the last of them Ghip Ghisizzle went away quite sad and unhappy 
8190_284433_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He did not approve the way the strangers were being treated and thought it was wicked and cruel to try to destroy them 
8190_284433_000032_000000	train-clean-360	During his absence the prisoners had been talking together very earnestly 
none	none	We must get away from here somehow r other said Cap n Bill but o course we can t stir a step without the Magic Umbrel
8190_284433_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 No I must surely manage to get my umbrella first said Button Bright 
8190_284433_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Do it quick then urged Trot for I can t stand those snubnoses much longer 
none	none	I ll do it to night said the boy The sooner the better my lad remarked the sailor but seein as the Blue Boolooroo has locked it up in his Treasure Chamber it mayn t be easy to get hold of
8190_284433_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 No it won t be easy Button Bright admitted 
none	none	But it has to be done Cap n Bill and there s no use waiting any longer No one here likes us and in a few days they may make an end of us Oh Button Bright 
8190_284433_000039_000001	train-clean-360	There s a Blue Wolf in the Treasure Chamber exclaimed Trot 
8190_284433_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know 
none	none	An a patched man on guard outside Cap n Bill reminded him I know repeated Button Bright And the key s in the King s own pocket added Trot despairingly 
8190_284433_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The boy nodded 
none	none	He didn t say how he would overcome all these difficulties so the little girl feared they would never see the Magic Umbrella again 
8190_284433_000044_000002	train-clean-360	But their present position was a very serious one and even Cap n Bill dared not advise Button Bright to give up the desperate attempt 
none	none	When Ghip Ghisizzle returned he said
8190_284433_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 You must be very careful not to anger the Boolooroo or he may do you a mischief 
none	none	I think the little girl had better keep away from the Princesses for to night unless they demand her presence The boy must go for the King s shoes and blue them and polish them and then take them back to the Royal Bedchamber 
8190_284433_000046_000003	train-clean-360	Cap n Bill won t have anything to do for I ve ordered Tiggle to mix the nectar 
8190_284433_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Thank e friend Sizzle said Cap n Bill 
8190_284433_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Now follow me and I will take you to your rooms 
none	none	He led them to the rear of the palace where he gave them three small rooms on the ground floor each having a bed in it Cap n Bill s room had a small door leading out into the street of the City but Ghip Ghisizzle advised him to keep this door locked as the city people would be sure to hurt the strangers if they had the chance to attack them
8190_284433_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 You re safer in the palace than anywhere else said the Majordomo for there is no way you can escape from the island and here the servants and soldiers dare not injure you for fear of the Boolooroo 
8190_284433_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He placed Trot and her six pets which followed her wherever she went in one room and Cap n Bill in another and took Button Bright away with him to show the boy the way to the King s bedchamber 
none	none	As they proceeded they passed many rooms with closed doors and before one of these a patched Blueskin was pacing up and down in a tired and sleepy way 
8190_284433_000051_000002	train-clean-360	It was Jimfred Jinksjones the double of the Fredjim Jonesjinks they had talked with in the servants hall and he bowed low before the Majordomo 
none	none	This is the King s new bootblue a stranger who has lately arrived here said Ghip Ghisizzle introducing the boy to the patched man
8190_284433_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sorry for him muttered Jimfred 
none	none	He s a queer looking chap with his pale yellow skin and I imagine our cruel Boolooroo is likely to patch him before long as he did me I mean us No he won t said Button Bright positively
8190_284433_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 The Boolooroo s afraid of me 
none	none	Oh that s different said Jimfred
8190_284433_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 You re the first person I ever knew that could scare our Boolooroo 
none	none	They passed on and Ghip Ghisizzle whispered That is the Royal Treasure Chamber Button Bright nodded 
8190_284433_000057_000001	train-clean-360	He had marked the place well so he couldn t miss it when he wanted to find it again 
8190_284433_000058_000000	train-clean-360	When they came to the King s apartments there was another guard before the door this time a long necked soldier with a terrible scowl 
none	none	This slave is the Royal Bootblue said Ghip Ghisizzle to the guard You will allow him to pass into his Majesty s chamber to get the royal shoes and to return them when they are blued
8190_284433_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 All right answered the guard 
none	none	Our Boolooroo is in an ugly mood to night 
8190_284433_000060_000002	train-clean-360	It will go hard with this little short necked creature if he doesn t polish the shoes properly 
none	none	Then Ghip Ghisizzle left Button Bright and went away and the boy passed through several rooms to the Royal Bedchamber where his Majesty sat undressing
8190_284433_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Hi there 
8190_284433_000062_000001	train-clean-360	What are you doing here he roared as he saw Button Bright 
8190_284433_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve come for the shoes said the boy 
none	none	The king threw them at his head aiming carefully but Button Bright dodged the missiles and one smashed a mirror while the other shattered a vase on a small table His Majesty looked around for something else to throw but the boy seized the shoes and ran away returning to his own room 
8190_284433_000065_000000	train-clean-360	While he polished the shoes he told his plans to Cap n Bill and Trot and asked them to be ready to fly with him as soon as he returned with the Magic Umbrella 
none	none	All they need to do was to step out into the street through the door of Cap n Bill s room and open the umbrella Fortunately the seats and the lunch basket were still attached to the handle or so they thought and there would be nothing to prevent their quickly starting on the journey home They waited a long time however to give the Boolooroo time to get to sleep so it was after midnight when Button Bright finally took the shoes in his hand and started for the Royal Bedchamber He passed the guard of the Royal Treasury and Fredjim nodded good naturedly to the boy 
8190_284433_000066_000002	train-clean-360	But the sleepy guard before the King s apartments was cross and surly 
8190_284433_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 What are you doing here at this hour he demanded 
8190_284433_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 I m returning his Majesty s shoes said Button Bright 
8190_284433_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Go back and wait till morning commanded the guard 
none	none	If you prevent me from obeying the Boolooroo s orders returned the boy quietly he will probably have you patched 
8190_284433_000071_000000	train-clean-360	This threat frightened the long necked guard who did not know what orders the Boolooroo had given his Royal Bootblue 
none	none	Go in then said he but if you make a noise and waken his Majesty the chances are you ll get yourself patched
8190_284433_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll be quiet promised the boy 
none	none	Indeed Button Bright had no desire to waken the Boolooroo whom he found snoring lustily with the curtains of his high posted bed drawn tightly around him 
8190_284433_000074_000001	train-clean-360	The boy had taken off his own shoes after he passed the guard and now he tiptoed carefully into the room set down the royal shoes very gently and then crept to the chair where his Majesty s clothes were piled 
none	none	Scarcely daring to breathe for fear of awakening the terrible monarch the boy searched in the royal pockets until he found a blue gold key attached to a blue gold chain At once he decided this must be the key to the Treasure Chamber but in order to make sure he searched in every other pocket without finding another key Then Button Bright crept softly out of the room again and in one of the outer rooms he sat down near a big cabinet and put on his shoes Poor Button Bright did not know that lying disregarded beneath that very cabinet at his side was the precious umbrella he was seeking or that he was undertaking a desperate adventure all for nothing 
8190_284433_000075_000002	train-clean-360	He passed the long necked guard again finding the man half asleep and then made his way to the Treasure Chamber 
none	none	Facing Jimfred he said to the patched man in a serious tone His Majesty commands you to go at once to the corridor leading to the apartments of the Six Snubnosed Princesses and to guard the entrance until morning You are to permit no one to enter or to leave the apartments But good gracious exclaimed the surprised Jimfred who will guard the Treasure Chamber
8190_284433_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I am to take your place said Button Bright 
8190_284433_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh very well replied Jimfred this is a queer freak for our Boolooroo to indulge in but he is always doing something absurd 
none	none	You re not much of a guard seems to me but if anyone tries to rob the Treasure Chamber you must ring this big gong which will alarm the whole palace and bring the soldiers to your assistance Do you understand Yes said Button Bright Then Fredjim stalked away to the other side of the palace to guard the Princesses and Button Bright was left alone with the key to the Treasure Chamber in his hand But he had not forgotten that the ferocious Blue Wolf was guarding the interior of the Chamber so he searched in some of the rooms until he found a sofa pillow which he put under his arm and then returned to the corridor 
8190_284433_000082_000000	train-clean-360	He placed the key in the lock and the bolt turned with a sharp click Button Bright did not hesitate 
8190_284433_000082_000001	train-clean-360	He was afraid to be sure and his heart was beating fast with the excitement of the moment but he knew he must regain the Magic Umbrella if he would save his comrades and himself from destruction for without it they could never return to the Earth 
none	none	So he summoned up his best courage opened the door stepped quickly inside and closed the door after him Illustration Illustration BUTTON BRIGHT ENCOUNTERS THE BLUE WOLF CHAPTER eleven A low fierce growl greeted him The Treasure Chamber was pretty dark although the moonlight came in through some of the windows but the boy had brought with him the low brass lamp that lighted the corrider and this he set upon a table beside the door before he took time to look around him The Treasure Chamber was heaped and crowded with all the riches the Boolooroo had accumulated during his reign of two or three hundred years Piles of gold and jewels were on all sides and precious ornaments and splendid cloths rare pieces of carved furniture vases bric a brac and the like were strewn about the room in astonishing profusion Just at the boy s feet crouched a monstrous animal of most fearful aspect He knew at a glance it was the terrible Blue Wolf and the sight of the beast sent a shiver through him The Blue Wolf s head was fully as big as that of a lion and its wide jaws were armed with rows of long pointed teeth Its shoulders and front legs were huge and powerful but the rest of the wolf s body dwindled away until at the tail it was no bigger than a dog The jaws were therefore the dangerous part of the creature and its small blue eyes flashed wickedly at the intruder Just as the boy made his first step forward the Blue Wolf sprang upon him with its enormous jaws stretched wide open Button Bright jammed the sofa pillow into the brute s mouth and crowded it in as hard as he could 
8190_284434_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The terrible teeth came together and buried themselves in the pillow and then mister Wolf found he could not pull them out again because his mouth was stuffed full 
none	none	He could not even growl or yelp but rolled upon the floor trying in vain to release himself from the conquering pillow Button Bright paid no further attention to the helpless animal but caught up the blue brass lamp and began a search for his umbrella 
8190_284434_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Of course he could not find it as it was not there 
none	none	He came across a small book bound in light blue leather which lay upon an exquisitely carved center table It was named in dark blue letters stamped on the leather The Royal Record Book and remembering that Ghip Ghisizzle longed to possess this book Button Bright hastily concealed it inside his blouse Then he renewed his search for the umbrella but it was quite in vain He hunted in every crack and corner tumbling the treasures here and there in the quest but at last he became positive that the Magic Umbrella had been removed from the room The boy was bitterly disappointed and did not know what to do next But he noticed that the Blue Wolf had finally seized an edge of the sofa pillow in its sharp claws and was struggling to pull the thing out of his mouth so there being no object in his remaining longer in the room where he might have to fight the wolf again Button Bright went out and locked the door behind him While he stood in the corridor wondering what to do next a sudden shouting reached his ears 
8190_284434_000010_000001	train-clean-360	It was the voice of the Boolooroo crying My Key my Key 
8190_284434_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Who has stolen my golden Key And then there followed shouts of soldiers and guards and servants and the rapid pattering of feet was heard throughout the palace 
none	none	Button Bright took to his heels and ran along the passages until he came to Cap n Bill s room where the sailorman and Trot were anxiously awaiting him
8190_284434_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Quick cried the boy we must escape from here at once or we will be caught and patched 
none	none	Where s the umbrel asked Cap n Bill I don t know 
8190_284434_000014_000001	train-clean-360	I can t find it 
none	none	But all the palace is aroused and the Boolooroo is furious 
8190_284434_000014_000003	train-clean-360	Come let s get away at once 
none	none	Where ll we go inquired Trot
8190_284434_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 We must make for the open country and hide in the Fog Bank or in the Arch of Phinis replied the boy 
none	none	They did not stop to argue any longer but all three stepped out of the little door into the street where they first clasped hands so they would not get separated in the dark and then ran as swiftly as they could down the street which was deserted at this hour by the citizens They could not go very fast because the sailorman s wooden leg was awkward to run with and held them back but Cap n Bill hobbled quicker than he had ever hobbled before in all his life and they really made pretty good progress They met no one on the streets and continued their flight until at last they came to the City Wall which had a blue iron gate in it Here was a Blueskin guard who had been peacefully slumbering when aroused by the footsteps of the fugitives Halt cried the guard fiercely Cap n Bill halted long enough to grab the man around his long neck with one hand and around his long leg with the other hand Then he raised the Blueskin in the air and threw him far over the wall A moment later they had unfastened the gate and fled into the open country where they headed toward the low mountain whose outlines were plainly visible in the moonlight The guard was now howling and crying for help In the city were answering shouts A hue and cry came from every direction reaching as far as the palace Lights began to twinkle everywhere in the streets and the Blue City hummed like a beehive filled with angry bees It won t do for us to get caught now panted Cap n Bill as they ran along I m more afeared o them Blue citizens ner I am o the Blue Boolooroo 
8190_284434_000022_000002	train-clean-360	They d tear us to pieces if they could 
none	none	Sky Island was not a very big place especially the blue part of it and our friends were now very close to the low mountain Presently they paused before a grim archway of blue marble above which was carved the one word Phinis The interior seemed dark and terrible as they stopped to regard it as a possible place of refuge
8190_284434_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t like that place Cap n whispered Trot 
8190_284434_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 No more do I mate he answered 
8190_284434_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I d rather take a chance on the Fog Bank said Button Bright 
none	none	Just then they were all startled by a swift flapping of wings and a voice cried in shrill tones
8190_284434_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Where are you Trot As like as not I ve been forgot 
none	none	Cap n Bill jumped this way and Button Bright that and then there alighted on Trot s shoulder the blue parrot that had been the pet of the Princess Cerulia Said the bird Gee I ve flown Here all alone It s pretty far But here we are and then he barked like a dog and chuckled with glee at having found his little friend In escaping from the palace Trot had been obliged to leave all the pets behind her but it seemed that the parrot had found some way to get free and follow her 
8190_284434_000033_000001	train-clean-360	They were all astonished to hear the bird talk and in poetry too but Cap n Bill told Trot that some parrots he had known had possessed a pretty fair gift of language and he added that this blue one seemed an unusually bright bird 
none	none	As fer po try said he that s as how you look at po try 
8190_284434_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Rhymes come from your head but real po try from your heart an whether the blue parrot has a heart or not he s sure got a head 
none	none	Having decided not to venture into the Arch of Phinis they again started on this time across the country straight toward the Fog Bank which hung like a blue gray cloud directly across the center of the island They knew they were being followed by bands of the Blueskins for they could hear the shouts of their pursuers growing louder and louder every minute since their long legs covered the ground more quickly than our friends could possibly go Had the journey been much farther the fugitives would have been overtaken but when the leaders of the pursuing Blueskins were only a few yards behind them they reached the edge of the Fog Bank and without hesitation plunged into its thick mist which instantly hid them from view 
8190_284434_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The Blueskins fell back horrified at the mad act of the strangers 
none	none	To them the Fog Bank was the most dreadful thing in existence and no Blueskin had ever ventured within it even for a moment
8190_284434_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 That s the end of those short necked Yellowskins said one shaking his head 
none	none	We may as well go back and report the matter to the Boolooroo Illustration Illustration THROUGH THE FOG BANK CHAPTER twelve 
8190_284435_000005_000000	train-clean-360	It was rather moist in the Fog Bank 
none	none	Seems like a reg lar drizzle said Trot I ll be soaked through in a minute She had been given a costume of blue silk in exchange for her own dress and the silk was so thin that the moisture easily wetted it Never mind said Cap n Bill
8190_284435_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 When it s a case of life n death clo s don t count for much 
8190_284435_000007_000002	train-clean-360	I m sort o drippy myself 
8190_284435_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Cried the parrot 
none	none	fluttering his feathers to try to keep them from sticking together
8190_284435_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Floods and gushes fill our path This is not my day for a bath Shut it off or fear my wrath 
none	none	We can t laughed Trot We ll jus have to stick it out till we get to the other side
8190_284435_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Had we better go to the other side asked Button Bright anxiously 
8190_284435_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not returned Cap n Bill 
none	none	The other side s the only safe side for us
8190_284435_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 We don t know that sir said the boy 
none	none	Ghip Ghisizzle said it was a terrible country I don t believe it retorted the sailor stoutly Sizzle s never been there an he knows nothing about it The Sunset Country sounds sort o good to me But how ll we ever manage to get there inquired Trot Aren t we already lost in this fog Not yet said Cap n Bill I ve kep my face turned straight ahead ever since we climbed inter this bank o wetness If we don t get twisted any we ll go straight through to the other side It was no darker in the Fog Bank than it had been in the Blue Country They could see dimly the mass of fog which seemed to cling to them and when they looked down they discovered that they were walking upon white pebbles that were slightly tinged with the blue color of the sky Gradually this blue became fainter until as they progressed everything became a dull gray I wonder how far it is to the other side remarked Trot wearily
8190_284435_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 We can t say till we get there mate answered the sailor in a cheerful voice 
none	none	Cap n Bill had a way of growing more and more cheerful when danger threatened Never mind said the girl I m as wet as a dish rag now and I ll never get any wetter Wet wet wet It s awful wet you bet moaned the parrot on her shoulder I m a fish pond I m a well I m a clam without a shell
8190_284435_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Can t you dry up asked Cap n Bill 
none	none	Not this evening thank you sir To talk and grumble I prefer replied the parrot dolefully They walked along more slowly now still keeping hold of hands for although they were anxious to get through the Fog Bank they were tired with the long run across the country and with their day s adventures They had had no sleep and it was a long time past midnight
8190_284435_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Look out cried the parrot sharply and they all halted to find a monstrous frog obstructing their path 
none	none	Cap n Bill thought it was as big as a whale and as it squatted on the gray pebbles its eyes were on a level with those of the old sailor Ker chug ker choo grunted the frog what in the Sky is this crowd W we re strangers stammered Trot an we re tryin to scape from the Blueskins an get into the Pink Country I don t blame you said the frog in a friendly tone I hate those Blueskins The Pinkies however are very decent neighbors
8190_284435_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I m glad to hear that cried Button Bright 
none	none	Can you tell us Mister Mistress good mister Frog eh eh your Royal Highness if we re on the right road to the Pink Country The frog seemed to laugh for he gurgled in his throat in a very funny way I m no Royal Highness he said
8190_284435_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 I m just a common frog and a little wee tiny frog too 
8190_284435_000034_000002	train-clean-360	But I hope to grow in time 
none	none	This Fog Bank is the Paradise of Frogs and our King is about ten times as big as I am Then he s a big un an no mistake admitted Cap n Bill I m glad you like your country but it s a mite too damp for us an we d be glad to get out of it
8190_284435_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Follow me said the frog 
none	none	I ll lead you to the border 
8190_284435_000036_000002	train-clean-360	It s only about six jumps 
8190_284435_000037_000000	train-clean-360	He turned around made a mighty leap and disappeared in the gray mist 
none	none	Our friends looked at one another in bewilderment Don t see how we can foller that lead remarked Cap n Bill but we may as well start in the same direction
8190_284435_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Brooks and creeks How it leaks 
none	none	muttered the parrot
8190_284435_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 How can we jog To a frog in a fog 
none	none	The big frog seemed to understand their difficulty for he kept making noises in his throat to guide them to where he had leaped 
8190_284435_000043_000001	train-clean-360	When at last they came up to him he made a second jump out of sight as before and when they attempted to follow they found a huge lizard lying across the path 
8190_284435_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Cap n Bill thought it must be a giant alligator at first it was so big but he looked at them sleepily and did not seem at all dangerous 
none	none	O Liz you puffy Liz Get out of our way and mind your biz cried the parrot Creep a mousie crawl a mousie please move on We can t move a step till you are gone Don t disturb me said the lizard I m dreaming about parsnips 
8190_284435_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Did you ever taste a parsnip 
8190_284435_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 We re in a hurry if it s the same to you sir said Cap n Bill politely

none	none	When they re little they re juicy when they re big there s more of em but either way there s nothing so delicious as a parsnip There are none here in the Fog Bank so the best I can do is dream of them Oh parsnips par snips p a r snips He closed his eyes sleepily and resumed his dreams Walking around the lizard they resumed their journey and soon came to the frog being guided by its grunts and croaks 
8190_284435_000051_000001	train-clean-360	Then off it went again its tremendous leap carrying it far into the fog 
8190_284435_000051_000002	train-clean-360	Suddenly Cap n Bill tripped and would have fallen flat had not Trot and Button Bright held him up 
none	none	Then he saw that he had stumbled over the claw of a gigantic land crab which lay sprawled out upon the pebbly bottom
8190_284435_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh beg parding I m sure exclaimed Cap n Bill backing away 
none	none	Don t mention it replied the crab in a tired tone You did not disturb me so there is no harm done We didn t know you were here explained Trot
8190_284435_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Probably not said the crab 
none	none	It s no place for me anyhow for I belong in the Constellations you know with Taurus and Gemini and the other fellows But I had the misfortune to tumble out of the Zodiac some time ago My name is Cancer but I m not a disease Those who examine the heavens in these days alas can find no Cancer there Yes we can sir Mister Cancer said the parrot with a chuckle Once remarked Cap n Bill I sawr a picter of you in an almanac Ah the almanacs always did us full justice the crab replied but I m told they re not fashionable now
8190_284435_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 If you don t mind we d like to pass on said Button Bright 
none	none	No I don t mind but be careful not to step on my legs 
8190_284435_000061_000001	train-clean-360	They re rheumatic it s so moist here 
none	none	They climbed over some of the huge legs and walked around others 
8190_284435_000062_000001	train-clean-360	Soon they had left the creature far behind 
none	none	Aren t you rather slow asked the frog when once more they came up to him
8190_284435_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t that said Trot 
none	none	You are rather swift I guess 
8190_284435_000065_000000	train-clean-360	The frog chuckled and leaped again 
none	none	They noticed that the fog had caught a soft rose tint and was lighter and less dense than before for which reason the sailor remarked that they must be getting near to the Pink Country On this jump they saw nothing but a monstrous turtle which lay asleep with its head and legs drawn into its shell It was not in their way so they hurried on and rejoined the frog which said to them I m sorry but I m due at the King s Court in a few minutes and I can t wait for your short weak legs to make the journey to the Pink Country But if you will climb upon my back I think I can carry you to the border in one more leap I m tired said Trot an this awful fog s beginnin to choke me Let s ride on the frog Cap n
8190_284435_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 Right you are mate he replied and although he shook a bit with fear the old man at once began to climb to the frog s back 
none	none	Trot seated herself on one side of him and Button Bright on the other and the sailor put his arms around them both to hold them tight together Are you ready asked the frog
8190_284435_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Ding dong cried the parrot 
8190_284435_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 All aboard let er go Jump the best jump that you know 
8190_284435_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t don t 
none	none	Jump sort o easy please begged Cap n Bill But the frog was unable to obey his request Its powerful hind legs straightened like steel springs and shot the big body with its passengers through the fog like an arrow launched from a bow They gasped for breath and tried to hang on and then suddenly the frog landed just at the edge of the Fog Bank stopping so abruptly that his three riders left his back and shot far ahead of him They felt the fog melt away and found themselves bathed in glorious rays of sunshine but they had no time to consider this change because they were still shooting through the air and presently before they could think of anything at all all three were rolling heels over head on the soft grass of a meadow Illustration Illustration THE PINK COUNTRY CHAPTER thirteen When the travelers could collect their senses and sit up they stared about them in bewilderment for the transition from the sticky damp fog to this brilliant scene was so abrupt as to daze them at first It was a Pink Country indeed The grass was a soft pink the trees were pink all the fences and buildings which they saw in the near distance were pink 
8447-284436-0000	train-other-500	even the gravel in the pretty paths was pink
none	none	 Many shades of color were there of course 
8447-284436-0001	train-other-500	grading from a faint blush rose to deep pink verging on red but no other color was visible In the sky hung a pink glow with rosy clouds floating here and there
none	none	 and the sun was not silvery white as we see it from the Earth 
8447-284436-0002	train-other-500	but a distinct pink The sun was high in the sky just now
none	none	 which proved the adventurers had been a long time in passing through the Fog Bank But all of them were wonderfully relieved to reach this beautiful country in safety 
8447-284436-0003	train-other-500	for aside from the danger that threatened them in the Blue Country the other side of the island was very depressing Here the scene that confronted them was pretty and homelike
none	none	 except for the prevailing color and the fact that all the buildings were round without a single corner or angle 
8447-284436-0004	train-other-500	Half a mile distant was a large City
none	none	 its pink tintings glistening bravely in the pink sunshine 
8447-284436-0005	train-other-500	while hundreds of pink banners floated from its numerous domes The country between the Fog Bank and the City was like a vast garden very carefully kept and as neat as wax
8447-284436-0006	train-other-500	The parrot was fluttering its wings and pruning its feathers to remove the wet of the fog Trot and Button Bright and Cap n Bill were all soaked to the skin and chilled through
8447-284436-0007	train-other-500	but as they sat upon the pink grass they felt the rays of the sun sending them warmth
none	none	 and rapidly drying their clothes so being tired out they laid themselves comfortably down and first one and then another fell cosily asleep It was the parrot that aroused them Look out look out There s folks about it screamed The apple dumplings fat and pink Will be here quicker than a wink Trot started up in alarm and rubbed her eyes Cap n Bill rolled over and blinked hardly remembering where he was Button Bright was on his feet in an instant 
8447-284436-0008	train-other-500	Advancing toward them were four of the natives of the Pink Country
none	none	 Two were men and two were women and their appearance was in sharp contrast to that of the Blueskins For the Pinkies were round and chubby almost like apple dumplings as the parrot had called them 
8447-284436-0009	train-other-500	and they were not very tall the highest of the men being no taller than Trot or Button Bright They all had short necks and legs pink hair and eyes rosy cheeks and pink complexions
none	none	 and their faces were good natured and jolly in expression 
8447-284436-0010	train-other-500	The men wore picturesque pink clothing and round hats with pink feathers in them
none	none	 but the apparel of the women was still more gorgeous and striking 
8447-284436-0011	train-other-500	Their dresses consisted of layer after layer of gauzy tucks and ruffles and laces
none	none	 caught here and there with bows of dainty ribbon 
8447-284436-0012	train-other-500	The skirts which of course were of many shades of pink were so fluffy and light
none	none	 that they stuck out from the fat bodies of the Pinkie women like the skirts of ballet dancers 
8447-284436-0013	train-other-500	displaying their chubby pink ankles and pink kid shoes They wore rings and necklaces and bracelets and brooches of rose gold set with pink gems and all four of the new arrivals
none	none	 both men and women carried sharp pointed sticks made of rosewood for weapons 
8447-284436-0014	train-other-500	They halted a little way from our adventurers
none	none	 and one of the women muttered in a horrified voice Blueskins Guess again The more you guess I rather think you ll know the less retorted the parrot and then he added grumblingly in Trot s ear Blue feathers don t make bluebirds Really said the little girl standing up and bowing respectfully to the Pinkies we are not Blueskins although we are wearing the blue uniforms of the Boolooroo and have just escaped from the Blue Country If you will look closely you will see that our skins are white There is some truth in what she says remarked one of the men thoughtfully Their skins are not blue but neither are they white To be exact I should call the skin of the girl and that of the boy a muddy pink rather faded while the skin of the gigantic monster with them is an unpleasant brown Cap n Bill looked cross for a minute for he did not like to be called a gigantic monster although he realized he was much larger than the pink people 
8447-284436-0015	train-other-500	What country did you come from
none	none	 asked the woman who had first spoken From the Earth replied Button Bright The Earth The Earth they repeated That is a country we have never heard of Where is it located Why down below somewhere said the boy who did not know in which direction the Earth lay 
8447-284436-0016	train-other-500	It isn t just one country but a good many countries
none	none	 We have three countries in Sky Island 
8447-284436-0017	train-other-500	returned the woman They are the Blue
none	none	 Country the Fog Country and the Pink Country but of course this end of the Island is the most important How came you in the Blue Country from whence you say you escaped asked the man We flew there by means of a Magic Umbrella explained Button Bright but the wicked Boolooroo stole it from us Stole it How dreadful 
8447-284436-0018	train-other-500	they all cried in a chorus And they made us slaves said Trot An wanted fer to patch us added Cap n Bill indignantly
none	none	 So we ran away and passed through the Fog Bank and came here said Button Bright The Pinkies turned away and conversed together in low tones Then one of the women came forward and addressed the strangers Your story is the strangest we have ever heard said she and your presence here is still more strange and astonishing So we have decided to take you to Tourmaline and let her decide what shall be your fate Who is Tourmaline inquired Trot doubtfully for she didn t like the idea of being taken to anyone The Queen of the Pinkies She is the sole Ruler of our country so the word of Tourmaline is the Law of the Land Seems to me we ve had bout enough of kings an queens remarked Cap n Bill Can t we shy your Tut Tor mar line or whatever you call her in some way an deal with you direct No Until we prove your truth and honor we must regard you as enemies of our race If you had a Magic Umbrella you may be magicians and sorcerers come here to deceive us and perhaps betray us to our natural enemies the Blueskins Mud and bricks fiddlesticks We don t play such nasty tricks yelled the parrot angrily and this caused the Pinkies to shrink back in alarm for they had never seen a parrot before Surely this is magic declared one of the men No bird can talk unless inspired by witchcraft Oh yes parrots can said Trot But this incident had determined the Pinkies to consider our friends prisoners and to take them immediately before their Queen Must we fight you asked the woman or will you come with us peaceably We ll go peaceable answered Cap n Bill You re a makin a sad mistake for we re as harmless as doves but seein as you re suspicious we d better have it out with your Queen first as last Their clothing was quite dry by this time although much wrinkled and discolored by the penetrating fog so at once they prepared to follow the Pinkies The two men walked on either side of them holding the pointed sticks ready to jab them if they attempted to escape and the two women followed in the rear also armed with sharp sticks So the procession moved along the pretty roadways to the City which they soon reached There was a strong high wall of pink marble around it and they passed through a gate made of pink metal bars and found themselves in a most delightful and picturesque town The houses were big and substantial all round in shape with domed roofs and circular windows and doorways In all the place there was but one street a circular one that started at the gate and wound like a corkscrew toward the center of the City It was paved with pink marble and between the street and the houses that lined both sides of it were gardens filled with pink flowers and pink grass lawns which were shaded by pink trees and shrubbery As the Queen lived in the very center of the city the captives were obliged to parade the entire length of this street 
8447-284436-0019	train-other-500	and that gave all the Pink Citizens a chance to have a good look at the strangers
none	none	 The Pinkies were every one short and fat and gorgeously dressed in pink attire 
8447-284436-0020	train-other-500	and their faces indicated that they were contented and happy They were much surprised at Cap n Bill s great size and wooden leg two very unusual things in their experience and the old sailor frightened more than one Pinky boy and girl
none	none	 and sent them scampering into the houses 
8447-284436-0021	train-other-500	where they viewed the passing procession from behind the window shutters in comparative safety As for the grown people
none	none	 many of them got out their sharp pointed sticks to use as weapons in case the strangers attacked them or broke away from their guards A few more bold than the others followed on at the tail of the procession and so presently they all reached an open circular place in the exact center of the Pink City Illustration Illustration TOURMALINE THE POVERTY QUEEN CHAPTER fourteen The open space which they entered was paved with pink marble and around it were two rows of large pink statues at least life size and beautifully sculptured All were set upon nicely carved pink pedestals They were of course statues of Pinky men and women and all had bands of pink metal around their foreheads in the center of each band being a glistening pink jewel About the middle of the open space inside the statues which appeared to be the public meeting place of the Pinkies was a small low house domed like all the other houses but built of a coarse pink stone instead of the fine marble to be seen everywhere else It had no ornamentation being exceedingly plain in appearance No banners floated from it no flowers grew near it Here said one of their guides as the procession halted before the little stone building is the palace of Tourmaline who is our Queen What that little cabin exclaimed Trot Of course Did you suppose a palace would be like one of our handsome residences asked the woman evidently surprised I thought it would be better said the girl All the palaces I ve seen were splendid A splendid palace exclaimed one of the Pinkies and then they looked at one another in amazement and seemed to doubt that their ears had heard aright These intruders are very peculiar people remarked a man in the crowd They seem very ignorant poor things said another in reply Come commanded the woman who led the party you three must follow me to the presence of Tourmaline The people must wait outside for there is no room for them in the palace So they followed her through the low archway and in a room beyond very simply furnished sat a young girl engaged in darning a pair of pink stockings She was a beautiful girl of about seventeen years of age not fat like all the rest of the Pinkies but slender and well formed according to our own ideas of beauty Her complexion was not a decided pink but a soft rosy tint not much deeper than that of Trot s skin Instead of a silken gown furbelowed like all the others they had seen women wear in this land Tourmaline was dressed in a severely plain robe of coarse pink cloth much resembling bedticking Across her brow however was a band of rose gold in the center of which was set a luminous pink jewel which gleamed more brilliantly than a diamond It was her badge of office and seemed very incongruous when compared with her poor raiment and simple surroundings As they entered the girl sighed and laid down her work Her expression was patient and resigned as she faced her audience What is it Coralie she asked the woman Here are three strange people Tourmaline was the reply who say they have entered our country through the Fog Bank They tell a queer story of an escape from the Blueskins so I decided to bring them to you that you may determine their fate The Queen gazed upon our friends with evident interest She smiled a little sadly at Trot seemed to approve Button Bright s open frank face and was quite surprised because Cap n Bill was so much bigger than her own people Are you a giant she asked the sailor in a soft sweet voice No your Majesty he replied I m only Majesty she exclaimed flushing a deeper pink Are you addressing that word to me O course ma am answered Cap n Bill I m told that s the proper way to speak to a Queen Perhaps you are trying to ridicule me she continued regarding the sailor s face closely There is nothing majestic about me as you know very well Coralie do you consider majesty a proper word to use when addressing a Queen she added appealing to the Pinky woman By no means was the prompt reply What shall I call her then inquired Cap n Bill Just Tourmaline That is her name and it is sufficient said the woman The Ruler of a country ought to be treated with great respec declared Trot a little indignantly for she thought the pretty little queen was not being properly deferred to Why asked Tourmaline curiously Because the Ruler is the mos risticratic person in any land explained the little girl Even in America ever body bows low to our President an the Blueskins are so fraid o their Boolooroo that they tremble whenever they go near him But surely that is all wrong said Tourmaline gravely The Ruler is appointed to protect and serve the people and here in the Pink Country I have the full power to carry out the laws I even decree death when such a punishment is merited Therefore I am a mere agent to direct the laws which are the Will of the People and am only a public servant obliged constantly to guard the welfare of my subjects In that case said Button Bright you re entitled to the best there is to pay for your trouble A powerful ruler ought to be rich and to live in a splendid palace Your folks ought to treat you with great respect as Trot says Oh no responded Tourmaline quickly that would indeed be very wrong Too much should never be given to anyone If with my great power conferred upon me by the people I also possessed great wealth I might be tempted to be cruel and overbearing In that case my subjects would justly grow envious of my superior station If I lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns the good Pinkies would say that their Queen had more than they themselves and it would be true No our way is best The Ruler be it king or queen has absolute power to rule but no riches no high station no false adulation The people have the wealth and honor for it is their due The Queen has nothing but the power to execute the laws to adjust grievances and to compel order What pays you then for all your bother asked Trot I have one great privilege After my death a pink marble statue of me will be set up in the Grand Court with the statues of the other Kings and Queens who have ruled this land and all the Pinkies in ages to come will then honor me as having been a just and upright queen That is my reward I m sorry for you ma am said Cap n Bill Your pay for bein a queen is sort o like a life insurance It don t come due till after you re dead an then you can t get much fun out o it I did not choose to be the Queen answered Tourmaline simply A misfortune of birth placed me here and I cannot escape my fate It is much more desirable to be a private citizen happy and care free But we have talked long enough of myself Tell me who you are and why you have come here Between them they told the story of how the Magic Umbrella had taken them to Sky Island which they did not know when they started was anywhere in existence Button Bright told this and then Trot related their adventures among the Blueskins and how the Boolooroo had stolen the umbrella and prevented them from going home again The parrot on her shoulder kept interrupting her continually for the mention of the Boolooroo seemed to make the bird frantic with rage Naughty naugh ty Boo loo roo He s the worst I ev er knew the parrot repeated over and over again Cap n Bill finished the story by telling of their escape through the Fog Bank We didn t know what your Pink Country was like o course he said but we knew it couldn t be worse than the Blue Country an we didn t take any stock in their stories that the Fog Bank would be the death o us Pretty wet Pretty wet Was the journey you can bet declared the parrot in conclusion Yes it was wet an sticky all right agreed the sailor but the big frog helped us an we got through all right But what can you do here asked Tourmaline You are not like my people the Pinkies and there is no place for you in our country That s true enough said Cap n Bill but we had to go somewhere an this was the likeliest place we could think of Your Sky Island ain t very big so when we couldn t stay in the Blue Country where ever body hated us or in the Fog Bank which ain t healthy an is too wet for humans to live in for long we nat rally were forced to enter the Pink Country where we expected to find nice people We are nice said Tourmaline but it is our country not yours and we have no place here for strangers In all our history you are the first people from outside our borders who have ever stepped a foot in our land We do not hate you as you say the Blueskins do nor are we savage or cruel but we do not want you here and I am really puzzled what to do with you Isn t there a law to cover this case asked Coralie I do not remember any such law replied the queen but I will search in the Great Book and see if I can find anything that refers to strange people entering our land If not said the woman you must make a law It is your duty I know answered Tourmaline but I hope such a responsibility will not fall upon my shoulders These poor strangers are in a very uncomfortable position and I wish I could help them to get back to their own country Thank you said Trot We wish so too Haven t you any fairies here Oh there are fairies of course as there are everywhere answered Tourmaline but none that we can call to our assistance or command to do our bidding How about witches asked Button Bright I know of one witch said Tourmaline thoughtfully but she is not very obliging She says it makes her head ache to perform witchcraft and so she seldom indulges in it But if there is no other way I may be obliged to call upon Rosalie for help I ll look in the Great Book first Meantime you will go home with Coralie who will feed you and give you entertainment To morrow morning come to me again and then I will decree your fate The little Queen then picked up her stocking and began to darn the holes in it and Coralie without any formal parting led the strangers from the miserable palace Illustration Illustration THE SUNRISE TRIBE AND THE SUNSET TRIBE CHAPTER fifteen Although Trot and her comrades were still prisoners they were far more comfortable than they had been in the Blue Country Coralie took them to her own home where she lived in great luxury being one of the prominent women of the Pinkies In this country the women seemed fully as important as the men and instead of being coddled and petted they performed their share of the work both in public and private affairs and were expected to fight in the wars exactly as the men did Our friends learned considerable about the Pinkies during that afternoon and evening for their hostess proved kind and agreeable and frankly answered all their questions Although this half of Sky Island was no larger than the Blue Country being no more than two miles square it had several hundred inhabitants These were divided into two tribes which were called the Sunrise Tribe and the Sunset Tribe The Sunrise Tribe lived in the eastern half of the Pink Country and the Sunset Tribe in the west half and there was great rivalry between them and sometimes wars It was all a question of social importance The Sunrise Tribe claimed that every day the sun greeted them first of all which proved they were the most important but on the other hand the Sunset Tribe claimed that the sun always deserted the other tribe and came to them which was evidence that they were the most attractive people On Sky Island at least on the Pink side the sun arose in wonderful splendor but also it set in a blaze of glory and so there were arguments on both sides and for want of something better to argue about the Pinkies took this queer subject as a cause of dispute Both Tribes acknowledged Tourmaline their Queen and obeyed the laws of the country and just at this time there was peace in the land and all the inhabitants of the east and west were friendly But they had been known Coralie said to fight one another fiercely with the sharp sticks at which times a good many were sure to get hurt Why do they call this an Island asked Button Bright There isn t any water around it is there No but there is sky all around it answered Coralie and if one should step off the edge he would go tumbling into the great sky and never be heard of again Is there a fence around the edge asked Trot Only a few places are fenced was the reply Usually there are rows of thick bushes set close to the edge to prevent people from falling off Once there was a King of the Pinkies who was cruel and overbearing and imagined he was superior to the people he ruled so one day his subjects carried him to the edge of the island and threw him over the bushes Goodness me said Trot He might have hit some one on the Earth Guess he skipped it though added Cap n Bill for I never heard of a Pinky till I came here And I have never heard of the Earth retorted Coralie Of course there must be such a place because you came from there but the Earth is never visible in our sky No said Button Bright cause it s under your island But it s there all right and it s a pretty good place to live I wish I could get back to it So do I Button Bright exclaimed Trot Let s fly cried the parrot turning his head so that one bright little eye looked directly into the girl s eye Say good bye and let s fly through the sky far and high If we only had my umbrella we d fly in a minute sighed Button Bright But the Boolooroo stole it Naugh ty naugh ty Boo loo roo What a wicked thing to do wailed the parrot and they all agreed with him Illustration Coralie belonged to the Sunset Tribe as she lived west of the queen s palace which was the center of the Pink Country A servant came to the room where they were conversing to state that the sun was about to set and at once Coralie arose and took the strangers to an upper balcony where all the household had assembled The neighboring houses also had their balconies and roofs filled with people for it seemed all the Sunset Tribe came out every night to witness the setting of the sun It was really a magnificent sight and Trot scarcely breathed as the great golden ball sank low in the sky and colored all the clouds with gorgeous tints of orange red and yellow Never on the Earth was there visible such splendor and as the little girl watched the ever changing scene she decided the Sunset Tribe was amply justified in claiming that the West was the favored country of the sun You see said Cap n Bill the sky is all around us an we re high up so the sun really loses itself in the clouds an leaves a trail of beauty behind him He does that agreed Trot This is almost worth comin for Cap n But not quite said Button Bright sadly I d get along without the sunset if only we could go home They went in to dinner after this and sat at Coralie s own table with her husband and children and found the meal very good After a pleasant evening during which no reference was made to their being prisoners they were shown to prettily furnished rooms all in pink and slept soundly in the soft beds provided for them Trot wakened early the next morning and went out on the balcony to see the sunrise The little girl was well repaid for the splendor of the rising sun was almost equal to that of the setting sun Surely this was a wonderful country and much more delightful than the Blue side of the island where the sun was hidden by the great Fog Bank and only the moon was visible When she went in she found that both Button Bright and Cap n Bill were up and dressed so they decided to take a walk before breakfast No one restrained them or interfered with them in any way They know we can t get away observed the sailor so they don t need to watch us We could go into the Fog Bank again suggested Trot We could mate but we won t answered Cap n Bill If there s no way for us to get clean off n Sky Island I d rather stay with the Pinkies than with the Blues I wonder what they ll do with us said Button Bright The Queen seems like a nice girl and I don t think she ll hurt us whatever happens They walked freely along the circular street seeing such sights as the Pink City afforded and then returned to Coralie s house for breakfast Coralie herself was not there as she had been summoned to the Queen s palace but her husband looked after the guests and when breakfast was finished he said to them I am to take you to Tourmaline who has promised to decide your fate this morning I am curious to know what she will do with you for in all our history we have never before had strangers intrude upon us We re curious too said Trot but we ll soon find out As they walked down the street they observed that the sky was now covered with dark clouds which entirely hid the sun Does it ever rain here inquired Button Bright Certainly answered Coralie s husband that is the one drawback of our country it rains quite often and although it makes the flowers and the grass grow I think rain is very disagreeable I am always glad to see the rainbow which is a sign that the sun will shine again Looks like rain now remarked Cap n Bill It does said the man glancing at the sky We must hurry or we may get wet Haven t you any umbrellas asked Button Bright No we don t know what umbrellas are replied the Pinky man It did not rain at once and they reached Tourmaline s wretched hut in safety There they found quite a number of Pinkies assembled and a spirited discussion was taking place when they arrived Come in please said Tourmaline opening the door for them and when they had entered she placed a pinkwood bench for them to sit upon and went back to her throne which was a common rocking chair At her right were seated six men and women of the Sunrise Tribe and on her left six men and women of the Sunset Tribe among the latter being Coralie The contrast between the plain simple dress of the Queen and the gorgeous apparel of her Counselors was quite remarkable yet her beauty far surpassed that of any of her people and her demeanor was so modest and unassuming that it was difficult for the prisoners to believe that her word could decree life or death and that all the others were subservient to her Tourmaline s eyes were so deep a shade of pink that they were almost hazel and her hair was darker than that of the others being a golden red in color These points taken with her light pink skin and slender form rendered her distinctive among the Pinkies whatever gown she might wear When the strangers were seated she turned to them and said I have searched through the Great Book of Laws and found nothing about foreign people entering our land There is a law that if any of the Blueskins break through the Fog Bank they shall be driven back with sharp sticks but you are not Blueskins so this Law does not apply to you Therefore in order to decide your fate I have summoned a Council of twelve of my people who will vote as to whether you shall be permitted to remain here or not They wanted to see you before they cast their final vote that they may examine you carefully and discover if you are worthy to become inhabitants of the Pink Country The rose is red the violet s blue But Trot is sweeter than the two declared the parrot in a loud voice It was a little verse Cap n Bill had taught the bird that very morning while Trot was seeing the sun rise The Pinkies were startled and seemed a little frightened at hearing a bird speak so clearly Trot laughed and patted the bird s head in return for the compliment Is the Monster Man whose legs are part wood a dangerous creature asked one of the Sunrise Tribe Not to my friends replied Cap n Bill much amused I s pose I could fight your whole crowd o Pinkies if I had to an make you run for your lives but bein as you re friendly to us you ain t in any danger The sailor thought this speech was diplomatic and might head off any trouble but the Pinkies seemed uneasy and several of them picked up their slender pointed sticks and held them in their hands They were not cowardly but it was evident they mistrusted the big man who on Earth was not considered big at all but rather undersized What we d like said Trot is to stay here cosy an peaceable till we can find a way to get home to the Earth again Your country is much nicer than the Blue Country and we like you pretty well from what we ve seen of you so if you ll let us stay we won t be any more trouble to you than we can help They all gazed upon the little girl curiously and one of them said How strangely light her color is And it is pink too which is in her favor But her eyes are of that dreadful blue tint which prevails in the other half of Sky Island while her hair is a queer color all unknown to us She is not like our people and would not harmonize with the universal color here That s true said another the three strangers are all inharmonious If allowed to remain here they would ruin the color scheme of the country where all is now pink In spite of that said Coralie they are harmless creatures and have done us no wrong Yes they have replied a nervous little Sunrise man they wronged us by coming here They could not help doing that argued Coralie and it is their misfortune that they are here on Sky Island at all Perhaps if we keep them with us for awhile they may find a way to return safely to their own country We ll fly through the sky by and by ki yi yelled the parrot with startling suddenness It that true asked a Pinky seriously Why we would if we could answered Trot We flew to this island anyhow Perhaps said another if we pushed them off the edge they could fly down again Who knows We know answered Cap n Bill hastily We d tumble but we wouldn t fly They d take a fall And that is all observed the parrot fluttering its wings There was silence for a moment while all the Pinkies seemed to think deeply Then the Queen asked the strangers to step outside while they counseled together Our friends obeyed and leaving the room they entered the courtyard and examined the rows of pink marble statues for nearly an hour before they were summoned to return to the little room in Tourmaline s palace We are now ready to vote as to your fate said the pretty Queen to them We have decided there are but two things for us to do either permit you to remain here as honored guests or take you to an edge of the island and throw you over the bushes into the sky They were silent at hearing this dreadful alternative but the parrot screamed shrilly Oh what a dump Oh what a jump Won t we all thump when we land with a bump If we do said Cap n Bill thoughtfully we ll none of us know it Illustration Illustration ROSALIE THE WITCH CHAPTER sixteen Trot and Button Bright had now become worried and anxious for they knew if they were tossed over the edge of the island they would be killed Cap n Bill frowned and set his jaws tight together The old sailor had made up his mind to make a good fight for his boy and girl as well as for his own life if he was obliged to do so The twelve Counselors then voted and when the vote was counted Tourmaline announced that six had voted to allow the strangers to remain and six to toss them over the bushes We seem evenly divided on this matter remarked the Queen with a puzzled look at her Council Trot thought the pretty Queen was their friend so she said Of course you ll have the deciding vote then you being the Ruler Oh no replied Tourmaline Since I have asked these good people to advise me it would be impolite to side against some of them and with the others That would imply that the judgment of some of my Counselors is wrong and the judgment of others right I must ask some one else to cast the deciding vote Who will it be then inquired Trot Can t I do it Or Cap n Bill or Button Bright Tourmaline smiled and shook her head while all the Counselors murmured their protests Let Trot do it Or you ll rue it advised the parrot and then he barked like a dog and made them all jump Let me think a moment said the Queen resting her chin on her hand A Pink can think As quick s a wink the parrot declared But Tourmaline s thoughts required time and all her Counselors remained silent and watched her anxiously At last she raised her head and said I shall call upon Rosalie the Witch She is wise and honest and will decide the matter justly The Pinkies seemed to approve this choice so Tourmaline rose and took a small pink paper parcel from a drawer In it was a pink powder which she scattered upon the seat of a big armchair Then she lighted this powder which at first flashed vivid pink and then filled all the space around the chair with a thick pink cloud of smoke Presently the smoke cleared away when they all saw seated within the chair Rosalie the Witch This famous woman was much like the other Pinkies in appearance except that she was somewhat taller and not quite so fat as most of the people Her skin and hair and eyes were all of a rosy pink color and her gown was of spider web gauze that nicely matched her complexion She did not seem very old for her features were smiling and attractive and pleasant to view She held in her hand a slender staff tipped with a lustrous pink jewel All the Pinkies present bowed very respectfully to Rosalie who returned the salutation with a dignified nod Then Tourmaline began to explain the presence of the three strangers and the difficulty of deciding what to do with them I have summoned you here that you may cast the deciding vote added the Queen What shall we do Rosalie allow them to remain here as honored guests or toss them over the bushes into the sky Rosalie during Tourmaline s speech had been attentively examining the faces of the three Earth people Now she said Before I decide I must see who these strangers are I will follow their adventures in a vision to discover if they have told you the truth And in order that you may all share my knowledge you shall see the vision as I see it She then bowed her head and closed her eyes Rock a bye baby on a tree top Don t wake her up or the vision will stop muttered the parrot but no one paid any attention to the noisy bird Gradually a pink mist formed in the air about the Witch and in this mist the vision began to appear First there was Button Bright in the attic of his house finding the Magic Umbrella Then his first flight was shown and afterward his trip across the United States until he landed on the bluff where Trot sat In rapid succession the scenes shifted and disclosed the trial flights with Trot and Cap n Bill as passengers then the trip to Sky Island and the meeting with the Boolooroo No sound was heard but it was easy from the gestures of the actors for the Pinkies to follow all the adventures of the strangers in the Blue Country Button Bright was greatly astonished to see in this vision how the Boolooroo had tested the Magic Umbrella and in a fit of rage cast it into a corner underneath the cabinet with the seats and lunch basket still attached to the handle by means of the rope The boy now knew why he could not find the umbrella in the Treasure Chamber and he was provoked to think he had several times been quite close to it without knowing it was there The last scene ended with the trip through the Fog Bank and the assistance rendered them by the friendly frog After the three tumbled upon the grass of the Pink Country the vision faded away and Rosalie lifted her head with a smile of triumph at the success of her witchcraft Did you see clearly she asked We did O Wonderful Witch they declared Then said Rosalie there can be no doubt in your minds that these strangers have told you the truth None at all they admitted What arguments are advanced by the six Counselors who voted to allow them to remain here as guests inquired the Witch They have done us no harm answered Coralie speaking for her side therefore we should in honor and justice do them no harm Rosalie nodded What arguments have the others advanced she asked They interfere with our color scheme and do not harmonize with our people a man of the Sunrise Tribe answered Again Rosalie nodded and Trot thought her eyes twinkled a little I think I now fully comprehend the matter said she and so I will cast my vote I favor taking the Earth people to the edge of the island and casting them into the sky For a moment there was perfect silence in the room All present realized that this was a decree of death to the strangers Trot was greatly surprised at the decision and for a moment she thought her heart had stopped beating for a wave of fear swept over her Button Bright flushed red as a Pinky and then grew very pale He crept closer to Trot and took her hand in his own pressing it to give the little girl courage As for Cap n Bill he was watching the smiling face of the Witch in a puzzled but not hopeless way for he thought she did not seem wholly in earnest in what she had said The case is decided announced Tourmaline in a clear cold voice The three strangers shall be taken at once to the edge of the island and thrown over the bushes into the sky It s raining hard outside announced Coralie who sat near the door why not wait until this shower is over I have said at once replied the little Queen with dignity and so it must be at once We are accustomed to rain so it need not delay us and when a disagreeable duty is to be performed the sooner it is accomplished the better May I ask ma am said Cap n Bill addressing the Witch why you have decided to murder of us in this cold blooded way I did not decide to murder you answered Rosalie To throw us off the island will be murder declared the sailor Then they cannot throw you off the Witch replied The Queen says they will I know said Rosalie but I m quite positive her people can t do it This statement astonished all the Pinkies who looked at the Witch inquiringly Why not asked Tourmaline It is evident to me said the Witch speaking slowly and distinctly that these Earth people are protected in some way by fairies They may not be aware of this themselves nor did I see any fairies in my vision But if you will think upon it carefully you will realize that the Magic Umbrella has no power in itself but is enchanted by fairy powers so that it is made to fly and to carry passengers through the air by fairies This being the case I do not think you will be allowed to injure these favored people in any way but I am curious to see in what manner the fairies will defend them and therefore I voted to have them thrown off the island I bear these strangers no ill will nor do I believe they are in any danger But since you Tourmaline have determined to attempt this terrible thing at once I shall go with you and see what will happen Some of the Pinkies looked pleased and some troubled at this speech but they all prepared to escort the prisoners to the nearest edge of the island The rain was pouring down in torrents and umbrellas were unknown but all of them both men and women slipped gossamer raincoats over their clothing which kept the rain from wetting them Then they caught up their sharp sticks and surrounding the doomed captives commanded them to march to meet their fate Illustration Illustration THE ARRIVAL OF POLYCHROME CHAPTER seventeen Cap n Bill had determined to fight desperately for their lives but he was a shrewd old sailorman and he found much that was reasonable in the Witch s assertion that fairies would protect them He had often wondered how the Magic Umbrella could fly and obey spoken commands but now he plainly saw that the thing must be directed by some invisible power and that power was quite likely to save them from the cruel death that had been decreed 
5471-284440-0000	train-other-500	To be sure the Magic Umbrella was now in the Blue Country and the fairies that directed its flight might be with the umbrella instead of with them yet the old sailor had already experienced some strange adventures in Trot s company
5471-284440-0001	train-other-500	and knew she had managed to escape every danger that had threatened So he decided not to fight until the last moment and meekly hobbled along the street as he was commanded to do Trot was also encouraged by the Witch s suggestion
5471-284440-0002	train-other-500	for she believed in fairies and trusted them but Button Bright could find no comfort in their situation and his face was very sad as he marched along by Trot s side
5471-284440-0003	train-other-500	If they had followed the corkscrew windings of the street it would have been a long journey to the outer edge of the Pink Country but Tourmaline took a short cut leading them through private gardens and even through houses
5471-284440-0004	train-other-500	so that they followed almost a bee line to their destination It rained all the way and the walking was very disagreeable but our friends were confronting an important crisis in their strange adventures and with possible death at their journey s end they were in no hurry to arrive there
5471-284440-0005	train-other-500	Once free of the City they traversed the open country and here they often stepped into sticky pink mud up to their ankles Cap n Bill s wooden leg would often go down deep and stick fast in this mud
5471-284440-0006	train-other-500	and at such times he would be helpless until two of the Pinkies who were a strong people pulled him out again The parrot was getting its feathers sadly draggled in the rain and the poor bird soon presented a wet and woebegone appearance
5471-284440-0007	train-other-500	Soak us again Drown us with rain it muttered in a resigned tone and then it would turn to Trot and moan The rose is red the violet s blue The Pinkies are a beastly crew The country was not so trim and neatly kept near the edge
none	none	 for it was evident the people did not care to go too near to the dangerous place 
5471-284440-0008	train-other-500	There was a row of thick bushes which concealed the gulf below and as they approached these bushes the rain abruptly ceased and the clouds began to break and drift away in the sky
5471-284440-0009	train-other-500	Two of you seize the girl and throw her over said Tourmaline in a calm matter of fact way and two others must throw the boy over It may take four perhaps to lift the huge and ancient man More n that said Cap n Bill grimly
5471-284440-0010	train-other-500	I m pretty sure it ll take all o you young lady an the chances are you won t do it then They had halted a short distance from the bushes and now there suddenly appeared through a rift in the clouds an immense Rainbow
5471-284440-0011	train-other-500	It was perfectly formed and glistened with a dozen or more superb tintings that were so vivid and brilliant and blended into one another so exquisitely that every one paused to gaze enraptured upon the sight
5471-284440-0012	train-other-500	Steadily yet with wonderful swiftness the end of the great bow descended until it rested upon the pink field almost at the feet of the little party of observers Then they saw dancing gaily upon the arch
5471-284440-0013	train-other-500	a score of beautiful maidens dressed in fleecy robes of rainbow tints which fluttered around them like clouds The Daughters of the Rainbow whispered Tourmaline in an awed voice and the Witch beside her nodded and said
5471-284440-0014	train-other-500	Fairies of the sky What did I tell you Tourmaline Just then one of the maidens tripped lightly down the span of the arch until near the very end leaning over to observe the group below
5471-284440-0015	train-other-500	She was exquisitely fair dainty as a lily and graceful as a bough swaying in the breeze Why it s Polychrome exclaimed Button Bright in a voice of mingled wonder and delight Hello Polly Don t you remember me
none	none	 Of course I remember Button Bright replied the maiden in a sweet tinkling voice 
5471-284440-0016	train-other-500	The last time I saw you was in the Land of Oz Oh cried Trot turning to stare at the boy with big wide open eyes were you ever in the Land of Oz Yes he answered still looking at the Rainbow s Daughter and then he said appealingly
5471-284440-0017	train-other-500	These people want to kill us Polly Can t you help us Polly wants a cracker Polly wants a cracker screeched the parrot
none	none	 Polychrome straightened up and glanced at her sisters Illustration Tell Father to call for me in an hour or two said she 
5471-284440-0018	train-other-500	There is work for me to do here for one of my old friends is in trouble With this she sprang lightly from the rainbow and stood beside Button Bright and Trot and scarcely had she left the splendid arch when it lifted and rose into the sky
5471-284440-0019	train-other-500	The other end had been hidden in the clouds and now the Rainbow began to fade gradually like mist and the sun broke through the clouds and shot its cheering rays over the Pink Country until presently the Rainbow had vanished altogether
5471-284440-0020	train-other-500	and the only reminder of it was the lovely Polychrome standing among the wondering band of Pinkies Tell me she said gently to the boy why are you here and why do these people of the sky wish to destroy you In a few hurried words
5471-284440-0021	train-other-500	Button Bright related their adventure with the Magic Umbrella and how the Boolooroo had stolen it and they had been obliged to escape into the Pink Country Polychrome listened and then turned to the Queen Why have you decreed death to these innocent strangers she asked
5471-284440-0022	train-other-500	They do not harmonize with our color scheme replied Tourmaline That is utter nonsense declared Polychrome impatiently You re so dreadfully pink here that your color which in itself is beautiful has become tame and insipid
5471-284440-0023	train-other-500	What you really need is some sharp contrast to enhance the charm of your country and to keep these three people with you would be a benefit rather than an injury to you At this the Pinkies looked downcast and ashamed
5471-284440-0024	train-other-500	while only Rosalie the Witch laughed and seemed to enjoy the rebuke But protested Tourmaline the Great Book of Laws says our country shall harbor none but the Pinkies Does it indeed asked the Rainbow s Daughter
5471-284440-0025	train-other-500	Come let us return at once to your City and examine your Book of Laws I am quite sure I can find in them absolute protection for these poor wanderers They dared not disobey Polychrome s request so at once they all turned and walked back to the City
5471-284440-0026	train-other-500	As it was still muddy underfoot the Rainbow s Daughter took a cloak from one of the women partly rolled it and threw it upon the ground Then she stepped upon it and began walking forward The cloak unrolled as she advanced affording a constant carpet for her feet
5471-284440-0027	train-other-500	and for those of the others who followed her So being protected from the mud and wet they speedily gained the City and in a short time were all gathered in the low room of Tourmaline s palace where the Great Book of Laws lay upon a table
5471-284440-0028	train-other-500	Polychrome began turning over the leaves while the others all watched her anxiously and in silence Here she said presently is a Law which reads as follows
5471-284440-0029	train-other-500	Everyone in the Pink Country is entitled to the protection of the Ruler and to a house and a good living except only the Blueskins If any of the natives of the Blue Country should ever break through the Fog Bank
5471-284440-0030	train-other-500	they must be driven back with sharp sticks Have you read this Law Tourmaline Yes said the Queen but how does that apply to these strangers Why being in the Pink Country as they surely are and not being Blueskins
5471-284440-0031	train-other-500	they are by this Law entitled to protection to a home and good living The Law does not say Pinkies it says any who are in the Pink Country True agreed Coralie greatly pleased
5471-284440-0032	train-other-500	and all the other Pinkies nodded their heads and repeated True true The rose is red the violet s blue The law s the thing because it s true cried the parrot I am indeed relieved to have you interpret the Law in this way declared Tourmaline
5471-284440-0033	train-other-500	I knew it was cruel to throw these poor people over the edge but that seemed to us the only thing to be done It was cruel and unjust answered Polychrome as sternly as her sweet voice could speak
5471-284440-0034	train-other-500	But here she added for she had still continued to turn the leaves of the Great Book is another Law which you have also overlooked It says The person whether man or woman boy or girl living in the Pink Country who has the lightest skin
5471-284440-0035	train-other-500	shall be the Ruler King or Queen as long as he or she lives unless some one of a lighter skin is found and this Ruler s commands all the people must obey Do you know this Law Oh yes replied Tourmaline
5471-284440-0036	train-other-500	That is why I am the Queen You will notice my complexion is of a lighter pink than that of any other of my people Yes remarked Polychrome looking at her critically when you were made Queen without doubt you had the lightest colored skin in all the Pink Country
5471-284440-0037	train-other-500	But now you are no longer Queen of the Pinkies Tourmaline Those assembled were so startled by this statement that they gazed at the Rainbow s Daughter in astonishment for a time Then Tourmaline asked Why not your Highness
5471-284440-0038	train-other-500	Because here is one lighter in color than yourself pointing to Trot This girl is by the Law of the Great Book the rightful Queen of the Pinkies and as loyal citizens you are all obliged to obey her commands
5471-284440-0039	train-other-500	Give me that circlet from your brow Tourmaline Without hesitation Tourmaline removed the rose gold circlet with its glittering jewel and handed it to Polychrome who turned and placed it upon Trot s brow Then she called in a loud imperative voice
5471-284440-0040	train-other-500	Greet your new Queen Pinkies One by one they all advanced knelt before Trot and pressed her hand to their lips Long live Queen Mayre called out Cap n Bill dancing around on his wooden leg in great delight vive la
5471-284440-0041	train-other-500	vive la ah ah Trot Thank you Polly said Button Bright gratefully This will fix us all right I m sure Why I have done nothing returned Polychrome smiling upon him it is the Law of the Country
5471-284440-0042	train-other-500	Isn t it surprising how little most people know of their Laws Are you all contented Pinkies she asked turning to the people
none	none	 We are they cried Then several of the men ran out to spread the news throughout the City and Country so that a vast crowd soon began to gather in the Court of the Statues Illustration Illustration MAYRE QUEEN OF THE PINK COUNTRY CHAPTER eighteen Polychrome now dismissed all but Button Bright Cap n Bill Rosalie the Witch and the new Queen of the Pinkies Tourmaline hastened away to her father s house to put on a beautiful gown all covered with flounces and ribbons for she was glad to be relieved of the duties of Queen and was eager to be gaily dressed and one of the people again I s pose said Trot I ll have to put on one of Tourmaline s common pink dresses Yes replied Polychrome you must follow the customs of the country absurd though they may be In the little sleeping chamber adjoining this room you will find plenty of gowns poor enough for the Queen to wear Shall I assist you to put one on
8591_284445_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 No answered Trot 
none	none	I guess I can manage it alone When she withdrew to the little chamber the Rainbow s Daughter began conversing with the Witch whom she urged to stay with the new queen and protect her as long as she ruled the Pink Country Rosalie who longed to please the powerful Polychrome whose fairy powers as Daughter of the Rainbow were far superior to her own witchcraft promised faithfully to devote herself to Queen Mayre as long as she might need her services By the time Trot was dressed in pink and had returned to the room there was an excited and clamorous crowd assembled in the court and Polychrome took the little girl s hand and led her out to greet her new subjects The Pinkies were much impressed by the fact that the Rainbow s Daughter was their new Queen s friend and that Rosalie the Witch stood on Trot s left hand and treated her with humble deference So they shouted their approval very enthusiastically and pressed forward one by one to kneel before their new Ruler and kiss her hand The parrot was now on Cap n Bill s shoulder for Trot thought a Queen ought not to carry a bird around but the parrot did not mind the change and was as much excited as anyone in the crowd Oh what bliss to kiss a miss he shouted as Trot held out her hand to be kissed by her subjects and then he would scream We re in the sky and flyin high We re goin to live instead of die It s time to laugh instead of cry Oh my ki yi ain t this a pie Cap n Bill let the bird jabber as he pleased for the occasion was a joyful one and it was no wonder the parrot was excited And while the throng shouted greetings to the Queen suddenly the great Rainbow appeared in the sky and dropped its end right on the Court of the Statues Polychrome stooped to kiss Trot and Button Bright gave Cap n Bill a charming smile and Rosalie the Witch a friendly nod of farewell Then she sprang lightly upon the arch of the Rainbow and was greeted by the bevy of dancing laughing maidens who were her sisters I shall keep watch over you Button Bright she called to the boy Don t despair whatever happens for behind the clouds is always the Rainbow Thank you Polly he answered and Trot also thanked the lovely Polychrome and so did Cap n Bill The parrot made quite a long speech flying high above the arch where Polychrome stood and then back to Cap n Bill s shoulder Said he We Pollys know our business and we re all right We ll take good care of Cap n Bill and Trot and Button Bright You watch em from the Rainbow and I ll watch day and night And we ll call a sky policeman if trouble comes in sight Suddenly the bow lifted and carried the dancing maidens into the sky The colors faded the arch slowly dissolved and the heavens were clear Trot turned to the Pinkies Let s have a holiday to day she said Have a good time and enjoy yourselves I don t jus know how I m goin to rule this country yet but I ll think it over an let you know Then she went into the palace hut with Cap n Bill and Button Bright and Rosalie the Witch and the people went away to enjoy themselves and talk over the surprising events of the day Dear me said Trot throwing herself into a chair wasn t that a sudden change of fortune though That Rainbow s Daughter is a pretty good fairy I m glad you knew her Button Bright I was sure something would happen to save you remarked Rosalie and that was why I voted to have you thrown off the edge I wanted to discover who would come to your assistance and I found out Now I have made a friend of Polychrome and that will render me more powerful as a Witch for I can call upon her for assistance whenever I need her But see here said Cap n Bill you can t afford to spend your time a rulin this tucked up country Trot Why not asked Trot who was pleased with her new and important position It d get pretty tiresome mate after you d had a few quarrels with the Pinkies for they expec their Queen to be as poor as poverty an never have any fun in life You wouldn t like it for long I m sure added Button Bright seriously Trot seemed thoughtful No I don t know s I would she admitted But as long as we stay here it seems a pretty good thing to be Queen I guess I m a little proud of it I wish mother could see me rulin the Pinkies an Papa Griffith too Wouldn t they open their eyes They would mate but they can t see you said Cap n Bill So the question is what s to be done We ought to get home observed the boy Our folks will worry about us and Earth s the best place to live after all If we could only get hold of my Magic Umbrella we d be all right The rose is red the violet s blue But the umbrel s stole by the Boo loo roo screamed the parrot That s it said Cap n Bill the Boolooroo s got the umbrel an that settles the question Tell me said Rosalie if you had your Magic Umbrella could you fly home again in safety Of course we could replied Button Bright And would you prefer to go home to remaining here We would indeed Then why do you not get the umbrella How asked Trot eagerly The Witch paused a moment Then she said You must go into the Blue Country and force the Boolooroo to give up your property Through the Fog Bank asked Cap n Bill doubtfully And let the Boolooroo capture us again demanded Button Bright with a shiver An have to wait on the Snubnoses instead of bein a Queen said Trot You must remember that conditions have changed and you are now a powerful Ruler replied Rosalie The Pinkies are really a great nation and they are pledged to obey your commands Why not assemble an army march through the Fog Bank fight and conquer the Boolooroo and recapture the Magic Umbrella Hooray shouted Cap n Bill pounding his wooden leg on the floor that s the proper talk Let s do it Queen Trot It doesn t seem like a bad idea added Button Bright Do you think the Pinkies could fight the Blueskins asked Trot Why not replied the sailorman They have sharp sticks an know how to use em whereas the Blueskins have only them windin up cords with weights on the ends The Blueskins are the biggest people said the girl But they re cowards I m sure declared the boy Anyhow the sailor remarked that s our only hope of ever gett n home again I d like to try it Trot If you decide on this adventure said Rosalie I believe I can be of much assistance to you That ll help asserted Cap n Bill And we ve one good friend among the Blueskins said Button Bright I m sure Ghip Ghisizzle will side with us and I ve got the Royal Record Book which proves that the Boolooroo has already reigned his lawful three hundred years Does the book say that inquired Trot with interest Yes I ve been reading it Then Sizzle ll be the new Boolooroo said the girl an p raps we won t have to fight after all We d better go prepared though advised Cap n Bill fer that awful ol Boolooroo won t give up without a struggle When shall we start Trot hesitated so they all looked to Rosalie for advice Just as soon as we can get the army together and ready decided the Witch That will not take long perhaps two or three days Good cried Cap n Bill and the parrot screamed Here s a lovely how d y do We re going to fight the Boo loo roo We ll get the Six Snubnoses too And make em all feel mighty blue Either that or the other thing said Trot Anyhow we re in for it Illustration Illustration THE WAR OF THE PINKS AND BLUES CHAPTER nineteen Much to the surprise of the Earth people the Pinkies made no objection whatever to undertaking the adventure Their lives were so monotonous and uninteresting that they welcomed anything in the way of excitement This march through the unknown Fog Bank to fight the unknown Blueskins aroused them to enthusiasm and although the result of the expedition could not be foretold and some of them were almost certain to get hurt they did not hesitate to undertake the war It appeared that Coralie was Captain of the Sunset Tribe and a man named Tintint the Captain of the Sunrise Tribe Tintint had a very pink skin and eyes so faded in their pink color that he squinted badly in order to see anything around him He was a fat and pompous little fellow and loved to strut up and down his line of warriors twirling his long pointed stick so that all might admire him By Rosalie s advice the Army of Conquest consisted of one hundred Sunsets and one hundred Sunrises Many more were eager to go but the Witch thought that would be enough The warriors consisted of both men and women equally divided and there was no need to provide uniforms for them because their regular pink clothing was a distinctive uniform in itself Each one bore a long pointed stick as the main weapon and had two short pointed sticks stuck in his belt While the army was getting ready Rosalie the Witch went to the central edge of the Fog Bank and fearlessly entered it There she called for the King of the Giant Frogs who came at her bidding and the two held an earnest and long talk together Meantime Cap n Bill had the army assembled in the Court of the Statues where Queen Mayre appeared and told the Pinkies that the sailorman was to be Commander in Chief of the Expedition and all must obey his commands Then Cap n Bill addressed the army and told what the Fog Bank was like He advised them all to wear their raincoats over their pretty pink clothes so they would not get wet and he assured them that all the creatures to be met with in the Fog were perfectly harmless When we come to the Blue Country though he added you re liable to be pretty busy The Blueskins are tall an lanky an ugly an fierce an if they happen to capture you you ll all be patched which is a deep disgrace an a uncomfertable mix up Will they throw us over the edge asked Captain Tintint nervously I don t think it replied Cap n Bill While I was there I never heard the edge mentioned They re cruel enough to do that specially the Boolooroo but I guess they ve never thought o throwin folks over the edge They fight with long cords that have weights on the ends which coil round you an make you helpless in a jiffy so whenever they throw them cords you mus ward em off with your long sticks Don t let em wind around your bodies or you re done for He told them other things about the Blueskins so they would not be frightened when they faced the enemy and found them so different in appearance from themselves and also he assured them that the Pinkies were so much the braver and better armed that he had no doubt they would easily conquer On the third day just at sunrise the army moved forward to the Fog Bank headed by Cap n Bill clad in an embroidered pink coat with wide flowing pink trousers and accompanied by Trot and Button Bright and Rosalie the Witch all bundled up in their pink raincoats The parrot was there too as the bird refused to be left behind They had not advanced far into the deep fog when they were halted by a queer barrier consisting of a long line of gigantic frogs crouching so close together that no Pinkie could squeeze between them As the heads of the frogs were turned the other way toward the Blue Country the army could not at first imagine what the barrier was but Rosalie said to them Our friends the frogs have agreed to help us through the Fog Bank Climb upon their backs as many on each frog as are able to hold on and then we shall make the journey more quickly Obeying this injunction the Pinkies began climbing upon the frogs and by crowding close together all were able to find places On the back of the King Frog rode Trot and her parrot besides Rosalie Button Bright Cap n Bill and the captains of the two companies of the army When all were seated clinging to one another so they would not slide off Cap n Bill gave the word of command and away leaped the frogs all together They bounded a long distance at this jump some farther than others and as soon as they landed they jumped again without giving their passengers a chance to get their breaths It was a bewildering and exciting ride but a dozen of the huge jumps accomplished the journey and at the edge of Fog Bank each frog stopped so suddenly that the Pinkies went flying over their heads to tumble into the blue fields of the Blue Country where they rolled in a confused mass until they could recover and scramble to their feet No one was hurt however and the King Frog had been wise enough to treat his passengers more gently by slowing down at the edge and allowing his riders to slip to the ground very comfortably Illustration Cap n Bill at once formed his army into line of battle and had them all remove the cumbersome raincoats which they piled in a heap at the edge of the Fog Bank It was a splendid array of warriors and from where they stood they could discover several Blueskins rushing in a panic toward the Blue City as fast as their long blue legs could carry them Well they know we re here anyhow said Cap n Bill and instead of waitin to see what ll they do I guess we ll jus march on the City an ask em to please surrender So he raised the long sharp stick with which he had armed himself and shouted For rerd march For ward march repeated Coralie to the Sunset Tribe For ward march roared Tintint to the Sunrise people March April June October screamed the parrot Then the drums beat and the band played and away marched the Pinkies to capture the Blue City Illustration Illustration GHIP GHISIZZLE HAS A BAD TIME CHAPTER twenty The Boolooroo was quite busy at the time the Pinkies invaded his country He had discovered the loss of the Book of Records and after being frightened most to death at the prospect of his fraud on the people s being made public he decided to act boldly and hold his position as Boolooroo at any cost Since Ghip Ghisizzle was to be the next Boolooroo the king suspected him first of all so he had the Majordomo bound with cords and brought before him when he accused him of stealing the Book of Records Of course Ghip Ghisizzle denied taking the Book but he became almost as nervous at its loss as had the Boolooroo He secretly believed that Button Bright had taken the Book from the Treasure Chamber and if this were true it might prove as great a misfortune as if the king had kept it locked up For Button Bright had escaped into the Fog Bank and Ghip Ghisizzle was afraid the boy would never again be seen in the Blue Country He did not tell the Boolooroo of this suspicion because in that case the king would realize he was secure and that his deception could never be proved against him The Majordomo simply denied taking the Record Book and the Boolooroo did not believe he spoke truly To prevent his rival from ever becoming the Ruler of the Blue Country the Boolooroo determined to have him patched but for some time he could find no other Blueskin to patch him with No one had disobeyed a command or done anything wrong so the king was in a quandary until he discovered that a servant named Tiggle had mixed the royal nectar for Cap n Bill who had been ordered to do it at the time of his capture This was sufficient excuse for the Boolooroo who at once had Tiggle made a prisoner and brought before him This servant was not so long legged as Ghip Ghisizzle and his head was thicker and his nose flatter But that pleased the Boolooroo all the more He realized that when the great knife had sliced the prisoners in two and their halves were patched together they would present a ridiculous sight and all the Blueskins would laugh at them and avoid them So on the very morning that the Pinkies arrived the Boolooroo had ordered his two prisoners brought into the room of the palace where the Great Knife stood and his soldiers were getting ready to perform the operation of patching Ghip Ghisizzle with Tiggle when a messenger came running to say that a great army of the Pinkies had broken through the Fog Bank Never mind said the Boolooroo I ll attend to them in a minute I m busy now They are marching on the City said the frightened messenger If you delay Most High and Mighty One we shall all be captured You d better save your City first and do your patching afterward What roared the Boolooroo dare you dictate to me But he was impressed by the man s logic After locking the prisoners who were still bound in the Room of the Great Knife the Ruler hurried away to assemble his soldiers By this time the Pinkies had advanced halfway to the walls of the City so the first thing the Boolooroo did was to order all the gates closed and locked and then he placed a line of soldiers on the wall to prevent any of the Pinkies from climbing over Therefore when Cap n Bill s army reached the wall he was obliged to halt his ranks until he could find a way to enter the City Now when the Boolooroo looked through the blue steel bars of the main gate and saw the enemy armed with sharp pointed sticks he began to tremble and when he thought how painful it would be to have his body and arms and legs prodded and pricked by such weapons he groaned aloud and was very miserable But the thought occurred to him that if he could avoid being caught by the Pinkies they would be unable to harm him So he went among his people and reminded them how horrible it would feel to be punched full of holes by the invaders and urged them to fight desperately and drive the Pinkies back into the Fog Bank Only a few of the Blueskins were soldiers and these all belonged to the King s bodyguard but the citizens realized they must indeed fight bravely to save themselves from getting hurt so they promised the Boolooroo to do all they could They armed themselves with long cords having weights fastened to the ends and practiced throwing these weights in such a manner that the cords would wind around their enemies Also they assembled in the streets in small groups and told each other in frightened whispers that all their trouble was due to the Boolooroo s cruel treatment of the Earth people If he had received them as friends instead of making them slaves they would never have escaped to the Pinkies and brought an army into the Blue Country that they might be revenged The Blueskins had not liked their Boolooroo before this and now they began to hate him forgetting they had also treated the strangers in a very disagreeable manner Meantime the Six Snubnosed Princesses had seen from their rooms in a tower of the palace the army of the Pinkies marching upon them and the sight had served to excite them greatly They had been quarreling bitterly among themselves all the morning and strangely enough this quarrel was all about which of them should marry Ghip Ghisizzle They knew that some day the Majordomo would become Boolooroo and each one of the six had determined to marry him so as to be the Queen and thus force her sisters to obey her commands They paid no attention to the fact that Ghip Ghisizzle did not want to marry any of them for they had determined that when it was agreed who should have him they would ask their father to force the man to marry While they quarreled in one room of the palace Ghip Ghisizzle was in danger of being patched in another room but the Six Snubnosed Princesses did not know that The arrival of the Pinkies gave them something new to talk about so they hurried downstairs and along the corridors so as to gain the courtyard and take part in the exciting scenes But as they passed the closed door of the Room of the Great Knife they heard a low moan and stopped to listen The moan was repeated and being curious they unlocked the door the key having been left on the outside and entered the room At once the Pinkies were forgotten for there upon the floor tightly bound lay Ghip Ghisizzle and beside him poor Tiggle who had uttered the moans The six Princesses sat down in a circle facing the captives and Cerulia said Ghip my dear we will release you on one condition That you choose a wife from among us and promise to marry the one selected as soon as the Pinkies are driven back into the Fog Bank Ghip Ghisizzle managed to shake his head Then he said Really ladies you must excuse me I d rather be patched than mismatched as I would be with a lovely snubnosed wife You are too beautiful for me go seek your husbands elsewhere Monster cried Indigo if you choose me I ll scratch your eyes out If you choose me said Cobalt in a rage I ll tear out your hair by the roots If I am to be your wife screamed Azure I ll mark your obstinate face with my finger nails And I said Turquoise passionately will pound your head with a broomstick I ll shake him till his teeth rattle shrieked Sapphire The best way to manage a husband observed Cerulia angrily is to pull his nose Ladies said Ghip Ghisizzle when he had a chance to speak do not anticipate these pleasures I beg of you for I shall choose none among you for a wife We ll see about that said Indigo I think you will soon change your mind added Azure I m going to be patched to Tiggle here as soon as the Boolooroo returns said Ghip Ghisizzle and it s against the law for a patched man to marry anyone It s regarded as half bigamy Illustration Dear me cried Cobalt if he s patched he never can be Boolooroo Then he mustn t be patched declared Sapphire We must save him from that fate girls and force him to decide among us Otherwise none of us can ever be the Queen This being evident they proceeded to unbind the long legs of Ghip Ghisizzle leaving his body and arms however tied fast together Then between them they got him upon his feet and led him away paying no attention to poor Tiggle who whined to be released so he could fight in the war After a hurried consultation the Six Snubnosed Princesses decided to hide the Majordomo in one of their boudoirs so they dragged him up the stairs to their reception room and fell to quarreling as to whose boudoir should be occupied by their captive Not being able to settle the question they finally locked him up in a vacant room across the hall and told him he must stay there until he had decided to marry one of the Princesses and could make a choice among them Illustration Illustration THE CAPTURE OF CAP N BILL CHAPTER twenty one While this was transpiring in the palace Cap n Bill and the Pinkies had encamped before the principal gate of the City and a tent had been pitched for Trot and Button Bright and Rosalie The army had been very fearful and weak kneed when it first entered the Blue Country but perceiving that the Boolooroo and his people were afraid of them and had locked themselves up in the City the Pinkies grew bolder and longed to make an attack One of them in his curiosity to examine the Blue City got a little too near the wall and a blue soldier throw his cord and weight at him 
8591_284444_000007_000001	train-clean-360	The cord didn t wind around the Pinkie as he was too far off but the weight hit him in the eye and made him howl lustily as he trotted back to his comrades at full speed 
8591_284444_000007_000002	train-clean-360	After this experience the invaders were careful to keep a safe distance from the wall 
8591_284444_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The Boolooroo having made all preparations to receive the enemy was annoyed because they held back 
8591_284444_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He was himself so nervous and excited that he became desperate and after an hour of tedious waiting during which time he pranced around impatiently he decided to attack the hated Pinkies and rid the country of them 
8591_284444_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Their dreadful color makes me hysterical he said to his soldiers so if I am to have any peace of mind we must charge the foe and drive them back into the Fog Bank 
8591_284444_000009_000001	train-clean-360	But take all the prisoners you can my brave men and to morrow we will have a jolly time patching them 
8591_284444_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Don t be afraid those pink creatures have no blue blood in their veins and they ll run like rabbits when they see us coming 
8591_284444_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Then he ordered the gate thrown open and immediately the Blueskins poured out into the open plain and began to run toward the Pinkies 
8591_284444_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The Boolooroo went out too but he kept well behind his people remembering the sharp sticks with which the enemy were armed 
none	none	Cap n Bill was alert and had told his army what to do in case of an attack 
8591_284444_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The Pinkies did not run like rabbits but formed a solid line and knelt down with their long sharp sticks pointed directly toward the Blueskins the other ends being set firmly upon the ground 
8591_284444_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Of course the Blueskins couldn t run against these sharp points so they halted a few feet away and began to swing their cord and weights 
none	none	But the Pinkies were too close together to be caught in this manner and now by command of Cap n Bill they suddenly rose to their feet and began jabbing their sticks at the foe 
8591_284444_000011_000004	train-clean-360	The Blueskins hesitated until a few got pricked and began to yell with terror when the whole of the Boolooroo s attacking party turned and ran back to the gate their Ruler reaching it first of all 
8591_284444_000011_000005	train-clean-360	The Pinkies tried to chase them but their round fat legs were no match for the long thin legs of the Blueskins who quickly gained the gate and shut themselves up in the City again 
8591_284444_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 It is evident panted the Boolooroo facing his defeated soldiers wrathfully that you are a pack of cowards 
none	none	We but followed your own royal example in running replied the Captain
8591_284444_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 I merely ran back to the City to get a drink of water for I was thirsty declared the Boolooroo 
8591_284444_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 So did we 
8591_284444_000015_000001	train-clean-360	So did we cried the soldiers eagerly 
8591_284444_000015_000002	train-clean-360	 We were all thirsty 
8591_284444_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Your High and Mighty Spry and Flighty Majesty remarked the Captain respectfully it occurs to me that the weapons of the Pinkies are superior to our own 
8591_284444_000016_000001	train-clean-360	What we need in order to oppose them successfully is a number of sharp sticks which are longer than their own 
8591_284444_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 True true exclaimed the Boolooroo enthusiastically 
8591_284444_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Get to work at once and make yourselves long sharp sticks and then we will attack the enemy again 
8591_284444_000018_000000	train-clean-360	So the soldiers and citizens all set to work preparing long sharp sticks and while they were doing this Rosalie the Witch had a vision in which she saw exactly what was going on inside the City wall 
8591_284444_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Queen Trot and Cap n Bill and Button Bright saw the vision too for they were all in the tent together and the sight made them anxious 
8591_284444_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 What can be done asked the girl 
8591_284444_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 The Blueskins are bigger and stronger than the Pinkies and if they have sharp sticks which are longer than ours they will surely defeat us 
8591_284444_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 I have one magic charm said Rosalie thoughtfully that will save our army but I am allowed to work only one magic charm every three days not oftener and perhaps I ll need the magic for other things 
8591_284444_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Strikes me ma am returned the sailor that what we need most on this expedition is to capture the Blueskins 
8591_284444_000021_000001	train-clean-360	If we don t we ll need plenty of magic to help us back to the Pink Country but if we do we can take care of ourselves without magic 
8591_284444_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Very well replied Rosalie I will take your advice Cap n and enchant the weapons of the Pinkies 
8591_284444_000023_000000	train-clean-360	She then went out and had all the Pinkies come before her one by one and she enchanted their sharp sticks by muttering some cabalistic words and making queer passes with her hands over the weapons 
8591_284444_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Now she said to them you will be powerful enough to defeat the Blueskins whatever they may do 
8591_284444_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The Pinkies were overjoyed at this promise and it made them very brave indeed since they now believed they would surely be victorious 
none	none	When the Boolooroo s people were armed with long thin lances of bluewood all sharpened to fine points at one end they prepared to march once more against the invaders 
8591_284444_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Their sticks were twice as long as those of the Pinkies and the Boolooroo chuckled with glee to think what fun they would have in punching holes in the round fat bodies of his enemies 
8591_284444_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Out from the gate they marched very boldly and pressed on to attack the Pinkies who were drawn up in line of battle to receive them with Cap n Bill at their head 
8591_284444_000027_000001	train-clean-360	When the opposing forces came together however and the Blueskins pushed their points against the Pinkies the weapons which had been enchanted by Rosalie began to whirl in swift circles so swift that the eye could scarcely follow the motion 
8591_284444_000027_000002	train-clean-360	The result was that the lances of the Boolooroo s people could not touch the Pinkies but were thrust aside with violence and either broken in two or sent hurling through the air in all directions 
8591_284444_000027_000003	train-clean-360	Finding themselves so suddenly disarmed the amazed Blueskins turned about and ran again while Cap n Bill greatly excited by his victory shouted to his followers to pursue the enemy and hobbled after them as fast as he could make his wooden leg go swinging his sharp stick as he advanced 
8591_284444_000028_000000	train-clean-360	The Blues were in such a frightened confused mass that they got in one another s way and could not make very good progress on the retreat so the old sailor soon caught up with them and began jabbing at the crowd with his stick 
8591_284444_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Unfortunately the Pinkies had not followed their commander being for the moment dazed by their success so that Cap n Bill was all alone among the Blueskins when he stepped his wooden leg into a hole in the ground and tumbled full length his sharp stick flying from his hand and pricking the Boolooroo in the leg as it fell 
8591_284444_000029_000000	train-clean-360	At this the Ruler of the Blues stopped short in his flight to yell with terror but seeing that only the sailorman was pursuing them and that this solitary foe had tumbled flat upon the ground he issued a command and several of his people fell upon poor Cap n Bill seized him in their long arms and carried him struggling into the City where he was fast bound 
8591_284444_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Then a panic fell upon the Pinkies at the loss of their leader and Trot and Button Bright called out in vain for them to rescue Cap n Bill 
8591_284444_000030_000001	train-clean-360	By the time the army recovered their wits and prepared to obey it was too late 
8591_284444_000030_000002	train-clean-360	And although Trot ran with them in her eagerness to save her friend the gate was found to be fast barred and she knew it was impossible for them to force an entrance into the City 
8591_284444_000031_000000	train-clean-360	So she went sorrowfully back to the camp followed by the Pinkies and asked Rosalie what could be done 
8591_284444_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I m sure I do not know replied the Witch 
none	none	I cannot use another magic charm until three days have expired but if they do not harm Cap n Bill during that time I believe I can then find a way to save him
8591_284444_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Three days is a long time remarked Trot dismally 
8591_284444_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 The Boolooroo may decide to patch him at once added Button Bright with equal sadness for he too mourned the sailor s loss 
none	none	It can t be helped replied Rosalie
8591_284444_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 I am not a fairy my dears but merely a witch and so my magic powers are limited 
8591_284444_000035_000002	train-clean-360	We can only hope that the Boolooroo won t patch Cap n Bill for three days 
none	none	When night settled down upon the camp of the Pinkies where many tents had now been pitched all the invaders were filled with gloom 
8591_284444_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The band tried to enliven them by playing the Dead March but it was not a success 
8591_284444_000036_000002	train-clean-360	The Pinkies were despondent in spite of the fact that they had repulsed the attack of the Blues for as yet they had not succeeded in gaining the City or finding the Magic Umbrella and the blue dusk of this dread country which was so different from their own land of sunsets made them all very nervous 
8591_284444_000036_000003	train-clean-360	They saw the moon rise for the first time in their lives and its cold silvery radiance made them shudder and prevented them from going to sleep 
8591_284444_000036_000004	train-clean-360	Trot tried to interest them by telling them that on the Earth the people had both the sun and the moon and loved them both but nevertheless it is certain that had not the terrible Fog Bank stood between them and the Pink Land most of the invading army would have promptly deserted and gone back home 
none	none	Illustration 
8591_284444_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Trot couldn t sleep either she was so worried over Cap n Bill 
none	none	She went back to the tent where Rosalie and Button Bright were sitting in the moonlight and asked the Witch if there was no way in which she could secretly get into the City of the Blues and search for her friend Rosalie thought it over for some time and then replied
8591_284444_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 We can make a rope ladder that will enable you to climb to the top of the wall and then you can lower it to the other side and descend into the City 
8591_284444_000039_000001	train-clean-360	But if anyone should see you you would be captured 
8591_284444_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll risk that said the child excited at the prospect of gaining the side of Cap n Bill in this adventurous way 
8591_284444_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 Please make the rope ladder at once Rosalie 
8591_284444_000041_000000	train-clean-360	So the Witch took some ropes and knotted together a ladder long enough to reach to the top of the wall 
8591_284444_000041_000001	train-clean-360	When it was finished the three Rosalie Trot and Button Bright stole out into the moonlight and crept unobserved into the shadow of the wall 
8591_284444_000041_000002	train-clean-360	The Blueskins were not keeping a very close watch as they were confident the Pinkies could not get into the City 
8591_284444_000042_000000	train-clean-360	The hardest part of Rosalie s task was to toss up one end of the rope ladder until it would catch on some projection on top of the wall 
8591_284444_000042_000001	train-clean-360	There were few such projections but after creeping along the wall for a distance they saw the end of a broken flagstaff near the top edge 
8591_284444_000042_000002	train-clean-360	The Witch tossed up the ladder trying to catch it upon this point and on the seventh attempt she succeeded 
8591_284444_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Good cried Trot now I can climb up 
8591_284444_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you want me to go with you asked Button Bright a little wistfully 
8591_284444_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 No said the girl you must stay to lead the army 
8591_284444_000045_000001	train-clean-360	And if you can think of a way you must try to rescue us 
8591_284444_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Perhaps I ll be able to save Cap n Bill myself but if I don t it s all up to you Button Bright 
8591_284444_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll do my best he promised 
8591_284444_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 And here keep my polly till I come back added Trot giving him the bird 
none	none	I can t take it with me for it would be a bother an if it tried to spout po try I d be discovered in a jiffy 
8591_284444_000048_000000	train-clean-360	As the beautiful Witch kissed the little girl good bye she slipped upon her finger a curious ring 
8591_284444_000048_000001	train-clean-360	At once Button Bright exclaimed 
8591_284444_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Why where has she gone 
none	none	I m right here said Trot s voice by his side
8591_284444_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 Can t you see me 
8591_284444_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 No replied the boy mystified 
none	none	Rosalie laughed
8591_284444_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 It s a magic ring I ve loaned you my dear said she and as long as you wear it you will be invisible to all eyes those of Blueskins and Pinkies alike 
none	none	I m going to let you wear this wonderful ring for it will save you from being discovered by your enemies 
8591_284444_000052_000003	train-clean-360	If at any time you wish to be seen take the ring from your finger but as long as you wear it no one can see you not even Earth people 
8591_284444_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh thank you cried Trot 
none	none	That will be fine I see you have another ring on your hand said Rosalie and I perceive it is enchanted in some way Where did you get it
8591_284444_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 The Queen of the Mermaids gave it to me answered Trot but Sky Island is so far away from the sea that the ring won t do me any good while I m here 
8591_284444_000055_000001	train-clean-360	It s only to call the mermaids to me if I need them and they can t swim in the sky you see 
8591_284444_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Rosalie smiled and kissed her again 
8591_284444_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 Be brave my dear she said and I am sure you will be able to find Cap n Bill without getting in danger yourself 
8591_284444_000056_000002	train-clean-360	But be careful not to let any Blueskin touch you for while you are in contact with any person you will become visible 
8591_284444_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Keep out of their way and you will be perfectly safe 
8591_284444_000056_000004	train-clean-360	Don t lose the ring for you must give it back to me when you return 
8591_284444_000056_000005	train-clean-360	It is one of my witchcraft treasures and I need it in my business 
none	none	Then Trot climbed the ladder although neither Button Bright nor Rosalie could see her do so and when she was on top the broad wall she pulled up the knotted ropes and began to search for a place to let it down on the other side 
8591_284444_000057_000001	train-clean-360	A little way off she found a bluestone seat near to the inner edge and attaching the ladder to this she easily descended it and found herself in the Blue City 
none	none	A guard was pacing up and down near her but as he could not see the girl he of course paid no attention to her So after marking the place where the ladder hung that she might know how to reach it again Trot hurried away through the streets of the city Illustration Illustration TROT S INVISIBLE ADVENTURE CHAPTER twenty two 
8591_284445_000004_000000	train-clean-360	All the Blueskins except a few sentries had gone to bed and were sound asleep 
8591_284445_000004_000001	train-clean-360	A blue gloom hung over the City which was scarcely relieved by a few bluish wavering lights here and there but Trot knew the general direction in which the palace lay and she decided to go there first 
none	none	She believed the Boolooroo would surely keep so important a prisoner as Cap n Bill locked up in his own palace 
8591_284445_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Once or twice the little girl lost her way for the streets were very puzzling to one not accustomed to them but finally she sighted the great palace and went up to the entrance 
8591_284445_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There she found a double guard posted 
8591_284445_000005_000002	train-clean-360	They were sitting on a bench outside the doorway and both stood up as she approached 
8591_284445_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 We thought we heard footsteps said one 
none	none	So did we replied the other yet there is no one in sight Trot then saw that the guards were the two patched men Jimfred Jonesjinks and Fredjim Jinksjones who had been talking together quite cheerfully 
8591_284445_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It was the first time the girl had seen them together and she marveled at the queer patching that had so strongly united them yet so thoroughly separated them 
8591_284445_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 You see remarked Jimfred as they seated themselves again upon the bench the Boolooroo has ordered the patching to take place to morrow morning after breakfast 
none	none	The old Earth man is to be patched to poor Tiggle instead of Ghip Ghisizzle who has in some way managed to escape from the Room of the Great Knife no one knows how but Tiggle and Tiggle won t tell
8591_284445_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 We re sorry for anyone who has to be patched replied Fredjim in a reflective tone for although it didn t hurt us as much as we expected it s a terrible mix up to be in until we become used to our strange combination 
8591_284445_000010_000001	train-clean-360	You and we are about alike now Jimfred although we were so different before 
8591_284445_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Not so said Jimfred we are really more intelligent than you are for the left side of our brain was always the keenest before we were patched 
8591_284445_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 That may be admitted Fredjim but we are much the strongest because our right arm was by far the best before we were patched 
8591_284445_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 We are not sure of that responded Jimfred for we have a right arm too and it is pretty strong 
8591_284445_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 We will test it suggested the other by all pulling upon one end of this bench with our right arms 
none	none	Whichever can pull the bench from the others must be the stronger 
8591_284445_000015_000000	train-clean-360	While they were tussling at the bench dragging it first here and then there in the trial of strength Trot opened the door of the palace and walked in 
8591_284445_000015_000001	train-clean-360	It was pretty dark in the hall and only a few dim blue lights showed at intervals down the long corridors 
8591_284445_000015_000002	train-clean-360	As the girl walked through these passages she could hear snores of various degrees coming from behind some of the closed doors and knew that all the regular inmates of the place were sound asleep 
8591_284445_000015_000003	train-clean-360	So she mounted to the upper floor and thinking she would be likely to find Cap n Bill in the Room of the Great Knife she went there and tried the door 
8591_284445_000015_000004	train-clean-360	It was locked but the key had been left on the outside 
8591_284445_000015_000005	train-clean-360	She waited until the sentry who was pacing the corridor had his back toward her and then she turned the key and slipped within softly closing the door behind her 
none	none	It was dark as pitch in the room and Trot didn t know how to make a light 
8591_284445_000016_000001	train-clean-360	After a moment s thought she began feeling her way to the window stumbling over objects as she went 
8591_284445_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Every time she made a noise some one groaned and that made the child uneasy 
8591_284445_000017_000000	train-clean-360	At last she found a window and managed to open the shutters and let the moonlight in 
none	none	It wasn t a very strong moonlight but it enabled her to examine the interior of the room 
8591_284445_000017_000002	train-clean-360	In the center stood the Great Knife which the Boolooroo used to split people in two when he patched them and at one side was a dark form huddled upon the floor and securely bound 
8591_284445_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Trot hastened to this form and knelt beside it but was disappointed to find it was only Tiggle 
none	none	The man stirred a little and rolled against Trot s knee when she at once became visible to him
8591_284445_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh it s the Earth Child said he 
8591_284445_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you condemned to be patched too little one 
none	none	No answered Trot
8591_284445_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Tell me where Cap n Bill is 
8591_284445_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t said Tiggle 
8591_284445_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 The Boolooroo has hidden him until to morrow morning when he s to be patched to me 
none	none	Ghip Ghisizzle was to have been my mate but Ghip escaped being carried away by the Six Snubnosed Princesses Why she asked One of them means to marry him explained Tiggle
8591_284445_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s worse than being patched cried Trot 
8591_284445_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Much worse said Tiggle with a groan 
8591_284445_000026_000000	train-clean-360	But now an idea occurred to the girl 
8591_284445_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Would you like to escape she asked the captive 
8591_284445_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I would indeed said he 
8591_284445_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 If I get you out of the palace can you hide yourself so that you won t be found 
none	none	Certainly he declared
8591_284445_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 I know a house where I can hide so snugly that all the Boolooroo s soldiers cannot find me 
8591_284445_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Trot I ll do it for when you re gone the Boolooroo will have no one to patch Cap n Bill to 
8591_284445_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 He may find some one else suggested the prisoner 
8591_284445_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 But it will take him time to do that and time is all I want answered the child 
8591_284445_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Even while she spoke Trot was busy with the knots in the cords and presently she had unbound Tiggle who soon got upon his feet 
none	none	Now I ll go to one end of the passage and make a noise said she and when the guard runs to see what it is you must run the other way Outside the palace Jimfred and Fredjim are on guard but if you tip over the bench they are seated on you can easily escape them
8591_284445_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll do that all right promised the delighted Tiggle 
8591_284445_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 You ve made a friend of me little girl and if ever I can help you I ll do it with pleasure 
8591_284445_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Then Trot started for the door and Tiggle could no longer see her because she was not now touching him 
8591_284445_000036_000001	train-clean-360	The man was much surprised at her disappearance but listened carefully and when he heard the girl make a noise at one end of the corridor he opened the door and ran in the opposite direction as he had been told to do 
none	none	Of course the guard could not discover what made the noise and Trot ran little risk as she was careful not to let him touch her 
8591_284445_000037_000001	train-clean-360	When Tiggle had safely escaped the little girl wandered through the palace in search of Cap n Bill but soon decided such a quest in the dark was likely to fail and she must wait until morning 
8591_284445_000037_000002	train-clean-360	She was tired too and thought she would find a vacant room of which there were many in the big palace and go to sleep until daylight 
8591_284445_000037_000003	train-clean-360	She remembered there was a comfortable vacant room just opposite the suite of the Six Snubnosed Princesses so she stole softly up to it and tried the door 
8591_284445_000037_000004	train-clean-360	It was locked but the key was outside as the Blueskins seldom took a door key away from its place 
8591_284445_000037_000005	train-clean-360	So she turned the key opened the door and walked in 
none	none	Now this was the chamber in which Ghip Ghisizzle had been confined by the Princesses his arms being bound tight to his body but his legs left free The Boolooroo in his search had failed to discover what had become of Ghip Ghisizzle but the poor man had been worried every minute for fear his retreat would be discovered or that the terrible Princesses would come for him and nag him until he went crazy There was one window in his room and the prisoner had managed to push open the sash with his knees 
8591_284445_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Looking out he found that a few feet below the window was the broad wall that ran all around the palace gardens 
8591_284445_000038_000004	train-clean-360	A little way to the right the wall joined the wall of the City being on the same level with it 
none	none	Ghip Ghisizzle had been thinking deeply upon this discovery and he decided that if anyone entered his room he would get through the window leap down upon the wall and try in this way to escape 
8591_284445_000039_000001	train-clean-360	It would be a dangerous leap for as his arms were bound he might topple off the wall into the garden but he resolved to take this chance 
none	none	Therefore when Trot rattled at the door of his room Ghip Ghisizzle ran and seated himself upon the window sill dangling his long legs over the edge 
8591_284445_000040_000001	train-clean-360	When she finally opened the door he slipped off and let himself fall to the wall where he doubled up in a heap 
8591_284445_000040_000002	train-clean-360	The next minute however he had scrambled to his feet and was running swiftly along the garden wall 
none	none	Trot finding the window open came and looked out and she saw the Majordomo s tall form hastening along the top of the wall The guards saw him too outlined against the sky in the moonlight and they began yelling at him to stop but Ghip Ghisizzle kept right on until he reached the City Wall when he began to follow that 
8591_284445_000041_000002	train-clean-360	More guards were yelling now running along the foot of the wall to keep the fugitive in sight and people began to pour out of the houses and join in the chase 
none	none	Poor Ghip realized that if he kept on the wall he would merely circle the city and finally be caught 
8591_284445_000042_000001	train-clean-360	If he leaped down into the City he would be seized at once 
8591_284445_000042_000002	train-clean-360	Just then he came opposite the camp of the Pinkies and decided to trust himself to the mercies of his Earth friends rather than be made a prisoner by his own people who would obey the commands of their detested but greatly feared Boolooroo 
8591_284445_000042_000003	train-clean-360	So suddenly he gave a mighty leap and came down into the field outside the City 
none	none	Again he fell in a heap and rolled over and over for it was a high wall and the jump a dangerous one but finally he recovered and got upon his feet delighted to find he had broken none of his bones Some of the Blueskins had by now opened a gate and out rushed a crowd to capture the fugitive but Ghip Ghisizzle made straight for the camp of the Pinkies and his pursuers did not dare follow him far in that direction 
8591_284445_000043_000001	train-clean-360	They soon gave up the chase and returned to the City while the runaway Majordomo was captured by Captain Coralie and marched away to the tent of Rosalie the Witch a prisoner of the Pinkies 
none	none	Illustration Illustration THE GIRL AND THE BOOLOOROO CHAPTER twenty three Trot watched from the window the escape of Ghip Ghisizzle but did not know of course who it was Then after the City had quieted down again she lay upon the bed without undressing and was sound asleep in a minute The blue dawn was just breaking when she opened her eyes with a start of fear that she might have overslept but soon she found that no one else in the palace was yet astir Even the guards had gone to sleep by this time and were adding their snores to the snores of the other inhabitants of the Royal Palace So the little girl got up and finding a ewer of water and a basin upon the dresser washed herself carefully and then looked in a big mirror to see how her hair was To her astonishment there was no reflection at all the mirror was blank so far as Trot was concerned She laughed a little at that remembering she wore the ring of Rosalie the Witch which rendered her invisible Then she slipped quietly out of the room and found it was already light enough in the corridors for her to see all objects distinctly After hesitating a moment which way to turn she decided to visit the Snubnosed Princesses and passed through the big reception room to the sleeping room of Indigo There this Princess the crossest and most disagreeable of all the disagreeable six was curled up in bed and slumbering cosily The little blue dog came trotting out of Indigo s boudoir and crowed like a rooster for although he could not see Trot his keen little nose scented her presence Thinking it time the Princess awoke Trot leaned over and gave her snubnose a good tweak and at once Indigo yelled like an Indian and sat up glaring around her to see who had dared to pull her nose Trot standing back in the room threw a sofa pillow that caught the Princess on the side of her head At once Indigo sprang out of bed and rushed into the chamber of Cobalt which adjoined her own Thinking it was this sister who had slyly attacked her Indigo rushed at the sleeping Cobalt and slapped her face At once there was war The other four Princesses hearing the screams and cries of rage came running into Cobalt s room and as fast as they appeared Trot threw pillows at them so that presently all six were indulging in a free for all battle and snarling like tigers The blue lamb came trotting into the room and Trot leaned over and patted the pretty little animal but as she did so she became visible for an instant each pat destroying the charm of the ring while the girl was in contact with a living creature These flashes permitted some of the Princesses to see her and at once they rushed toward her with furious cries But the girl realized what had happened and leaving the lamb she stepped back into a corner and her frenzied enemies failed to find her It was a little dangerous though remaining in a room where six girls were feeling all around for her so she went away and left them to their vain search while she renewed her hunt for Cap n Bill The sailorman did not seem to be in any of the rooms she entered so she decided to visit the Boolooroo s own apartments In the room where Rosalie s vision had shown them the Magic Umbrella lying under a cabinet Trot attempted to find it for she considered that next to rescuing Cap n Bill this was the most important task to accomplish but the umbrella had been taken away and was no longer beneath the cabinet This was a severe disappointment to the child but she reflected that the umbrella was surely some place in the Blue City so there was no need to despair Finally she entered the King s own sleeping chamber and found the Boolooroo in bed and asleep with a funny nightcap tied over his egg shaped head As Trot looked at him she was surprised to see that he had one foot out of bed and that to his big toe was tied a cord that led out of the bedchamber into a small dressing room beyond Trot slowly followed this cord and in the dressing room came upon Cap n Bill who was lying asleep upon a lounge and snoring with great vigor His arms were tied to his body and his body was tied fast to the lounge The wooden leg stuck out into the room at an angle and the shoe on his one foot had been removed so that the end of the cord could be fastened to the sailor s big toe This arrangement had been a clever thought of the Boolooroo Fearing his important prisoner might escape before he was patched as Ghip Ghisizzle had done the cruel King of the Blues had kept Cap n Bill in his private apartments and had tied his own big toe to the prisoner s big toe so that if the sailor made any attempt to get away he would pull on the cord and that would arouse the Boolooroo Trot saw through this cunning scheme at once so the first thing she did was to untie the cord from Cap n Bill s big toe and retie it to a leg of the lounge Then she unfastened her friend s bonds and leaned over to give his leathery face a smacking kiss Cap n Bill sat up and rubbed his eyes He looked around the room and rubbed his eyes again seeing no one who could have kissed him Then he discovered that his bonds had been removed and he rubbed his eyes once more to make sure he was not dreaming The little girl laughed softly Trot exclaimed the sailor recognizing her voice Then Trot came up and took his hand the touch at once rendering her visible to him Dear me said the bewildered sailor however did you get here mate in the Boolooroo s own den Is the Blue City captured Not yet she replied but you are Cap n and I ve come to save you All alone Trot All alone Cap n Bill But it s got to be done jus the same And then she explained about the magic ring Rosalie had lent her which rendered her invisible while she wore it unless she touched some living creature Cap n Bill was much interested I m willing to be saved mate he said for the Boo l roo is set on patchin me right after breakfas which I hope the cook ll be late with Who are you to be patched with she asked A feller named Tiggle who s in disgrace cause he mixed the royal necktie for me That was nectar not necktie corrected Trot But you needn t be fraid of bein patched with Tiggle cause I ve set him loose By this time he s in hiding where he can t be found That s good said Cap n Bill nodding approval but the blamed ol Bool roo s sure to find some one else What s to be done mate Trot thought about it for a moment Then she remembered how some unknown man had escaped from the palace the night before by means of the wall which he had reached from the window of the very chamber in which she had slept Cap n Bill might easily do the same And the rope ladder she had used would help the sailor down from the top of the wall Could you climb down a rope ladder Cap n she asked Like enough said he I ve done it many a time on shipboard But you hadn t a wooden leg then she reminded him The wooden leg won t bother much he assured her So Trot tied a small sofa cushion around the end of his wooden leg so it wouldn t make any noise pounding upon the floor and then she quietly led the sailor through the room of the sleeping Boolooroo and through several other rooms until they came to the passage Here a soldier was on guard but he had fallen asleep for a moment in order to rest himself They passed this Blueskin without disturbing him and soon reached the chamber opposite the suite of the Six Snubnosed Princesses whom they could hear still quarreling loudly among themselves Trot locked the door from the inside so no one could disturb them and then led the sailor to the window The garden was just below But good gracious me It s a drop o ten feet Trot he exclaimed And you ve only one foot to drop Cap n she said laughing Couldn t you let yourself down with one of the sheets from the bed I ll try he rejoined But can you do that circus act Trot Oh I m goin to stay here an find the Magic Umbrella she replied Bein invis ble Cap n I m safe enough What I want to do is to see you safe back with the Pinkies an then I ll manage to hold my own all right never fear So they brought a blue sheet and tied one end to a post of the blue bed and let the other end dangle out the blue window Good bye mate said Cap n Bill preparing to descend don t get reckless I won t Cap n Don t worry Then he grasped the sheet with both hands and easily let himself down to the wall Trot had told him where to find the rope ladder she had left and how to fasten it to the broken flagstaff so he could climb down into the field outside the City As soon as he was safe on the wall Cap n Bill began to hobble along the broad top toward the connecting wall that surrounded the entire City just as Ghip Ghisizzle had done and Trot anxiously watched him from the window But the Blue City was now beginning to waken to life One of the soldiers came from a house sleepily yawning and stretching himself and presently his eyes lit upon the huge form of Cap n Bill hastening along the top of the wall The soldier gave a yell that aroused a score of his comrades and brought them tumbling into the street When they saw how the Boolooroo s precious prisoner was escaping they instantly became alert and wide awake and every one started in pursuit along the foot of the wall Of course the long legged Blueskins could run faster than poor Cap n Bill Some of them soon got ahead of the old sailorman and came to the rope ladder which Trot had left dangling from the stone bench where it hung down inside the City The Blue soldiers promptly mounted this ladder and so gained the wall heading off the fugitive When Cap n Bill came up panting and all out of breath the Blueskins seized him and held him fast Cap n Bill was terribly disappointed at being recaptured and so was Trot who had eagerly followed his every movement from her window in the palace The little girl could have cried with vexation and I think she did weep a few tears before she recovered her courage but Cap n Bill was a philosopher in his way and had learned to accept ill fortune cheerfully Knowing he was helpless he made no protest when they again bound him and carried him down the ladder like a bale of goods Others were also disappointed by his capture Button Bright had heard the parrot squawking Oh there s Cap n Bill There s Cap n Bill I see him still up on that hill It s Cap n Bill So the boy ran out of his tent to find the sailor hurrying along the top of the wall as fast as he could go At once Button Bright aroused Coralie who got her Pinkies together and quickly marched them toward the wall to assist in the escape of her Commander in Chief But they were too late Before they could reach the wall the Blueskins had captured Trot s old friend and lugged him down into the City so Coralie and Button Bright were forced to return to their camp discomfited There Ghip Ghisizzle and Rosalie were awaiting them and they all went into the Witch s tent and held a council of war Tell me said Ghip Ghisizzle to Button Bright did you not take the Royal Record Book from the Treasure Chamber of the Boolooroo I did replied the boy I remember that you wanted it and so I have kept it with me ever since that night Here it is and he presented the little blue book to the Majordomo the only friend the adventurers had found among all the Blueskins Ghip Ghisizzle took the book eagerly and at once began turning over its leaves Ah he exclaimed presently it is just as I suspected The wicked Boolooroo had already reigned over the Blue Country three hundred years last Thursday so that now he has no right to rule at all I myself have been the rightful Ruler of the Blues since Thursday and yet this cruel and deceitful man has not only deprived me of my right to succeed him but he has tried to have me patched so that I could never become the Boolooroo Does the book tell how old he is asked Button Bright Yes he is now five hundred years old and has yet another hundred years to live He planned to rule the Blue Country until the last but I now know the deception he has practiced and have the Royal Record Book to prove it With this I shall be able to force him to resign that I may take his place for all the people will support me and abide by the Law The tyrant will perhaps fight me and my cause desperately but I am sure to win in the end If we can help you said Button Bright the whole Pink Army will fight for you Only if you win you must promise to give me back my Magic Umbrella and let us fly away to our own homes again I will do that most willingly agreed Ghip Ghisizzle And now let us consult together how best to take the Blue City and capture the Boolooroo As I know my own country much better than you or the Pinkies do I think I can find a way to accomplish our purpose Illustration Illustration THE AMAZING CONQUEST OF THE BLUES CHAPTER twenty four The shouting and excitement in the City following upon the recapture of Cap n Bill aroused the sleeping Boolooroo He found the cord still tied to his big toe and at first imagined his prisoner was safe in the dressing room While he put on his clothes the king occasionally gave the cord a sudden pull hoping to hurt Cap n Bill s big toe and make him yell but as no response came to this mean action the Boolooroo finally looked into the room only to find he had been pulling on a leg of the couch and that his prisoner had escaped Then he flew into a mighty rage and running out into the hall he aimed a blow at the unfaithful guard knocking the fellow off his feet Then he rushed down stairs into the courtyard shouting loudly for his soldiers and threatening to patch everybody in his dominions if the sailorman was not recaptured While the Boolooroo stormed and raged a band of soldiers and citizens came marching in surrounding Cap n Bill who was again firmly bound So ho roared the monarch you thought you could defy me Earth Clod did you But you were mistaken No one can resist the Mighty Boolooroo of the Blues so it is folly for you to rebel against my commands Hold him fast my men and as soon as I ve had my coffee and oatmeal I ll take him to the Room of the Great Knife and patch him I wouldn t mind a cup o coffee myself said Cap n Bill I ve had consid ble exercise this mornin and I m all ready for breakfas Very well replied the Boolooroo you shall eat with me for then I can keep an eye on you My guards are not to be trusted and I don t mean to let you out of my sight again until you are patched So Cap n Bill and the Boolooroo had breakfast together six Blueskins standing in a row back of the sailorman to grab him if he attempted to escape But Cap n Bill made no such attempt knowing it would be useless Trot was in the room too standing in a corner and listening to all that was said while she racked her little brain for an idea that would enable her to save Cap n Bill from being patched No one could see her so no one not even Cap n Bill knew she was there After breakfast was over a procession was formed headed by the Boolooroo and they marched the prisoner through the palace until they came to the Room of the Great Knife Invisible Trot followed soberly after them still wondering what she could do to save her friend As soon as they entered the Room of the Great Knife the Boolooroo gave a yell of disappointment What s become of Tiggle he shouted Where s Tiggle Who has released Tiggle Go at once you dummies and find him or it will go hard with you The frightened soldiers hurried away to find Tiggle and Trot was well pleased because she knew Tiggle was by this time safely hidden The Boolooroo stamped up and down the room muttering threats and declaring Cap n Bill should be patched whether Tiggle was found or not and while they waited Trot took time to make an inspection of the place which she now saw for the first time in broad daylight The Room of the Great Knife was high and big and around it ran rows of benches for the spectators to sit upon In one place at the head of the room was a raised platform for the royal family with elegant throne chairs for the King and Queen and six smaller but richly upholstered chairs for the Snubnosed Princesses The poor Queen by the way was seldom seen as she passed all her time playing solitaire with a deck that was one card short hoping that before she had lived her entire six hundred years she would win the game Therefore her Majesty paid no attention to anyone and no one paid any attention to her In the center of the room stood the terrible knife that gave the place its name a name dreaded by every inhabitant of the Blue City The knife was built into a huge framework like a derrick that reached to the ceiling and it was so arranged that when the Boolooroo pulled a cord the great blade would drop down in its frame and neatly cut in two the person who stood under it And in order that the slicing would be accurate there was another frame to which the prisoner was tied so that he couldn t wiggle either way This frame was on rollers so that it could be placed directly underneath the knife While Trot was observing this dreadful machine the door opened and in walked the Six Snubnosed Princesses all in a row and with their chins up as if they disdained everyone but themselves They were magnificently dressed and their blue hair was carefully arranged in huge towers upon their heads with blue plumes stuck into the tops These plumes waved gracefully in the air with every mincing step the Princesses took Rich jewels of blue stones glittered upon their persons and the royal ladies were fully as gorgeous as they were haughty and overbearing They marched to their chairs and seated themselves to enjoy the cruel scene their father was about to enact and Cap n Bill bowed to them politely and said Mornin girls hope ye feel as well as ye look Papa exclaimed Turquoise angrily can you not prevent this vile Earth Being from addressing us It is an insult to be spoken to by one about to be patched Control yourselves my dears replied the Boolooroo the worst punishment I know how to inflict on anyone this prisoner is about to suffer You ll see a very pretty patching my royal daughters When inquired Cobalt When As soon as the soldiers return with Tiggle said he But just then in came the soldiers to say that Tiggle could not be found anywhere in the City he had disappeared as mysteriously as had Ghip Ghisizzle Immediately the Boolooroo flew into another towering rage Villains he shouted go out and arrest the first living thing you meet and whoever it proves to be will be instantly patched to Cap n Bill The Captain of the Guards hesitated to obey this order Suppose it s a friend he suggested Friend roared the Boolooroo I haven t a friend in the country Tell me sir do you know of anyone who is my friend The Captain shook his head I can t think of anyone just now your Spry and Flighty High and Mighty Majesty he answered Of course not said the Boolooroo Everyone hates me and I don t object to that because I hate everybody But I m the Ruler here and I ll do as I please Go and capture the first living creature you see and bring him here to be patched to Cap n Bill So the Captain took a file of soldiers and went away very sorrowful for he did not know who would be the victim and if the Boolooroo had no friends the Captain had plenty and did not wish to see them patched Meantime Trot being invisible to all was roaming around the room and behind a bench she found a small coil of rope which she picked up Then she seated herself in an out of the way place and quietly waited Suddenly there was a noise in the corridor and evidence of scuffling and struggling Then the door flew open and in came the soldiers dragging a great blue billygoat which was desperately striving to get free Villains howled the Boolooroo what does this mean Why you said to fetch the first living creature we met and that was this billygoat replied the Captain panting hard as he held fast to one of the goat s horns The Boolooroo stared a moment and then he fell back in his throne laughing boisterously The idea of patching Cap n Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter Some of the soldiers laughed too being tickled with the absurd notion and the Six Snubnosed Princesses all sat up straight and permitted themselves to smile contemptuously This would indeed be a severe punishment therefore the Princesses were pleased at the thought of Cap n Bill s becoming half a billygoat and the billygoat s being half Cap n Bill They look something alike you know suggested the Captain of the Guards looking from one to the other doubtfully and they re nearly the same size if you stand the goat on his hind legs They ve both got the same style of whiskers and they re both of em obstinate and dangerous so they ought to make a good patch Splendid Fine Glorious cried the Boolooroo wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes We will proceed with the Ceremony of Patching at once Cap n Bill regarded the billygoat with distinct disfavor and the billygoat glared evilly upon Cap n Bill Trot was horrified and wrung her little hands in sore perplexity for this was a most horrible fate that awaited her dear old friend First bind the Earth Man in the frame commanded the Boolooroo We ll slice him in two before we do the same to the billygoat So they seized Cap n Bill and tied him into the frame so that he couldn t move a jot in any direction Then they rolled the frame underneath the Great Knife and handed the Boolooroo the cord that released the blade But while this was going on Trot had crept up and fastened one end of her rope to the frame in which Cap n Bill was confined Then she stood back and watched the Boolooroo and just as he pulled the cord she pulled on her rope and dragged the frame on its rollers away so that the Great Knife fell with a crash and sliced nothing but the air Huh exclaimed the Boolooroo that s queer Roll him up again soldiers The soldiers again rolled the frame in position having first pulled the Great Knife once more to the top of the derrick The immense blade was so heavy that it took the strength of seven Blueskins to raise it When all was in readiness the King pulled the cord a second time and Trot at the same instant pulled upon her rope The same thing happened as before Cap n Bill rolled away in his frame and the knife fell harmlessly Now indeed the Boolooroo was as angry as he was amazed He jumped down from the platform and commanded the soldiers to raise the Great Knife into position When this had been accomplished the Boolooroo leaned over to try to discover why the frame rolled away seemingly of its own accord and he was the more puzzled because it had never done such a thing before As he stood bent nearly double his back was toward the billygoat which in their interest and excitement the soldiers were holding in a careless manner At once the goat gave a leap escaped from the soldiers and with bowed head rushed upon the Boolooroo Before any could stop him he butted his Majesty so furiously that the King soared far into the air and tumbled in a heap among the benches where he lay moaning and groaning The goat s warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack Finding himself free he turned and assaulted the soldiers butting them so fiercely that they tumbled down in bunches and as soon as they could rise again ran frantically from the room and along the corridors as if a fiend was after them By this time the goat was so animated by the spirit of conquest that he rushed at the Six Snubnosed Princesses who had all climbed upon their chairs and were screaming in a panic of fear Six times the goat butted and each time he tipped over a chair and sent a haughty Princess groveling upon the floor where the ladies got mixed up in their long blue trains and flounces and laces and struggled wildly until they recovered their footing Then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices As the Room of the Great Knife was now cleared of all but Cap n Bill who was tied in his frame and of Trot and the moaning Boolooroo who lay hidden behind the benches the goat gave a victorious bleat and stood in the doorway to face any enemy that might appear Trot had been as surprised as anyone at this sudden change of conditions but she was quick to take advantage of the opportunities it afforded First she ran with her rope to the goat and as the animal could not see her she easily succeeded in tying the rope around its horns and fastening the loose end to a pillar of the doorway Next she hurried to Cap n Bill and began to unbind him and as she touched the sailor she became visible He nodded cheerfully then and said I had a notion it was you mate as saved me from the knife But it were a pretty close call an I hope it won t happen again I couldn t shiver much bein bound so tight but when I m loose I mean to have jus one good shiver to relieve my feelin s Shiver all you want to Cap n she said as she removed the last bonds but first you ve got to help me save us both As how he asked stepping from the frame Come and get the Boolooroo she said going toward the benches The sailor followed and pulled out the Boolooroo who when he saw the terrible goat was captured and tied fast quickly recovered his courage Hi there he cried where are my soldiers What do you mean prisoner by daring to lay hands upon me Let me go this minute or I ll I ll have you patched twice Don t mind him Cap n said Trot but fetch him along to the frame The Boolooroo looked around to see where the voice came from and Cap n Bill grinned joyfully and caught up the king in both his strong arms dragging the struggling Monarch of the Blues to the frame Illustration Stop it How dare you roared the frightened Boolooroo I ll have revenge I ll I ll You ll take it easy cause you can t help yourself said Cap n Bill What next Queen Trot Hold him steady in the frame and I ll tie him up she replied So Cap n Bill held the Boolooroo and the girl tied him fast in position as Cap n Bill had been tied so that his Majesty couldn t wiggle at all Then they rolled the frame in position underneath the Great Knife and Trot held in her hand the cord which would release it All right Cap n she said in a satisfied tone I guess we can run this Blue Country ourselves after this The Boolooroo was terrified to find himself in danger of being sliced by the same knife he had so often wickedly employed to slice others Like Cap n Bill he had no room to shiver but he groaned very dismally and was so full of fear that his blue hair nearly stood on end Illustration Illustration THE RULER OF SKY ISLAND CHAPTER twenty five The girl now took off Rosalie s ring and put it carefully away in her pocket It won t matter who sees me now she remarked an I want em to know that you an me Cap n are running this kingdom I m Queen o the Pinkies an Booloorooess o the Blues an What s that

8447-284448-0001	train-other-500	Just then they heard a sound of footsteps in the corridor The soldiers had partly recovered their courage and fearful of the anger of their dreaded Boolooroo
none	none	 whom the Princesses declared would punish them severely had ventured to return to the room They came rather haltingly though and the Captain of the Guards first put his head cautiously through the doorway to see if the coast was clear The goat discovered him and tried to make a rush but the rope held the animal back and when the Captain saw this he came forward more boldly Halt cried Trot The Captain halted his soldiers peering curiously over his shoulders and the Six Snubnosed Princesses looking on from behind where they considered themselves safe If anyone dares enter this room without my permission said Trot I ll pull this cord and slice your master that once was the Boolooroo Don t come in Don t come in yelled the Boolooroo in a terrified voice Then they saw that the sailor was free and the Boolooroo bound in his place The soldiers were secretly glad to observe this but the Princesses were highly indignant Release his Majesty at once cried Indigo from the corridor You shall be severely punished for this rebellion Don t worry replied Trot His Majesty isn t his Majesty any longer he s jus a common Blueskin Cap n Bill and I perpose runnin this Island ourselves after this You ve all got to obey me for I m the Booloorooess no I mean the Boss o the Blues and I ve a notion to run things my own way You can t said Turquoise scornfully the Law says Bother the Law exclaimed Trot I ll make the Laws myself from now on and I ll unmake every Law you ever had before I conquered you Oh Have you conquered us then asked the Captain of the Guards in a surprised tone Of course said Trot Can t you see It looks like it admitted the Captain Cap n Bill is goin to be my General o the Army an the Royal Manager o the Blue Country continued Trot so you ll mind what he says Nonsense shouted Indigo March in and capture them Captain Never mind if they do slice the Boolooroo I m his daughter and I ll rule the kingdom You won t screamed Cobalt I ll rule it I ll rule it myself cried Cerulia No no yelled Turquoise I ll be the Ruler That shall be my privilege shouted Sapphire Cobalt began to say I m the Be quiet said Trot sternly Would you have your own father sliced so that you could rule in his place Yes yes of course rejoined the six Princesses without a second s hesitation Well well What d ye think o that mister Boolooroo asked Cap n Bill They re undutiful daughters don t pay any attention to them

8447-284448-0005	train-other-500	At once the soldiers seized the Princesses and notwithstanding their snarls and struggles marched them to their rooms and locked them in While they were gone on this errand the Boolooroo begged to be released
none	none	 whining and wailing for fear the knife would fall upon him 
8447-284448-0006	train-other-500	But Trot did not think it safe to unbind him just then When the soldiers returned she told their leader to put a strong guard before the palace and to admit no one unless either she or Cap n Bill gave the order to do so
none	none	 The soldiers obeyed readily 
8447-284448-0007	train-other-500	and when Trot and Cap n Bill were left alone they turned the goat loose in the Room of the Great Knife and then locked the animal in

8447-284448-0011	train-other-500	and then the two began a careful search through the palace They went into every room and looked behind the furniture and underneath the beds and in every crack and corner
8447-284448-0012	train-other-500	but no place could they spy the Magic Umbrella Cap n Bill even ventured to enter the rooms of the Six Snubnosed Princesses who were by this time so thoroughly alarmed that they had become meek and mild as could be
none	none	 But the umbrella wasn t there either 
8447-284448-0013	train-other-500	Finally they returned to the great throne room of the palace
none	none	 where they seated themselves on the throne 
8447-284448-0014	train-other-500	and tried to think what could possibly have become of the precious umbrella While they were sitting and talking together the Captain of the Guards entered and bowed respectfully Beg pardon your Small Sized Majesty
8447-284448-0015	train-other-500	said he to Trot but it is my duty to report that the Pinkies are preparing to attack the City Oh I d forgotten the Pinkies exclaimed the girl
none	none	 Tell me Captain have you such a thing as a Brass Band in this City 
8447-284448-0016	train-other-500	We have two fine bands but they are not brass replied the Captain Their instruments are made of blue metal Well order em out commanded Trot And say

8447-284448-0017	train-other-500	We ll have all the fun there is going continued the girl for we are to entertain the Army of the Pinkies The Pinkies exclaimed the Captain of the Guards why they re our enemies your Short Highness
8447-284448-0018	train-other-500	Not any more replied Trot I m Queen of the Pinkies an I m also Queen of the Blues so I won t have my people quarreling
none	none	 Tell the Blue people we are to throw open the gates and welcome the Pinkies to the City where everybody will join in a grand celebration 
8447-284448-0019	train-other-500	And jus as soon as you ve spread the news an got the bands tuned up and the soldiers ready to march you let us know and we ll head the procession
none	none	 Your Microscopic Majesty shall be obeyed said the Captain and went away to carry out these commands Illustration Illustration TROT CELEBRATES HER VICTORY CHAPTER twenty six The Blue people were by this time dazed with wonder at all the events that had transpired that eventful day but they still had wit enough to be glad the war was over for in war some one is likely to get hurt and it is foolish to take such chances when one can remain quietly at home The Blues did not especially admire the Pinkies but it was easier to entertain them than to fight them and above all the Blueskins were greatly rejoiced that their wicked Boolooroo had been conquered and could no longer abuse them So they were quite willing to obey the orders of their girl Queen and in a short time the blasts of trumpets and roll of drums and clashing of cymbals told Trot and Cap n Bill that the Blue Bands had assembled before the palace So they went down and found that a great crowd of people had gathered and these cheered Trot with much enthusiasm which was very different from the scowls and surly looks with which they had formerly greeted their strange visitors from the Earth The soldiers wore their best blue uniforms and were formed before the palace in marching order so Trot and Cap n Bill headed the procession and then came the soldiers all keeping step and then the bands playing very loud noises on their instruments and finally the crowd of Blue citizens waving flags and banners and shouting joyfully In this order they proceeded to the main gate which Trot ordered the guards to throw wide open Then they all marched out a little way into the fields and found that the Army of Pinkies had already formed and was advancing steadily toward them At the head of the Pinkies were Ghip Ghisizzle and Button Bright who had the parrot on his shoulder and they were supported by Captain Coralie and Captain Tintint and Rosalie the Witch They had decided to capture the Blue City at all hazards that they might rescue Trot and Cap n Bill and conquer the Boolooroo so when from a distance they saw the Blueskins march from the gate with banners flying and bands playing they supposed a most terrible fight was about to take place However as the two forces came nearer together Button Bright spied Trot and Cap n Bill standing before the enemy and the sight astonished him considerably Welcome friends shouted Cap n Bill in a loud voice and Welcome cried Trot and Welcome roared the Blue soldiers and the people of the Blue City Hooray yelled the parrot Welcome to our happy home From which no longer will we roam and then he flapped his wings and barked like a dog with pure delight and added as fast as his bird s tongue could speak One army s pink and one is blue But neither one is in a stew Because the naughty Boolooroo Is out of sight so what we ll do Is try to be a jolly crew And dance and sing our too ral loo And to our friends be ever true And to our foes Stop it said Button Bright I can t hear myself think The Pinkies were amazed at the strange reception of the Blues and hesitated to advance but Trot now ran up in front of them and made a little speech Pinkies said she your Queen has conquered the Boolooroo and is now the Queen of the Blues All of Sky Island except the Fog Bank is now my kingdom so I welcome my faithful Pinkies to my Blue City where you are to be royally entertained and have a good time The war is over an ever body must be sociable an happy or I ll know the reason why Now indeed the Pinkies raised a great shout of joy and the Blues responded with another joyful shout and Rosalie kissed the little girl and said she had performed wonders and everybody shook hands with Cap n Bill and congratulated him upon his escape and the parrot flew to Trot s shoulder and screeched The Pinkies are pink the Blues are blue But Trot s the Queen so too ral loo When the Blueskins saw Ghip Ghisizzle they raised another great shout for he was the favorite of the soldiers and very popular with all the people But Ghip Ghisizzle did not heed the shouting He was looking downcast and sad and it was easy to see he was disappointed because he had not conquered the Boolooroo himself But the people called upon him for a speech so he faced the Blueskins and said I escaped from the City because the Boolooroo tried to patch me as you all know and the Six Snubnosed Princesses tried to marry me which would have been a far greater misfortune But I have recovered the Book of Royal Records which has long been hidden in the Treasure Chamber and by reading it I find that the Boolooroo is not your lawful Boolooroo at all having reigned more than his three hundred years Since last Thursday I Ghip Ghisizzle have been the lawful Boolooroo of the Blue Country but now that you are conquered by Queen Trot I suppose I am conquered too and you have no Boolooroo at all Hooray cried the parrot Here s a pretty howdy do You haven t any Boolooroo Trot had listened carefully to the Majordomo s speech When he finished she said cheerfully Don t worry Sizzle dear it ll all come right pretty soon Now then let s enter the City an enjoy the grand feast that s being cooked I m nearly starved myself for this conquerin kingdoms is hard work So the Pinkies and the Blues marched side by side into the City and there was great rejoicing and music and dancing and feasting and games and merrymaking that lasted for three full days Trot carried Rosalie and Captain Coralie and Ghip Ghisizzle to the palace and of course Button Bright and Cap n Bill were with her They had the Royal Chef serve dinner at once and they ate it in great state seated in the Royal Banquet Hall where they were waited on by a hundred servants The parrot perched upon the back of Queen Trot s chair and the girl fed it herself being glad to have the jolly bird with her again After they had eaten all they could and the servants had been sent away Trot related her adventures telling how with the assistance of the billygoat she had turned the tables on the wicked Boolooroo Then she gave Rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind Witch for all she had done for them And now said she I want to say to Ghip Sizzle that jus as soon as we can find Button Bright s umbrel we re going to fly home again I ll always be Queen of Sky Island but the Pink and Blue Countries must each have a Ruler I think I ll make Sizzle the Boolooroo of the Blues but I want you to promise me Ghip that you ll destroy the Great Knife and its frame and clean up the room and turn it into a skating rink an never patch anyone as long as you rule the Blueskins Ghip Ghisizzle was overjoyed at the prospect of being Boolooroo of the Blues but he looked solemn at the promise Trot exacted I m not cruel he said and I don t approve of patching in general so I ll willingly destroy the Great Knife But before I do that I want the privilege of patching the Snubnosed Princesses to each other mixing the six as much as possible and then I want to patch the former Boolooroo to the billygoat which is the same punishment he was going to inflict upon Cap n Bill No said Trot positively there s been enough patching in this country and I won t have any more of it The old Boolooroo and the six stuck up Princesses will be punished enough by being put out of the palace The people don t like em a bit so they ll be outcasts and wanderers and that will make em sorry they were so wicked an cruel when they were powerful Am I right Cap n Bill You are mate replied the sailor Please Queen Trot begged Ghip Ghisizzle let me patch just the Boolooroo It will be such a satisfaction I have said no an I mean it answered the girl You let the poor old Boolooroo alone There s nothing that hurts so much as a come down in life an I spect the old rascal s goin to be pretty miser ble by m by What does he say to his reverse of fortune asked Rosalie Why I don t b lieve he knows about it said Trot Guess I d better send for him an tell him what s happened So the Captain of the Guards was given the key and told to fetch the Boolooroo from the Room of the Great Knife The guards had a terrible struggle with the goat which was loose in the room and still wanted to fight but finally they subdued the animal and then they took the Boolooroo out of the frame he was tied in and brought both him and the goat before Queen Trot who awaited them in the throne room of the palace When the courtiers and the people assembled saw the goat they gave a great cheer for the beast had helped to dethrone their wicked Ruler What s goin to happen to this tough ol warrior Trot asked Cap n Bill It s my idee as he s braver than the whole Blue Army put together You re right Cap n she returned I ll have Sizzle make a fine yard for the goat where he ll have plenty of blue grass to eat An I ll have a pretty fence put around it an make all the people honor an respec him jus as long as he lives I ll gladly do that promised the new Boolooroo and I ll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat besides the grass He ll be the happiest goat in Sky Island I assure you As they led the now famous animal from the room the Boolooroo shuddered and said How dare you people give orders in my palace I m the Boolooroo Scuse me said Trot I neglected to tell you that you re not the Boolooroo any more We ve got the Royal Record Book an it proves you ve already ruled this country longer than you had any right to Sides all that I m the Queen o Sky Island which means Queen o the Pinkies an Queen o the Blues both of em So things are run as I say an I ve made Ghip Ghisizzle Boolooroo in your place He ll look after this end of the Island hereafter an unless I m much mistaken he ll do it a heap better than you did The former Boolooroo groaned What s going to become of me then he asked Am I to be patched or what You won t be hurt answered the girl but you ll have to find some other place to stay besides this palace an perhaps you ll enjoy workin for a livin by way of variety Can t I take any of the treasure with me he pleaded Not even a bird cage said she Ever thing in the palace now belongs to Ghip Ghisizzle Except the Six Snubnosed Princesses exclaimed the new Boolooroo earnestly Won t you please get rid of them too your Majesty Can t they be discharged Of course said Trot they must go with their dear father an mother Isn t there some house in the City they can all live in Ghip Why I own a little cabin at the end of the town said Ghip Ghisizzle and I ll let them use that as I won t need it any longer It isn t a very pretty cabin and the furniture is cheap and common but I m sure it is good enough for this wicked man and his family I ll not be wicked any more sighed the old Boolooroo I ll reform It s always best to reform when it is no longer safe to remain wicked As a private citizen I shall be a model of deportment because it would be dangerous to be otherwise Trot now sent for the Princesses who had been weeping and wailing and fighting among themselves ever since they learned that their father had been conquered When first they entered the throne room they tried to be as haughty and scornful as ever but the Blues who were assembled there all laughed at them and jeered them for there was not a single person in all the Blue Country who loved the Princesses the least little bit Trot told the girls that they must go with their father to live in Ghip Ghisizzle s little old cabin and when they heard this dreadful decree the six snubnosed ones began to scream and have hysterics and between them they managed to make so much noise that no one could hear anything else So Ghip Ghisizzle ordered the Captain to take a file of soldiers and escort the raving beauties to their new home This was done the once royal family departing from the palace with shamed and downcast looks Then the Room of the Great Knife was cleared of its awful furniture The frames were split into small pieces of bluewood and the benches chopped into kindling and the immense sharp knife broken into bits All the rubbish was piled in the square before the palace and a bonfire made of it while the Blue people clustered around and danced and sang with joy as the blue flames devoured the dreadful instrument that had once caused them so much unhappiness That evening Trot gave a grand ball in the palace to which the most important of the Pinkies and the Blueskins were invited The combined bands of both the countries played the music and a fine supper was served The Pinkies would not dance with the Blues however nor would the Blues dance with the Pinkies The two nations were so different in all ways that they were unable to agree at all and several times during the evening quarrels arose and there was fighting between them which Trot promptly checked I think it will be best for us to go back to our own country as soon as possible suggested Rosalie the Witch for if we stay here very long the Blueskins may rise against us and cause the Pinkies much trouble Jus as soon as we find that umbrel promised Trot we ll dive into the Fog Bank an make tracks for the Land of Sunrise an Sunset Illustration THE FATE OF THE MAGIC UMBRELLA CHAPTER twenty seven Next morning the search for the Magic Umbrella began in earnest With many to hunt for it and the liberty of the whole palace to aid them every inch of the great building was carefully examined But no trace of the umbrella could be found Cap n Bill and Button Bright went down to the cabin of the former Boolooroo and tried to find out what he had done with the umbrella but the old Boolooroo said I had it brought from the Treasure Chamber and tried to make it work but there was no magic about the thing So I threw it away I haven t any idea what became of it The six former Princesses were sitting upon a rude bench looking quite bedraggled and untidy Said Indigo If you will make Ghip Ghisizzle marry me I ll find your old umbrella Where is it asked Button Bright eagerly Make Ghip Ghisizzle marry me and I ll tell you repeated Indigo But I won t say another word about it until after I am married So they went back to the palace and proposed to the new Boolooroo to marry Indigo so they could get their Magic Umbrella But Ghip Ghisizzle positively refused I d like to help you said he but nothing will ever induce me to marry one of those snubnoses They re very pretty for Blueskins said Trot But when you marry a girl you marry the inside as well as the outside declared Ghip Ghisizzle and inside these Princesses there are wicked hearts and evil thoughts I d rather be patched than marry the best of them Which is the best asked Button Bright I don t know I m sure was the reply Judging from their actions in the past there is no best Rosalie the Witch now went to the cabin and put Indigo into a deep sleep by means of a powerful charm Then while the Princess slept the Witch made her tell all she knew which wasn t a great deal to be sure but it was soon discovered that Indigo had been deceiving them and knew nothing at all about the umbrella She had hoped to marry Ghip Ghisizzle and become Queen after which she could afford to laugh at their reproaches So the Witch woke her up and went back to the palace to tell Trot of her failure The girl and Button Bright and Cap n Bill were all rather discouraged by this time for they had searched high and low and had not found a trace of the all important umbrella That night none of them slept much for they all lay awake wondering how they could ever return to the Earth and to their homes In the morning of the third day after Trot s conquest of the Blues the little girl conceived another idea She called all the servants of the palace to her and questioned them closely But not one could remember having seen anything that looked like an umbrella Are all the servants of the old Boolooroo here inquired Cap n Bill who was sorry to see Trot looking so sad and downcast All but one was the reply Tiggle used to be a servant but he escaped and ran away Oh yes exclaimed Trot Tiggle is in hiding somewhere Perhaps he don t know there s been a revolution and a new Boolooroo rules the country If he did there s no need for him to hide any longer for he is now in no danger She now dispatched messengers all through the City and the surrounding country who cried aloud for Tiggle saying that the new Boolooroo wanted him Tiggle hiding in the cellar of a deserted house in a back street at last heard these cries and joyfully came forth to confront the messenger Having heard of the old Boolooroo s downfall and disgrace the man consented to go to the palace again and as soon as Trot saw him she asked about the umbrella Tiggle thought hard for a minute and then said he remembered sweeping the King s rooms and finding a queer thing that might have been an umbrella lying beneath a cabinet It had ropes and two wooden seats and a wicker basket all attached to the handle Illustration That s it cried Button Bright excitedly and That s it That s it cried both Trot and Cap n Bill But what did you do with it asked Ghip Ghisizzle I dragged it out and threw it on the rubbish heap in an alley back of the palace said Tiggle At once they all rushed out to the alley and began digging in the rubbish heap By and by Cap n Bill uncovered the lunch basket and pulling on this he soon drew up the two seats and finally the Magic Umbrella Hurrah shouted Button Bright grabbing the umbrella and hugging it tight in his arms Hooray shrieked the parrot Cap n Bill s a lucky fellah Cause he found the old umbrella Trot s face was wreathed in smiles This is jus the best luck that could have happened to us she exclaimed cause now we can go home whenever we please Let s go now this minute before we lose the umbrella again said Button Bright But Trot shook her head Not yet she replied We ve got to straighten out things in Sky Island first of all A Queen has some duties you know and as long as I m Queen here I ve got to live up to the part What has to be did mate inquired Cap n Bill Well we ve fixed the Blue Country pretty well by makin Sizzle the Boolooroo of it but the Pinkies mus be looked after too cause they ve stood by us an helped us to win We must take em home again safe an sound and get a new Queen to rule over em When that s done we can go home any time we want to Quite right Trot said the sailor approvingly When do we march Right away she replied I ve had enough of the Blue Country Haven t you We have mate We ve had plenty of it observed Button Bright And the Pinkies are anxious to get home added Rosalie who was present So Cap n Bill unhooked the seats from the handle of the umbrella and wound the ropes around the two boards and made a package of them which he carried under his arm Trot took the empty lunch basket and Button Bright held fast to the precious umbrella Then they returned to the palace to bid good bye to Ghip Ghisizzle and the Blues The new Boolooroo seemed rather sorry to lose his friends but the people were secretly glad to get rid of the strangers especially of the Pinkies They maintained a sullen silence while Coralie and Captain Tintint formed their ranks in marching order and they did not even cheer when Trot said to them in a final speech I m the Queen of Sky Island you know and the new Boolooroo has got to carry out my orders and treat you all nicely while I m away I don t know when I ll come back but you d better watch out an not make any trouble or I ll find a way to make you sorry for it So now good bye And good riddance screamed the Six Snubnosed Girls who had once been Princesses and who were now in the crowd that watched the departure But Trot paid no attention to them She made a signal to the Pinkie Band which struck up a fine Pink March and then the Army stepped out with the left foot first and away went the conquerors down the streets of the Blue City out of the blue barred gateway and across the country toward the Fog Bank Illustration Illustration THE ELEPHANT S HEAD COMES TO LIFE CHAPTER twenty eight When they reached the edge of the Fog Bank the Pinkies all halted to put on their raincoats and Button Bright put up his umbrella and held it over himself and Trot Then when everybody was ready they entered the Fog and Rosalie the Witch made a signal to call the Frog King and his subjects to aid them as they had done before Pretty soon the great frogs appeared a long line of them facing Trot and her Pink Army and sitting upon their haunches close together Turn around so we can get upon your backs said Rosalie Not yet answered the Frog King in a gruff deep voice You must first take that insulting umbrella out of my dominions Why what is there about my umbrella that seems insulting asked Button Bright in surprise It is an insinuation that you don t like our glorious climate and object to our delightful fog and are trying to ward off its soulful clinging kisses replied the Frog King in an agitated voice There has never been an umbrella in my kingdom before and I ll not allow one in it now Take it away at once But we can t explained Trot We ve got to take the umbrella with us to the Pink Country We ll put it down if you like an cross the bank in this drizzle which may be clingin an soulful but is too wet to be comfort ble But the umbrella s got to go with us It can t go another inch cried the obstinate frog with an angry croak nor shall any of your people advance another step while that insulting umbrella is with you Trot turned to Rosalie What shall we do she asked I really do not know replied the Witch greatly perplexed Can t you make the frogs let us through inquired the boy No I have no power over the frogs Rosalie answered They carried us before as a favor but if the king now insists that we cannot pass with the umbrella we must go back to the Blue Country or leave your umbrella behind us We won t do that said Button Bright indignantly Can t we fight the frogs Fight cried Trot why see how big they are They could eat up our whole army if they wanted to But just then while they stood dismayed at this unfortunate position a queer thing happened The umbrella in Button Bright s hand began to tremble and shake He looked down at the handle and saw that the red eyes of the carved elephant s head were rolling fiercely and sending out red sparks of anger in all directions The trunk swayed from side to side and the entire head began to swell and grow larger Illustration In his fright the boy sprang backward a step and dropped the umbrella to the ground and as he did so it took the form of a complete elephant growing rapidly to a monstrous size Then flapping its ears and wagging its tail which was merely the covered frame of the umbrella the huge elephant lifted its trunk and charged the line of astonished frogs In a twinkling the frogs all turned and made the longest leaps their powerful legs enabled them to The King jumped first of all and in a panic of fear the others followed his example They were out of sight in an instant and then the elephant turned its head and looked at Button Bright and at once trotted into the depths of the fog He wants us to follow said the boy gasping in amazement at this wonderful transformation So immediately they began marching through the fog behind the elephant and as the great beast advanced the frogs scrambled out of his way and hid themselves in the moist banks until he had passed them by Cap n Bill had to mind his wooden leg carefully and the old sailor was so excited that he mumbled queer sentences about Araby Ann Knights and ding donged magic and the fool foolishness of fussin with witches an sich until Trot wondered whether her old friend had gone crazy or was only badly scared It was a long journey and all the Pinkies were dripping water from their raincoats and their little fat legs were tired and aching when the pink glow showing through the fog at last announced the fact that they were nearing the Pink Country At the very edge of the Fog Bank the elephant halted winked at Button Bright lowered its head and began to shrink in size and dwindle away By the time the boy came up to it closely followed by Trot and Cap n Bill the thing was only the well known Magic Umbrella with the carved elephant s head for a handle and it lay motionless upon the ground Button Bright cautiously picked it up and as he examined it he thought the tiny red eyes still twinkled a little as if with triumph and pride Trot drew a long breath That was some magic I guess she exclaimed Don t you think so Rosalie It was the most wonderful thing I ever saw admitted the Witch The fairies who control Button Bright s umbrella must be very powerful indeed Illustration Illustration TROT REGULATES THE PINKIES CHAPTER twenty nine The Pinkies were rejoiced to find themselves again in their beloved land of sunrises and sunsets They sang and shouted with glee and the Band uncovered its pink instruments and played the National Pink Anthem while the parrot flew from Trot s shoulder to Cap n Bill s shoulder and back again screaming ecstatically Hooray we re through the wetful fogs Where the elephant scared the fretful frogs There was a magnificent sunset in the sky just then and it cheered the Pinkies and gave them renewed strength Away they hastened across the pink fields to the Pink City where all the Pink people who had been left behind ran out to welcome them home again Trot and Button Bright with Cap n Bill and Rosalie the Witch went to the humble palace where they had a simple supper of coarse food and slept upon hard beds In the houses of the City however there was much feasting and merrymaking and it seemed to Trot that the laws of the country which forbade the Queen from enjoying all the good things the people did were decidedly wrong and needed changing The next morning Rosalie said to the little girl Will you make Tourmaline the Queen again when you go away I ll send for her and see about it replied Trot But when Tourmaline arrived at the palace dressed all in lovely fluffy robes and with a dainty pink plume in her pink hair she begged most earnestly not to be made the Queen again I m having a good time just now after years of worry and uncomfortable living in this uncomfortable old hut of a palace said the poor girl so it would be cruel for you to make me the servant of the people again and condemn me to want and misery That seems reason ble replied Trot thoughtfully Rosalie s skin is just as light a pink as my own continued Tourmaline Why don t you make her the Queen I hadn t thought of that said Trot Then she turned to Rosalie and asked How would you like to rule the Pinkies I wouldn t like it replied the Witch with a smile The Queen is the poorest and most miserable creature in all the kingdom and I m sure I don t deserve such a fate I ve always tried to be a good witch and to do my duty Trot thought this over quite seriously for a time Then one of her quaint ideas came to her so quaint that it was entirely sensible I m the Queen of the Pinkies just now am I not she asked Of course answered Rosalie none can dispute that Then I ve the right to make new laws haven t I I believe so In that case said the girl I m goin to make a law that the Queen shall have the same food an the same dresses an the same good times that her people have and she shall live in a house jus as good as the houses of any of her people an have as much money to spend as anybody But no more The Queen can have her share of ever thing cordin to the new law but if she tries to get more than her share I ll have the law say she shall be taken to the edge an pushed off What do you think of that law Rosalie It s a good law and a just one replied the Witch approvingly So Trot sent for the Royal Scribbler who was a very fat Pinky with large pink eyes and curly pink hair and had him carefully write the new law in the Great Book of Laws The Royal Scribbler wrote it very nicely in pink ink with a big capital letter at the beginning and a fine flourish at the end After Trot had signed her name to it as Queen she called all of the important people of the land to assemble in the Court of the Statues and ordered the Royal Declaimer to read to them the new law The Pinkies seemed to think it was a just law and much better than the old one and Rosalie said Now no one can object to becoming the Queen since the Ruler of the Pinkies will no longer be obliged to endure suffering and hardships All right said Trot In that case I ll make you the Queen Rosalie for you ve got more sense than Tourmaline has and your powers as a witch will help you to protect the people At once she made the announcement telling the assembled Pinkies that by virtue of her high office as Queen of Sky Island she would leave Rosalie the Witch to rule over the Pink Country while she returned to the Earth with her friends As Rosalie was greatly loved and respected the people joyfully accepted her as their Queen and Trot ordered them to tear down the old hut and build a new palace for Rosalie one which would be just as good as any other house in the City but no better She further ordered a pink statue of Tourmaline to be set up in the Court and also a pink statue of herself so that the record of all the rulers of the Pinkies should be complete The people agreed to do all this as soon as possible and some of the leaders whispered together and then asked Coralie to be their spokesman in replying to Queen Trot s speech Coralie stood on a chair and made a bow after which she thanked Trot in the name of the Pinkies for leading them safely into the Blue Country and out again and for giving them so good a Queen as Rosalie The Pinkies would be sorry to have their new friends the Earth people leave them but asked the Queen of Sky Island to carry with her the royal band of pink gold which she now wore upon her brow together with the glistening pink jewel set in its center It would remind her Coralie declared of the Beautiful Land of Sunset and Sunrise and of the fact that the Pinkies would always be glad to welcome her back Trot knew she would never return to Sky Island but she did not tell them that She merely thanked Coralie and the Pinkies and said they might all come to the Court after dinner and see her and her comrades fly away through the sky Illustration THE JOURNEY HOME CHAPTER thirty After the Pinkies had been dismissed their new Queen Rosalie by means of a clever charm conjured up a dinner table set with very nice things to eat They all enjoyed a hearty meal and afterward sat and talked over their adventures Will you take the parrot home with you Trot asked Cap n Bill Guess not Cap n she answered Mother wouldn t like to have him hangin round an screechin bad po try ev ry minute I ll give him to Rosalie for I m sure she ll take good care of him Rosalie accepted the gift with pleasure but the parrot looked sober awhile and then said This looks to me like a give away But here I am and here I ll stay The country s pink but we ll all be blue When Trot goes home as she says she ll do They now packed the lunch basket with the remains of the feast for they knew a long journey was before them and feared they might be hungry before they landed again Cap n Bill straightened out the ropes and adjusted the seats while Button Bright examined the umbrella to see if it had been injured in any way when the elephant tramped through the Fog Bank The boy looked into the small red eyes of the carved elephant s head handle with some misgivings but as seen in the strong sunshine the eyes were merely red stones while the handle plainly showed the marks of the tool that had carved it When all was ready they went into the Court of the Statues where all the Pinkies were assembled together with their Pink Band and Cap n Bill hooked the swinging seats onto the handle of the Magic Umbrella Trot kissed Rosalie and Coralie and Tourmaline good bye and said to them If you ever happen to come to Earth you must be sure to visit me and I ll try to give you a good time But p raps you ll stay here all your lives I think we shall replied Rosalie laughing for in all Sky Island there will be no Magic Umbrella for us to fly with And when you see Polychrome added Trot jus give her my love Then she and Button Bright seated themselves in the double seat which was flat upon the pink ground and Cap n Bill sat before them on his own seat to which the lunch basket had been fastened by means of a stout cord Hold fast said the sailorman and they all held fast to the ropes while the boy glancing up toward the open umbrella he held said solemnly and distinctly Take us to Trot s house on the Earth The umbrella obeyed at once mounting into the air It moved slowly at first but gradually increased its speed First it lifted the seat of the boy and girl then Cap n Bill s seat and finally the lunch basket Fly high mind your eye Don t cry bye bye shouted the parrot from the Pink Witch s shoulder Trot leaned over and waved her hand The Pink Band played as loud as it could in order that the travelers might hear it as long as possible and Rosalie and Coralie and Tourmaline threw kisses to their vanishing friends as long as they remained in sight Seems good to be on the way home again remarked Trot as the umbrella bumped into a big black cloud It reely does mate answered the sailorman joyously Fast through the cloud the umbrella swept and then suddenly it sailed into a clear blue sky across which a great and gorgeous Rainbow spread its radiant arch Upon the bow danced the dainty Daughters of the Rainbow and the umbrella passed near enough to it for the passengers to observe Polychrome merrily leading her sisters her fleecy robes waving prettily in the gentle breeze Good bye Polly cried Button Bright and Trot and Cap n Bill both called out Good bye Polychrome heard and nodded to them smilingly never halting in her graceful dance Then the umbrella dropped far below the arch which presently faded from view It was an exciting ride Scenes presented themselves entirely different from those they had seen on their former voyage for the sky changes continually and the clouds of the moment are not the clouds of an hour ago Once they passed between two small stars as brilliant as diamonds and once an enormous bird whose wings spread so wide that they shadowed the sun soared directly over them and lost itself in the vague distance of the limitless sky Illustration They rode quite comfortably however and were full of eager interest in what they saw The rush of air past them made them hungry so Cap n Bill drew up the lunch basket and held it so that Button Bright and Trot could help themselves to the pink food which tasted very good And finally a dark rim appeared below them which the sailor declared must be the Earth He proved to be correct and when they came nearer they found themselves flying over the waves of the ocean Pretty soon a small island appeared and Trot exclaimed That s the Sky Island we thought we were goin to only we didn t Yes an there s the mainland mate cried Cap n Bill excitedly pointing toward a distant coast On swept the Magic Umbrella Then its speed gradually slackened the houses and trees on the coast could be seen and presently almost before they realized it they were set down gently upon the high bluff near the giant acacia A little way off stood the white cottage where Trot lived It was growing dusk as Cap n Bill unhooked the seats and Button Bright folded up the umbrella and tucked it under his arm Trot seized the lunch basket and ran to the house where she found her mother busy in the kitchen Well I m back again said the little girl Is supper ready mama Button Bright stayed all night with them but next morning bright and early he hooked one of the seats to his Magic Umbrella said good bye to Trot and Cap n Bill and flew into the air to begin his journey to Philadelphia Just before he started Trot said Let me know if you get home safe Button Bright an come an see me again as quick as you can Illustration I ll try to come again said the boy We ve had a good time haven t we Trot The bes time I ever had she replied enthusiastically Then she asked Didn t you like it too Cap n Bill Parts o it mate the sailor answered as he thoughtfully made marks in the sand with the end of his wooden leg but seems to me the bes part of all was gett n home again After several days Trot received a postal card from Button Bright It was awkwardly scrawled for the boy was not much of a writer but Trot managed to make out the words It read as follows Got home safe Trot and the folks were so worried they forgot to scold me Father has taken the Magic Umbrella and locked it up in a big strong chest in the attic He put the key in his own pocket so I don t know as I ll ever be able to see you again But I ll never forget the Queen of Sky Island and I send my love to you and Cap n Bill Your friend BUTTON BRIGHT THE END These
