none	none	an enviable reputation To venture there at night was considered so dangerous that the soldiers from the outlying forts who came in to Paris with permission to go to the theatre were ordered to halt at the barriere and not to pass through the perilous district excepting in parties of three or four After midnight these gloomy narrow streets became the haunt of numerous homeless vagabonds and escaped criminals and malefactors moreover made the quarter their rendezvous If the day had been a lucky one they made merry over their spoils and when sleep overtook them hid in doorways or among the rubbish in deserted houses Every effort had been made to dislodge these dangerous guests but the most energetic measures had failed to prove successful Watched hunted and in imminent danger of arrest though they were they always returned with idiotic obstinacy obeying as one might suppose some mysterious law of attraction Hence the district was for the police an immense trap constantly baited and to which the game came of their own accord to be caught The result of a tour of inspection of this locality was so certain that the officer in charge of the police post called to the squad as they departed I will prepare lodgings for our guests Good luck to you and much pleasure This last wish was pure irony for the weather was the most disagreeable that could be imagined A very heavy snow storm had prevailed for several days It was now beginning to thaw and on all the frequented thoroughfares the slush was ankle deep It was still cold however a damp chill filled the air and penetrated to the very marrow of one s bones Besides there was a dense fog so dense that one could not see one s hands before one s face What a beastly job growled one of the agents

none	none	replied the inspector who commanded the squad if you had an income of thirty thousand francs I don t suppose you d be here The laugh that greeted this common place joke was not so much flattery as homage to a recognized and established superiority The inspector was in fact one of the most esteemed members of the force a man who had proved his worth His powers of penetration were not perhaps very great but he thoroughly understood his profession its resources its labyrinths and its artifices Long practise had given him imperturbable coolness a great confidence in himself and a sort of coarse diplomacy that supplied the place of shrewdness To his failings and his virtues he added incontestable courage and he would lay his hand upon the collar of the most dangerous criminal as tranquilly as a devotee dips his fingers in a basin of holy water He was a man about forty six years of age strongly built with rugged features a heavy mustache and rather small gray eyes hidden by bushy eyebrows His name was Gevrol but he was universally known as the General This sobriquet was pleasing to his vanity which was not slight as his subordinates well knew and doubtless he felt that he ought to receive from them the same consideration as was due to a person of that exalted rank If you begin to complain already he added gruffly what will you do by and by In fact it was too soon to complain The little party were then passing along the Rue de Choisy The people on the footways were orderly and the lights of the wine shops illuminated the street All these places were open There is no fog or thaw that is potent enough to dismay lovers of pleasure And a boisterous crowd of maskers filled each tavern and public ballroom Through the open windows came alternately the sounds of loud voices and bursts of noisy music Occasionally a drunken man staggered along the pavement or a masked figure crept by in the shadow cast by the houses Before certain establishments Gevrol commanded a halt He gave a peculiar whistle and almost immediately a man came out This was another member of the force His report was listened to and then the squad passed on To the left boys ordered Gevrol we will take the Rue d Ivry and then cut through the shortest way to the Rue de Chevaleret From this point the expedition became really disagreeable The way led through an unfinished unnamed street full of puddles and deep holes and obstructed with all sorts of rubbish There were no longer any lights or crowded wine shops No footsteps no voices were heard solitude gloom and an almost perfect silence prevailed and one might have supposed oneself a hundred leagues from Paris had it not been for the deep and continuous murmur that always arises from a large city resembling the hollow roar of a torrent in some cavern depth All the men had turned up their trousers and were advancing slowly picking their way as carefully as an Indian when he is stealing upon his prey They had just passed the Rue du Chateau des Rentiers when suddenly a wild shriek rent the air At this place and at this hour such a cry was so frightfully significant that all the men paused as if by common impulse Did you hear that General asked one of the detectives in a low voice Yes there is murder going on not far from here but where Silence let us listen They all stood motionless holding their breath and anxiously listening Soon a second cry or rather a wild howl resounded

none	none	exclaimed the inspector it is at the Poivriere This peculiar appellation Poivriere or pepper box was derived from the term peppered which in French slang is applied to a man who has left his good sense at the bottom of his glass Hence also the sobriquet of pepper thieves given to the rascals whose specialty it is to plunder helpless inoffensive drunkards What added Gevrol to his companions don t you know Mother Chupin s drinking shop there on the right Run And setting the example he dashed off in the direction indicated His men followed and in less than a minute they reached a hovel of sinister aspect standing alone in a tract of waste ground It was indeed from this den that the cries had proceeded They were now repeated and were immediately followed by two pistol shots The house was hermetically closed but through the cracks in the window shutters gleamed a reddish light like that of a fire One of the police agents darted to one of these windows and raising himself up by clinging to the shutters with his hands endeavored to peer through the cracks and to see what was passing within Gevrol himself ran to the door Open he commanded striking it heavily No response came But they could hear plainly enough the sound of a terrible struggle of fierce imprecations hollow groans and occasionally the sobs of a woman Horrible cried the police agent who was peering through the shutters it is horrible This exclamation decided Gevrol Open in the name of the law he cried a third time And

none	none	responding with a blow of the shoulder that was as violent as a blow from a battering ram he dashed open the door Then the horror stricken accent of the man who had been peering through the shutters was explained The room presented such a spectacle that all the agents and even Gevrol himself remained for a moment rooted to the threshold shuddering with unspeakable horror Everything denoted that the house had been the scene of a terrible struggle of one of those savage conflicts which only too often stain the barriere drinking dens with blood The lights had been extinguished at the beginning of the strife but a blazing fire of pine logs illuminated even the furthest corners of the room Tables glasses decanters household utensils and stools had been overturned thrown in every direction trodden upon shivered into fragments Near the fireplace two men lay stretched upon the floor They were lying motionless upon their backs with their arms crossed A third was extended in the middle of the room A woman crouched upon the lower steps of a staircase leading to the floor above She had thrown her apron over her head and was uttering inarticulate moans Finally facing the police and with his back turned to an open door leading into an adjoining room stood a young man in front of whom a heavy oaken table formed as it were a rampart He was of medium stature and wore a full beard His clothes not unlike those of a railway porter were torn to fragments and soiled with dust and wine and blood This

profusely In his right hand covered with a handkerchief he held a pistol which he aimed at the intruders Surrender cried Gevrol The man s lips moved but in spite of a visible effort he could not articulate a syllable Don t do any mischief continued the inspector we are in force you can not escape so lay down your arms I am innocent exclaimed the man in a hoarse strained voice Naturally but we do not see it I have been attacked ask that old woman I defended myself I have killed I had a right to do so it was in self defense The gesture with which he enforced these words was so menacing that one of the agents drew Gevrol violently aside saying as he did so Take care General take care The revolver has five barrels and we have heard but two shots But the inspector was inaccessible to fear he freed himself from the grasp of his subordinate and again stepped forward speaking in a still calmer tone No foolishness my lad if your case is a good one which is possible after all don t spoil it A frightful indecision betrayed itself on the young man s features He held Gevrol s life at the end of his finger was he about to press the trigger No he suddenly threw his weapon to the floor exclaiming Come and take me And turning as he spoke he darted into the adjoining room hoping doubtless to escape by some means of egress which he knew of Gevrol had expected this movement He sprang after him with outstretched arms but the table retarded his pursuit Ah he exclaimed the wretch escapes us But the fate of the fugitive was already decided While Gevrol parleyed one of the agents he who had peered through the shutters had gone to the rear of the house and effected an entrance through the back door As the murderer darted out this man sprang upon him seized him and with surprising strength and agility dragged him back The murderer tried to resist but in vain He had lost his strength he tottered and fell upon the table that had momentarily protected him murmuring loud enough for every one to hear Lost It is the Prussians who are coming This simple and decisive maneuvre on the part of the subordinate had won the victory and at first it greatly delighted the inspector Good my boy said he very good Ah you have a talent for your business and you will do well if ever an opportunity But he checked himself all his followers so evidently shared his enthusiasm that a feeling of jealousy overcame him He felt his prestige diminishing and hastened to add The idea had occurred to me but I could not give the order without warning the scoundrel himself This remark was superfluous All the police agents had now gathered around the murderer They began by binding his feet and hands and then fastened him securely to a chair He offered no resistance His wild excitement had given place to that gloomy prostration that follows all unnatural efforts either of mind or body Evidently he had abandoned himself to his fate When Gevrol saw that the men had finished their task he called on them to attend to the other inmates of the den and in addition ordered the lamps to be lit for the fire was going out The inspector began his examination with the two men lying near the fireplace He laid his hand on their hearts but no pulsations were to be detected He then held the face of his watch close to their lips but the glass remained quite clear Useless he murmured after several trials useless they are dead They will never see morning again Leave them in the same position until the arrival of the public prosecutor and let us look at the other one The third man still breathed He was a young fellow wearing the uniform of a common soldier of the line He was unarmed and his large bluish gray cloak was partly open revealing his bare chest The agents lifted him very carefully for he groaned piteously at the slightest movement and placed him in an upright position with his back leaning against the wall He soon opened his eyes and in a faint voice asked for something to drink They brought him a glass of water which he drank with evident satisfaction He then drew a long breath and seemed to regain some little strength Where are you wounded asked Gevrol In the head there he responded trying to raise one of his arms Oh how I suffer The police agent who had cut off the murderer s retreat now approached and with a dexterity that an old surgeon might have envied made an examination of the gaping wound which the young man had received in the back of the neck It is nothing declared the police agent but as he spoke there was no mistaking the movement of his lower lip It was evident that he considered the wound very dangerous probably mortal It will be nothing affirmed Gevrol in his turn wounds in the head when they do not kill at once are cured in a month The wounded man smiled sadly I have received my death blow he murmured Nonsense Oh it is useless to say anything I feel it but I do not complain I have only received my just deserts All the police agents turned toward the murderer on hearing these words presuming that he would take advantage of this opportunity to repeat his protestations of innocence But their expectations were disappointed he did not speak although he must certainly have heard the words It was that brigand Lacheneur who enticed me here continued the wounded man in a voice that was growing fainter Lacheneur Yes Jean Lacheneur a former actor who knew me when I was rich for I had a fortune but I spent it all I wished to amuse myself He knowing I was without a single sou in the world came and promised me money enough to begin life over again Fool that I was to believe him for he brought me to die here like a dog Oh I will have my revenge on him At this thought the wounded man clenched his hands threateningly I will have my revenge he resumed I know much more than he believes I will reveal everything But he had presumed too much upon his strength Anger had given him a moment s energy but at the cost of his life which was ebbing away When he again tried to speak he could not Twice did he open his lips but only a choking cry of impotent rage escaped them This was his last manifestation of intelligence A bloody foam gathered upon his lips his eyes rolled back in their sockets his body stiffened and he fell face downward in a terrible convulsion It is over murmured Gevrol Not yet replied the young police agent who had shown himself so proficient but he can not live more than two minutes Poor devil he will say nothing The inspector of police had risen from the floor as if he had just witnessed the commonest incident in the world and was carefully dusting the knees of his trousers Oh well he responded we shall know all we need to know This fellow is a soldier and the number of his regiment will be given on the buttons of his cloak A slight smile curved the lips of the subordinate I think you are mistaken General said he How Yes I understand Seeing him attired in a military coat you supposed But no this poor wretch was no soldier Do you wish for an immediate proof Is his hair the regulation cut Where did you ever see soldiers with their hair falling over their shoulders This objection silenced the General for a moment but he replied bruskly Do you think that I keep my eyes in my pocket What you have remarked did not escape my notice only I said to myself here is a young man who has profited by leave of absence to visit the wig maker At least But Gevrol would permit no more interruptions Enough talk he declared We will now hear what has happened Mother Chupin the old hussy is not dead As he spoke he advanced toward the old woman who was still crouching upon the stairs She had not moved nor ventured so much as a look since the entrance of the police but her moans had not been discontinued With a sudden movement Gevrol tore off the apron which she had thrown over her head and there she stood such as years vice poverty and drink had made her wrinkled shriveled toothless and haggard her skin as yellow and as dry as parchment and drawn tightly over her bones Come stand up ordered the inspector Your lamentations don t affect me You ought to be sent to prison for putting such vile drugs into your liquors thus breeding madness in the brains of your customers The old woman s little red eyes traveled slowly round the room and then in tearful tones she exclaimed What a misfortune what will become of me Everything is broken I am ruined She only seemed impressed by the loss of her table utensils Now tell us how this trouble began said Gevrol Alas I know nothing about it I was upstairs mending my son s clothes when I heard a dispute And after that Of course I came down and I saw those three men that are lying there picking a quarrel with the young man you have arrested the poor innocent For he is innocent as truly as I am an honest woman If my son Polyte had been here he would have separated them but I a poor widow what could I do I cried Police with all my might After giving this testimony she resumed her seat thinking she had said enough But Gevrol rudely ordered her to stand up again Oh we have not done said he I wish for other particulars What particulars dear Monsieur Gevrol since I saw nothing Anger crimsoned the inspector s ears What would you say old woman if I arrested you It would be a great piece of injustice Nevertheless it is what will happen if you persist in remaining silent I have an idea that a fortnight in Saint Lazare would untie your tongue These words produced the effect of an electric shock on the Widow Chupin She suddenly ceased her hypocritical lamentations rose placed her hands defiantly on her hips and poured forth a torrent of invective upon Gevrol and his agents accusing them of persecuting her family ever since they had previously arrested her son a good for nothing fellow Finally she swore that she was not afraid of prison and would be only too glad to end her days in jail beyond the reach of want At first the General tried to impose silence upon the terrible termagant but he soon discovered that he was powerless besides all his subordinates were laughing Accordingly he turned his back upon her and advancing toward the murderer he said You at least will not refuse an explanation The man hesitated for a moment I have already said all that I have to say he replied at last I have told you that I am innocent and this woman and a man on the point of death who was struck down by my hand have both confirmed my declaration What more do you desire When the judge questions me I will perhaps reply until then do not expect another word from me It was easy to see that the fellow s resolution was irrevocable and that he was not to be daunted by any inspector of police Criminals frequently preserve an absolute silence from the very moment they are captured These men are experienced and shrewd and lawyers and judges pass many sleepless nights on their account They have learned that a system of defense can not be improvised at once that it is on the contrary a work of patience and meditation and knowing what a terrible effect an apparently insignificant response drawn from them at the moment of detection may produce on a court of justice they remain obstinately silent So as to see whether the present culprit was an old hand or not Gevrol was about to insist on a full explanation when some one announced that the soldier had just breathed his last As that is so my boys the inspector remarked two of you will remain here and I will leave with the others I shall go and arouse the commissary of police and inform him of the affair he will take the matter in hand and we can then do whatever he commands My responsibility will be over in any case So untie our prisoner s legs and bind Mother Chupin s hands and we will drop them both at the station house as we pass The men hastened to obey with the exception of the youngest among them the same who had won the General s passing praise He approached his chief and motioning that he desired to speak with him drew him outside the door When they were a few steps from the house Gevrol asked him what he wanted I wish to know General what you think of this affair I think my boy that four scoundrels encountered each other in this vile den They began to quarrel and from words they came to blows One of them had a revolver and he killed the others It is as clear as daylight According to his antecedents and according to the antecedents of the victims the assassin will be judged Perhaps society owes him some thanks And you think that any investigation any further search is unnecessary Entirely unnecessary The younger man appeared to deliberate for a moment It seems to me General he at length replied that this affair is not perfectly clear Have you noticed the murderer remarked his demeanor and observed his look Have you been surprised as I have been By what Ah well it seems to me I may of course be mistaken but I fancy that appearances are deceitful and Yes I suspect something Bah explain yourself please How can you explain the dog s faculty of scent Gevrol shrugged his shoulders In short he replied you scent a melodrama here a rendezvous of gentlemen in disguise here at the Poivriere at Mother Chupin s house Well hunt after the mystery my boy search all you like you have my permission What you will allow me I not only allow you I order you to do it You are going to remain here with any one of your comrades you may select And if you find anything that I have not seen I will allow you to buy me a pair of spectacles II The young police agent to whom Gevrol abandoned what he thought an unnecessary investigation was a debutant in his profession His name was Lecoq He was some twenty five or twenty six years of age almost beardless very pale with red lips and an abundance of wavy black hair He was rather short but well proportioned and each of his movements betrayed unusual energy There was nothing remarkable about his appearance if we except his eyes which sparkled brilliantly or grew extremely dull according to his mood and his nose the large full nostrils of which had a surprising mobility The son of a respectable well to do Norman family Lecoq had received a good and solid education He was prosecuting his law studies in Paris when in the same week blow following blow he learned that his father had died financially ruined and that his mother had survived him only a few hours He was left alone in the world destitute of resources obliged to earn his living But how He had an opportunity of learning his true value and found that it amounted to nothing for the university on bestowing its diploma of bachelor does not give an annuity with it Hence of what use is a college education to a poor orphan boy He envied the lot of those who with a trade at the ends of their fingers could boldly enter the office of any manufacturer and say I would like to work Such men were working and eating Lecoq sought bread by all the methods employed by people who are in reduced circumstances Fruitless labor There are a hundred thousand people in Paris who have seen better days

none	none	He gave proofs of undaunted energy He gave lessons and copied documents for a lawyer He made his appearance in a new character almost every day and left no means untried to earn an honest livelihood At last he obtained employment from a well known astronomer the Baron Moser and spent his days in solving bewildering and intricate problems at the rate of a hundred francs a month But a season of discouragement came After five years of constant toil he found himself at the same point from which he had started He was nearly crazed with rage and disappointment when he recapitulated his blighted hopes his fruitless efforts and the insults he had endured The past had been sad the present was intolerable the future threatened to be terrible Condemned to constant privations he tried to escape from the horrors of his real life by taking refuge in dreams Alone in his garret after a day of unremitting toil assailed by the thousand longings of youth Lecoq endeavored to devise some means of suddenly making himself rich All reasonable methods being beyond his reach it was not long before he was engaged in devising the worst expedients In short this naturally moral and honest young man spent much of his time in perpetrating in fancy the most abominable crimes Sometimes he himself was frightened by the work of his imagination for an hour of recklessness might suffice to make him pass from the idea to the fact from theory to practise This is the case with all monomaniacs an hour comes in which the strange conceptions that have filled their brains can be no longer held in check One day he could not refrain from exposing to his patron a little plan he had conceived which would enable him to obtain five or six hundred francs from London Two letters and a telegram were all that was necessary and the game was won It was impossible to fail and there was no danger of arousing suspicion The astronomer amazed at the simplicity of the plan could but admire it On reflection however he concluded that it would not be prudent for him to retain so ingenious a secretary in his service This was why on the following day he gave him a month s pay in advance and dismissed him saying When one has your disposition and is poor one may either become a famous thief or a great detective Choose Lecoq retired in confusion but the astronomer s words bore fruit in his mind Why should I not follow good advice he asked himself Police service did not inspire him with repugnance far from it He had often admired that mysterious power whose hand is everywhere and which although unseen and unheard still manages to hear and see everything He was delighted with the prospect of being the instrument of such a power He considered that the profession of detective would enable him to employ the talents with which he had been endowed in a useful and honorable fashion besides opening out a life of thrilling adventure with fame as its goal In short this profession had a wonderful charm for him So much so that on the following week thanks to a letter from Baron Moser he was admitted into the service A cruel disenchantment awaited him He had seen the results but not the means His surprise was like that of a simple minded frequenter of the theatre when he is admitted for the first time behind the scenes and is able to pry into the decorations and tinsel that are so dazzling at a distance However the opportunity for which he had so ardently longed for which he had been waiting during many weary months had come he thought at last as he reached the Poivriere with Gevrol and the other police agents While he was clinging to the window shutters he saw by the light of his ambition a pathway to success It was at first only a presentiment but it soon became a supposition and then a conviction based upon actual facts which had escaped his companions but which he had observed and carefully noted He recognized that fortune had at last turned in his favor when he saw Gevrol neglect all but the merest formalities of examination and when he heard him declare peremptorily that this triple murder was merely the result of one of those ferocious quarrels so frequent among vagrants in the outskirts of the city Ah well he thought have it your own way trust in appearances since you will see nothing beneath them But I will prove to you that my youthful theory is better than all your experience The inspector s carelessness gave Lecoq a perfect right to secretly seek information on his own account but by warning his superior officers before attempting anything on his own responsibility he would protect himself against any accusation of ambition or of unduly taking advantage of his comrade Such charges might prove most dangerous for his future prospects in a profession where so much rivalry is seen and where wounded vanity has so many opportunities to avenge itself by resorting to all sorts of petty treason Accordingly he spoke to his superior officer saying just enough to be able to remark in case of success Ah I warned you just enough so as not to dispel any of Gevrol s doubts The permission which Lecoq obtained to remain in charge of the bodies was his first triumph of the best possible augury but he knew how to dissimulate and it was in a tone of the utmost indifference that he requested one of his comrades to remain with him Then while the others were making ready to depart he seated himself upon the corner of the table apparently oblivious of all that was passing around He did not dare to lift his head for fear of betraying his joy so much did he fear that his companions might read his hopes and plans in the expression of his face Inwardly he was wild with impatience Though the murderer submitted with good grace to the precautions that were taken to prevent his escape it required some time to bind the hands of the Widow Chupin who fought and howled as if they were burning her alive They will never go Lecoq murmured to himself They did so at last however Gevrol gave the order to start and left the house addressing a laughing good by to his subordinate The latter made no reply He followed his comrades as far as the threshold to make sure that they were really going for he trembled at the thought that Gevrol might reflect change his mind and return to solve the mystery as was his right His anxiety was needless however The squad gradually faded away in the distance and the cries of Widow Chupin died away in the stillness of the night It was only then that Lecoq reentered the room He could no longer conceal his delight his eyes sparkled as might those of a conqueror taking possession of some vast empire he stamped his foot upon the floor and exclaimed with exultation Now the mystery belongs to us two alone Authorized by Gevrol to choose one of his comrades to remain with him at the Poivriere Lecoq had requested the least intelligent of the party to keep him company He was not influenced by a fear of being obliged to share the fruits of success with his companion but by the necessity of having an assistant from whom he could in case of need exact implicit obedience The comrade Lecoq selected was a man of about fifty who after a term of cavalry service had become an agent of the prefecture In the humble office that he occupied he had seen prefect succeed prefect and might probably have filled an entire prison with the culprits he had arrested with his own hands Experience had not however made him any the shrewder or any the more zealous Still he had this merit when he received an order he executed it with military exactitude so far as he understood it Of course if he had failed to understand it so much the worse It might indeed be said of him that he discharged his duties like a blind man like an old horse trained for a riding school When he had a moment s leisure and a little money in his pocket he invariably got drunk Indeed he spent his life between two fits of intoxication without ever rising above a condition of semi lucidity His comrades had known but had forgotten his name and his partiality for a certain beverage had accordingly induced them to call him Father Absinthe With his limited powers of observation he naturally did not observe the tone of triumph in his young companion s voice Upon my word he remarked when they were alone your idea of keeping me here was a good one and I thank you for it While the others spend the night paddling about in the slush I shall get a good sleep Here he stood in a room that was splashed with blood that was shuddering so to speak with crime and yet face to face with the still warm bodies of three murdered men he could talk of sleep But after all what did it matter to him He had seen so many similar scenes in his time And does not habit infallibly lead to professional indifference making the soldier cool and composed in the midst of conflict and rendering the surgeon impassible when the patient shrieks and writhes beneath his operating knife I have been upstairs looking about pursued Father Absinthe I saw a bed up there and we can mount guard here by turns With an imperious gesture Lecoq interrupted him You must give up that idea Father Absinthe he said we are not here to sleep but to collect information to make the most careful researches and to note all the probabilities In a few hours the commissary of police the legal physician and the public prosecutor will be here I wish to have a report ready for them This proposition seemed anything but pleasing to the old police agent Eh what is the use of that he exclaimed I know the General When he goes in search of the commissary as he has gone this evening there is nothing more to be done Do you think you can see anything that he didn t see I think that Gevrol like every one else is liable to be mistaken I think that he believes too implicitly in what seems to him evidence I could swear that this affair is not what it seems to be and I am sure that if we like we can discover the mystery which is concealed beneath present appearances Although Lecoq s vehemence was intense he did not succeed in making any impression upon his companion who with a yawn that threatened to dislocate his jaws replied Perhaps you are right but I am going to bed This need not prevent you from searching around however and if you find anything you can wake me Lecoq made no sign of impatience nor in reality was he impatient These words afforded him the opportunity for which he was longing You will give me a moment first he remarked In five minutes by your watch I promise to let you put your finger on the mystery that I suspect here Well go on for five minutes After that you shall be free Father Absinthe Only it is clear that if I unravel the mystery alone I alone ought to pocket the reward that a solution will certainly bring At the word reward the old police agent pricked up his ears He was dazzled by the vision of an infinite number of bottles of the greenish liquor whose name he bore Convince me then said he taking a seat upon a stool which he had lifted from the floor Lecoq remained standing in front of him To begin with he remarked whom do you suppose the person we have just arrested to be A porter probably or a vagabond That is to say a man belonging to the lowest class of society consequently a fellow without education Certainly Lecoq spoke with his eyes fixed upon those of his companion He distrusted his own powers as is usual with persons of real merit but he felt that if he could succeed in making his convictions penetrate his comrade s obtuse mind their exactitude would be virtually proved And now he continued what would you say if I showed you that this young man had received an excellent even refined education I should reply that it was very extraordinary I should reply that but what a fool I am You have not proved it to me yet But I can do so very easily Do you remember the words that he uttered as he fell Yes I remember them perfectly He said It is the Prussians who are coming What do you suppose he meant by that What a question I should suppose that he did not like the Prussians and that he supposed he was offering us a terrible insult Lecoq was waiting anxiously for this response Ah well Father Absinthe he said gravely you are wrong quite wrong And that this man has an education superior to his apparent position is proved by the fact that you did not understand his meaning nor his intention It was this single phrase that enlightened me Father Absinthe s physiognomy expressed the strange and comical perplexity of a man who is so thoroughly mystified that he knows not whether to laugh or to be angry After reflecting a little he decided to adopt the latter course You are rather too young to impose upon an old fellow like me he remarked I don t like boasters One moment interrupted Lecoq allow me to explain You have certainly heard of a terrible battle which resulted in one of the greatest defeats that ever happened to France the battle of Waterloo I don t see the connection Answer if you please Yes then I have heard of it Very well you must know then that for some time victory seemed likely to rest with the banners of France The English began to fall back and the emperor had already exclaimed We have them when suddenly on the right a little in the rear a large body of troops was seen advancing It was the Prussian army The battle of Waterloo was lost In all his life worthy Father Absinthe had never made such a strenuous effort to understand anything In this case his perseverance was not wholly useless for springing from his stool and probably in much the same tone that Archimedes cried Eureka he exclaimed I understand The man s words were only an allusion It is as you have said remarked Lecoq approvingly But I had not finished If the emperor was thrown into consternation by the appearance of the Prussians it was because he was momentarily expecting the arrival of one of his own generals from the same direction Grouchy with thirty five thousand men So if this man s allusion was exact and complete he was not expecting an enemy but a friend Now draw your own conclusions Father Absinthe was amazed but convinced and his eyes heavy with sleep a few moments before now opened to their widest extent Good heavens he murmured if you put it in that way But I forget you must have seen something as you were looking through the shutters The young man shook his head Upon my honor he declared I saw nothing save the struggle between the murderer and the poor devil dressed as a soldier It was that sentence alone that aroused my attention Wonderful prodigious exclaimed the astonished old man I will add that reflection has confirmed my suspicions I ask myself why this man instead of flying at once should have waited and remained there at that door to parley with us With a bound Father Absinthe sprang again to his feet Why he interrupted because he had accomplices and he wished to give them time to escape Ah I understand it all now A triumphant smile parted Lecoq s lips That is what I said to myself he replied and now it is easy to verify my suspicions There is snow outside isn t there It was not necessary to say any more The elder officer seized the light and followed by his companion he hastened to the back door of the house which opened into a small garden In this sheltered enclosure the snow had not melted and upon its white surface the dark stains of numerous footprints presented themselves Without hesitation Lecoq threw himself upon his knees in the snow he rose again almost immediately These indentations were not made by the men s feet said he There have been women here III Obstinate men of Father Absinthe s stamp who are at first always inclined to differ from other people s opinions are the very individuals who end in madly adopting them When an idea has at last penetrated their empty brains they twist and turn it dwell upon it and develop it until it exceeds the bounds of reason Hence the police veteran was now much more strongly convinced than his companion that the usually clever Gevrol had been mistaken and accordingly he laughed the inspector to scorn On hearing Lecoq affirm that women had taken part in the horrible scene at the Poivriere his joy was extreme A fine affair he exclaimed an excellent case And suddenly recollecting a maxim that has been handed down from the time of Cicero he added in sententious tones Who holds the woman holds the cause Lecoq did not deign to reply He was standing upon the threshold leaning against the framework of the door his hand pressed to his forehead as motionless as a statue The discovery he had just made and which so delighted Father Absinthe filled him with consternation It was the death of his hopes the annihilation of the ingenious structure which his imagination had built upon the foundation of a single sentence There was no longer any mystery so celebrity was not to be gained by a brilliant stroke For the presence of two women in this vile den explained everything in the most natural and commonplace fashion Their presence explained the quarrel the testimony of Widow Chupin the dying declaration of the pretended soldier The behavior of the murderer was also explained He had remained to cover the retreat of the two women he had sacrificed himself in order to save them an act of gallantry so common in the French character that any scoundrel of the barrieres might have performed it Still the strange allusion to the battle of Waterloo remained unexplained But what did that prove now Nothing simply nothing However who could say how low an unworthy passion might cause a man even of birth and breeding to descend And the carnival afforded an opportunity for the parties to disguise themselves But while Lecoq was turning and twisting all these probabilities in his mind Father Absinthe became impatient Are we going to remain here until doomsday he asked Are we to pause just at the moment when our search has been productive of such brilliant results Brilliant results These words stung the young man as deeply as the keenest irony could have done Leave me alone he replied gruffly and above all don t walk about the garden as by doing so you ll damage any footprints His companion swore a little but soon became silent in his turn He was constrained to submit to the irresistible ascendency of superior will and intelligence Lecoq was engaged in following out his course of reasoning The murderer leaving the ball at the Rainbow a dancing house not far from here near the fortifications came to this wine shop accompanied by two women He found three men drinking here who either began teasing him or who displayed too much gallantry toward his companions He became angry The others threatened him he was one against three he was armed he became wild with rage and fired He checked himself and an instant after added aloud But was it the murderer who brought these women here If he is tried this will be the important point It is necessary to obtain information regarding it He immediately went back into the house closely followed by his colleague and began an examination of the footprints round about the door that Gevrol had forced open Labor lost There was but little snow on the ground near the entrance of the hovel and so many persons had passed in and out that Lecoq could discover nothing What a disappointment after his patient hopes Lecoq could have cried with rage He saw the opportunity for which he had sighed so long indefinitely postponed He fancied he could hear Gevrol s coarse sarcasms Enough of this he murmured under his breath The General was right and I am a fool He was so positively convinced that one could do no more than discover the circumstances of some commonplace vulgar broil that he began to wonder if it would not be wise to renounce his search and take a nap while awaiting the coming of the commissary of police But Father Absinthe was no longer of this opinion This worthy man who was far from suspecting the nature of his companion s reflections could not explain his inaction Come my boy said he have you lost your wits This is losing time it seems to me The authorities will arrive in a few hours and what report shall we be able to give them As for me if you desire to go to sleep I shall pursue the investigation alone Disappointed as he was the young police officer could not repress a smile He recognized his own exhortation of a few moments before It was the old man who had suddenly become intrepid To work then he sighed like a man who while foreseeing defeat wishes at least to have no cause for self reproach He found it however extremely difficult to follow the footprints in the open air by the uncertain light of a candle which was extinguished by the least breath of wind I wonder if there is a lantern in the house he said If we could only lay our hands upon one They searched everywhere and at last upstairs in the Widow Chupin s own room they found a well trimmed lantern so small and compact that it certainly had never been intended for honest purposes A regular burglar s implement said Father Absinthe with a coarse laugh The implement was useful in any case as both men agreed when they returned to the garden and recommenced their investigations systematically They advanced very slowly and with extreme caution The old man carefully held the lantern in the best position while Lecoq on his knees studied each footprint with the attention of a chiromancer professing to read the future in the hand of a rich client This new examination assured Lecoq that he had been correct in his first supposition It was plain that two women had left the Poivriere by the back door They had started off running as was proved by the length of the steps and the shape of the footprints The difference in the tracks left by the two fugitives was so remarkable that it did not escape Father Absinthe s eyes Sapristi he muttered one of these jades can boast of having a pretty foot at the end of her leg He was right One of the tracks betrayed a small coquettish slender foot clad in an elegant high heeled boot with a narrow sole and an arched instep The other denoted a broad short foot growing wider toward the end It had evidently been incased in a strong low shoe This was indeed a clue Lecoq s hopes at once revived so eagerly does a man welcome any supposition that is in accordance with his desires Trembling with anxiety he went to examine some other footprints a short distance from these and an excited exclamation at once escaped his lips What is it eagerly inquired the other agent what do you see Come and look for yourself see there cried Lecoq The old man bent down and his surprise was so great that he almost dropped the lantern Oh said he in a stifled voice a man s footprint Exactly And this fellow wore the finest of boots See that imprint how clear how neat it is Worthy Father Absinthe was scratching his ear furiously his usual method of quickening his rather slow wits But it seems to me he ventured to say at last that this individual was not coming from this ill fated hovel Of course not the direction of the foot tells you that No he was not going away he was coming here But he did not pass beyond the spot where we are now standing He was standing on tiptoe with outstretched neck and listening ears when on reaching this spot he heard some noise fear seized him and he fled Or rather the women were going out as he was coming and No the women were outside the garden when he entered it This assertion seemed far too audacious to suit Lecoq s companion who remarked One can not be sure of that I am sure of it however and can prove it conclusively If you doubt it it is because your eyes are growing old Bring your lantern a little nearer yes here it is our man placed his large foot upon one of the marks made by the woman with the small foot and almost effaced it This unexceptionable piece of circumstantial evidence stupefied the old police agent Now continued Lecoq could this man have been the accomplice whom the murderer was expecting Might it not have been some strolling vagrant whose attention was attracted by the two pistol shots This is what we must ascertain And we will ascertain it Come A wooden fence of lattice work rather more than three feet high was all that separated the Widow Chupin s garden from the waste land surrounding it When Lecoq made the circuit of the house to cut off the murderer s escape he had encountered this obstacle and fearing lest he should arrive too late he had leaped the fence to the great detriment of his pantaloons without even asking himself if there was a gate or not There was one however a light gate of lattice work similar to the fence turning upon iron hinges and closed by a wooden button Now it was straight toward this gate that these footprints in the snow led the two police agents Some now thought must have struck the younger man for he suddenly paused Ah he murmured these two women did not come to the Poivriere this evening for the first time Why do you think that my boy inquired Father Absinthe I could almost swear it How unless they were in the habit of coming to this den could they have been aware of the existence of this gate Could they have discovered it on such a dark foggy night No for I who can without boasting say that I have good eyes I did not see it Ah yes that is true These two women however came here without hesitating in a straight line and note that to do this it was necessary for them to cross the garden diagonally The veteran would have given something if he could have found some objection to offer but unfortunately he could find none Upon my word he exclaimed yours is a droll way of proceeding You are only a conscript I am a veteran in the service and have assisted in more affairs of this sort than you are years old but never have I seen Nonsense interrupted Lecoq you will see much more For example I can prove to you that although the women knew the exact position of the gate the man knew it only by hearsay The proof The fact is easily demonstrated Study the man s footprints and you who are very sharp will see at once that he deviated greatly from the straight course He was in such doubt that he was obliged to search for the gate with his hand stretched out before him and his fingers have left their imprint on the thin covering of snow that lies upon the upper railing of the fence The old man would have been glad to verify this statement for himself as he said but Lecoq was in a hurry Let us go on let us go on said he You can verify my assertions some other time They left the garden and followed the footprints which led them toward the outer boulevards inclining somewhat in the direction of the Rue de Patay There was now no longer any need of close attention No one save the fugitives had crossed this lonely waste since the last fall of snow A child could have followed the track so clear and distinct it was Four series of footprints very unlike in character formed the track two of these had evidently been left by the women the other two one going and one returning had been made by the man On several occasions the latter had placed his foot exactly on the footprints left by the two women half effacing them thus dispelling all doubt as to the precise moment of his approach About a hundred yards from the Poivriere Lecoq suddenly seized his colleague s arm Halt he exclaimed we have reached a good place I can see unmistakable proofs The spot all unenclosed as it was was evidently utilized by some builder for the storage of various kinds of lumber The ground was strewn with large blocks of granite some chiseled some in the rough with numerous long planks and logs of wood in their midst In front of one of these logs the surface of which had been evidently wiped all the various footprints came together mingling confusedly Here declared the young detective our fugitives met the man and took counsel with him One of the women the one with the little feet sat down upon this log We ought to make quite sure of that said Father Absinthe in an oracular tone But his companion cut short his desire for verification You my old friend said he are going to do me the kindness to keep perfectly still pass me the lantern and do not move Lecoq s modest tone had suddenly become so imperious that his colleague dared offer no resistance Like a soldier at the command to halt he remained erect motionless and mute following his colleague s movements with an inquisitive wondering eye Quick in his motions and understanding how to maneuvre the lantern in accordance with his wishes the young police agent explored the surroundings in a very short space of time A bloodhound in pursuit of his prey would have been less alert less discerning less agile He came and went now turning now pausing now retreating now hurrying on again without any apparent reason he scrutinized he questioned every surrounding object the ground the logs of wood the blocks of stone in a word nothing escaped his glance For a moment he would remain standing then fall upon his knees and at times lie flat upon his stomach with his face so near the ground that his breath must have melted the snow He had drawn a tape line from his pocket and using it with a carpenter s dexterity he measured measured and measured And all his movements were accompanied with the wild gestures of a madman interspersed with oaths or short laughs with exclamations of disappointment or delight After a quarter of an hour of this strange exercise he turned to Father Absinthe placed the lantern on a stone wiped his hands with his pocket handkerchief and said Now I know everything Well that is saying a great deal When I say everything I mean all that is connected with the episode of the drama which ended in that bloody bout in the hovel This expanse of earth covered with snow is a white page upon which the people we are in search of have written not only their movements their goings and comings but also their secret thoughts their alternate hopes and anxieties What do these footprints say to you Papa Absinthe To me they are alive like the persons who made them they breathe speak accuse The old agent was saying to himself Certainly this fellow is intelligent undeniably shrewd but he is very disagreeable These are the facts as I have read them pursued Lecoq When the murderer repaired to the Poivriere with the two women his companion I should say his accomplice came here to wait He was a tall man of middle age he wore a soft hat and a shaggy brown overcoat he was moreover probably married or had been so as he had a wedding ring on the little finger of his right hand His companion s despairing gestures obliged the speaker to pause This description of a person whose existence had but just now been demonstrated these precise details given in a tone of absolute certainty completely upset all Father Absinthe s ideas increasing his perplexity beyond all bounds This is not right he growled this is not kind You are poking fun at me I take the thing seriously I listen to you I obey you in everything and then you mock me in this way We find a clue and instead of following it up you stop to relate all these absurd stories No replied his companion I am not jesting and I have told you nothing of which I am not absolutely sure nothing that is not strictly and indisputably true And you would have me believe Fear nothing papa I would not have you do violence to your convictions When I have told you my reasons and my means of information you will laugh at the simplicity of the theory that seems so incomprehensible to you now Go on then said the good man in a tone of resignation We had decided rejoined Lecoq that the accomplice mounted guard here The time seemed long and growing impatient he paced to and fro the length of this log of wood occasionally pausing to listen Hearing nothing he stamped his foot doubtless exclaiming What
6081_41997_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 the deuce 
none	none	has happened to him down there He had made about thirty turns I have counted them when a sound broke the stillness the two women were coming On hearing Lecoq s recital all the conflicting sentiments that are awakened in a child s mind by a fairy tale doubt faith anxiety and hope filled Father Absinthe s heart What should he believe what should he refuse to believe He did not know How was he to separate the true from the false among all these equally surprising assertions On the other hand the gravity of his companion which certainly was not feigned dismissed all idea of pleasantry Finally curiosity began to torture him We had reached the point where the women made their appearance said he Yes indeed responded Lecoq but here all certainty ceases no more proofs only suppositions Still I have every reason to believe that our fugitives left the drinking den before the beginning of the fight before the cries that attracted our attention Who were they I can only conjecture I suspect however that they were not equals in rank I am inclined to think that one was the mistress the other her servant That is proved ventured the old man by the great difference in their feet and in their shoes This shrewd observation elicited a smile from Lecoq That difference he replied seriously is something of course but it was not that which decided me in my opinion If greater or less perfection of the extremities regulated social distinctions many mistresses would be servants What struck me was this when the two women rushed wildly from Mother Chupin s house the woman with the small feet sprang across the garden with one bound she darted on some distance in advance of the other The terror of the situation the vileness of the den the horror of the scandal the thought of safety inspired her with marvelous energy But her strength as often happens with delicate and nervous women lasted only a few seconds She was not half way from the Poivriere when her speed relaxed her limbs trembled Ten steps farther on she tottered and almost fell Some steps farther and she became so exhausted that she let go her hold upon her skirts they trailed upon the snow tracing a faint circle there Then the woman with the broad feet came to aid her She seized her companion round the waist she dragged her along their footprints here are mingled confusedly then seeing that her friend was about to fall she caught her up in her strong arms and carried her for you will see that the footprints made by the woman with the small feet suddenly cease at this point Was Lecoq merely amusing himself by inventing this story Was this scene anything but a work of imagination Was the accent of deep and sincere conviction which he imparted to his words only feigned Father Absinthe was still in doubt but he thought of a way in which he might satisfy his uncertainty He caught up the lantern and hurried off to examine these footprints which he had not known how to read which had been speechless to him but which yielded their secret to another He was obliged to agree with his companion All that Lecoq had described was written there he saw the confused footprints the circle made by the sweeping skirts the cessation of the tiny imprints On his return his countenance betrayed a respectful and astonished admiration and it was with a shade of embarrassment that he said You can scarcely blame an old man for being a little like saint Thomas I have touched it with my fingers and now I am content to follow you The young police agent could not indeed blame his colleague for his incredulity Resuming his recital he continued Then the accomplice who had heard the fugitives coming ran to meet them and he aided the woman with large feet in carrying her companion The latter must have been really ill for the accomplice took off his hat and used it in brushing the snow off this log Then thinking the surface was not yet dry enough he wiped it with the skirt of his overcoat Were these civilities pure gallantry or the usual attentions of an inferior I have asked myself that question This much however is certain while the woman with the small feet was recovering her strength half reclining upon this board the other took the accomplice a little on one side five or six steps away to the left just beside that enormous block of granite There she talked with him and as he listened the man leaned upon the snow covered stone His hand left a very distinct imprint there Then as the conversation continued he rested his elbow upon the snowy surface Like all men of limited intelligence Father Absinthe had suddenly passed from unreasoning distrust to unquestioning confidence Henceforth he could believe anything for the very same reason that had at first made him believe nothing Having no idea of the bounds of human reasoning and penetration he saw no limits to the conjectural genius of his companion With perfect faith therefore he inquired And what was the accomplice saying to the woman with the broad shoes Lecoq smiled at this simplicity but the other did not see him do so It is rather difficult for me to answer that question replied the young detective I think however that the woman was explaining to the man the immensity and imminence of the danger that threatened his companion and that they were trying to devise some means to rescue him from it Perhaps she brought him orders given by the murderer It is certain that she ended by beseeching the accomplice to run to the Poivriere and see what was passing there And he did so for his tracks start from this block of granite And only to think exclaimed Father Absinthe that we were in the hovel at that very moment A word from Gevrol and we might have had handcuffs on the whole gang How unfortunate Lecoq was not sufficiently disinterested to share his companion s regret On the contrary he was very thankful for Gevrol s blunder Had it not been for that how would he ever have found an opportunity of investigating an affair that grew more and more mysterious as his search proceeded but which he hoped to fathom finally To conclude he resumed the accomplice soon returned he had witnessed the scene and was evidently afraid He feared that the thought of exploring the premises might enter the minds of the police It was to the lady with small feet that he addressed himself He explained the necessity of flight and told her that even a moment s delay might be fatal At his words she summoned all her energy she rose and hastened away clinging to the arm of her companion Did the man indicate the route they were to take or did they know it themselves This much is certain he accompanied them some distance in order to watch over them But besides protecting these women he had a still more sacred duty to perform that of succoring his accomplice if possible He retraced his steps passed by here once more and the last footprint that I can discover leads in the direction of the Rue du Chateau des Rentiers He wished to know what would become of the murderer and went to place himself where he might see him pass by with his captors Like a dilettante who can scarcely restrain his applause until the close of the aria that delights him Father Absinthe had been unable during the recital to entirely suppress his admiration But it was not until Lecoq ceased speaking that he gave full vent to his enthusiasm Here is a detective if you like he exclaimed And they pretend that Gevrol is shrewd What has he ever done to compare with this Ah shall I tell you what I think Why in comparison with you the General is a more John the Baptist Certainly the flattery was gross but it was impossible to doubt its sincerity This was the first time that the balmy dew of praise had fallen upon Lecoq s vanity and it greatly delighted him although he modestly replied Nonsense you are too kind papa After all what have I done that is so very clever I told you that the man was of middle age It was not difficult to see that after one had examined his heavy dragging step I told you that he was tall an easy matter When I saw that he had been leaning upon that block of granite there to the left I measured the block in question It is almost five feet five inches in height consequently a man who could rest his elbow upon it must be at least six feet high The mark of his hand proves that I am not mistaken On seeing that he had brushed away the snow which covered the plank I asked myself what he had used I thought that it might be his cap and the mark left by the peak proves that I was right Finally if I have discovered the color and the material of his overcoat it is only because when he wiped the wet board some splinters of the wood tore off a few tiny flakes of brown wool which I have found and which will figure in the trial But what does this amount to after all Nothing We have only discovered the first clues of the affair Still we are on the right scent so forward then The old officer was electrified and like an echo he repeated Forward IV That night the vagabonds who had taken refuge in the neighborhood of the Poivriere had a very bad time of it for while those who managed to sleep were disturbed by frightful dreams of a police raid those who remained awake witnessed some strange incidents well calculated to fill their minds with terror On hearing the shots fired inside Mother Chupin s drinking den most of the vagrants concluded that there had been a collision between the police and some of their comrades and they immediately began prowling about eagerly listening and watching and ready to take flight at the least sign of danger At first they could discover no particular reasons for alarm But later on at about two o clock in the morning just as they were beginning to feel secure again the fog lifted a little and they witnessed a phenomenon well calculated to arouse anxiety Upon the unoccupied tract of land which the people of the neighborhood called the plain a small but very bright light was seen describing the most capricious evolutions It moved here and there without any apparent aim tracing the most inexplicable zigzags sometimes sinking to the earth sometimes rising to a height of four or five feet at others remaining quite motionless and the next second flying off like a ball In spite of the place and the season of the year the less ignorant among vagabonds believed the light to be some ignis fatuus one of those luminous meteors that raise from the marshes and float about in the atmosphere at the bidding of the wind In point of fact however this ignis fatuus was the lantern by the light of which the two police agents were pursuing their investigations After thus suddenly revealing his capacity to his first disciple Lecoq found himself involved in a cruel perplexity He had not the boldness and promptness of decision which is the gift of a prosperous past and was hesitating between two courses both equally reasonable and both offering strong probabilities of success He stood between two paths that made by the two women on the one side and that made by the accomplice on the other Which should he take For he could not hope to follow both Seated upon the log where the women had rested a few moments before with his hand pressed upon his forehead he reflected and weighed the chances If I follow the man I shall learn nothing that I do not know already He has gone to hover round the party he has followed them at a distance he has seen them lock up his accomplice and he is undoubtedly prowling round about the station house If I hurried in pursuit could I hope to overtake and capture him No too long a time has elapsed Father Absinthe listened to this monologue with intense curiosity as anxious as an unsophisticated person who having questioned a clairvoyant in regard to some lost articles is waiting the oracle s response To follow the women continued the young man to what would that lead Perhaps to an important discovery perhaps to nothing However he preferred the unknown which with all its chances of failure had chances of success as well He rose his course was decided Father Absinthe said he we are going to follow the footprints of these two women and wherever they lead us we will go Inspired with equal ardor they began their walk At the end of the path upon which they had entered they fancied they observed as in some magic glass the one the fruits the other the glory of success They hurried forward At first it was only play to follow the distinct footprints that led toward the Seine But it was not long before they were obliged to proceed more slowly On leaving the waste ground they arrived at the outer limits of civilization so to speak and strange footprints mingled constantly with the footprints of the fugitives at times even effacing them In many spots either on account of exposure or the nature of the soil the thaw had completed its work and there were large patches of ground entirely free from snow In such cases they lost the trail and it required all Lecoq s sagacity and all his companion s good will to find it again On such occasions Father Absinthe planted his cane in the earth near the last footprint that had been discovered and Lecoq and himself hunted all over the ground around this point much after the fashion of a couple of bloodhounds thrown off the scent Then it was that the lantern moved about so strangely More than a dozen times in spite of all their efforts they would have lost the clue entirely had it not been for the elegant shoes worn by the lady with the little feet These had such small and extremely high heels that the impression they left could not be mistaken They sank down three or four inches in the snow or the mud and their tell tale impress remained as clear and distinct as that of a seal Thanks to these heels the pursuers were able to discover that the two fugitives had not gone up the Rue de Patay as might have been supposed Probably they had considered this street too frequented and too well lighted They had only crossed it just below the Rue de la Croix Rouge and had profited by an empty space between two houses to regain the open ground Certainly these women were well acquainted with the locality murmured Lecoq Indeed the topography of the district evidently had no secrets for them for on quitting the Rue de Patay they had immediately turned to the right so as to avoid several large excavations from which a quantity of brick clay had been dug But at last the trail was recovered and the detectives followed it as far as the Rue du Chevaleret Here the footprints abruptly ceased Lecoq discovered eight or ten footmarks left by the woman who wore the broad shoes but that was all Hereabout moreover the condition of the ground was not calculated to facilitate an exploration of this nature There had been a great deal of passing to and fro in the Rue du Chevaleret and not merely was there scarcely any snow left on the footpaths but the middle of the street was transformed into a river of slush Did these people recollect at last that the snow might betray them Did they take the middle of the road grumbled the young police agent Certainly they could not have crossed to a vacant space as they had done just before for on the other side of the street extended a long factory wall Ah sighed Father Absinthe we have our labor for our pains But Lecoq possessed a temperament that refused to acknowledge defeat Animated by the cold anger of a man who sees the object which he was about to seize disappear from before his eyes he recommenced his search and was well repaid for his efforts I understand he cried suddenly I comprehend I see Father Absinthe drew near He did not see nor divine anything but he no longer doubted his companion s powers Look there said Lecoq what are those marks Marks left by the wheels of some carriage that plainly turned here Very well papa these tracks explain everything When they reached this spot our fugitives saw the light of an approaching cab which was returning from the centre of Paris It was empty and proved their salvation They waited and when it came nearer they hailed the driver No doubt they promised him a handsome fare this is indeed evident since he consented to go back again He turned round here they got into the vehicle and that is why the footprints go no further This explanation did not please Lecoq s companion Have we made any great progress now that we know that he asked Lecoq could not restrain an impulse to shrug his shoulders Did you expect that the tracks made by the fugitives would lead us through Paris and up to their very doors he asked No but Then what would you ask more Do you think that I shall not know how to find this driver to morrow He was returning with his empty vehicle his day s work was ended hence his stable is in the neighborhood Do you suppose that he will have forgotten that he took up two persons in the Rue du Chevaleret He will tell us where he drove them but that will not do us any good for of course they will not have given him their real address But at all events he can probably give us a description of them tell us how they were dressed describe their appearance their manner and their age And with that and what we already know An eloquent gesture expressed the remainder of his thought then he added We must now go back to the Poivriere and go quickly And you my friend may now extinguish your lantern While doing his best to keep pace with his companion who was in such haste to get back to the Poivriere that he almost ran Father Absinthe s thoughts were as busy as his legs and an entirely new train of ideas was awakened in his mind During the twenty five years that he had been connected with the police force the good man to use his own expression had seen many of his colleagues walk over him and win after only a few months work a promotion that his long years of service had not gained for him In these cases he had not failed to accuse his superiors of injustice and his fortunate rivals of gross flattery In his opinion seniority was the only claim to advancement the only the best the most respectable claim and he was wont to sum up all his opinions all his grief and bitterness of mind in one phrase It is infamous to pass over an old member of the service To night however Father Absinthe discovered that there is something else in the world besides seniority and sufficient reasons for what he had formerly regarded as favoritism He secretly confessed that this newcomer whom he had treated so carelessly had just followed up a clue as he veteran though he was would never have succeeded in doing But communing with himself was not this good man s forte he soon grew weary of reflection and on reaching a place where they were obliged to proceed more slowly on account of the badness of the road he deemed it a favorable opportunity to resume the conversation You are silent comrade he ventured to remark and one might swear that you were not exactly pleased This surprising result of the old man s reflections would have amazed Lecoq if his mind had not been a hundred leagues away No I am not pleased he responded And why pray Only ten minutes ago you were as gay as a lark Then I did not see the misfortune that threatens us A misfortune A very great misfortune Do you not perceive that the weather has undesirably changed It is evident that the wind is now coming from the south The fog has disappeared but the sky is cloudy and threatening It will rain in less than an hour A few drops are falling now I just felt one These words produced on Lecoq much the same effect as a whip up on a spirited horse He sprang forward and adopting a still more hurried pace exclaimed Let us make haste let us make haste The old police agent followed him as in duty bound but his mind was if possible still more troubled by the replies of his young companion A great misfortune The wind from the south Rain He did not he could not see the connection Greatly puzzled and not a little anxious Father Absinthe asked for an explanation although he had but little more breath than was absolutely necessary to enable him to continue the forced march he was making Upon my word said he I have racked my brains His companion took pity on his anxiety What he exclaimed as he still hastened forward you do not understand that our investigation my success and your reward are dependent upon those black clouds which the wind is driving toward us Oh Twenty minutes of merely gentle rain and our time and labor will be lost If it rains the snow will melt and then farewell to our proofs Let us get on let us get on more quickly You know very well that in such cases words don t suffice If we declare to the public prosecutor that we have seen these footprints he will ask where And what can we say If we swear by all the gods that we have seen the footprints of a man and of two women the investigating magistrate will say Let me see them And who will feel sheepish then Father Absinthe and Lecoq Besides Gevrol would not fail to declare that we were saying what was not true in order to enhance our own value and humiliate him What an idea Faster papa faster you will have all day to morrow to be indignant Perhaps it will not rain In that case these perfect clear and easily recognizable footprints will prove the culprits ruin How can we preserve them By what process could we solidify them I would deluge them with my blood if that could only cause them to congeal Father Absinthe was just then thinking that his share of the labor had hitherto been the least important for he had merely held the lantern But here was a chance for him to acquire a real and substantial right to the prospective reward I know a method said he by which one could preserve these marks in the snow At these words the younger man stopped short You know you he interrupted Yes I know replied the old detective with the evident satisfaction of a man who has gained his revenge They invented a way at the time of that affair at the Maison Blanche last December I recollect Ah well on the snow in the courtyard there was a footprint that attracted a detective s attention He said that the whole evidence depended on that mark alone that it was worth more than ten years hard work in following up the case Naturally he desired to preserve it They sent for a great chemist Go on go on I have never seen the method put into practise but an expert told me all about it and showed me the mold they obtained He explained it to me precisely on account of my profession Lecoq was trembling with impatience And how did they obtain the mold he asked abruptly Wait I was just going to explain They take some of the best gelatine and allow it to soak in cold water When it becomes thoroughly softened they heat it until it forms a liquid of moderate consistency Then when it is just cool enough they pour a nice little covering of it upon the footprint Lecoq felt the irritation that is natural to a person who has just heard a bad joke or who has lost his time in listening to a fool Enough he interrupted angrily That method can be found in all the manuals It is excellent no doubt but how can it serve us Have you any gelatine about you No Nor have I You might as well have counseled me to pour melted lead upon the footprints to fix them They continued their way and five minutes later without having exchanged another word they reentered the Widow Chupin s hovel The first impulse of the older man would have been to rest to breathe but Lecoq did not give him time to do so Make haste get me a dish a plate anything cried the young detective and bring me some water gather together all the boards and old boxes you can find lying about While his companion was obeying him Lecoq armed himself with a fragment of one of the broken bottles and began scraping away furiously at the plastered wall that separated the two rooms His mind disconcerted at first by the imminence of this unexpected catastrophe a fall of rain had now regained its equilibrium He had reflected he had thought of a way by which failure might possibly be averted and he hoped for ultimate success When he had accumulated some seven or eight handfuls of fine plaster dust he mixed one half with a little water so as to form a thin paste leaving the rest untouched on the side of the plate Now papa said he come and hold the light for me When in the garden the young man sought for the deepest and most distinct of the footprints knelt beside it and began his experiment trembling with anxiety He first sprinkled upon the impression a fine coating of dry plaster and then upon this coating with infinite care he poured his liquid solution drop by drop What luck the experiment was successful The plaster united in a homogeneous mass forming a perfect model of the impression Thus after an hour s labor Lecoq possessed half a dozen of these casts which might perhaps be a little wanting in clearness of outline but which were quite perfect enough to be used as evidence The young detective s alarm had been well founded for it was already beginning to rain Still he had plenty of time to cover a number of the footprints with the boxes and pieces of board which Father Absinthe had collected thus placing them as it were beyond the reach of a thaw Now he could breathe The authorities might come for the most important part of his task was completed V It was some distance from the Poivriere to the Rue de Chevaleret 
3698-41990-0000	train-other-500	even by way of the plain and fully four hours had been occupied by Lecoq and his colleague in collecting their elements of information
none	none	 All this while the Widow Chupin s abode had remained open 
3698-41990-0001	train-other-500	accessible to any chance visitor Still when on his return the young police agent remembered this neglect of elementary precautions he did not feel alarmed Considering all the circumstances
3698-41990-0002	train-other-500	it was very difficult to believe that any serious harm could have resulted from this carelessness For who would have been likely to visit this drinking den after midnight Its bad name served the purpose of a bulwark
3698-41990-0003	train-other-500	The most daring vagrants did not drink there without some disquietude fearing that if the liquor caused them to lose consciousness they might be robbed or perhaps even murdered
3698-41990-0004	train-other-500	Hence if any one had been attracted to this notoriously dangerous drinking shop by the light that streamed through the open door it could only have been some very reckless person returning late at night from the ball at the Rainbow
3698-41990-0005	train-other-500	with a few sous left in his pocket But even then a single glance inside would have sufficed to put the bravest to flight In less than a second the young police agent had weighed all these possibilities
3698-41990-0006	train-other-500	concerning which he did not breathe a word to Father Absinthe When little by little the excitement caused by his successive hopes and disappointments and by the accomplishment of the experiment with the footprints had died away
3698-41990-0007	train-other-500	and he had regained his usual calm of mind he made a careful inspection of the abode and was by no means satisfied with himself He had experimented upon Father Absinthe with his new system of investigation
none	none	 just as an aspiring orator tries his powers before his least gifted friends 
3698-41990-0008	train-other-500	not before the cleverest He had certainly overwhelmed the old veteran by his superiority he had literally crushed him But what great merit what wonderful victory was this
3698-41990-0009	train-other-500	Why should he boast of having outwitted Father Absinthe one of the least sagacious men in the service
none	none	 If he could only have given some startling proofs of his energy or of his penetration 
3698-41990-0010	train-other-500	But after all what had he accomplished Was the mystery solved Was his success more than problematical When one thread is drawn out the skein is not untangled
3698-41990-0011	train-other-500	This night would undoubtedly decide his future as a detective so he swore that if he could not conquer his vanity he would at least compel himself to conceal it Hence it was in a very modest tone
3698-41990-0012	train-other-500	that he said to his companion We have done all that we can do outside now would it not be wise to busy ourselves with the inside of the house Everything looked exactly in the same state as when the two men left the room
3698-41990-0013	train-other-500	A candle with a charred smoking wick cast its flickering light upon the same scene of disorder revealing to view the rigid features of the three victims Without losing a moment
3698-41990-0014	train-other-500	Lecoq began to pick up and study the various objects scattered over the floor Some of these still remained intact
none	none	 The Widow Chupin had recoiled from the expense of a tiled floor 
3698-41990-0015	train-other-500	judging the bare ground upon which the cabin was built quite good enough for the feet of her customers This ground which must originally have been well beaten down had by constant use and damp
3698-41990-0016	train-other-500	become well nigh as muddy as the soil outside The first fruits of Lecoq s search were a large salad bowl and a big iron spoon the latter so twisted and bent that it had evidently been used as a weapon during the conflict
3698-41990-0017	train-other-500	On inspecting the bowl it became evident that when the quarrel began the victims were regaling themselves with the familiar mixture of water wine and sugar
none	none	 known round about the barrieres as vin a la Frangaise 
3698-41990-0018	train-other-500	After the salad bowl the two men picked up five of the weighty glasses ordinarily used in wine shops and which while looking as though they would contain half a bottle are in point of fact so thick at the bottom
3698-41990-0019	train-other-500	that they hold next to nothing Three of these glasses were broken two were whole All of them had contained wine
none	none	 the same vin a la Frangaise This was plain but for greater surety Lecoq applied his tongue to the bluish mixture remaining in the bottom of each glass The deuce he muttered with an astonished air 
3698-41990-0020	train-other-500	Then he examined successively the surfaces of the three overturned tables Upon one of these the one nearest the fireplace and the window the still wet marks of the five glasses of the salad bowl
3698-41990-0021	train-other-500	and even of the spoons could be distinguished Lecoq very properly regarded this circumstance as a matter of the greatest importance for it proved clearly enough that five persons had emptied the salad bowl in company
3698-41990-0022	train-other-500	Who were these five persons Oh oh suddenly exclaimed Lecoq in two entirely different tones Then the two women could not have been with the murderer
3698-41990-0023	train-other-500	A very simple mode of discovery had presented itself to his mind It was to ascertain if there were any other glasses and what they had contained After a fresh search on the floor a sixth glass was found
none	none	 similar in form to the others 
3698-41990-0024	train-other-500	but much smaller Its smell showed that it had contained brandy Then these two women had not been with the murderer and therefore he could not have fought because the other men had insulted them
3698-41990-0025	train-other-500	This discovery proved the inaccuracy of Lecoq s original suppositions It was an unexpected check and he was mourning over it in silence when Father Absinthe who had not ceased ferreting about uttered a cry of surprise
3698-41990-0026	train-other-500	The young man turned he saw that his companion had become very pale What is it he asked Some one has been here in our absence Impossible It was not impossible it was true
none	none	 When Gevrol had torn the apron off Widow Chupin s head 
3698-41990-0027	train-other-500	he had thrown it upon the steps of the stairs neither of the police agents had since touched it And yet the pockets of this apron were now turned inside out this was a proof this was evidence At this discovery
3698-41990-0028	train-other-500	Lecoq was overcome with consternation and the contraction of his features revealed the struggle going on in his mind Who could have been here he murmured Robbers That is improbable Then
none	none	 after a long silence which his companion took good care not to interrupt 
3698-41990-0029	train-other-500	he added The person who came here who dared to penetrate into this abode and face the corpses of these murdered men this person could have been none other than the accomplice But it is not enough to suspect this
3698-41990-0030	train-other-500	it is necessary to know it I must I will know it They searched for a long time and it was not until after an hour of earnest work that in front of the door forced open by the police they discovered in the mud
none	none	 just inside the marks made by Gevrol s tread 
3698-41990-0031	train-other-500	a footprint that bore a close resemblance to those left by the man who had entered the garden They compared the impressions and recognized the same designs formed by the nails upon the sole of the boot It must have been the accomplice
3698-41990-0032	train-other-500	exclaimed Lecoq He watched us he saw us go away and then he entered But why What pressing irresistible necessity made him decide to brave such imminent danger He seized his companion s hand
3698-41990-0033	train-other-500	nearly crushing it in his excitement Ah I know why continued he violently I understand only too well Some article that would have served to throw light on this horrible affair had been left or forgotten or lost here
3698-41990-0034	train-other-500	and to obtain it to find it he decided to run this terrible risk And to think that it was my fault my fault alone that this convincing proof escaped us And I thought myself so shrewd
none	none	 What a lesson 
3698-41990-0035	train-other-500	The door should have been locked any fool would have thought of it Here he checked himself and remained with open mouth and distended eyes pointing with his finger to one of the corners of the room What is the matter
3698-41990-0036	train-other-500	asked his frightened companion Lecoq made no reply but slowly and with the stiff movements of a somnambulist he approached the spot to which he had pointed stooped picked up something and said
3698-41990-0037	train-other-500	My folly is not deserving of such luck The object he had found was an earring composed of a single large diamond The setting was of marvelous workmanship This diamond declared Lecoq
none	none	 after a moment s examination 
3698-41990-0038	train-other-500	must be worth at least five or six thousand francs
none	none	 Are you in earnest 
3698-41990-0039	train-other-500	I think I could swear to it He would not have troubled about such a preamble as I think a few hours before but the blunder he had made was a lesson that would not be forgotten so long as he lived
3698-41990-0040	train-other-500	Perhaps it was that same diamond earring that the accomplice came to seek ventured Father Absinthe The supposition is scarcely admissible In that case he would not have sought for it in Mother Chupin s apron
3698-41990-0041	train-other-500	No he must have been seeking for something else a letter for example The older man was not listening he had taken the earring and was examining it in his turn And to think
3698-41990-0042	train-other-500	he murmured astonished by the brilliancy of the stone to think that a woman who had ten thousand francs worth of jewels in her ears would have come to the Poivriere Who would have believed it
3698-41990-0043	train-other-500	Lecoq shook his head thoughtfully Yes it is very strange very improbable very absurd
none	none	 And yet we shall see many things quite as strange if we ever arrive which I very much doubt at a solution of this mysterious affair Day was breaking cold cheerless and gloomy when Lecoq and his colleague concluded their investigation There was not an inch of space that had not been explored carefully examined and studied one might almost say with a magnifying glass There now only remained to draw up the report The younger man seated himself at the table and with the view of making his recital as intelligible as possible he began by sketching a plan of the scene of the murder Graphic Omitted It will be seen that in the memoranda appended to this explanatory diagram Lecoq had not once written his own name In noting the things that he had imagined or discovered he referred to himself simply as one of the police This was not so much modesty as calculation By hiding one s self on well chosen occasions one gains greater notoriety when one emerges from the shade It was also through cunning that he gave Gevrol such a prominent position These tactics rather subtle perhaps but after all perfectly fair could not fail to call attention to the man who had shown himself so efficient when the efforts of his chief had been merely confined to breaking open the door The document Lecoq drew up was not a proces verbal a formal act reserved for the officers of judiciary police it was a simple report that would be admitted under the title of an inquiry and yet the young detective composed it with quite as much care as a general would have displayed in drawing up the bulletin of his first victory While Lecoq was drawing and writing Father Absinthe leaned over his shoulder to watch him The plan amazed that worthy man He had seen a great deal but he had always supposed that it was necessary to be an engineer an architect or at least a carpenter to execute such work Not at all With a tape line with which to take some measurements and a bit of board in place of a rule his inexperienced colleague had soon accomplished the miracle Father Absinthe s respect for Lecoq was thereby greatly augmented It is true that the worthy veteran had not noticed the explosion of the young police agent s vanity nor his return to his former modest demeanor He had not observed his alarm nor his perplexity nor his lack of penetration After a few moments Father Absinthe ceased watching his companion He felt weary after the labors of the night his head was burning and he shivered and his knees trembled Perhaps though he was by no means sensitive he felt the influence of the horrors that surrounded him and which seemed more sinister than ever in the bleak light of morning He began to ferret in the cupboards and at last succeeded in discovering oh marvelous fortune a bottle of brandy three parts full He hesitated for an instant then he poured out a glass and drained it at a single draft Will you have some he inquired of his companion It is not a very famous brand to be sure but it is just as good it makes one s blood circulate and enlivens one Lecoq refused he did not need to be enlivened All his faculties were hard at work He intended that after a single perusal of his report the investigating magistrate should say Let the officer who drew up this document be sent for It must be remembered that Lecoq s future depended upon such an order Accordingly he took particular care to be brief clear and concise to plainly indicate how his suspicions on the subject of the murder had been aroused how they had increased and how they had been confirmed He explained by what series of deductions he had succeeded in establishing a theory which if it was not the truth was at least plausible enough to serve as the basis for further investigation Then he enumerated the articles of conviction ranged on the table before him There were the flakes of brown wool collected upon the plank the valuable earring the models of the different footprints in the garden and the Widow Chupin s apron with its pockets turned inside out There was also the murderer s revolver with two barrels discharged and three still loaded This weapon although not of an ornamental character was still a specimen of highly finished workmanship It bore the name of one Stephens fourteen Skinner Street a well known London gunsmith Lecoq felt convinced that by examining the bodies of the victims he would obtain other and perhaps very valuable information but he did not dare venture upon such a course Besides his own inexperience in such a matter there was Gevrol to be thought of and the inspector furious at his own mistake would not fail to declare that by changing the attitude of the bodies Lecoq had rendered a satisfactory examination by the physicians impossible The young detective accordingly tried to console himself for his forced inaction in this respect and he was rereading his report modifying a few expressions when Father Absinthe who was standing upon the threshold of the outer door called to him Is there anything new asked Lecoq Yes was the reply Here come Gevrol and two of our comrades with the commissary of police and two other gentlemen It was indeed the commissary who was approaching interested but not disturbed by this triple murder which was sure to make his arrondissement the subject of Parisian conversation during the next few days Why indeed should he be troubled about it For Gevrol whose opinion in such matters might be regarded as an authority had taken care to reassure him when he went to arouse him from his slumbers It was only a fight between some old offenders former jail birds habitues of the Poivriere he had said adding sententiously If all these ruffians would kill one another we might have some little peace He added that as the murderer had been arrested and placed in confinement there was nothing urgent about the case Accordingly the commissary thought there was no harm in taking another nap and waiting until morning before beginning the inquiry He had seen the murderer reported the case to the prefecture and now he was coming leisurely enough accompanied by two physicians appointed by the authorities to draw up a medico legal report in all such cases The party also comprised a sergeant major of the fifty threed regiment of infantry of the line who had been summoned by the commissary to identify if possible the murdered man who wore a uniform for if one might believe the number engraved upon the buttons of his overcoat he belonged to the fifty threed regiment now stationed at the neighboring fort As the party approached it was evident that Inspector Gevrol was even less disturbed than the commissary He whistled as he walked along flourishing his cane which never left his hand and already laughing in his sleeve over the discomfiture of the presumptuous fool who had desired to remain to glean where he the experienced and skilful officer had perceived nothing As soon as he was within speaking distance the inspector called to Father Absinthe who after warning Lecoq remained on the threshold leaning against the door post puffing his pipe as immovable as a sphinx Ah well old man cried Gevrol have you any great melodrama very dark and very mysterious to relate to us I have nothing to relate myself replied the old detective without even drawing his pipe from his lips I am too stupid that is perfectly understood But Monsieur Lecoq will tell you something that will astonish you The prefix monsieur which the old police agent used in speaking of his colleague displeased Gevrol so much that he pretended not to understand Who are you speaking of he asked abruptly Of my colleague of course who is now busy finishing his report of Monsieur Lecoq Quite unintentionally the worthy fellow had certainly become the young police agent s godfather From that day forward for his enemies as well as for his friends he was and he remained Monsieur Lecoq Ah ah said the inspector whose hearing was evidently impaired Ah he has discovered The pot of roses which others did not scent General By this remark Father Absinthe made an enemy of his superior officer But he cared little for that Lecoq had become his deity and no matter what the future might reserve the old veteran had resolved to follow his young colleague s fortunes We ll see about that murmured the inspector mentally resolving to have an eye on this youth whom success might transform into a rival He said no more for the little party which he preceded had now overtaken him and he stood aside to make way for the commissary of police This commissary was far from being a novice He had served for many years and yet he could not repress a gesture of horror as he entered the Poivriere The sergeant major of the fifty threed who followed him an old soldier decorated and medaled who had smelt powder many scores of times was still more overcome He grew as pale as the corpses lying on the ground and was obliged to lean against the wall for support The two physicians alone retained their stoical indifference Lecoq had risen his report in his hand he bowed and assuming a respectful attitude was waiting to be questioned You must have passed a frightful night said the commissary kindly and quite unnecessarily since any investigation was superfluous I think however replied the young police agent having recourse to all his diplomacy that my time has not been entirely lost I have acted according to the instructions of my superior officer I have searched the premises thoroughly and I have ascertained many things I have for example acquired the certainty that the murderer had a friend possibly an accomplice of whom I can give quite a close description He must have been of middle age and wore if I am not mistaken a soft cap and a brown woolen overcoat as for his boots Zounds exclaimed Gevrol and I He stopped short like a man whose impulse had exceeded his discretion and who would have gladly recalled his words And you inquired the commissary pray

6081_41998_000038_000001	train-clean-100	what do you mean 
none	none	The inspector had gone too far to draw back and unwittingly was now obliged to act as his own executioner I was about to mention he said that this morning an hour or so ago while I was waiting for you sir before the station house at the Barriere d Italie where the murderer is confined I noticed close by an individual whose appearance was not unlike that of the man described by Lecoq This man seemed to be very intoxicated for he reeled and staggered against the walls He tried to cross the street but fell down in the middle of it in such a position that he would inevitably have been crushed by the first passing vehicle Lecoq turned away his head he did not wish them to read in his eyes how perfectly he understood the whole game Seeing this pursued Gevrol I called two men and asked them to aid me in raising the poor devil We went up to him he had apparently fallen asleep we shook him we made him sit up we told him that he could not remain there but he immediately flew into a furious rage He swore at us threatened us and began fighting us And on my word we had to take him to the station house and leave him there to recover from the effects of his drunken debauch Did you shut him up in the same cell with the murderer inquired Lecoq Naturally You know very well that there are only two cages in the station house at the barriere one for men and the other for women consequently The commissary seemed thoughtful Ah that s very unfortunate he stammered and there is no remedy Excuse me there is one observed Gevrol I can send one of my men to the station house with an order to detain the drunken man Lecoq interposed with a gesture Trouble lost he said coldly If this individual is an accomplice he has got sober by now rest assured of that and is already far away Then what is to be done asked the inspector with an ironical air May one be permitted to ask the advice of Monsieur Lecoq I think chance offered us a splendid opportunity and we did not know how to seize it and that the best thing we can do now is to give over mourning and prepare to profit by the next opportunity that presents itself Gevrol was however determined to send one of his men to the station house and it was not until the messenger had started that Lecoq commenced the reading of his report He read it rapidly refraining as much as possible from placing the decisive proofs in strong relief reserving these for his own benefit but so strong was the logic of his deductions that he was frequently interrupted by approving remarks from the commissary and the two physicians Gevrol who alone represented the opposition shrugged his shoulders till they were well nigh dislocated and grew literally green with jealousy I think that you alone young man have judged correctly in this affair said the commissary when Lecoq had finished reading I may be mistaken but your explanations have made me alter my opinion concerning the murderer s attitude while I was questioning him which was only for a moment He refused obstinately refused to answer my questions and wouldn t even give me his name The commissary was silent for a moment reviewing the past circumstances in his mind and it was in a serious tone that he eventually added We are I feel convinced in presence of one of those mysterious crimes the causes of which are beyond the reach of human sagacity this strikes me as being one of those enigmatical cases which human justice never can reach Lecoq made no audible rejoinder but he smiled to himself and thought We will see about that VI No consultation held at the bedside of a dying man ever took place in the presence of two physicians so utterly unlike each other as those who accompanied the commissary of police to the Poivriere One of them a tall old man with a bald head wearing a broad brimmed hat and an overcoat of antique cut was evidently one of those modest savants encountered occasionally in the byways of Paris one of those healers devoted to their art who too often die in obscurity after rendering immense services to mankind He had the gracious calmness of a man who having seen so much of human misery has nothing left to learn and no troubled conscience could have possibly sustained his searching glance which was as keen as his lancet His colleague young fresh looking light haired and jovial was somewhat foppishly attired and his white hands were encased in handsome fur gloves There was a soft self satisfied smile on his face and he had the manners of those practitioners who for profit s sake invariably recommend the infallible panaceas invented each month in chemical laboratories and advertised ad nauseam in the back pages of newspapers He had probably written more than one article upon Medicine for the use of the people puffing various mixtures pills ointments and plasters for the benefit of their respective inventors I will request you gentlemen said the commissary of police to begin your duties by examining the victim who wears a military costume Here is a sergeant major summoned to answer a question of identity whom I must send back to his quarters as soon as possible The two physicians responded with a gesture of assent and aided by Father Absinthe and another agent of police they lifted the body and laid it upon two tables which had previously been placed end to end They were not obliged to make any note of the attitude in which they found the body since the unfortunate man who was still alive when the police entered the cabin had been moved before he expired Approach sergeant ordered the commissary and look carefully at this man It was with very evident repugnance that the old soldier obeyed What is the uniform that he wears It is the uniform of the twod battalion of the fifty threed regiment of the line Do you recognize him Not at all Are you sure that he does not belong to your regiment I can not say for certain there are some conscripts at the Depot whom I have never seen But I am ready to swear that he had never formed part of the twod battalion which by the way is mine and in which I am sergeant major Lecoq who had hitherto remained in the background now stepped forward It might be as well he suggested to note the numbers marked on the other articles of clothing That is a very good idea said the commissary approvingly Here is his shako added the young police agent It bears the number three thousand one hundred twenty nine The officials followed Lecoq s advice and soon discovered that each article of clothing worn by the unfortunate man bore a different number The deuce murmured the sergeant there is every indication But it is very singular Invited to consider what he was going to say the brave trooper evidently made an effort to collect his intellectual faculties I would stake my epaulets that this fellow never was a soldier he said at last He must have disguised himself to take part in the Shrove Sunday carnival Why do you think that Oh I know it better than I can explain it I know it by his hair by his nails by his whole appearance by a certain je ne sais quoi in short I know it by everything and by nothing Why look the poor devil did not even know how to put on his shoes he has laced his gaiters wrong side outwards Evidently further doubt was impossible after this evidence which confirmed the truth of Lecoq s first remark to Inspector Gevrol Still if this person was a civilian how could he have procured this clothing insisted the commissary Could he have borrowed it from the men in your company Yes that is possible but it is difficult to believe Is there no way by which you could ascertain Oh very easily I have only to run over to the fort and order an inspection of clothing Do so approved the commissary it would be an excellent way of getting at the truth But Lecoq had just thought of a method quite as convincing and much more prompt One word sergeant said he isn t cast off military clothing sold by public auction Yes at least once a year after the inspection And are not the articles thus sold marked in some way Assuredly Then see if there isn t some mark of the kind on this poor wretch s uniform The sergeant turned up the collar of the coat and examined the waist band of the pantaloons You are right he said these are condemned garments The eyes of the young police agent sparkled We must then believe that the poor devil purchased this costume he observed Where Necessarily at the Temple from one of the dealers in military clothing There are only five or six of these establishments I will go from one to another of them and the person who sold these clothes will certainly recognize them by some trade mark And that will assist us very much growled Gevrol The sergeant major to his great relief now received permission to retire but not without having been warned that very probably the commissary would require his deposition The moment had come to search the garments of the pretended soldier and the commissary who performed this duty himself hoped that some clue as to the man s identity would be forthcoming He proceeded with his task at the same time dictating to one of the men a proces verbal of the search that is to say a minute description of all the articles he found upon the dead man s person In the right hand trousers pocket some tobacco a pipe and a few matches were found in the left hand one a linen handkerchief of good quality but unmarked and a soiled leather pocket book containing seven francs and sixty centimes There appeared to be nothing more and the commissary was expressing his regret when on carefully examining the pocket book he found a compartment which had at first escaped his notice being hidden by a leather flap This compartment contained a carefully folded paper The commissary unfolded it and read the contents aloud My dear Gustave To morrow Sunday evening do not fail to come to the ball at the Rainbow according to our agreement If you have no money pass by my house and I will leave some with the concierge who will give it to you Be at the ball by eight o clock If I am not already there it will not be long before I make my appearance Everything is going on satisfactorily Lacheneur Alas what did this letter reveal Only that the dead man s name was Gustave that he had some connection with a man named Lacheneur who had advanced him money for a certain object and that they had met at the Rainbow some hours before the murder It was little very little but still it was something It was a clue and in this absolute darkness even the faintest gleam of light was eagerly welcomed Lacheneur growled Gevrol the poor devil uttered that name in his last agony Precisely insisted Father Absinthe and he declared that he wished to revenge himself upon him He accused him of having drawn him into a trap Unfortunately death cut his story short Lecoq was silent The commissary of police had handed him the letter and he was studying it with the closest attention The paper on which it was written was of the ordinary kind the ink was blue In one of the corners was a half effaced stamp of which one could just distinguish the word Beaumarchais This was enough for Lecoq This letter he thought was certainly written in a cafe on the Boulevard Beaumarchais In which one I must ascertain that point for this Lacheneur must be found While the agents of the prefecture were gathered around the commissary holding council and deliberating the physicians began their delicate and disagreeable task With the assistance of Father Absinthe they removed the clothing of the pretended soldier and then with sleeves rolled up they bent over their subject like surgeons in the schools of anatomy and examined inspected and appraised him physically Very willingly would the younger doctor have dispensed with these formalities which he considered very ridiculous and entirely unnecessary but the old physician had too high a regard for his profession and for the duty he had been called upon to fulfil to neglect the slightest detail Minutely and with the most scrupulous exactitude he noted the height of the dead man his supposed age the nature of his temperament the color and length of his hair and the degree of development of his muscular system Then the doctors passed to an examination of the wound Lecoq had judged correctly The medical men declared it to be a fracture of the base of the skull It could they stated only have been caused by some instrument with a very broad surface or by a violent knock of the head against some hard substance of considerable magnitude But no weapon other than the revolver had been found and it was evidently not heavy enough to produce such a wound There must then necessarily have been a hand to hand struggle between the pretended soldier and the murderer and the latter seizing his adversary by the throat had dashed him violently against the wall The presence of some very tiny but very numerous spots of extravasated blood about the neck made this theory extremely plausible No other wound not even a bruise or a scratch was to be found Hence it became evident that this terrible struggle must have been exceedingly short The murder of the pretended soldier must have been consummated between the moment when the squad of police heard the shrieks of despair and the moment when Lecoq peered through the shutter and saw the victim fall The examination of the other murdered man required different but even greater precautions than those adopted by the doctors in their inspection of the pseudo soldier The position of these two victims had been respected they were still lying across the hearth as they had fallen and their attitude was a matter of great importance since it might have decisive bearing on the case Now this attitude was such that one could not fail to be impressed with the idea that with both these men death had been instantaneous They were both stretched out upon their backs their limbs extended and their hands wide open No contraction or extension of the muscles no trace of conflict could be perceived it seemed evident that they had been taken unawares the more so as their faces expressed the most intense terror Thus said the old doctor we may reasonably suppose that they were stupefied by some entirely unexpected strange and frightful spectacle I have come across this terrified expression depicted upon the faces of dead people more than once I recollect noticing it upon the features of a woman who died suddenly from the shock she experienced when one of her neighbors with the view of playing her a trick entered her house disguised as a ghost Lecoq followed the physician s explanations and tried to make them agree with the vague hypotheses that were revolving in his own brain But who could these individuals be Would they in death guard the secret of their identity as the other victim had done The first subject examined by the physicians was over fifty years of age His hair was very thin and quite gray and his face was closely shaven excepting a thick tuft of hair on his rather prominent chin He was very poorly clad wearing a soiled woolen blouse and a pair of dilapidated trousers hanging in rags over his boots which were very much trodden down at the heels The old doctor declared that this man must have been instantly killed by a bullet The size of the circular wound the absence of blood around its edge and the blackened and burnt state of the flesh demonstrated this fact with almost mathematical precision The great difference that exists in wounds made by firearms according to the distance from which the death dealing missile comes was seen when the physicians began to examine the last of the murdered men The ball that had caused the latter s death had scarcely crossed a yard of space before reaching him and his wound was not nearly so hideous in aspect as the other s This individual who was at least fifteen years younger than his companion was short and remarkably ugly his face which was quite beardless being pitted all over by the smallpox His garb was such as is worn by the worst frequenters of the barriere His trousers were of a gray checked material and his blouse turned back at the throat was blue It was noticed that his boots had been blackened quite recently The smart glazed cap that lay on the floor beside him was in harmony with his carefully curled hair and gaudy necktie These were the only facts that the physicians report set forth in technical terms this was the only information obtained by the most careful investigation The two men s pockets were explored and turned inside out but they contained nothing that gave the slightest clue to their identity either as regards name social position or profession There was not even the slightest indication on any of these points not a letter nor an address not a fragment of paper nothing not even such common articles of personal use as a tobacco pouch a knife or a pipe which might be recognized and thus establish the owner s identity A little tobacco in a paper bag a couple of pocket handkerchiefs that were unmarked a packet of cigarettes these were the only articles discovered beyond the money which the victims carried loose in their pockets On this point it should be mentioned that the elder man had sixty seven francs about him and the younger one two louis Rarely had the police found themselves in the presence of so strange an affair without the slightest clue to guide them Of course there was the fact itself as evidenced by the bodies of the three victims but the authorities were quite ignorant of the circumstances that had attended and of the motive that had inspired the crime Certainly they might hope with the powerful means of investigation at their disposal to finally arrive at the truth in the course of time and after repeated efforts But in the mean while all was mystery and so strangely did the case present itself that it could not safely be said who was really responsible for the horrible tragedy at the Poivriere The murderer had certainly been arrested but if he persisted in his obstinacy how were they to ascertain his name He protested that he had merely killed in self defense How could it be shown that such was not the case Nothing was known concerning the victims one of whom had with his dying breath accused himself Then again an inexplicable influence tied the Widow Chupin s tongue Two women one of whom had lost an earring valued at five thousand francs had witnessed the struggle then disappeared An accomplice after two acts of unheard of audacity had also made his escape And all these people the women the murderer the keeper of the saloon the accomplice and the victims were equally strange and mysterious equally liable not to be what they seemed Perhaps the commissary of police thought he would spend a very unpleasant quarter of an hour at the prefecture when he reported the case Certainly he spoke of the crime in a very despondent tone It will now be best he said at last to transport these three bodies to the Morgue There they will doubtless be identified He reflected for a moment and then added And to think that one of these dead men is perhaps Lacheneur himself That is scarcely possible said Lecoq The spurious soldier being the last to die had seen his companions fall If he had supposed Lacheneur to be dead he would not have spoken of vengeance Gevrol who for the past two hours had pretended to pay no attention to the proceedings now approached He was not the man to yield even to the strongest evidence If Monsieur the Commissary will listen to me he shall hear my opinion which is a trifle more definite than M Lecoq s fancies Before he could say any more the sound of a vehicle stopping before the door of the cabin interrupted him and an instant afterward the investigating magistrate entered the room All the officials assembled at the Poivriere knew at least by sight the magistrate who now made his appearance and Gevrol an old habitue of the Palais de Justice mechanically murmured his name M Maurice d Escorval He was the son of that famous Baron d Escorval who in eighteen fifteen sealed his devotion to the empire with his blood and upon whom Napoleon in the Memorial of saint Helena pronounced this magnificent eulogium Men as honest as he may I believe exist but more honest no it is not possible Having entered upon his duties as magistrate early in life and being endowed with remarkable talents it was at first supposed that the younger D Escorval would rise to the most exalted rank in his profession But he had disappointed all such prognostications by resolutely refusing the more elevated positions that were offered to him in order to retain his modest but useful functions in the public prosecutor s offices at Paris To explain his repeated refusals he said that life in the capital had more charms for him than the most enviable advancement in provincial centres But it was hard to understand this declaration for in spite of his brilliant connections and large fortune he had ever since the death of his eldest brother led a most retired life his existence merely being revealed by his untiring labors and the good he did to those around him He was now about forty two years of age but appeared much younger although a few furrows already crossed his brow One would have admired his face had it not been for the puzzling immobility that marred its beauty the sarcastic curl of his thin lips and the gloomy expression of his pale blue eyes To say that he was cold and grave did not express the truth it was saying too little He was gravity and coldness personified with a shade of hauteur added Impressed by the horror of the scene the instant he placed his foot upon the threshold M d Escorval acknowledged the presence of the physicians and the commissary by a slight nod of the head The others in the room had no existence so far as he was concerned At once his faculties went to work He studied the ground and carefully noted all the surroundings with the attentive sagacity of a magistrate who realizes the immense weight of even the slightest detail and who fully appreciates the eloquence of circumstantial evidence This is a serious affair he said gravely very serious The commissary s only response was to lift his eyes to heaven A gesture that plainly implied I quite agree with you The fact is that for the past two hours the worthy commissary s responsibility had weighed heavily upon him and he secretly blessed the investigating magistrate for relieving him of it The public prosecutor was unable to accompany me resumed M d Escorval he has not the gift of omnipresence and I doubt if it will be possible for him to join me here Let us therefore begin operations at once The curiosity of those present had become intense and the commissary only expressed the general feeling when he said You have undoubtedly questioned the murderer sir and have learnt I have learnt nothing interrupted M d Escorval apparently much astonished at the interruption He took a chair and sat himself down and while his clerk was busy in authenticating the commissary s proces verbal he began to read the report prepared by Lecoq Pale agitated and nervous the young police agent tried to read upon the magistrate s impassive face the impression produced by the document His future depended upon the magistrate s approval or disapproval and it was not with a fuddled mind like that of Father Absinthe that he had now to deal but with a superior intelligence If I could only plead my own cause he thought What are cold written phrases in comparison with spoken living words palpitating with emotion and imbued with the convictions of the speaker However he was soon reassured The magistrate s face retained its immobility but again and again did M d Escorval nod his head in token of approval and occasionally some point more ingenious than the others extorted from his lips the exclamations Not bad very good When he had finished the perusal he turned to the commissary and remarked All this is very unlike your report of this morning which represented the affair as a low broil between a party of miserable vagabonds The observation was only too just and fair and the commissary deeply regretted that he had trusted to Gevrol s representations and remained in bed This morning he responded evasively I only gave you my first impressions These have been modified by subsequent researches so that Oh interrupted the magistrate I did not intend to reproach you on the contrary I must congratulate you One could not have done better nor acted more promptly The investigation that has been carried out shows great penetration and research and the results are given with unusual clearness and wonderful precision Lecoq s head whirled The commissary hesitated for an instant At first he was sorely tempted to confiscate this praise to his own profit If he drove away the unworthy thought it was because he was an honest man and more than that because he was not displeased to have the opportunity to do Gevrol a bad turn and punish him for his presumptuous folly I must confess he said with some embarrassment that the merit of this investigation does not belong to me To whom then shall I attribute it to the inspector thought M d Escorval not without surprise for having occasionally employed Gevrol he did not expect from him such ingenuity and sagacity as was displayed in this report Is it you then who have conducted this investigation so ably he asked Upon my word no responded Inspector Gevrol I myself am not so clever as all that I content myself with telling what I actually discover and I only give proofs when I have them in hand May I be hung if the grounds of this report have any existence save in the brains of the man who imagined them Perhaps the inspector really believed what he said being one of those persons who are blinded by vanity to such a degree that with the most convincing evidence before their eyes they obstinately deny it And yet insisted the magistrate these women whose footprints have been detected must have existed The accomplice who left the flakes of wool adhering to the plank is a real being This earring is a positive palpable proof Gevrol had hard work to refrain from shrugging his shoulders All this can be satisfactorily explained he said without a search of twelve or fourteen hours That the murderer had an accomplice is possible The presence of the women is very natural Wherever there are male thieves you will find female thieves as well As for the diamond what does that prove That the scoundrels had just met with a stroke of good luck that they had come here to divide their booty and that the quarrel arose from the division This was an explanation and such a plausable one that M d Escorval was silent reflecting before he announced his decision Decidedly he declared at last decidedly I adopt the hypothesis set forth in the report Who prepared it Gevrol s face turned red with anger One of my men he replied a clever adroit fellow Monsieur Lecoq Come forward Lecoq that the magistrate may see you The young man advanced his lips tightly compressed so as to conceal a smile of satisfaction which almost betrayed itself My report sir is only a summary he began but I have certain ideas Which you will acquaint me with when I ask for them interrupted the magistrate And oblivious of Lecoq s chagrin he drew from his clerk s portfolio two forms which he filled up and handed to Gevrol saying Here are two orders take them to the station where the murderer and the landlady of this cabin are confined and have them conducted to the prefecture where they will be privately examined Having given these directions M d Escorval was turning toward the physicians when Lecoq at the risk of a second rebuff interposed May I venture sir to beg of you to confide this message to me he asked of the investigating magistrate Impossible I may have need of you here I desired sir to collect certain evidence and an opportunity to do so may not present itself again The magistrate perhaps fathomed the young man s motive Then let it be so he replied but after your task is completed you must wait for me at the prefecture where I shall proceed as soon as I have finished here You may go Lecoq did not wait for the order to be repeated He snatched up the papers and hastened away He literally flew over the ground and strange to say he no longer experienced any fatigue from the labors of the preceding night Never had he felt so strong and alert either in body or mind He was very hopeful of success He had every confidence in himself and his happiness would indeed have been complete if he had had another judge to deal with But M d Escorval overawed him to such a degree that he became almost paralyzed in his presence With what a disdainful glance the magistrate had surveyed him With what an imperious tone he had imposed silence upon him and that too when he had found his work deserving of commendation Still never mind the young detective mentally exclaimed no one ever tastes perfect happiness here below And concentrating all his thoughts on the task before him he hurried on his way VII When after a rapid walk of twenty minutes Lecoq reached the police station near the Barriere d Italie the doorkeeper with his pipe in his mouth was pacing slowly to and fro before the guard house 
6135-41994-0000	train-other-500	His thoughtful air and the anxious glances he cast every now and then toward one of the little grated windows of the building sufficed to indicate that some very rare bird indeed had been entrusted to his keeping
none	none	 As soon as he recognized Lecoq his brow cleared 
6135-41994-0001	train-other-500	and he paused in his promenade Ah well he inquired what news do you bring I have an order to conduct the prisoners to the prefecture
none	none	 The keeper rubbed his hands and his smile of satisfaction plainly implied that he felt a load the less on his shoulders 
6135-41994-0002	train-other-500	Capital capital he exclaimed
none	none	 The Black Maria the prison van will pass here in less than an hour 
6135-41994-0003	train-other-500	we will throw them in and hurry the driver off Lecoq was obliged to interrupt the keeper s transports of satisfaction Are the prisoners alone he inquired Quite alone
none	none	 the woman in one cell and the man in the other 
6135-41994-0004	train-other-500	This has been a remarkably quiet night for Shrove Sunday Quite surprising indeed It is true your hunt was interrupted You had a drunken man here however No yes that s true
none	none	 this morning just at daybreak A poor devil who is under a great obligation to Gevrol The involuntary irony of this remark did not escape Lecoq Yes under a great obligation indeed he said with a derisive laugh 
6135-41994-0005	train-other-500	You may laugh as much as you like retorted the keeper but such is really the case if it hadn t been for Gevrol the man would certainly have been run over And what has become of him The keeper shrugged his shoulders You ask me too much he responded
none	none	 He was a worthy fellow who had been spending the night at a friend s house 
6135-41994-0006	train-other-500	and on coming out into the open air the wine flew into his head He told us all about it when he got sober half an hour afterward I never saw a man so vexed as he was He wept and stammered The father of a family and at my age too
6135-41994-0007	train-other-500	Oh it is shameful What shall I say to my wife What will the children think Did he talk much about his wife He talked about nothing else He mentioned her name Eudosia Leocadie or some name of that sort
none	none	 He declared that he should be ruined if we kept him here 
6135-41994-0008	train-other-500	He begged us to send for the commissary to go to his house and when we set him free I thought he would go mad with joy he kissed our hands and thanked us again and again And did you place him in the same cage as the murderer inquired Lecoq
6135-41994-0009	train-other-500	Of course Then they talked with each other Talked
none	none	 Why the drunkard was so gone I tell you that he couldn t have said bread distinctly 
6135-41994-0010	train-other-500	When he was placed in a cell bang He fell down like a log of wood
none	none	 As soon as he recovered we let him out I m sure they didn t talk to each other 
6135-41994-0011	train-other-500	The young police agent had grown very thoughtful I was evidently right he murmured What did you say
none	none	 inquired the keeper Nothing replied Lecoq who 
6135-41994-0012	train-other-500	was not inclined to communicate his reflections to the custodian of the guard house These reflections of his were by no means pleasant ones I was right he thought this pretended drunkard was none other than the accomplice He is evidently an adroit
6135-41994-0013	train-other-500	audacious cool headed fellow While we were tracking his footprints he was watching us When we had got to some distance he was bold enough to enter the hovel
none	none	 Then he came here and compelled them to arrest him and thanks to an assumption of childish simplicity 
6135-41994-0014	train-other-500	he succeeded in finding an opportunity to speak with the murderer He played his part perfectly Still I know that he did play a part and that is something
none	none	 I know that one must believe exactly the opposite of what he said 
6135-41994-0015	train-other-500	He talked of his family his wife and children hence he has neither children wife nor family
none	none	 Lecoq suddenly checked himself remembering that he had no time to waste in conjectures 
6135-41994-0016	train-other-500	What kind of fellow was this drunkard he inquired He was tall and stout with full ruddy cheeks a pair of white whiskers small eyes a broad flat nose and a good natured jovial manner
6135-41994-0017	train-other-500	How old would you suppose him to be Between forty and fifty Did you form any idea of his profession It s my opinion that what with his soft cap and his heavy brown overcoat he must be either a clerk
6135-41994-0018	train-other-500	or the keeper of some little shop Having obtained this description
none	none	 which agreed with the result of his investigations 
6135-41994-0019	train-other-500	Lecoq was about to enter the station house when a sudden thought brought him to a standstill
none	none	 I hope this man has had no communication with this Widow Chupin 
6135-41994-0020	train-other-500	he exclaimed The keeper laughed heartily How could he have had any he responded Isn t the old woman alone in her cell Ah the old wretch She has been cursing and threatening ever since she arrived
none	none	 Never in my whole life have I heard such language as she has used It has been enough to make the very stones blush even the drunken man was so shocked that he went to the grating in the door and told her to be quiet 
6135-41994-0021	train-other-500	Lecoq s glance and gesture were so expressive of impatience and wrath that the keeper paused in his recital much perturbed What is the matter he stammered Why are you angry Because replied Lecoq furiously
none	none	 because 
6135-41994-0022	train-other-500	Not wishing to disclose the real cause of his anger he entered the station house saying that he wanted to see the prisoner Left alone the keeper began to swear in his turn These police agents are all alike he grumbled They question you
6135-41994-0023	train-other-500	you tell them all they desire to know and afterward if you venture to ask them anything they reply nothing or because They have too much authority it makes them proud Looking through the little latticed window in the door
6135-41994-0024	train-other-500	by which the men on guard watch the prisoners Lecoq eagerly examined the appearance of the assumed murderer He was obliged to ask himself if this was really the same man he had seen some hours previously at the Poivriere
6135-41994-0025	train-other-500	standing on the threshold of the inner door and holding the whole squad of police agents in check by the intense fury of his attitude Now on the contrary he seemed as it were the personification of weakness and despondency
6135-41994-0026	train-other-500	He was seated on a bench opposite the grating in the door his elbows resting on his knees his chin upon his hand
none	none	 his under lip hanging low and his eyes fixed upon vacancy 
6135-41994-0027	train-other-500	No murmured Lecoq no this man is not what he seems to be So saying he entered the cell the culprit raised his head gave the detective an indifferent glance but did not utter a word Well how goes it
6135-41994-0028	train-other-500	asked Lecoq I am innocent responded the prisoner in a hoarse discordant voice I hope so I am sure but that is for the magistrate to decide I came to see if you wanted anything No replied the murderer
6135-41994-0029	train-other-500	but a second later he changed his mind All the same he said I shouldn t mind a crust and a drink of wine
none	none	 You shall have them replied Lecoq who at once went out to forage in the neighborhood for eatables of some sort 
6135-41994-0030	train-other-500	In his opinion if the murderer had asked for a drink after at first refusing to partake of anything
none	none	 it was solely with the view of conveying the idea that he was really the kind of man he pretended to be 
6135-41994-0031	train-other-500	At all events whoever he might be the prisoner ate with an excellent appetite
none	none	 He then took up the large glass of wine that had been brought him 
6135-41994-0032	train-other-500	drained it slowly and remarked That s capital There can be nothing to beat that
none	none	 This seeming satisfaction greatly disappointed Lecoq who had selected as a test one of those horribly thick bluish nauseous mixtures in vogue around the barrieres 
6135-41994-0033	train-other-500	hoping nay almost expecting that the murderer would not drink it without some sign of repugnance And yet the contrary proved the case However the young detective had no time to ponder over the circumstance
6135-41994-0034	train-other-500	for a rumble of wheels now announced the approach of that lugubrious vehicle the Black Maria When the Widow Chupin was removed from her cell
none	none	 she fought and scratched and cried Murder at the top of her voice and it was only by sheer force 
6135-41994-0035	train-other-500	that she was at length got into the van Then it was that the officials turned to the assassin
none	none	 Lecoq certainly expected some sign of repugnance now and he watched the prisoner closely But he was again doomed to disappointment 
6135-41994-0036	train-other-500	The culprit entered the vehicle in the most unconcerned manner and took possession of his compartment like one accustomed to it knowing the most comfortable position to assume in such close quarters
none	none	 Ah what an unfortunate morning murmured Lecoq disconsolately Still I will lie in wait for him at the prefecture When the door of the prison van had been securely closed the driver cracked his whip and the sturdy horses started off at a brisk trot 
6135-41995-0000	train-other-500	Lecoq had taken his seat in front between the driver and the guard but his mind was so engrossed with his own thoughts that he heard nothing of their conversation which was very jovial
none	none	 although frequently interrupted by the shrill voice of the Widow Chupin 
6135-41995-0001	train-other-500	who sang and yelled her imprecations alternately It is needless however to recapitulate her oaths let us rather follow the train of Lecoq s meditation By what means could he secure some clue to the murderer s identity
6135-41995-0002	train-other-500	He was still convinced that the prisoner must belong
none	none	 to the higher ranks of society After all it was not so extraordinary that he should have succeeded in feigning an appetite that he should have concealed his distaste for a nauseous beverage and that he should have entered the Black Maria without hesitation 
6135-41995-0003	train-other-500	Such conduct was quite possible indeed almost probable on the part of a man endowed with considerable strength of will and realizing the imminence of his peril But granting this would he be equally able to hide his feelings
6135-41995-0004	train-other-500	when he was obliged to submit to the humiliating formalities that awaited him formalities which in certain cases can and must
none	none	 be pushed even to the verge of insult and outrage No Lecoq could not believe that this would be possible 
6135-41995-0005	train-other-500	He felt sure that the disgraceful position in which the prisoner would find himself would cause him to revolt to lose his self control to utter some word that might give the desired clue It was not until the gloomy vehicle
6135-41995-0006	train-other-500	had turned off the Pont Neuf on to the Quai de l Horloge that the young detective became conscious of what was transpiring around him Soon the van passed through an open gateway and drew up in a small damp courtyard
6135-41995-0007	train-other-500	Lecoq immediately alighted and opened the door of the compartment in which the supposed murderer was confined exclaiming as he did so Here we are get out There was no fear of the prisoner escaping The iron gate had been closed
6135-41995-0008	train-other-500	and at least a dozen agents were standing near at hand waiting to have a look at the new arrivals The prisoner slowly stepped to the ground His expression of face remained unchanged and each gesture evinced the perfect indifference
6135-41995-0009	train-other-500	of a man accustomed to such ordeals Lecoq scrutinized his demeanor as attentively as an anatomist might have watched the action of a muscle He noted that the prisoner seemed to experience a sensation of satisfaction
none	none	 directly his foot touched the pavement of the courtyard that he drew a long breath 
6135-41995-0010	train-other-500	and then stretched and shook himself as if to regain the elasticity of his limbs cramped by confinement in the narrow compartment from which he had just emerged Then he glanced around him and a scarcely perceptible smile played upon his lips
none	none	 One might have sworn that the place was familiar to him 
6135-41995-0011	train-other-500	that he was well acquainted with these high grim walls these grated windows these heavy doors in short
none	none	 with all the sinister belongings of a prison Good Lord murmured Lecoq greatly chagrined 
6135-41995-0012	train-other-500	does he indeed recognize the place And his sense of disappointment and disquietude increased
none	none	 when without waiting for a word a motion or a sign 
6135-41995-0013	train-other-500	the prisoner turned toward one of the five or six doors that opened into the courtyard Without an instant s hesitation he walked straight toward the very doorway he was expected to enter
none	none	 Lecoq asked himself was it chance But his amazement and disappointment increased tenfold when 
6135-41995-0014	train-other-500	after entering the gloomy corridor he saw the culprit proceed some little distance resolutely turn to the left pass by the keeper s room and finally enter the registrar s office An old offender could not have done better
6135-41995-0015	train-other-500	Big drops of perspiration stood on Lecoq s forehead This man thought he has certainly been here before he knows the ropes The registrar s office was a large room
6135-41995-0016	train-other-500	heated almost to suffocation by an immense stove and badly lighted by three small windows the panes of which were covered with a thick coating of dust There sat the clerk reading a newspaper spread out over the open register
6135-41995-0017	train-other-500	that fatal book in which are inscribed the names of all those whom misconduct crime misfortune madness or error have brought to these grim portals Three or four attendants
6135-41995-0018	train-other-500	who were awaiting the hour for entering upon their duties reclined half asleep upon the wooden benches that lined three sides of the room These benches with a couple of tables and some dilapidated chairs constituted the entire furniture of the office
6135-41995-0019	train-other-500	in one corner of which stood a measuring machine under which
none	none	 each culprit was obliged to pass 
6135-41995-0020	train-other-500	the exact height of the prisoners being recorded in order that the description of their persons might be complete in every respect At the entrance of the culprit accompanied by Lecoq the clerk raised his head Ah said he has the van arrived
none	none	 Yes responded Lecoq 
6135-41995-0021	train-other-500	And showing the orders signed by M d Escorval he added Here are this man s papers The registrar took the documents and read them Oh he exclaimed a triple assassination Oh oh
6135-41995-0022	train-other-500	The glance he gave the prisoner was positively deferential This was no common culprit no ordinary vagabond no vulgar thief The investigating magistrate orders a private examination continued the clerk
6135-41995-0023	train-other-500	and I must get the prisoner other clothing as the things he is wearing now will be used as evidence Let some one go at once and tell the superintendent that the other occupants of the van must wait At this moment the governor of the Depot entered the office
6135-41995-0024	train-other-500	The clerk at once dipped his pen in the ink and turning to the prisoner he asked What is your name May Your Christian name I have none
none	none	 What have you no Christian name The prisoner seemed to reflect for a moment 
6135-41995-0025	train-other-500	and then answered sulkily I may as well tell you that you need not tire yourself by questioning me I shan t answer any one else but the magistrate You would like to make me cut my own throat wouldn t you A very clever trick of course
none	none	 but one that won t do for me 
6135-41995-0026	train-other-500	You must see
none	none	 that you only aggravate your situation 
6135-41995-0027	train-other-500	observed the governor Not in the least I am innocent you wish to ruin me I only defend myself Get anything more out of me now if you can But you had better give me back what they took from me at the station house
6135-41995-0028	train-other-500	My hundred and thirty six francs and eight sous I shall need them when I get out of this place I want you to make a note of them on the register Where are they The money had been given to Lecoq by the keeper of the station house
none	none	 who had found it upon the prisoner when he was placed in his custody Lecoq now laid it upon the table 
6135-41995-0029	train-other-500	Here are your hundred and thirty six francs and eight sous said he and also your knife your handkerchief and four cigars An expression of lively contentment was discernible on the prisoner s features
6135-41995-0030	train-other-500	Now resumed the clerk will you answer But the governor perceived the futility of further questioning and silencing the clerk by a gesture he told the prisoner to take off his boots Lecoq thought the assassin s glance wavered as he heard this order
6135-41995-0031	train-other-500	Was it only a fancy Why must I do that asked the culprit To pass under the beam replied the clerk We must make a note of your exact height The prisoner made no reply
6135-41995-0032	train-other-500	but sat down and drew off his heavy boots The heel of the right one was worn down on the inside It was moreover noticed that the prisoner wore no socks and that his feet were coated with mud
6135-41995-0033	train-other-500	You only wear boots on Sundays then remarked Lecoq Why do you think that By the mud with which your feet are covered
none	none	 as high as the ankle bone 
6135-41995-0034	train-other-500	What of that exclaimed the prisoner in an insolent tone Is it a crime not to have a marchioness s feet It is a crime you are not guilty of at all events said the young detective slowly Do you think I can t see
6135-41995-0035	train-other-500	that if the mud were picked off your feet would be white and neat The nails have been carefully cut and polished He paused A new idea inspired by his genius for investigation had just crossed Lecoq s mind
none	none	 Pushing a chair in front of the prisoner 
6135-41995-0036	train-other-500	and spreading a newspaper over it he said Will you place your foot there The man did not comply with the request It is useless to resist exclaimed the governor we are in force The prisoner delayed no longer
none	none	 He placed his foot on the chair as he had been ordered and Lecoq with the aid of a knife proceeded to remove the fragments of mud that adhered to the skin 
6135-41995-0037	train-other-500	Anywhere else so strange and grotesque a proceeding would have excited laughter but here in this gloomy chamber
none	none	 the anteroom of the assize court 
6135-41995-0038	train-other-500	an otherwise trivial act is fraught with serious import Nothing astonishes and should a smile threaten to curve one s lips it is instantly repressed All the spectators from the governor of the prison to the keepers
6135-41995-0039	train-other-500	had witnessed many other incidents equally absurd and no one thought of inquiring the detective s motive This much was known already that the prisoner was trying to conceal his identity Now it was necessary to establish it at any cost
6135-41995-0040	train-other-500	and Lecoq had probably discovered some means of attaining this end The operation was soon concluded and Lecoq swept the dust off the paper into the palm of his hand He divided it into two parts enclosing one portion in a scrap of paper
6135-41995-0041	train-other-500	and slipping it into his own pocket With the remainder he formed a package which he handed to the governor saying I beg you sir to take charge of this and to seal it up here in presence of the prisoner This formality is necessary
6135-41995-0042	train-other-500	so that by and by he may not pretend that the dust has been changed The governor complied with the request and as he placed this bit of proof as he styled it in a small satchel for safe keeping the prisoner shrugged his shoulders with a sneering laugh
6135-41995-0043	train-other-500	Still beneath this cynical gaiety Lecoq thought he could detect poignant anxiety Chance owed him the compensation of this slight triumph for previous events had deceived all his calculations
6135-41995-0044	train-other-500	The prisoner did not offer the slightest objection when he was ordered to undress and to exchange his soiled and bloodstained garments for the clothing furnished by the Government Not a muscle of his face moved while he submitted his person
none	none	 to one of those ignominous examinations 
6135-41995-0045	train-other-500	which make the blood rush to the forehead of the lowest criminal It was with perfect indifference that he allowed an inspector to comb his hair and beard and to examine the inside of his mouth so as to make sure that he had not concealed
6135-41995-0046	train-other-500	either some fragment of glass by the aid of which captives can sever the strongest bars or one of those microscopical bits of lead with which prisoners write the notes they exchange rolled up in a morsel of bread and called
6135-41995-0047	train-other-500	postilions These formalities having been concluded the superintendent rang for one of the keepers Conduct this man to No three of the secret cells he ordered There was no need to drag the prisoner away He walked out as he had entered
6135-41995-0048	train-other-500	preceding the guard like some old habitue who knows where he is going What a rascal exclaimed the clerk
none	none	 Then you think began Lecoq baffled but not convinced 
6135-41995-0049	train-other-500	Ah there can be no doubt of it declared the governor This man is certainly a dangerous criminal an old offender I think I have seen him before I could almost swear to it Thus it was evident these people with their long varied experience
6135-41995-0050	train-other-500	shared Gevrol s opinion Lecoq stood alone He did not discuss the matter what good would it have done Besides the Widow Chupin was just being brought in The journey must have calmed her nerves for she had become as gentle as a lamb
6135-41995-0051	train-other-500	It was in a wheedling voice and with tearful eyes that she called upon these good gentlemen to witness the shameful injustice with which she was treated she an honest woman Was she not the mainstay of her family
6135-41995-0052	train-other-500	since her son Polyte was in custody charged with pocket picking hence what would become of her daughter in law and of her grandson Toto who had no one to look after them but her Still when her name had been taken and a keeper was ordered to remove her
6135-41995-0053	train-other-500	nature reasserted itself and scarcely had she entered the corridor than she was heard quarreling with the guard You are wrong not to be polite she said you are losing a good fee without counting many a good drink I would stand you when I get out of here
none	none	 Lecoq was now free until M d Escorval s arrival 
6135-41995-0054	train-other-500	He wandered through the gloomy corridors from office to office but finding himself assailed with questions by every one he came across he eventually left the Depot
none	none	 and went and sat down on one of the benches beside the quay 
6135-41995-0055	train-other-500	Here he tried to collect his thoughts His convictions were unchanged He was more than ever convinced that the prisoner was concealing his real social standing but on the other hand
none	none	 it was evident that he was well acquainted with the prison and its usages 
6135-41995-0056	train-other-500	He had also proved himself to be endowed with far more cleverness than Lecoq had supposed What self control What powers of dissimulation he had displayed He had not so much as frowned while undergoing the severest ordeals
6135-41995-0057	train-other-500	and he had managed to deceive the most experienced eyes in Paris The young detective had waited during nearly three hours as motionless as the bench on which he was seated and so absorbed in studying his case that he had thought neither of the cold
6135-41995-0058	train-other-500	nor of the flight of time when a carriage drew up before the entrance of the prison
none	none	 and M d Escorval alighted 
6135-41995-0059	train-other-500	followed by his clerk Lecoq rose and hastened well nigh breathless with anxiety toward the magistrate My researches on the spot said this functionary confirm me in the belief that you are right Is there anything fresh Yes sir
none	none	 a fact that is apparently very trivial though in truth it is of importance that Very well 
6135-41995-0060	train-other-500	interrupted the magistrate You will explain it to me by and by First of all I must summarily examine the prisoners A mere matter of form for to day Wait for me here Although the magistrate promised to make haste
none	none	 Lecoq expected that at least an hour would elapse before he reappeared 
6135-41995-0061	train-other-500	In this he was mistaken Twenty minutes later
none	none	 M d Escorval emerged from the prison without his clerk 
6135-41995-0062	train-other-500	He was walking very fast and instead of approaching the young detective he called to him at some little distance I must return home at once he said instantly I can not listen to you But sir Enough
6135-41995-0063	train-other-500	the bodies of the victims have been taken to the Morgue Keep a sharp lookout there Then this evening make well do whatever you think best But sir I must To morrow to morrow at nine o clock in my office in the Palais de Justice
6135-41995-0064	train-other-500	Lecoq wished to insist upon a hearing
none	none	 but M d Escorval had entered or rather 
6135-41995-0065	train-other-500	thrown himself into his carriage and the coachman was already whipping up the horse And to think that he s an investigating magistrate panted Lecoq
none	none	 left spellbound on the quay Has he gone mad As he spoke an uncharitable thought took possession of his mind 
6135-41995-0066	train-other-500	Can it be he murmured
none	none	 that M d Escorval 
6135-41995-0067	train-other-500	holds the key to the mystery Perhaps he wishes to get rid of me This suspicion was so terrible
none	none	 that Lecoq hastened back to the prison 
6135-41995-0068	train-other-500	hoping that the prisoner s bearing might help to solve his doubts On peering through the grated aperture in the door of the cell he perceived the prisoner lying on the pallet that stood opposite the door His face was turned toward the wall
none	none	 and he was enveloped in the coverlid up to his eyes He was not asleep 
6135-41995-0069	train-other-500	for Lecoq could detect a strange movement of the body which puzzled and annoyed him On applying his ear instead of his eye to the aperture he distinguished a stifled moan There could no longer be any doubt
6135-41995-0070	train-other-500	The death rattle was sounding in the prisoner s throat
none	none	 Help help cried Lecoq greatly excited 
6135-41995-0071	train-other-500	The prisoner is killing himself A dozen keepers hastened to the spot The door was quickly opened and it was then ascertained that the prisoner having torn a strip of binding from his clothes had fastened it round his neck and tried to strangle himself
none	none	 with the assistance of a spoon that had been left him with his food 
6135-41995-0072	train-other-500	He was already unconscious and the prison doctor who immediately bled him declared that had another ten minutes elapsed help would have arrived too late When the prisoner regained his senses he gazed around him with a wild puzzled stare
6135-41995-0073	train-other-500	One might have supposed that he was amazed to find himself still alive Suddenly a couple of big tears welled from his swollen eyelids and rolled down his cheeks He was pressed with questions
6135-41995-0074	train-other-500	but did not vouchsafe so much as a single word in response As he was in such a desperate frame of mind and as the orders to keep him in solitary confinement prevented the governor giving him a companion
none	none	 it was decided to put a straight waistcoat on him Lecoq assisted at this operation 
6135-41995-0075	train-other-500	and then walked away puzzled thoughtful and agitated Intuition told him that these mysterious occurrences concealed some terrible drama Still what can have occurred since the prisoner s arrival here he murmured
6135-41995-0076	train-other-500	Has he confessed his guilt to the magistrate or
none	none	 what is his reason for attempting so desperate an act VIII Lecoq did not sleep that night although he had been on his feet for more than forty hours and had scarcely paused either to eat or drink Anxiety hope and even fatigue itself had imparted to his body the fictitious strength of fever and to his intellect the unhealthy acuteness which is so often the result of intense mental effort He no longer had to occupy himself with imaginary deductions as in former times when in the employ of his patron the astronomer Once again did the fact prove stranger than fiction Here was reality a terrible reality personified by the corpses of three victims lying on the marble slabs at the Morgue Still if the catastrophe itself was a patent fact its motive its surroundings could only be conjectured Who could tell what circumstances had preceded and paved the way for this tragical denouement It is true that all doubt might be dispelled by one discovery the identity of the murderer Who was he Who was right Gevrol or Lecoq The former s views were shared by the officials at the prison the latter stood alone Again the former s opinion was based upon formidable proof the evidence of sight while Lecoq s hypothesis rested only on a series of subtle observations and deductions starting from a single sentence that had fallen from the prisoner s lips And yet Lecoq resolutely persisted in his theory guided by the following reasons He learnt from M d Escorval s clerk that when the magistrate had examined the prisoner the latter not only refused to confess but answered all the questions put to him in the most evasive fashion In several instances moreover he had not replied at all If the magistrate had not insisted it was because this first examination was a mere formality solely intended to justify the somewhat premature delivery of the order to imprison the accused Now under these circumstances how was one to explain the prisoner s attempt at self destruction Prison statistics show that habitual offenders do not commit suicide When apprehended for a criminal act they are sometimes seized with a wild frenzy and suffer repeated nervous attacks at others they fall into a dull stupor just as some glutted beast succumbs to sleep with the blood of his prey still dripping from his lips However such men never think of putting an end to their days They hold fast to life no matter how seriously they may be compromised In truth they are cowards On the other hand the unfortunate fellow who in a moment of frenzy commits a crime not unfrequently seeks to avoid the consequences of his act by self destruction Hence the prisoner s frustrated attempt at suicide was a strong argument in favor of Lecoq s theory This wretched man s secret must be a terrible one since he held it dearer than life since he had tried to destroy himself that he might take it unrevealed to the grave Four o clock was striking when Lecoq sprang from his bed on which he had thrown himself without undressing and five minutes later he was walking down the Rue Montmartre The weather was still cold and muggy and a thick fog hung over the city But the young detective was too engrossed with his own thoughts to pay attention to any atmospherical unpleasantness Walking with a brisk stride he had just reached the church of Saint Eustache when a coarse mocking voice accosted him with the exclamation Ah ha my fine fellow He looked up and perceived Gevrol who with three of his men had come to cast his nets round about the markets whence the police generally return with a good haul of thieves and vagabonds You are up very early this morning Monsieur Lecoq continued the inspector you are still trying to discover our man s identity I suppose Still trying Is he a prince in disguise or only a marquis One or the other I am quite certain
6081_41998_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 All right then 
none	none	In that case you will not refuse us the opportunity to drink to your success Lecoq consented and the party entered a wine shop close by When the glasses were filled Lecoq turned to Gevrol and exclaimed Upon my word General our meeting will save me a long walk I was going to the prefecture to request you on M d Escorval s behalf to send one of our comrades to the Morgue this morning The affair at the Poivriere has been noised about and all the world will be there so he desires some officer to be present to watch the crowd and listen to the remarks of the visitors All right Father Absinthe shall be there when the doors open To send Father Absinthe where a shrewd and subtle agent was required was a mockery Still Lecoq did not protest for it was better to be badly served than to be betrayed and he could at least trust Father Absinthe It doesn t much matter continued Gevrol but you should have informed me of this last evening However when I reached the prefecture you had gone I had some work to do Yes At the station house near the Barriere d Italie I wanted to know whether the floor of the cell was paved or tiled So saying Lecoq paid the score saluted his superior officer and went out Thunder exclaimed Gevrol striking his glass violently upon the counter Thunder how that fellow provokes me He does not know the A B C of his profession When he can t discover anything he invents wonderful stories and then misleads the magistrates with his high sounding phrases in the hope of gaining promotion I ll give him advancement with a vengeance I ll teach him to set himself above me Lecoq had not been deceived The evening before he had visited the station house where the prisoner had first been confined and had compared the soil of the cell floor with the dust he had placed in his pocket and he carried away with him as he believed one of those crushing proofs that often suffice to extort from the most obstinate criminal a complete confession If Lecoq was in haste to part company with Gevrol it was because he was anxious to pursue his investigations still further before appearing in M d Escorval s presence He was determined to find the cab driver who had been stopped by the two women in the Rue du Chevaleret and with this object in view he had obtained at the prefecture the names and addresses of all the cab owners hiring between the road to Fontainebleau and the Seine His earlier efforts at investigation proved unsuccessful At the first establishment he visited the stable boys who were not yet up swore at him roundly In the second he found the grooms at work but none of the drivers had as yet put in an appearance Moreover the owner refused to show him the books upon which are recorded or should be recorded each driver s daily engagements Lecoq was beginning to despair when at about half past seven o clock he reached an establishment just beyond the fortifications belonging to a man named Trigault Here he learned that on Sunday night or rather early on Monday morning one of the drivers had been accosted on his way home by some persons who succeeded in persuading him to drive them back into Paris This driver who was then in the courtyard harnessing his horse proved to be a little old man with a ruddy complexion and a pair of small eyes full of cunning Lecoq walked up to him at once Was it you he asked who on Sunday night or rather on Monday between one and two in the morning drove a couple of women from the Rue du Chevaleret into Paris The driver looked up and surveying Lecoq attentively cautiously replied Perhaps It is a positive answer that I want Aha said the old man sneeringly you know two ladies who have lost something in a cab and so The young detective trembled with satisfaction This man was certainly the one he was looking for Have you heard anything about a crime that has been committed in the neighborhood he interrupted Yes a murder in a low wine shop Well then I will tell you that these two women are mixed up in it they fled when we entered the place I am trying to find them I am a detective here is my card Now can you give me any information The driver had grown very pale Ah the wretches he exclaimed I am no longer surprised at the luck money they gave me a louis and two five franc pieces for the fare thirty francs in all Cursed money If I hadn t spent it I d throw it away And where did you drive them To the Rue de Bourgogne I have forgotten the number but I should recognize the house Unfortunately they would not have let you drive them to their own door Who knows I saw them ring the bell and I think they went in just as I drove away Shall I take you there Lecoq s sole response was to spring on to the box exclaiming Let us be off It was not to be supposed that the women who had escaped from the Widow Chupin s drinking den at the moment of the murder were utterly devoid of intelligence 
6081_41997_000001_000001	train-clean-100	Nor was it at all likely that these two fugitives conscious as they were of their perilous situation had gone straight to their real home in a vehicle hired on the public highway 
6081_41997_000001_000002	train-clean-100	Hence the driver s hope of finding them in the Rue de Bourgogne was purely chimerical 
none	none	Lecoq was fully aware of this and yet he did not hesitate to jump on to the box and give the signal for starting 
6081_41997_000001_000004	train-clean-100	In so doing he obeyed a maxim which he had framed in his early days of meditation a maxim intended to assure his after fame and which ran as follows Always suspect that which seems probable and begin by believing what appears incredible 
6081_41997_000002_000000	train-clean-100	As soon as the vehicle was well under way the young detective proceeded to ingratiate himself into the driver s good graces being anxious to obtain all the information that this worthy was able to impart 
none	none	In a tone that implied that all trifling would be useless the cabman cried Hey up hey up Cocotte and his mare pricked up her ears and quickened her pace so that the Rue de Choisy was speedily reached Then it was that Lecoq resumed his inquiries Well my good fellow he began you have told me the principal facts now I should like the details 
6081_41997_000004_000001	train-clean-100	How did these two women attract your attention 
6081_41997_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh it was very simple 
6081_41997_000005_000001	train-clean-100	I had been having a most unfortunate day six hours on a stand on the Boulevards with the rain pouring all the time It was simply awful 
6081_41997_000005_000002	train-clean-100	At midnight I had not made more than a franc and a half for myself but I was so wet and miserable and the horse seemed so done up that I decided to go home 
none	none	I did grumble I can tell you Well I had just passed the corner of the Rue Picard in the Rue du Chevaleret when I saw two women standing under a lamp some little distance off 
6081_41997_000005_000004	train-clean-100	I did not pay any attention to them for when a man is as old as I am women 
6081_41997_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 Go on said Lecoq who could not restrain his impatience 
6081_41997_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 I had already passed them when they began to call after me 
6081_41997_000007_000001	train-clean-100	I pretended I did not hear them but one of them ran after the cab crying A louis a louis for yourself I hesitated for a moment when the woman added And ten francs for the fare I then drew up 
none	none	Lecoq was boiling over with impatience but he felt that the wisest course was not to interrupt the driver with questions but to listen to all he had to say
6081_41997_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 As you may suppose continued the coachman I wasn t inclined to trust two such suspicious characters alone at that hour and in that part of the city 
6081_41997_000009_000001	train-clean-100	So just as they were about to get into the cab I called to them Wait a bit my little friends you have promised papa some sous where are they The one who had called after the cab at once handed me thirty francs saying Above all make haste 
none	none	Your recital could not be more minute exclaimed Lecoq approvingly Now how about these two women What do you mean
6081_41997_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I mean what kind of women did they seem to be what did you take them for 
none	none	Oh for nothing very good replied the driver with a knowing smile
6081_41997_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Ah and how were they dressed 
6081_41997_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Like most of the girls who go to dance at the Rainbow 
none	none	One of them however was very neat and prim while the other well she was a terrible dowdy
6081_41997_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Which ran after you 
6081_41997_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 The girl who was neatly dressed the one who 
none	none	The driver suddenly paused some vivid remembrance passed through his brain and abruptly jerking the rains he brought his horse to a standstill Thunder he exclaimed
6081_41997_000018_000001	train-clean-100	 Now I think of it I did notice something strange 
6081_41997_000018_000002	train-clean-100	One of the two women called the other Madame as large as life while the other said thee and thou and spoke as if she were somebody 
none	none	Oh oh oh exclaimed the young detective in three different keys And which was it that said thee and thou
6081_41997_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Why the dowdy one 
none	none	She with shabby dress and shoes as big as a gouty man s 
6081_41997_000020_000002	train-clean-100	You should have seen her shake the prim looking girl as if she had been a plum tree 
none	none	You little fool said she do you want to ruin us 
6081_41997_000020_000004	train-clean-100	You will have time to faint when we get home now come along 
6081_41997_000020_000005	train-clean-100	And then she began to sob Indeed madame indeed I can t she said and really she seemed quite unable to move in fact she appeared to be so ill that I said to myself Here is a young woman who has drunk more than is good for her 
6081_41997_000021_000000	train-clean-100	These facts confirmed even if they corrected Lecoq s first suppositions As he had suspected the social position of the two women was not the same 
6081_41997_000021_000001	train-clean-100	He had been mistaken however in attributing the higher standing to the woman wearing the shoes with the high heels the marks of which he had so particularly noticed in the snow with all the attendant signs of precipitation terror and weakness 
6081_41997_000021_000002	train-clean-100	In reality social preeminence belonged to the woman who had left the large broad footprints behind her 
6081_41997_000021_000003	train-clean-100	And not merely was she of a superior rank but she had also shown superior energy 
6081_41997_000021_000004	train-clean-100	Contrary to Lecoq s original idea it now seemed evident that she was the mistress and her companion the servant 
6081_41997_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Is that all my good fellow he asked the driver who during the last few minutes had been busy with his horses 
none	none	Yes replied the cabman except that I noticed that the shabbily dressed woman who paid me had a hand as small as a child s and in spite of her anger her voice was as sweet as music
6081_41997_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Did you see her face 
6081_41997_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 I just caught a glimpse of it 
none	none	Could you tell if she were pretty or whether she was a blonde or brunette 
6081_41997_000027_000000	train-clean-100	So many questions at a time confused the driver 
6081_41997_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 Stop a minute he replied 
6081_41997_000027_000002	train-clean-100	 In my opinion she wasn t pretty and I don t believe she was young but she certainly was a blonde and with plenty of hair too 
6081_41997_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Was she tall or short stout or slender 
6081_41997_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Between the two 
none	none	This was very vague And the other asked Lecoq the neatly dressed one The deuce As for her I did not notice her at all all I know about her is that she was very small
6081_41997_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Would you recognize her if you met her again 
none	none	Good heavens no The vehicle was now rolling along the Rue de Bourgogne 
6081_41997_000034_000001	train-clean-100	Half way down the street the driver pulled up and turning to Lecoq exclaimed Here we are 
6081_41997_000034_000002	train-clean-100	That s the house the hussies went into 
6081_41997_000035_000000	train-clean-100	To draw off the silk handkerchief that served him as a muffler to fold it and slip it into his pocket to spring to the ground and enter the house indicated was only the work of an instant for the young detective 
none	none	In the concierge s little room he found an old woman knitting Lecoq bowed to her politely and displaying the silk handkerchief exclaimed Madame I have come to return this article to one of your lodgers
6081_41997_000037_000000	train-clean-100	 To which one 
6081_41997_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Really I don t exactly know 
6081_41997_000039_000000	train-clean-100	In a moment the worthy dame imagined that this polite young man was making fun of her 
6081_41997_000039_000001	train-clean-100	 You scamp she began 
none	none	Excuse me interrupted Lecoq allow me to finish 
6081_41997_000040_000001	train-clean-100	I must tell you that at about three o clock in the morning of the day before yesterday I was quietly returning home when two ladies who were seemingly in a great hurry overtook me and passed on 
6081_41997_000040_000002	train-clean-100	One of them dropped this handkerchief which I picked up 
none	none	I hastened after her to restore it but before I could overtake them they had rung the bell at your door and were already in the house I did not like to ring at such an unearthly hour for fear of disturbing you Yesterday I was so busy I couldn t come however here I am at last and here s the handkerchief So saying Lecoq laid the handkerchief on the table and turned as if to go when the concierge detained him
6081_41997_000041_000000	train-clean-100	 Many thanks for your kindness said she but you can keep it 
6081_41997_000041_000001	train-clean-100	We have no ladies in this house who are in the habit of coming home alone after midnight 
none	none	Still I have eyes insisted Lecoq and I certainly saw Ah 
6081_41997_000043_000001	train-clean-100	I had forgotten exclaimed the old woman 
none	none	The night you speak of some one certainly did ring the bell here 
6081_41997_000043_000003	train-clean-100	I pulled the string that opens the door and listened but not hearing any one close the door or come upstairs I said to myself Some mischievous fellow has been playing a trick on me I slipped on my dress and went out into the hall where I saw two women hastening toward the door 
6081_41997_000043_000004	train-clean-100	Before I could reach them they slammed the door in my face 
6081_41997_000043_000005	train-clean-100	I opened it again as quickly as I could and looked out into the street 
6081_41997_000043_000006	train-clean-100	But they were hurrying away as fast as they could 
6081_41997_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 In what direction 
none	none	Oh they were running toward the Rue de Varennes Lecoq was baffled again however he bowed civilly to the concierge whom he might possibly have need of at another time and then went back to the cab
6081_41997_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 As I had supposed they do not live here he remarked to the driver 
none	none	The latter shrugged his shoulders in evident vexation which would inevitably have vent in a torrent of words if Lecoq who had consulted his watch had not forestalled the outburst by saying Nine o clock I am an hour behind time already still I shall have some news to tell Now take me to the Morgue as quickly as possible 
6081_41998_000001_000000	train-clean-100	When a mysterious crime has been perpetrated or a great catastrophe has happened and the identity of the victims has not been established a great day invariably follows at the Morgue 
6081_41998_000001_000001	train-clean-100	The attendants are so accustomed to the horrors of the place that the most sickly sight fails to impress them and even under the most distressing circumstances they hasten gaily to and fro exchanging jests well calculated to make an ordinary mortal s flesh creep 
6081_41998_000001_000002	train-clean-100	As a rule they are far less interested in the corpses laid out for public view on the marble slabs in the principal hall than in the people of every age and station in life who congregate here all day long at times coming in search of some lost relative or friend but far more frequently impelled by idle curiosity 
none	none	As the vehicle conveying Lecoq reached the quay the young detective perceived that a large excited crowd was gathered outside the building The newspapers had reported the tragedy at the Widow Chupin s drinking den of course more or less correctly and everybody wished to see the victims On drawing near the Pont Notre Dame Lecoq told the driver to pull up I prefer to alight here rather than in front of the Morgue he said springing to the ground 
6081_41998_000003_000001	train-clean-100	Then producing first his watch and next his purse he added We have been an hour and forty minutes my good fellow consequently I owe you 
6081_41998_000004_000000	train-clean-100	 Nothing at all replied the driver decidedly 
none	none	But No not a sou I am too worried already to think that I took the money these hussies offered me 
6081_41998_000006_000002	train-clean-100	It would only have served me right if the liquor I bought with it had given me the gripes 
6081_41998_000006_000003	train-clean-100	Don t be uneasy about the score and if you need a trap use mine for nothing till you have caught the jades As Lecoq s purse was low he did not insist 
6081_41998_000006_000004	train-clean-100	 You will at least take my name and address continued the driver 
none	none	Certainly The magistrate will want your evidence and a summons will be sent you All right then Address it to Papillon Eugene driver care of M Trigault 
6081_41998_000008_000002	train-clean-100	I lodge at his place because I have some small interest in the business you see 
6081_41998_000009_000000	train-clean-100	The young detective was hastening away when Papillon called him back When you leave the Morgue you will want to go somewhere else he said you told me that you had another appointment and that you were already late 
none	none	Yes I ought to be at the Palais de Justice but it is only a few steps from here No matter 
6081_41998_000011_000001	train-clean-100	I will wait for you at the corner of the bridge 
none	none	It s useless to say no I ve made up my mind and I m a Breton you know I want you to ride out the thirty francs that those jades paid me 
6081_41998_000012_000000	train-clean-100	It would have been cruel to refuse such a request 
none	none	Accordingly Lecoq made a gesture of assent and then hurried toward the Morgue 
6081_41998_000013_000000	train-clean-100	If there was a crowd on the roadway outside it was because the gloomy building itself was crammed full of people 
none	none	Indeed the sightseers most of whom could see nothing at all were packed as closely as sardines and it was only by dint of well nigh superhuman efforts that Lecoq managed to effect an entrance 
6081_41998_000013_000002	train-clean-100	As usual he found among the mob a large number of girls and women for strange to say the Parisian fair sex is rather partial to the disgusting sights and horrible emotions that repay a visit to the Morgue 
6081_41998_000014_000000	train-clean-100	The shop and work girls who reside in the neighborhood readily go out of their way to catch a glimpse of the corpses which crime accident and suicide bring to this horrible place 
6081_41998_000014_000001	train-clean-100	A few the more sensitive among them may come no further than the door but the others enter and after a long stare return and recount their impressions to their less courageous companions 
none	none	If there should be no corpse exhibited if all the marble slabs are unoccupied strange as it may seem the visitors turn hastily away with an expression of disappointment or discontent 
6081_41998_000015_000001	train-clean-100	There was no fear of their doing so however on the morrow of the tragedy at Poivriere for the mysterious murderer whose identity Lecoq was trying to establish had furnished three victims for their delectation 
none	none	Panting with curiosity they paid but little attention to the unhealthy atmosphere and yet a damp chill came from beyond the iron railings while from the crowd itself rose an infectious vapor impregnated with the stench of the chloride of lime used as a disinfectant As a continuous accompaniment to the exclamations sighs and whispered comments of the bystanders came the murmur of the water trickling from a spigot at the head of each slab a tiny stream that flowed forth only to fall in fine spray upon the marble 
6081_41998_000016_000001	train-clean-100	Through the small arched windows a gray light stole in on the exposed bodies bringing each muscle into bold relief revealing the ghastly tints of the lifeless flesh and imparting a sinister aspect to the tattered clothing hung around the room to aid in the identification of the corpses 
6081_41998_000016_000002	train-clean-100	This clothing after a certain time is sold for nothing is wasted at the Morgue 
6081_41998_000017_000000	train-clean-100	However Lecoq was too occupied with his own thoughts to remark the horrors of the scene 
none	none	He scarcely bestowed a glance on the three victims He was looking for Father Absinthe whom he could not perceive Had Gevrol intentionally or unintentionally failed to fulfil his promise or had Father Absinthe forgotten his duty in his morning dram Unable to explain the cause of his comrade s absence Lecoq addressed himself to the head keeper It would seem that no one has recognized the victims he remarked No one 
6081_41998_000019_000001	train-clean-100	And yet ever since opening we have had an immense crowd 
6081_41998_000019_000002	train-clean-100	If I were master here on days like this I would charge an admission fee of two sous a head with half price for children 
6081_41998_000019_000003	train-clean-100	It would bring in a round sum more than enough to cover the expenses 
none	none	The keeper s reply seemed to offer an inducement to conversation but Lecoq did not seize it
6081_41998_000020_000001	train-clean-100	 Excuse me he interrupted didn t a detective come here this morning 
6081_41998_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes there was one here 
none	none	Has he gone away then 
6081_41998_000022_000001	train-clean-100	I don t see him anywhere 
6081_41998_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The keeper glanced suspiciously at his eager questioner but after a moment s hesitation he ventured to inquire Are you one of them 
none	none	Yes I am replied Lecoq exhibiting his card in support of his assertion And your name Is Lecoq 
6081_41998_000027_000000	train-clean-100	The keeper s face brightened up 
6081_41998_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 In that case said he I have a letter for you written by your comrade who was obliged to go away Here it is 
none	none	The young detective at once tore open the envelope and read Monsieur Lecoq Monsieur 
6081_41998_000029_000001	train-clean-100	This simple formula of politeness brought a faint smile to his lips 
none	none	Was it not on Father Absinthe s part an evident recognition of his colleague s superiority 
6081_41998_000029_000003	train-clean-100	Indeed our hero accepted it as a token of unquestioning devotion which it would be his duty to repay with a master s kind protection toward his first disciple 
6081_41998_000029_000004	train-clean-100	However he had no time to waste in thought and accordingly at once proceeded to peruse the note which ran as follows 
none	none	Monsieur Lecoq I had been standing on duty since the opening of the Morgue when at about nine o clock three young men entered arm in arm From their manner and appearance I judged them to be clerks in some store or warehouse 
6081_41998_000030_000001	train-clean-100	Suddenly I noticed that one of them turned as white as his shirt and calling the attention of his companions to one of the unknown victims he whispered Gustave 
6081_41998_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 His comrades put their hands over his mouth and one of them exclaimed What are you about you fool to mix yourself up with this affair 
6081_41998_000031_000001	train-clean-100	Do you want to get us into trouble 
6081_41998_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Thereupon they went out and I followed them 
6081_41998_000032_000001	train-clean-100	But the person who had first spoken was so overcome that he could scarcely drag himself along and his companions were obliged to take him to a little restaurant close by 
6081_41998_000032_000002	train-clean-100	I entered it myself and it is there I write this letter in the mean time watching them out of the corner of my eye 
none	none	I send this note explaining my absence to the head keeper who will give it you You will understand that I am going to follow these men 
6081_41998_000032_000005	train-clean-100	A B S 
none	none	The handwriting of this letter was almost illegible and there were mistakes in spelling in well nigh every line still its meaning was clear and exact and could not fail to excite the most flattering hopes Lecoq s face was so radiant when he returned to the cab that as the old coachman urged on his horse he could not refrain from saying Things are going on to suit you 
6081_41998_000035_000000	train-clean-100	A friendly hush was the only response 
none	none	It required all Lecoq s attention to classify this new information When he alighted from the cab in front of the Palais de Justice he experienced considerable difficulty in dismissing the old cabman who insisted upon remaining at his orders He succeeded at last however but even when he had reached the portico on the left side of the building the worthy fellow standing up still shouted at the top of his voice At M Trigault s house don t forget Father Papillon No nine hundred ninety eight one thousand less two Lecoq had entered the left wing of the Palais He climbed the stairs till he had reached the third floor and was about to enter the long narrow badly lighted corridor known as the Galerie de l Instruction when finding a doorkeeper installed behind a heavy oaken desk he remarked M 
6081_41998_000036_000002	train-clean-100	d Escorval is of course in his office 
6081_41998_000037_000000	train-clean-100	The man shook his head 
none	none	No said he M d Escorval is not here this morning and he won t be here for several weeks
6081_41998_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Why not 
none	none	What do you mean
6081_41998_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Last night as he was alighting from his carriage at his own door he had a most unfortunate fall and broke his leg 
none	none	IX Some men are wealthy They own a carriage drawn by a pair of high stepping horses and driven by a coachman in stylish livery and as they pass by leaning back on comfortable cushions they become the object of many an envious glance Sometimes however the coachman has taken a drop too much and upsets the carriage perhaps the horses run away and a general smash ensues or maybe the hitherto fortunate owner in a moment of absent mindedness misses the step and fractures his leg on the curbstone Such accidents occur every day and their long list should make humble foot passengers bless the lowly lot which preserves them from such peril On learning the misfortune that had befallen M d Escorval Lecoq s face wore such an expression of consternation that the doorkeeper could not help laughing What is there so very extraordinary about that I ve told you he asked I oh nothing The detective did not speak the truth The fact is he had just been struck by the strange coincidence of two events the supposed murderer s attempted suicide and the magistrate s fall Still he did not allow the vague presentiment that flitted through his mind to assume any definite form For after all what possible connection could there be between the two occurrences Then again he never allowed himself to be governed by prejudice nor had he as yet enriched his formulary with an axiom he afterward professed Distrust all circumstances that seem to favor your secret wishes Of course Lecoq did not rejoice at M d Escorval s accident could he have prevented it he would have gladly done so Still he could not help saying to himself that this stroke of misfortune would free him from all further connection with a man whose superciliousness and disdain had been painfully disagreeable to his feelings This thought caused a sensation of relief almost one of light heartedness In that case said the young detective to the doorkeeper I shall have nothing to do here this morning You must be joking was the reply Does the world stop moving because one man is disabled The news only arrived an hour ago but all the urgent business that M d Escorval had in charge has already been divided among the other magistrates I came here about that terrible affair that occurred the other night just beyond the Barriere de Fontainebleau Eh Why didn t you say so at once A messenger has been sent to the prefecture after you already M Segmuller has charge of the case and he s waiting for you Doubt and perplexity were plainly written on Lecoq s forehead He was trying to remember the magistrate that bore this name and wondered whether he was a likely man to espouse his views Yes resumed the doorkeeper who seemed to be in a talkative mood M Segmuller you don t seem to know him He is a worthy man not quite so grim as most of our gentlemen A prisoner he had examined said one day That devil there has pumped me so well that I shall certainly have my head chopped off but nevertheless he s a good fellow His heart somewhat lightened by these favorable reports Lecoq went and tapped at a door that was indicated to him and which bore the number twenty two Come in called out a pleasant voice The young detective entered and found himself face to face with a man of some forty years of age tall and rather corpulent who at once exclaimed Ah you are Lecoq Very well take a seat I am busy just now looking over the papers of the case but I will attend to you in five minutes Lecoq obeyed at the same time glancing furtively at the magistrate with whom he was about to work M Segmuller s appearance corresponded perfectly with the description given by the doorkeeper His plump face wore an air of frankness and benevolence and his blue eyes had a most pleasant expression Nevertheless Lecoq distrusted these appearances and in so doing he was right Born near Strasbourg M Segmuller possessed that candid physiognomy common to most of the natives of blonde Alsace a deceitful mask which behind seeming simplicity not unfrequently conceals a Gascon cunning rendered all the more dangerous since it is allied with extreme caution He had a wonderfully alert penetrating mind but his system every magistrate has his own was mainly good humor Unlike most of his colleagues who were as stiff and cutting in manner as the sword which the statue of Justice usually holds in her hand he made simplicity and kindness of demeanor his leading trait though of course without ever losing sight of his magisterial duties Still the tone of his voice was so paternal and the subtle purport of his questions so veiled by his seeming frankness that most of those whom he examined forgot the necessity of protecting themselves and unawares confessed their guilt Thus it frequently happened that while some unsuspecting culprit was complacently congratulating himself upon getting the best of the judge the poor wretch was really being turned inside out like a glove By the side of such a man as M Segmuller a grave and slender clerk would have excited distrust so he had chosen one who was a caricature of himself This clerk s name was Goguet He was short but corpulent and his broad beardless face habitually wore a silly smile not out of keeping with his intellect which was none of the brightest As stated above when Lecoq entered M Segmuller s room the latter was busy studying the case which had so unexpectedly fallen into his hands All the articles which the young detective had collected from the flakes of wool to the diamond earring were spread out upon the magistrate s desk With the greatest attention he perused the report prepared by Lecoq and according to the different phases of the affair he examined one or another of the objects before him or else consulted the plan of the ground A good half hour elapsed before he had completed his inspection when he threw himself back in his armchair Monsieur Lecoq he said slowly Monsieur d Escorval has informed me by a note on the margin of this file of papers that you are an intelligent man and that we can trust you I am willing at all events You speak too slightingly of yourself this is the first time that an agent has brought me a report as complete as yours You are young and if you persevere I think you will be able to accomplish great things in your profession Nervous with delight Lecoq bowed and stammered his thanks Your opinion in this matter coincides with mine continued M Segmuller and the public prosecutor informs me that M d Escorval shares the same views An enigma is before us and it ought to be solved Oh we ll solve it I am certain sir exclaimed Lecoq who at this moment felt capable of the most extraordinary achievements Indeed he would have gone through fire and water for the magistrate who had received him so kindly and his enthusiasm sparkled so plainly in his eyes that M Segmuller could not restrain a smile I have strong hopes of it myself he responded but we are far from the end Now what have you been doing since yesterday Did M d Escorval give you any orders Have you obtained any fresh information I don t think I have wasted my time replied Lecoq who at once proceeded to relate the various facts that had come to his knowledge since his departure from the Poivriere With rare precision and that happiness of expression which seldom fails a man well acquainted with his subject he recounted the daring feats of the presumed accomplice the points he had noted in the supposed murderer s conduct the latter s unsuccessful attempt at self destruction He repeated the testimony given by the cab driver and by the concierge in the Rue de Bourgogne and then read the letter he had received from Father Absinthe In conclusion he placed on the magistrate s desk some of the dirt he had scraped from the prisoner s feet at the same time depositing beside it a similar parcel of dust collected on the floor of the cell in which the murderer was confined at the Barriere d Italie When Lecoq had explained the reasons that had led him to collect this soil and the conclusions that might be drawn from a comparison of the two parcels M Segmuller who had been listening attentively at once exclaimed You are right It may be that you have discovered a means to confound all the prisoner s denials At all events this is certainly a proof of surprising sagacity on your part So it must have been for Goguet the clerk nodded approvingly Capital he murmured I should never have thought of that While he was talking M Segmuller had carefully placed all the so called articles of conviction in a large drawer from which they would not emerge until the trial Now said he I understand the case well enough to examine the Widow Chupin We may gain some information from her He was laying his hand upon the bell when Lecoq stopped him with an almost supplicating gesture I have one great favor to ask you sir he observed What is it speak I should very much like to be present at this examination It takes so little sometimes to awaken a happy inspiration Although the law says that the accused shall first of all be privately examined by the investigating magistrate assisted by his clerk it also allows the presence of police agents Accordingly M Segmuller told Lecoq that he might remain At the same time he rang his bell which was speedily answered by a messenger Has the Widow Chupin been brought here in compliance with my orders asked M Segmuller Yes sir she is in the gallery outside Let her come in then An instant later the hostess of the Poivriere entered the room bowing to the right and to the left This was not her first appearance before a magistrate and she was not ignorant of the respect that is due to justice Accordingly she had arrayed herself for her examination with the utmost care She had arranged her rebellious gray locks in smooth bandeaux and her garments although of common material looked positively neat She had even persuaded one of the prison warders to buy her with the money she had about her at the time of her arrest a black crape cap and a couple of white pocket handkerchiefs intending to deluge the latter with her tears should the situation call for a pathetic display She was indeed far too knowing to rely solely on the mere artifices of dress hence she had also drawn upon her repertoire of grimaces for an innocent sad and yet resigned expression well fitted in her opinion to win the sympathy and indulgence of the magistrate upon whom her fate would depend Thus disguised with downcast eyes and honeyed voice she looked so unlike the terrible termagant of the Poivriere that her customers would scarcely have recognized her Indeed an honest old bachelor might have offered her twenty francs a month to take charge of his chambers solely on the strength of her good looks But M Segmuller had unmasked so many hypocrites that he was not deceived for a moment What an old actress he muttered to himself and glancing at Lecoq he perceived the same thought sparkling in the young detective s eyes It is true that the magistrate s penetration may have been due to some notes he had just perused notes containing an abstract of the woman s former life and furnished by the chief of police at the magistrate s request With a gesture of authority M Segmuller warned Goguet the clerk with the silly smile to get his writing materials ready He then turned toward the Widow Chupin Your name he asked in a sharp tone Aspasie Claperdty my maiden name replied the old woman and to day the Widow Chupin at your service sir so saying she made a low courtesy and then added A lawful widow you understand sir I have my marriage papers safe in my chest at home and if you wish to send any one Your age interrupted the magistrate Fifty four Your profession Dealer in wines and spirits outside of Paris near the Rue du Chateau des Rentiers just beyond the fortifications A prisoner s examination always begins with these questions as to individuality which gives both the magistrate and the culprit time to study each other to try as it were each other s strength before joining in a serious struggle just as two duelists about to engage in mortal combat first try a few passes with the foils Now resumed M Segmuller we will note your antecedents Have you not already been found guilty of several offenses The Widow Chupin was too well versed in criminal procedure to be ignorant of those famous records which render the denial of identity such a difficult matter in France I have been unfortunate my good judge she whined Yes several times First of all you were arrested on a charge of receiving stolen goods But it was proved that I was innocent that my character was whiter than snow My poor dear husband had been deceived by his comrades that was all Possibly But while your husband was undergoing his sentence you were condemned first to one month s and then to three months imprisonment for stealing Oh I had some enemies who did their best to ruin me Next you were imprisoned for having led some young girls astray They were good for nothing hussies my kind sir heartless unprincipled creatures I did them many favors and then they went and related a batch of falsehoods to ruin me I have always been too kind and considerate toward others The list of the woman s offenses was not exhausted but M Segmuller thought it useless to continue Such is your past he resumed At the present time your wine shop is the resort of rogues and criminals Your son is undergoing his fourth term of imprisonment and it has been clearly proved that you abetted and assisted him in his evil deeds Your daughter in law by some miracle has remained honest and industrious hence you have tormented and abused her to such an extent that the authorities have been obliged to interfere When she left your house you tried to keep her child no doubt meaning to bring it up after the same fashion as its father This thought the Widow Chupin is the right moment to try and soften the magistrate s heart Accordingly she drew one of her new handkerchiefs from her pocket and by dint of rubbing her eyes endeavored to extract a tear Oh unhappy me she groaned How can any one imagine that I would harm my grandson my poor little Toto Why I should be worse than a wild beast to try and bring my own flesh and blood to perdition She soon perceived however that her lamentations did not much affect M Segmuller hence suddenly changing both her tone and manner she began her justification She did not positively deny her past but she threw all the blame on the injustice of destiny which while favoring a few generally the less deserving showed no mercy to others Alas she was one of those who had had no luck in life having always been persecuted despite her innocence In this last affair for instance how was she to blame A triple murder had stained her shop with blood but the most respectable establishments are not exempt from similar catastrophes During her solitary confinement she had said she dived down into the deepest recesses of her conscience and she was still unable to discover what blame could justly be laid at her door I can tell you interrupted the magistrate You are accused of impeding the action of the law Good heavens Is it possible And of seeking to defeat justice This is equivalent to complicity Widow Chupin take care When the police entered your cabin after this crime had been committed you refused to answer their questions I told them all that I knew Very well then you must repeat what you told them to me M Segmuller had reason to feel satisfied He had conducted the examination in such a way that the Widow Chupin would now have to initiate a narrative of the tragedy This excellent point gained for this shrewd old woman possessed of all her coolness would naturally have been on her guard against any direct questions Now it was essential that she should not suspect either what the magistrate knew of the affair or what he was ignorant of By leaving her to her own devices she might in the course of the version which she proposed to substitute for the truth not merely strengthen Lecoq s theories but also let fall some remark calculated to facilitate the task of future investigation Both M Segmuller and Lecoq were of opinion that the version of the crime which they were about to hear had been concocted at the station house of the Place d Italie while the murderer and the spurious drunkard were left together and that it had been transmitted by the accomplice to the widow during the brief conversation they were allowed to have through the wicket of the latter s cell Invited by the magistrate to recount the circumstances of the tragedy Mother Chupin did not hesitate for a moment Oh it was a very simple affair my good sir she began I was sitting by my fireside on Sunday evening when suddenly the door opened and three men and two women came in M Segmuller and the young detective exchanged glances The accomplice had evidently seen Lecoq and his comrade examining the footprints and accordingly the presence of the two women was not to be denied What time was this asked the magistrate About eleven o clock Go on As soon as they sat down they ordered a bowl of wine a la Frangaise Without boasting I may say that I haven t an equal in preparing that drink Of course I waited on them and afterward having a blouse to mend for my boy I went upstairs to my room which is just over the shop Leaving the people alone Yes my judge That showed a great deal of confidence on your part The widow sadly shook her head People as poor as I am don t fear the thieves she sighed Go on go on Well I had been upstairs about half an hour when I heard some one below call out Eh old woman So I went down and found a tall big bearded man who had just come in He asked for a glass of brandy which I brought to a table where he had sat down by himself And then did you go upstairs again interrupted the magistrate The exclamation was ironical of course but no one could have told from the Widow Chupin s placid countenance whether she was aware that such was the case Precisely my good sir she replied in the most composed manner Only this time I had scarcely taken up my needle when I heard a terrible uproar in the shop I hurried downstairs to put a stop to it but heaven knows my interference would have been of little use The three men who had come in first of all had fallen upon the newcomer and they were beating him my good sir they were killing him I screamed Just then the man who had come in alone drew a revolver from his pocket he fired and killed one of his assailants who fell to the ground I was so frightened that I crouched on the staircase and threw my apron over my head that I might not see the blood run An instant later Monsieur Gevrol arrived with his men they forced open the door and behold The Widow Chupin here stopped short These wretched old women who have trafficked in every sort of vice and who have tasted every disgrace at times attain a perfection of hypocrisy calculated to deceive the most subtle penetration Any one unacquainted with the antecedents of the landlady of the Poivriere would certainly have been impressed by her apparent candor so skillfully did she affect a display of frankness surprise and fear Her expression would have been simply perfect had it not been for her eyes her small gray eyes as restless as those of a caged animal and gleaming at intervals with craftiness and cunning There she stood mentally rejoicing at the success of her narrative for she was convinced that the magistrate placed implicit confidence in her revelations although during her recital delivered by the way with conjurer like volubility not a muscle of M Segmuller s face had betrayed what was passing in his mind When she paused out of breath he rose from his seat and without a word approached his clerk to inspect the notes taken during the earlier part of the examination From the corner where he was quietly seated Lecoq did not cease watching the prisoner She thinks that it s all over he muttered to himself she fancies that her deposition is accepted without question If such were indeed the widow s opinion she was soon to be undeceived for after addressing a few low spoken words to the smiling Goguet M Segmuller took a seat near the fireplace convinced that the moment had now come to abandon defensive tactics and open fire on the enemy s position So Widow Chupin he began you tell us that you didn t remain for a single moment with the people who came into your shop that evening Not a moment They came in and ordered what they wanted you waited on them and then left them to themselves Yes my good sir It seems to me impossible that you didn t overhear some words of their conversation What were they talking about I am not in the habit of playing spy over my customers Didn t you hear anything Nothing at all The magistrate shrugged his shoulders with an air of commiseration In other words he remarked you refuse to inform justice Oh my good sir Allow me to finish All these improbable stories about leaving the shop and mending your son s clothes in your bedroom are so many inventions You have concocted them so as to be able to say to me I didn t see anything I didn t hear anything If such is your system of defense I warn you that it will be impossible for you to maintain it and I may add that it would not be admitted by any tribunal It is not a system of defense it is the truth M Segmuller seemed to reflect for a moment then suddenly he exclaimed Then you have nothing to tell me about this miserable assassin But he is not an assassin my good sir What do you mean by such an assertion I mean that he only killed the others in protecting himself They picked a quarrel with him he was alone against three and saw very plainly that he could expect no mercy from brigands who The color rose to the Widow Chupin s cheeks and she suddenly checked herself greatly embarrassed and evidently regretting that she had not bridled her tongue It is true she might reasonably hope that the magistrate had imperfectly heard her words and had failed to seize their full purport for two or three red hot coals having fallen from the grate on the hearth he had taken up the tongs and seemed to be engrossed in the task of artistically arranging the fire Who can tell me who can prove to me that on the contrary it was not this man who first attacked the others he murmured thoughtfully I can stoutly declared the widow already forgetful of her prudent hesitation I can swear it M Segmuller looked up intense astonishment written upon his face How can you know that he said slowly How can you swear it You were in your bedroom when the quarrel began Silent and motionless in his corner Lecoq was inwardly jubilant This was a most happy result he thought but a few questions more and the old woman would be obliged to contradict herself What she had already said sufficed to show that she must have a secret interest in the matter or else she would never have been so imprudently earnest in defending the prisoner However you have probably been led to this conclusion by your knowledge of the murderer s character remarked M Segmuller you are apparently well acquainted with him Oh I had never set eyes on him before that evening But he must have been in your establishment before Never in his life Oh oh Then how do you explain that on entering the shop while you were upstairs this unknown person this stranger should have called out Here old woman Did he merely guess that the establishment was kept by a woman and that this woman was no longer young He did not say that Reflect a moment you yourself just told me so Oh I didn t say that I m sure my good sir Yes you did and I will prove it by having your evidence read Goguet read the passage if you please The smiling clerk looked back through his minutes and then in his clearest voice he read these words taken down as they fell from the Widow Chupin s lips I had been upstairs about half an hour when I heard some one below call out Eh old woman So I went down et cetera et cetera Are you convinced asked M Segmuller The old offender s assurance was sensibly diminished by this proof of her prevarication However instead of discussing the subject any further the magistrate glided over it as if he did not attach much importance to the incident And the other men he resumed those who were killed did you know them No good sir no more than I knew Adam and Eve And were you not surprised to see three men utterly unknown to you and accompanied by two women enter your establishment Sometimes chance Come you do not think of what you are saying It was not chance that brought these customers in the middle of the night to a wine shop with a reputation like yours an establishment situated far from any frequented route in the midst of a desolate waste I m not a sorceress I say what I think Then you did not even know the youngest of the victims the man who was attired as a soldier he who was named Gustave Not at all M Segmuller noted the intonation of this response and then slowly added But you must have heard of one of Gustave s friends a man called Lacheneur On hearing this name the landlady of the Poivriere became visibly embarrassed and it was in an altered voice that she stammered Lacheneur Lacheneur no I have never heard that name mentioned Still despite her denial the effect of M Segmuller s remark was evident and Lecoq secretly vowed that he would find this Lacheneur at any cost Did not the articles of conviction comprise a letter sent by this man to Gustave and written so Lecoq had reason to believe in a cafe on the Boulevard Beaumarchais With such a clue and a little patience the mysterious Lacheneur might yet be discovered Now continued M Segmuller let us speak of the women who accompanied these unfortunate men What sort of women were they Oh women of no account whatever Were they well dressed On the contrary very miserably Well give me a description of them They were tall and powerfully built and indeed as it was Shrove Sunday I first of all took them for men in disguise They had hands like shoulders of mutton gruff voices and very black hair They were as dark as mulattoes Enough interrupted the magistrate I require no further proof of your mendacity These women were short and one of them was remarkably fair I swear to you my good sir Do not declare it upon oath I shall be forced to confront you with an honest man who will tell you to your face that you are a liar The widow did not reply and there was a moment s silence M Segmuller determined to deal a decisive blow Do you also affirm that you had nothing of a compromising character in the pocket of your apron he asked Nothing you may have it examined it was left in the house Then you still persist in your system resumed M Segmuller Believe me you are wrong Reflect it rests with you to go to the Assize Court as a witness or an accomplice Although the widow seemed crushed by this unexpected blow the magistrate did not add another word Her deposition was read over to her she signed it and was then led away M Segmuller immediately seated himself at his desk filled up a blank form and handed it to his clerk saying This is an order for the governor of the Depot Tell him to send the supposed murderer here at once X If it is difficult to extort a confession from a man interested in preserving silence 
5979-42000-0000	train-other-500	and persuaded that no proofs can be produced against him it is a yet more arduous task to make a woman similarly situated speak the truth As they say at the Palais de Justice
5979-42000-0001	train-other-500	one might as well try to make the devil confess
none	none	 The examination of the Widow Chupin had been conducted with the greatest possible care by M Segmuller 
5979-42000-0002	train-other-500	who was as skilful in managing his questions as a tried general in maneuvering his troops
none	none	 However all that he had discovered was that the landlady of the Poivriere 
5979-42000-0003	train-other-500	was conniving with the murderer The motive of her connivance was yet unknown
none	none	 and the murderer s identity still a mystery Both M Segmuller and Lecoq were nevertheless of the opinion 
5979-42000-0004	train-other-500	that the old hag knew everything It is almost certain remarked the magistrate that she was acquainted with the people who came to her house with the women the victims the murderer with all of them in fact
none	none	 I am positive as regards that fellow Gustave 
5979-42000-0005	train-other-500	I read it in her eyes
none	none	 I am also convinced that she knows Lacheneur the man upon whom the dying soldier breathed vengeance 
5979-42000-0006	train-other-500	the mysterious personage who evidently possesses the key to the enigma That man must be found
none	none	 Ah replied Lecoq and I will find him even if I have to question every one of the eleven hundred thousand men who constantly walk the streets of Paris This was promising so much that the magistrate despite his preoccupation could not repress a smile If this old woman would only decide to make a clean breast of it at her next examination 
5979-42000-0007	train-other-500	remarked Lecoq Yes But she won t The young detective shook his head despondently Such was his own opinion He did not delude himself with false hopes
5979-42000-0008	train-other-500	and he had noticed between the Widow Chupin s eyebrows those furrows which according to physiognomists indicate a senseless brutish obstinacy Women never confess resumed the magistrate
5979-42000-0009	train-other-500	and even when they seemingly resign themselves to such a course they are not sincere They fancy they have discovered some means of misleading their examiner On the contrary
5979-42000-0010	train-other-500	evidence will crush the most obstinate man he gives up the struggle and confesses Now a woman scoffs at evidence Show her the sun tell her it s daytime at once she will close her eyes and say to you
5979-42000-0011	train-other-500	No it s night Male prisoners plan and combine different systems of defense according to their social positions
5979-42000-0012	train-other-500	the women on the contrary have but one system no matter what may be their condition in life They deny everything persist in their denials even when the proof against them is overwhelming and then they cry
5979-42000-0013	train-other-500	When I worry the Chupin with disagreeable questions at her next examination you may be sure she will turn her eyes into a fountain of tears
none	none	 In his impatience M Segmuller angrily stamped his foot 
5979-42000-0014	train-other-500	He had many weapons in his arsenal but none strong enough to break a woman s dogged resistance If I only understood the motive that guides this old hag he continued But not a clue
5979-42000-0015	train-other-500	Who can tell me what powerful interest induces her to remain silent
none	none	 Is it her own cause that she is defending Is she an accomplice Is it certain that she did not aid the murderer in planning an ambuscade Yes responded Lecoq slowly 
5979-42000-0016	train-other-500	yes this supposition very naturally presents itself to the mind
none	none	 But think a moment sir such a theory would prove that the idea we entertained a short time since is altogether false 
5979-42000-0017	train-other-500	If the Widow Chupin is an accomplice the murderer is not the person we have supposed him to be he is simply the man he seems to be
none	none	 This argument apparently convinced M Segmuller 
5979-42000-0018	train-other-500	What is your opinion he asked The young detective had formed his opinion a long while ago But how could he a humble police agent venture to express any decided views when the magistrate hesitated
5979-42000-0019	train-other-500	He understood well enough that his position necessitated extreme reserve hence it was in the most modest tone that he replied Might not the pretended drunkard have dazzled Mother Chupin s eyes with the prospect of a brilliant reward
5979-42000-0020	train-other-500	Might he not have promised her a considerable sum of money
none	none	 He paused Goguet 
5979-42000-0021	train-other-500	the smiling clerk had just returned Behind him stood a private of the Garde de Paris who remained respectfully on the threshold his heels in a straight line his right hand raised to the peak of his shako
5979-42000-0022	train-other-500	and his elbow on a level with his eyes in accordance with the regulations The governor of the Depot said the soldier sends me to inquire if he is to keep the Widow Chupin in solitary confinement she complains bitterly about it
none	none	 M Segmuller reflected for a moment 
5979-42000-0023	train-other-500	Certainly he murmured as if replying to an objection made by his own conscience certainly it is an undoubted aggravation of suffering
5979-42000-0024	train-other-500	but if I allow this woman to associate with the other prisoners she will certainly find some opportunity to communicate with parties outside
none	none	 This must not be 
5979-42000-0025	train-other-500	the interests of justice and truth must be considered first The thought embodied in these last words decided him Despite her complaints the prisoner must be kept in solitary confinement until further orders he said
5979-42000-0026	train-other-500	The soldier allowed his right hand to fall to his side
none	none	 he carried his right foot three inches behind his left heel and wheeled around Goguet the smiling clerk then closed the door and drawing a large envelope from his pocket handed it to the magistrate Here is a communication from the governor of the Depot said he The magistrate broke the seal and read aloud as follows I feel compelled to advise M Segmuller to take every precaution with the view of assuring his own safety 
5979-42000-0027	train-other-500	before proceeding with the examination of the prisoner May
none	none	 Since his unsuccessful attempt at suicide 
5979-42000-0028	train-other-500	this prisoner has been in such a state of excitement that we have been obliged to keep him in a strait waistcoat He did not close his eyes all last night
none	none	 and the guards who watched him expected every moment that he would become delirious However he did not utter a word When food was offered him this morning he resolutely rejected it and I should not be surprised if it were his intention to starve himself to death 
5979-42000-0029	train-other-500	I have rarely seen a more determined criminal I think him capable of any desperate act
none	none	 Ah exclaimed the clerk whose smile had disappeared 
5979-42000-0030	train-other-500	If I were in your place sir I would only let him in here with an escort of soldiers What
none	none	 you Goguet you an old clerk make such a proposition 
5979-42000-0031	train-other-500	Can it be that you re frightened Frightened No certainly not but Nonsense interrupted Lecoq in a tone that betrayed superlative confidence in his own muscles Am I not here
none	none	 If M Segmuller had seated himself at his desk that article of furniture would naturally have served as a rampart between the prisoner and himself For purposes of convenience he usually did place himself behind it but after Goguet s display of fear 
5979-42000-0032	train-other-500	he would have blushed to have taken the slightest measure of self protection Accordingly he went and sat down by the fireplace
none	none	 as he had done a few moments previously while questioning the Widow Chupin 
5979-42000-0033	train-other-500	and then ordered his door keeper to admit the prisoner alone He emphasized this word alone A moment later the door was flung open with a violent jerk and the prisoner entered
5979-42000-0034	train-other-500	or rather precipitated himself into the room
none	none	 Goguet 
5979-42000-0035	train-other-500	turned pale behind his table and Lecoq advanced a step forward ready to spring upon the prisoner and pinion him should it be requisite But when the latter reached the centre of the room he paused and looked around him
5979-42000-0036	train-other-500	Where is the magistrate he inquired in a hoarse voice
none	none	 I am the magistrate replied M Segmuller 
5979-42000-0037	train-other-500	No the other one What other one The one who came to question me last evening He has met with an accident Yesterday after leaving you he fell down and broke his leg Oh
5979-42000-0038	train-other-500	And I am to take his place The prisoner was apparently deaf to the explanation Excitement had seemingly given way to stupor His features hitherto contracted with anger now relaxed
5979-42000-0039	train-other-500	He grew pale and tottered as if about to fall Compose yourself said the magistrate in a benevolent tone if you are too weak to remain standing take a seat
none	none	 Already with a powerful effort 
5979-42000-0040	train-other-500	the man had recovered his self possession A momentary gleam flashed from his eyes Many thanks for your kindness he replied but this is nothing I felt a slight sensation of dizziness but it is over now
5979-42000-0041	train-other-500	Is it long since you have eaten anything I have eaten nothing since that man
none	none	 and so saying he pointed to Lecoq 
5979-42000-0042	train-other-500	brought me some bread and wine at the station house Wouldn t you like to take something
none	none	 No 
5979-42000-0043	train-other-500	and yet if you would be so kind I should like a glass of water Will you not have some wine with it I should prefer pure water His request was at once complied with
5979-42000-0044	train-other-500	He drained a first glassful at a single draft the glass was then replenished and he drank again this time however more slowly One might have supposed that he was drinking in life itself
none	none	 Certainly when he laid down the empty glass he seemed quite another man 
5979-42001-0000	train-other-500	Eighteen out of every twenty criminals who appear before our investigating magistrates come prepared with a more or less complete plan of defense which they have conceived during their preliminary confinement
5979-42001-0001	train-other-500	Innocent or guilty they have resolved on playing some part or other which they begin to act as soon as they cross the threshold of the room where the magistrate awaits them The moment they enter his presence
5979-42001-0002	train-other-500	the magistrate needs to bring all his powers of penetration into play for such a culprit s first attitude as surely betrays his plan of defense as an index reveals a book s contents
none	none	 In this case however M Segmuller did not think that appearances were deceitful 
5979-42001-0003	train-other-500	It seemed evident to him that the prisoner was not feigning
none	none	 but that the excited frenzy which marked his entrance 
5979-42001-0004	train-other-500	was as real as his after stupor At all events there seemed no fear of the danger the governor of the Depot had spoken of
none	none	 and accordingly M Segmuller seated himself at his desk 
5979-42001-0005	train-other-500	Here he felt stronger and more at ease for his back being turned to the window his face was half hidden in shadow and in case of need he could by bending over his papers conceal any sign of surprise or discomfiture
5979-42001-0006	train-other-500	The prisoner on the contrary stood in the full light and not a movement of his features not the fluttering of an eyelid could escape the magistrate s attention He seemed to have completely recovered from his indisposition
5979-42001-0007	train-other-500	and his features assumed an expression which indicated either careless indifference or complete resignation Do you feel better
none	none	 asked M Segmuller 
5979-42001-0008	train-other-500	I feel very well I hope continued the magistrate paternally that in future you will know how to moderate your excitement Yesterday you tried to destroy yourself
5979-42001-0009	train-other-500	It would have been another great crime added to many others a crime which With a hasty movement of the hand the prisoner interrupted him I have committed no crime said he
none	none	 in a rough but no longer threatening voice I was attacked and I defended myself Any one has a right to do that There were three men against me It was a great misfortune and I would give my right hand to repair it 
5979-42001-0010	train-other-500	but my conscience does not reproach me that much The prisoner s that much was a contemptuous snap of his finger and thumb And yet I ve been arrested and treated like an assassin he continued
5979-42001-0011	train-other-500	When I saw myself interred in that living tomb which you call a secret cell I grew afraid I lost my senses I said to myself My boy they ve buried you alive and it is better to die to die quickly if you don t wish to suffer
5979-42001-0012	train-other-500	So I tried to strangle myself My death wouldn t have caused the slightest sorrow to any one
none	none	 I have neither wife nor child depending upon me for support 
5979-42001-0013	train-other-500	However my attempt was frustrated I was bled and then placed in a strait waistcoat as if I were a madman Mad I really believed I should become so
5979-42001-0014	train-other-500	All night long the jailors sat around me like children amusing themselves by tormenting a chained animal They watched me talked about me and passed the candle to and fro before my eyes The prisoner talked forcibly but without any attempt at oratorical display
none	none	 there was bitterness but not anger in his tone in short he spoke with all the seeming sincerity of a man giving expression to some deep emotion or conviction As the magistrate and the detective heard him speak they were seized with the same idea 
5979-42001-0015	train-other-500	This man they thought is very clever it won t be easy to get the better of him
none	none	 Then after a moment s reflection M Segmuller added aloud 
5979-42001-0016	train-other-500	This explains your first act of despair but later on for instance even this morning you refused to eat the food that was offered you As the prisoner heard this remark his lowering face suddenly brightened
none	none	 he gave a comical wink and finally burst into a hearty laugh gay frank and sonorous That said he is quite another matter Certainly I refused all they offered me and now I will tell you why As I had my hands confined in the strait waistcoat the jailor tried to feed me just as a nurse tries to feed a baby with pap 
5979-42001-0017	train-other-500	Now I wasn t going to submit to that so I closed my lips as tightly as I could Then he tried to force my mouth open and push the spoon in just as one might force a sick dog s jaws apart and pour some medicine down its throat
5979-42001-0018	train-other-500	The deuce take his impertinence I tried to bite him that s the truth and if I had succeeded in getting his finger between my teeth it would have stayed there However
5979-42001-0019	train-other-500	because I wouldn t be fed like a baby all the prison officials raised their hands to heaven in holy horror and pointed at me saying What a terrible man What an awful rascal The prisoner seemed to thoroughly enjoy the recollection of the scene he had described
none	none	 for he now burst into another hearty laugh to the great amazement of Lecoq and the scandal of Goguet the smiling clerk M Segmuller also found it difficult to conceal his surprise 
5979-42001-0020	train-other-500	You are too reasonable I hope he said at last
none	none	 to attach any blame to these men who in confining you in a strait waistcoat 
5979-42001-0021	train-other-500	were merely obeying the orders of their superior officers with the view of protecting you from your own violent passions Hum responded the prisoner suddenly growing serious I do blame them however
5979-42001-0022	train-other-500	and if I had one of them in a corner But never mind I shall get over it If I know myself aright I have no more spite in my composition than a chicken
none	none	 Your treatment depends on your own conduct rejoined M Segmuller 
5979-42001-0023	train-other-500	If you will only remain calm you shan t be put in a strait waistcoat again But you must promise me that you will be quiet and conduct yourself properly The murderer sadly shook his head
5979-42001-0024	train-other-500	I shall be very prudent hereafter said he but it is terribly hard to stay in prison with nothing to do If I had some comrades with me we could laugh and chat and the time would slip by
none	none	 but it is positively horrible to have to remain alone entirely alone in that cold damp cell 
5979-42001-0025	train-other-500	where not a sound can be heard The magistrate bent over his desk to make a note The word comrades had attracted his attention and he proposed to ask the prisoner to explain it at a later stage of the inquiry
5979-42001-0026	train-other-500	If you are innocent he remarked you will soon be released but it is necessary to prove your innocence What must I do to prove it Tell the truth the whole truth
none	none	 answer my questions honestly without reserve 
5979-42001-0027	train-other-500	As for that you may depend upon me As he spoke the prisoner lifted his hand as if to call upon God to witness his sincerity
none	none	 But M Segmuller immediately intervened 
5979-42001-0028	train-other-500	Prisoners do not take the oath said he Indeed ejaculated the man with an astonished air that s strange Although the magistrate had apparently paid but little attention to the prisoner
5979-42001-0029	train-other-500	he had in point of fact carefully noted his attitude his tone of voice his looks and gestures
none	none	 M Segmuller had moreover done his utmost to set the culprit s mind at ease 
5979-42001-0030	train-other-500	to quiet all possible suspicion of a trap and his inspection of the prisoner s person led him to believe that this result had been attained Now said he you will give me your attention
5979-42001-0031	train-other-500	and do not forget that your liberty depends upon your frankness What is your name May What is your Christian name I have none That is impossible
5979-42001-0032	train-other-500	I have been told that already three times since yesterday rejoined the prisoner impatiently
none	none	 And yet it s the truth 
5979-42001-0033	train-other-500	If I were a liar I could easily tell you that my name was Peter James or John But lying is not in my line Really I have no Christian name If it were a question of surnames it would be quite another thing I have had plenty of them
5979-42001-0034	train-other-500	What were they Let me see to commence with when I was with Father Fougasse I was called Affiloir because you see
none	none	 Who was this Father Fougasse 
5979-42001-0035	train-other-500	The great wild beast tamer sir
none	none	 Ah he could boast of a menagerie and no mistake Lions tigers and bears 
5979-42001-0036	train-other-500	serpents as big round as your thigh parrakeets of every color under the sun Ah it was a wonderful collection But unfortunately Was the man jesting or was he in earnest
none	none	 It was so hard to decide that M Segmuller and Lecoq were equally in doubt As for Goguet the smiling clerk he chuckled to himself as his pen ran over the paper 
5979-42001-0037	train-other-500	Enough interrupted the magistrate How old are you Forty four or forty five years of age Where were you born In Brittany probably
none	none	 M Segmuller thought he could detect a hidden vein of irony in this reply 
5979-42001-0038	train-other-500	I warn you said he severely that if you go on in this way your chances of recovering your liberty will be greatly compromised
none	none	 Each of your answers is a breach of propriety As the supposed murderer heard these words an expression of mingled distress and anxiety was apparent in his face Ah I meant no offense sir he sighed You questioned me and I replied You will see that I have spoken the truth if you will allow me to recount the history of the whole affair When the prisoner speaks the prosecution is enlightened so runs an old proverb frequently quoted at the Palais de Justice It does indeed seem almost impossible for a culprit to say more than a few words in an investigating magistrate s presence 
5979-42002-0000	train-other-500	without betraying his intentions or his thoughts without in short revealing more or less of the secret he is endeavoring to conceal All criminals even the most simple minded understand this
none	none	 and those who are shrewd prove remarkably reticent 
5979-42002-0001	train-other-500	Confining themselves to the few facts upon which they have founded their defense
none	none	 they are careful not to travel any further 
5979-42002-0002	train-other-500	unless absolutely compelled to do so and even then they only speak with the utmost caution When questioned they reply of course but always briefly and they are very sparing of details
5979-42002-0003	train-other-500	In the present instance however the prisoner was prodigal of words
none	none	 He did not seem to think that there was any danger of his being the medium of accomplishing his own decapitation 
5979-42002-0004	train-other-500	He did not hesitate like those who are afraid of misplacing a word of the romance they are substituting for the truth Under other circumstances this fact would have been a strong argument in his favor
5979-42002-0005	train-other-500	You may tell your own story then
none	none	 said M Segmuller in answer to the prisoner s indirect request 
5979-42002-0006	train-other-500	The presumed murderer did not try to hide the satisfaction he experienced at thus being allowed to plead his own cause in his own way His eyes sparkled and his nostrils dilated as if with pleasure
5979-42002-0007	train-other-500	He sat himself dawn threw his head back passed his tongue over his lips as if to moisten them and said Am I to understand that you wish to hear my history Yes
none	none	 Then you must know that one day about forty five years ago Father Tringlot the manager of a traveling acrobatic company was going from Guingamp to Saint Brieuc in Brittany 
5979-42002-0008	train-other-500	He had with him two large vehicles containing his wife the necessary theatrical paraphernalia and the members of the company Well soon after passing Chatelaudren he perceived something white lying by the roadside
none	none	 near the edge of a ditch I must go and see what that is he said to his wife 
5979-42002-0009	train-other-500	He stopped the horses alighted from the vehicle he was in went to the ditch picked up the object he had noticed and uttered a cry of surprise You will ask me what he had found Ah good heavens A mere trifle
5979-42002-0010	train-other-500	He had found your humble servant then about six months old With these last words the prisoner made a low bow to his audience Naturally Father Tringlot carried me to his wife
5979-42002-0011	train-other-500	She was a kind hearted woman She took me examined me fed me and said He s a strong healthy child and we ll keep him since his mother has been so wicked as to abandon him by the roadside I will teach him
5979-42002-0012	train-other-500	and in five or six years he will be a credit to us They then asked each other what name they should give me
none	none	 and as it happened to be the first day of May 
5979-42002-0013	train-other-500	they decided to call me after the month
none	none	 and so it happens that May has been my name from that day to this The prisoner paused again and looked from one to another of his listeners as if seeking some sign of approval None being forthcoming he proceeded with his story Father Tringlot was an uneducated man 
5979-42002-0014	train-other-500	entirely ignorant of the law
none	none	 He did not inform the authorities that he had found a child 
5979-42002-0015	train-other-500	and for this reason although I was living I did not legally exist for to have a legal existence it is necessary that one s name parentage and birthplace should figure upon a municipal register
none	none	 When I grew older I rather congratulated myself on Father Tringlot s neglect May my boy said I you are not put down on any government register consequently there s no fear of your ever being drawn as a soldier I had a horror of military service 
5979-42002-0016	train-other-500	and a positive dread of bullets and cannon balls Later on when I had passed the proper age for the conscription
none	none	 a lawyer told me that I should get into all kinds of trouble if I sought a place on the civil register so late in the day 
5979-42002-0017	train-other-500	and so I decided to exist surreptitiously And this is why I have no Christian name and why I can t exactly say where I was born If truth has any particular accent of its own
5979-42002-0018	train-other-500	as moralists have asserted the murderer had found that accent
none	none	 Voice gesture glance expression all were in accord 
5979-42002-0019	train-other-500	not a word of his long story had rung false Now
none	none	 said M Segmuller coldly 
5979-42002-0020	train-other-500	what are your means of subsistence By the prisoner s discomfited mien one might have supposed that he had expected to see the prison doors fly open at the conclusion of his narrative I have a profession
5979-42002-0021	train-other-500	he replied plaintively The one that Mother Tringlot taught me I subsist by its practise and I have lived by it in France and other countries The magistrate thought he had found a flaw in the prisoner s armor
5979-42002-0022	train-other-500	You say you have lived in foreign countries he inquired
none	none	 Yes during the seventeen years that I was with M Simpson s company 
5979-42002-0023	train-other-500	I traveled most of the time in England and Germany Then you are a gymnast and an athlete How is it that your hands are so white and soft
5979-42002-0024	train-other-500	Far from being embarrassed the prisoner raised his hands from his lap and examined them with evident complacency It is true they are pretty said he but this is because I take good care of them and scarcely use them
5979-42002-0025	train-other-500	Do they pay you then for doing nothing Ah no indeed
none	none	 But sir my duty consists in speaking to the public in turning a compliment in making things pass off pleasantly as the saying is 
5979-42002-0026	train-other-500	and without boasting I flatter myself that I have a certain knack
none	none	 M Segmuller stroked his chin 
5979-42002-0027	train-other-500	according to his habit whenever he considered that a prisoner had committed some grave blunder In that case said he will you give me a specimen of your talent
none	none	 Ah ha laughed the prisoner 
5979-42002-0028	train-other-500	evidently supposing this to be a jest on the part of the magistrate Ah ha
none	none	 Obey me if you please insisted M Segmuller 
5979-42002-0029	train-other-500	The supposed murderer made no objection His face at once assumed a different expression his features wearing a mingled air of impudence conceit and irony
none	none	 He caught up a ruler that was lying on the magistrate s desk 
5979-42002-0030	train-other-500	and flourishing it wildly began as follows in a shrill falsetto voice
none	none	 Silence music And you big drum hold your peace Now is the hour now is the moment ladies and gentlemen to witness the grand unique performance of these great artists 
5979-42002-0031	train-other-500	unequaled in the world for their feats upon the trapeze and the tight rope and in innumerable other exercises of grace suppleness and strength That is sufficient interrupted the magistrate
5979-42002-0032	train-other-500	You can speak like that in France but what do you say in Germany Of course I use the language of that country Let me hear then
none	none	 retorted M Segmuller whose mother tongue was German 
5979-42002-0033	train-other-500	The prisoner ceased his mocking manner assumed an air of comical importance and without the slightest hesitation began to speak as follows
none	none	 in very emphatic tones Mit Be willigung der hochloeblichen Obrigkeit wird heute vor hiesiger ehrenwerthen Burgerschaft zum erstenmal aufgefuhrt Genovesa oder This opening of the prisoner s German harangue may be thus rendered 
5979-42002-0034	train-other-500	With the permission of the local authorities there will now be presented before the honorable citizens for the first time Genevieve or the Enough said the magistrate harshly He rose perhaps to conceal his chagrin and added
none	none	 We will send for an interpreter to tell us whether you speak English as fluently 
5979-42002-0035	train-other-500	On hearing these words Lecoq modestly stepped forward I understand English said he Very well You hear prisoner But the man was already transformed
5979-42002-0036	train-other-500	British gravity and apathy were written upon his features
none	none	 his gestures were stiff and constrained 
5979-42002-0037	train-other-500	and in the most ponderous tones he exclaimed Walk up
none	none	 ladies and gentlemen walk up 
5979-42002-0038	train-other-500	Long life to the queen
none	none	 and to the honorable mayor of this town No country England excepted our glorious England could produce such a marvel such a paragon For a minute or two longer he continued in the same strain M Segmuller was leaning upon his desk 
5979-42002-0039	train-other-500	his face hidden by his hands
none	none	 Lecoq standing in front of the prisoner could not conceal his astonishment Goguet the smiling clerk alone found the scene amusing XI The governor of the Depot a functionary who had gained the reputation of an oracle by twenty years experience in prisons and with prisoners a man whom it was most difficult to deceive had advised the magistrate to surround himself with every precaution before examining the prisoner May And yet this man characterized as a most dangerous criminal and the very announcement of whose coming had made the clerk turn pale had proved to be a practical harmless and jovial philosopher vain of his eloquence a bohemian whose existence depended upon his ability to turn a compliment in short a somewhat erratic genius This was certainly strange but the seeming contradiction did not cause M Segmuller to abandon the theory propounded by Lecoq On the contrary he was more than ever convinced of its truth If he remained silent with his elbows leaning on the desk and his hands clasped over his eyes it was only that he might gain time for reflection The prisoner s attitude and manner were remarkable When his English harangue was finished he remained standing in the centre of the room a half pleased half anxious expression on his face Still he was as much at ease as if he had been on the platform outside some stroller s booth where if one could believe his story he had passed the greater part of his life It was in vain that the magistrate sought for some indication of weakness on his features which in their mobility were more enigmatical than the lineaments of the Sphinx Thus far M Segmuller had been worsted in the encounter It is true however that he had not as yet ventured on any direct attack nor had he made use of any of the weapons which Lecoq had forged for his use Still he was none the less annoyed at his defeat as it was easy to see by the sharp manner in which he raised his head after a few moments silence I see that you speak three European languages correctly said he It is a rare talent The prisoner bowed and smiled complacently Still that does not establish your identity continued the magistrate Have you any acquaintances in Paris Can you indicate any respectable person who will vouch for the truth of this story Ah sir it is seventeen years since I left France That is unfortunate but the prosecution can not content itself with such an explanation What about your last employer M Simpson Who is he M Simpson is a rich man replied the prisoner rather coldly worth more than two hundred thousand francs and honest besides In Germany he traveled with a show of marionettes and in England with a collection of phenomena to suit the tastes of that country Very well Then this millionaire could testify in your favor it would be easy to find him I suppose Certainly responded May emphatically M Simpson would willingly do me this favor It would not be difficult for me to find him only it would require considerable time Why Because at the present moment he must be on his way to America It was on account of this journey that I left his company I detest the ocean A moment previously Lecoq s anxiety had been so intense that his heart almost stopped beating on hearing these last words however he regained all his self possession As for the magistrate he merely greeted the murderer s reply with a brief but significant ejaculation When I say that he is on his way resumed the prisoner I may be mistaken He may not have started yet though he had certainly made all his arrangements before we separated What ship was he to sail by He did not tell me Where was he when you left him At Leipsic When was this Last Wednesday M Segmuller shrugged his shoulders disdainfully So you say you were in Leipsic on Wednesday How long have you been in Paris Since Sunday afternoon at four o clock It will be necessary to prove that Judging by the murderer s contracted brow it might be conjectured that he was making a strenuous effort to remember something He cast questioning glances first toward the ceiling and then toward the floor scratching his head and tapping his foot in evident perplexity How can I prove it how he murmured The magistrate did not appear disposed to wait Let me assist you said he The people at the inn where you boarded while in Leipsic must remember you We did not stop at an inn Where did you eat and sleep then In M Simpson s large traveling carriage it had been sold but he was not to give it up until he reached the port he was to sail from What port was that I don t know At this reply Lecoq who had less experience than the magistrate in the art of concealing one s impressions could not help rubbing his hands with satisfaction The prisoner was plainly convicted of falsehood indeed driven into a corner So you have only your own word to offer in support of this story inquired M Segmuller Wait a moment said the prisoner extending his arm as if to clutch at a still vague inspiration wait a moment When I arrived in Paris I had with me a trunk containing my clothes The linen is all marked with the first letter of my name and besides some ordinary coats and trousers there were a couple of costumes I used to wear when I appeared in public Well what have you done with all these things When I arrived in Paris I took the trunk to a hotel close by the Northern Railway Station Go on Tell us the name of this hotel said M Segmuller perceiving that the prisoner had stopped short evidently embarrassed That s just what I m trying to recollect I ve forgotten it But I haven t forgotten the house I fancy I can see it now and if some one would only take me to the neighborhood I should certainly recognize it The people at the hotel would know me and besides my trunk would prove the truth of what I ve told you On hearing this statement Lecoq mentally resolved to make a tour of investigation through the various hotels surrounding the Gare du Nord Very well retorted the magistrate Perhaps we will do as you request Now there are two questions I desire to ask If you arrived in Paris at four o clock in the afternoon how did it happen that by midnight of the same day you had discovered the Poivriere which is merely frequented by suspicious characters and is situated in such a lonely spot that it would be impossible to find it at night time if one were not familiar with the surrounding localities In the second place how does it happen if you possess such clothing as you describe that you are so poorly dressed The prisoner smiled at these questions I can easily explain that he replied One s clothes are soon spoiled when one travels third class so on leaving Leipsic I put on the worst things I had When I arrived here and felt my feet on the pavements of Paris I went literally wild with delight I acted like a fool I had some money in my pocket it was Shrove Sunday and my only thought was to make a night of it I did not think of changing my clothes As I had formerly been in the habit of amusing myself round about the Barriere d Italie I hastened there and entered a wine shop While I was eating a morsel two men came in and began talking about spending the night at a ball at the Rainbow I asked them to take me with them they agreed I paid their bills and we started But soon after our arrival there these young men left me and joined the dancers It was not long before I grew weary of merely looking on Rather disappointed I left the inn and being foolish enough not to ask my way I wandered on till I lost myself while traversing a tract of unoccupied land I was about to go back when I saw a light in the distance I walked straight toward it and reached that cursed hovel What happened then Oh I went in called for some one A woman came downstairs and I asked her for a glass of brandy When she brought it I sat down and lighted a cigar Then I looked about me The interior was almost enough to frighten one Three men and two women were drinking and chatting in low tones at another table My face did not seem to suit them One of them got up came toward me and said You are a police agent you ve come here to play the spy that s very plain I answered that I wasn t a police agent He replied that I was I again declared that I wasn t In short he swore that he was sure of it and that my beard was false So saying he caught hold of my beard and pulled it This made me mad I jumped up and with a blow of my fist I felled him to the ground In an instant all the others were upon me I had my revolver you know the rest And while all this was going on what were the two women doing Ah I was too busy to pay any attention to them They disappeared But you saw them when you entered the place what were they like Oh they were big ugly creatures as tall as grenadiers and as dark as moles Between plausible falsehood and improbable truth justice human justice and therefore liable to error is compelled to decide as best it can For the past hour M Segmuller had not been free from mental disquietude But all his doubts vanished when he heard the prisoner declare that the two women were tall and dark If he had said The women were fair M Segmuller would not have known what to believe but in the magistrate s opinion the audacious falsehood he had just heard proved that there was a perfect understanding between the supposed murderer and Widow Chupin Certainly M Segmuller s satisfaction was great but his face did not betray it It was of the utmost importance that the prisoner should believe that he had succeeded in deceiving his examiner You must understand how necessary it is to find these women said the magistrate kindly If their testimony corresponds with your allegations your innocence will be proved conclusively Yes I understand that but how can I put my hand upon them The police can assist you our agents are always at the service of prisoners who desire to make use of them in establishing their innocence Did you make any observations which might aid in the discovery of these women Lecoq whose eyes never wandered from the prisoner s face fancied that he saw the faint shadow of a smile on the man s lips I remarked nothing said the prisoner coldly M Segmuller had opened the drawer of his desk a moment before He now drew from it the earring which had been found on the scene of the tragedy and handing it abruptly to the prisoner he asked So you didn t notice this in the ear of one of the women The prisoner s imperturbable coolness of demeanor did not forsake him He took the jewel in his hand examined it attentively held it up to the light admired its brilliant scintillations and said It is a very handsome stone but I didn t notice it This stone remarked the magistrate is a diamond Ah Yes and worth several thousand francs So much as that This exclamation may have been in accordance with the spirit of the part assumed by the prisoner though at the same time its simplicity was undoubtedly far fetched It was strange that a nomad such as the murderer pretended to have been acquainted with most of the countries and capitals of Europe should have displayed this astonishment on learning the value of a diamond Still M Segmuller did not seem to notice the discrepancy Another thing said he When you threw down your pistol crying Come and take me what did you intend to do I intended to make my escape In what way Why of course by the door sir by Yes by the back door retorted the magistrate with freezing irony It remains for you to explain how you you who had just entered that hovel for the first time could have known of this door s existence For once in the course of the examination the prisoner seemed troubled For an instant all his assurance forsook him He evidently perceived the danger of his position and after a considerable effort he contrived to burst out in a laugh His laugh was a poor one however it rang false and failed to conceal a sensation of deep anxiety Growing gradually bolder he at length exclaimed That s nonsense I had just seen these two women go out by that very door Excuse me you declared a minute ago that you did not see these women leave that you were too busy to watch their movements Did I say that Word for word the passage shall be shown you Goguet find it The clerk at once read the passage referred to whereupon the prisoner undertook to show that the remark had been misunderstood He had not said at least he did not intend to say that they had quite misinterpreted his words With such remarks did he try to palliate the effect of his apparent blunders In the mean while Lecoq was jubilant Ah my fine fellow thought he you are contradicting yourself you are in deep water already you are lost There s no hope for you The prisoner s situation was indeed not unlike that of a bather who unable to swim imprudently advances into the sea until the water rises above his chin He may for a while have preserved his equilibrium despite the buffeting of the waves but now he totters loses his footing another second and he will sink Enough enough said the magistrate cutting the prisoner s embarrassed explanation short Now if you started out merely with the intention of amusing yourself how did it happen that you took your revolver with you I had it with me while I was traveling and did not think of leaving it at the hotel any more than I thought of changing my clothes Where did you purchase it It was given me by M Simpson as a souvenir Confess that this M Simpson is a very convenient personage said the magistrate coldly Still go on with your story Only two chambers of this murderous weapon were discharged but three men were killed You have not told me the end of the affair What s the use exclaimed the prisoner in saddened tones Two of my assailants had fallen the struggle became an equal one I seized the remaining man the soldier round the body and threw him down He fell against a corner of the table and did not rise again M Segmuller had unfolded upon his desk the plan of the Poivriere drawn by Lecoq Come here he said addressing the prisoner and show me on this paper the precise spot you and your adversaries occupied May obeyed and with an assurance of manner a little surprising in a man in his position he proceeded to explain the drama I entered said he by this door marked C I seated myself at the table H to the left of the entrance my assailants occupied the table between the fireplace F and the window B I must admit said the magistrate that your assertions fully agree with the statements of the physicians who say that one of the shots must have been fired about a yard off and the other about two yards off This was a victory for the prisoner but he only shrugged his shoulders and murmured That proves that the physicians knew their business Lecoq was delighted This part of the prisoner s narrative not merely agreed with the doctor s statements but also confirmed his own researches The young detective felt that had he been the examiner he would have conducted the investigation in precisely the same way Accordingly he thanked heaven that M Segmuller had supplied the place of M d Escorval This admitted resumed the magistrate it remains for you to explain a sentence you uttered when the agent you see here arrested you What sentence You exclaimed Ah it s the Prussians who are coming I m lost What did you mean by that A fleeting crimson tinge suffused the prisoner s cheek It was evident that if he had anticipated the other questions and had been prepared for them this one at least was unexpected It s very strange said he with ill disguised embarrassment that I should have said such a thing Five persons heard you insisted the magistrate The prisoner did not immediately reply He was evidently trying to gain time ransacking in his mind for a plausible explanation After all he ultimately said the thing s quite possible When I was with M Simpson we had with us an old soldier who had belonged to Napoleon s body guard and had fought at Waterloo I recollect he was always repeating that phrase I must have caught the habit from him This explanation though rather slow in coming was none the less ingenious At least M Segmuller appeared to be perfectly satisfied That s very plausible said he but there is one circumstance that passes my comprehension Were you freed from your assailants before the police entered the place Answer me yes or no Yes Then why instead of making your escape by the back door the existence of which you had divined did you remain on the threshold of the door leading into the back room with a table before you to serve as a barricade and your revolver leveled at the police as if to keep them at bay The prisoner hung his head and the magistrate had to wait for his answer I was a fool he stammered at last I didn t know whether these men were police agents or friends of the fellows I had killed In either case your own interest should have induced you to fly The prisoner remained silent Ah well resumed M Segmuller let me tell you my opinion I believe you designedly and voluntarily exposed yourself to the danger of being arrested in order to protect the retreat of the two women who had just left Why should I have risked my own safety for two hussies I did not even know Excuse me The prosecution is strongly inclined to believe that you know these two women very well I should like to see any one prove that So saying the prisoner smiled sneeringly but at once changed countenance when the magistrate retorted in a tone of assurance I will prove it XII M Segmuller certainly wished that a number had been branded upon the enigmatical prisoner before him And yet he did not by any means despair and his confidence exaggerated though it might be was not at all feigned He was of opinion that the weakest point of the prisoner s defense so far was his pretended ignorance concerning the two women He proposed to return to this subject later on In the mean while however there were other matters to be dealt with When he felt that his threat as regards the women had had time to produce its full effect the magistrate continued So prisoner you assert that you were acquainted with none of the persons you met at the Poivriere I swear it Have you never had occasion to meet a person called Lacheneur an individual whose name is connected with this unfortunate affair I heard the name for the first time when it was pronounced by the dying soldier Poor fellow I had just dealt him his death blow and yet his last words testified to my innocence This sentimental outburst produced no impression whatever upon the magistrate In that case said he I suppose you are willing to accept this soldier s statement The man hesitated as if conscious that he had fallen into a snare and that he would be obliged to weigh each answer carefully I accept it said he at last Of course I accept it Very well then This soldier as you must recollect wished to revenge himself on Lacheneur who by promising him a sum of money had inveigled him into a conspiracy A conspiracy against whom Evidently against you and yet you pretend that you had only arrived in Paris that evening and that mere chance brought you to the Poivriere Can you reconcile such conflicting statements The prisoner had the hardihood to shrug his shoulders disdainfully I see the matter in an entirely different light said he These people were plotting mischief against I don t know whom and it was because I was in their way that they sought a quarrel with me without any cause whatever Skilfully as the magistrate had delivered this thrust it had been as skilfully parried so skilfully indeed that Goguet the smiling clerk could not conceal an approving grimace Besides on principle he always took the prisoner s part in a mild Platonic way of course Let us consider the circumstances that followed your arrest resumed M Segmuller Why did you refuse to answer all the questions put to you A gleam of real or assumed resentment shone in the prisoner s eyes This examination he growled will alone suffice to make a culprit out of an innocent man I advise you in your own interest to behave properly Those who arrested you observed that you were conversant with all the prison formalities and rules Ah sir haven t I told you that I have been arrested and put in prison several times always on account of my papers I told you the truth and you shouldn t taunt me for having done so The prisoner had dropped his mask of careless gaiety and had assumed a surly discontented tone But his troubles were by no means ended in fact the battle had only just begun Laying a tiny linen bag on his desk M Segmuller asked him if he recognized it Perfectly It is the package that the governor of the Depot placed in his safe The magistrate opened the bag and poured the dust that it contained on to a sheet of paper You are aware prisoner said he that this dust comes from the mud that was sticking to your feet The police agent who collected it has been to the station house where you spent the night of the murder and has discovered that the composition of this dust is identical with that of the floor of the cell you occupied The prisoner listened with gaping mouth Hence continued the magistrate it was certainly at the station house and designedly that you soiled your feet with that mud In doing so you had an object I wished Let me finish Being determined to keep your identity secret and to assume the character of a member of the lower classes of a mountebank if you please you reflected that the care you bestow upon your person might betray you You foresaw the impression that would be caused when the coarse ill fitting boots you wore were removed and the officials perceived your trim clean feet which are as well kept as your hands Accordingly what did you do You poured some of the water that was in the pitcher in your cell on to the ground and then dabbled your feet in the mud that had thus been formed During these remarks the prisoner s face wore by turns an expression of anxiety astonishment irony and mirth When the magistrate had finished he burst into a hearty laugh So that s the result of twelve or fourteen hours research he at length exclaimed turning toward Lecoq Ah mister Agent it s good to be sharp but not so sharp as that The truth is that when I was taken to the station house forty eight hours thirty six of them spent in a railway carriage had elapsed since I had taken off my boots My feet were red and swollen and they burned like fire What did I do I poured some water over them As for your other suspicions if I have a soft white skin it is only because I take care of myself Besides as is usual with most men of my profession I rarely wear anything but slippers on my feet This is so true that on leaving Leipsic I only owned a single pair of boots and that was an old cast off pair given me by M Simpson Lecoq struck his chest Fool imbecile idiot that I am he thought He was waiting to be questioned about this circumstance He is so wonderfully shrewd that when he saw me take the dust he divined my intentions and since then he has managed to concoct this story a plausible story enough and one that any jury would believe M Segmuller was saying the same thing to himself But he was not so surprised nor so overcome by the skill the prisoner had displayed in fencing with this point Let us continue said he Do you still persist in your statements prisoner Yes Very well then I shall be forced to tell you that what you are saying is untrue The prisoner s lips trembled visibly and it was with difficulty that he faltered May my first mouthful of bread strangle me if I have uttered a single falsehood A single falsehood Wait The magistrate drew from the drawer of his desk the molds of the footprints prepared by Lecoq and showing them to the murderer he said You told me a few minutes ago that the two women were as tall as grenadiers now just look at the footprints made by these female giants They were as dark as moles you said a witness will tell you that one of them was a small delicate featured blonde with an exceedingly sweet voice He sought the prisoner s eyes gazed steadily into them and added slowly And this witness is the driver whose cab was hired in the Rue de Chevaleret by the two fugitives both short fair haired women This sentence fell like a thunderbolt upon the prisoner he grew pale tottered and leaned against the wall for support Ah you have told me the truth scornfully continued the pitiless magistrate Then who is this man who was waiting for you while you were at the Poivriere Who is this accomplice who after your arrest dared to enter the Widow Chupin s den to regain possession of some compromising object no doubt a letter which he knew he would find in the pocket of the Widow Chupin s apron Who is this devoted courageous friend who feigned drunkenness so effectually that even the police were deceived and thoughtlessly placed him in confinement with you Dare you deny that you have not arranged your system of defense in concert with him Can you affirm that he did not give the Widow Chupin counsel as to the course she should pursue But already thanks to his power of self control the prisoner had mastered his agitation All this said he in a harsh voice is a mere invention of the police However faithfully one may describe an examination of this kind a narrative can convey no more idea of the real scene than a heap of cold ashes can give the effect of a glowing fire One can note down each word each ejaculation but phraseology is powerless to portray the repressed animation the impassioned movements the studied reticence the varied tones of voice the now bold now faltering glances full of hatred and suspicion which follow each other in rapid succession mostly on the prisoner s side but not entirely so for although the magistrate may be an adept in the art of concealing his feelings at times nature can not be controlled When the prisoner reeled beneath the magistrate s last words the latter could not control his feelings He yields he thought he succumbs he is mine But all hope of immediate success vanished when M Segmuller saw his redoubtable adversary struggle against his momentary weakness and arm himself for the fight with renewed and if possible even greater energy The magistrate perceived that it would require more than one assault to over come such a stubborn nature So in a voice rendered still more harsh by disappointment he resumed It is plain that you are determined to deny evidence itself The prisoner had recovered all his self possession He must have bitterly regretted his weakness for a fiendish spite glittered in his eyes What evidence he asked frowning This romance invented by the police is very plausible I don t deny it but it seems to me that the truth is quite as probable You talk to me about a cabman whose vehicle was hired by two short fair haired women but who can prove that these women were the same that fled from the Poivriere The police agent you see here followed the tracks they left across the snow Ah at night time across fields intersected by ditches and up a long street a fine rain falling all the while and a thaw already beginning Oh your story is very probable As he spoke the murderer extended his arm toward Lecoq and then in a tone of crushing scorn he added A man must have great confidence in himself or a wild longing for advancement to try and get a man guillotined on such evidence as that At these words Goguet the smiling clerk whose pen was rapidly flying across the paper could not help remarking to himself The arrow has entered the bull s eye this time The comment was not without foundation for Lecoq was evidently cut to the quick Indeed he was so incensed that forgetful of his subordinate position he sprang to his feet exclaiming This circumstance would be of slight importance if it were not one of a long chain Be good enough to keep silent interrupted the magistrate who turning to the prisoner added The court does not utilize the proofs and testimony collected by the police until it has examined and weighed them No matter murmured the prisoner I should like to see this cab driver Have no fear about that he shall repeat his evidence in your presence Very well I am satisfied then I will ask him how he can distinguish people s faces when it is as dark as He checked himself apparently enlightened by a sudden inspiration How stupid I am he exclaimed I m losing my temper about these people when you know all the while who they are For of course the cabmen drove them home M Segmuller saw that the prisoner understood him He perceived moreover that the latter was doing all he could to increase the mystery that enshrouded this essential point of the case a point upon which the prosecution was particularly anxious to obtain information The prisoner was truly an incomparable comedian for his last observation was made in a tone of remarkable candor just tinged with sufficient irony to show that he felt he had nothing to fear in this direction If you are consistent with yourself remarked the magistrate you will also deny the existence of an accomplice of a comrade What would be the use denying it since you believe nothing that I say Only a moment ago you insinuated that my former employer was an imaginary personage so what need I say about my pretended accomplice According to your agents he s at all events a most faithful friend Indeed this wonderful being invented by Monsieur with these words the prisoner pointed to Lecoq was seemingly not satisfied at having once escaped the police for according to your account he voluntarily placed himself in their clutches a second time You gentlemen pretend that he conferred first of all with me and next with the Widow Chupin How did that happen Perhaps after removing him from my cell some of your agents obligingly shut him up with the old woman Goguet the clerk wrote all this down admiringly Here thought he is a man of brain who understands his case He won t need any lawyer s eloquence to put his defense favorably before a jury And after all continued the prisoner what are the proofs against me The name of Lacheneur faltered by a dying man a few footprints on some melting snow a sleepy cab driver s declaration and a vague doubt about a drunkard s identity If that is all you have against me it certainly doesn t amount to much Enough interrupted M Segmuller Your assurance is perfect now though a moment ago your embarrassment was most remarkable What was the cause of it The cause indignantly exclaimed the prisoner whom this query had seemingly enraged the cause Can t you see sir that you are torturing me frightfully pitilessly I am an innocent man and you are trying to deprive me of my life You have been turning me this way and that way for so many hours that I begin to feel as if I were standing on the guillotine Each time I open my mouth to speak I ask myself is it this answer that will send me to the scaffold My anxiety and dismay surprise you do they Why since this examination began I ve felt the cold knife graze my neck at least twenty times I wouldn t like my worst enemy to be subjected to such torture as this The prisoner s description of his sufferings did not seem at all exaggerated His hair was saturated with perspiration and big drops of sweat rested on his pallid brow or coursed down his cheeks on to his beard I am not your enemy said the magistrate more gently A magistrate is neither a prisoner s friend nor enemy he is simply the friend of truth and the executor of the law I am not seeking either for an innocent man or for a culprit I merely wish to arrive at the truth I must know who you are and I do know Ah if the assertion costs me my life I m May and none other No you are not Who am I then Some great man in disguise Ah I wish I were In that case I should have satisfactory papers to show you and then you would set me free for you know very well my good sir that I am as innocent as you are The magistrate had left his desk and taken a seat by the fireplace within a yard of the prisoner Do not insist said he Then suddenly changing both manner and tone he added with the urbanity that a man of the world displays when addressing an equal Do me the honor sir to believe me gifted with sufficient perspicuity to recognize under the difficult part you play to such perfection a very superior gentleman a man endowed with remarkable talents Lecoq perceived that this sudden change of manner had unnerved the prisoner He tried to laugh but his merriment partook somewhat of the nature of a sob and big tears glistened in his eyes I will not torture you any longer continued the magistrate In subtle reasoning I confess that you have conquered me However when I return to the charge I shall have proofs enough in my possession to crush you He reflected for a moment then lingering over each word he added Only do not then expect from me the consideration I have shown you to day Justice is human that is she is indulgent toward certain crimes She has fathomed the depth of the abyss into which blind passion may hurl even an honest man To day I freely offer you any assistance that will not conflict with my duty Speak shall I send this officer of police away Would you like me to send my clerk out of the room on an errand He said no more but waited to see the effect of this last effort The prisoner darted upon him one of those searching glances that seem to pierce an adversary through His lips moved one might have supposed that he was about to make a revelation But no suddenly he crossed his arms over his chest and murmured You are very frank sir Unfortunately for me I m only a poor devil as I ve already told you My name is May and I earn my living by speaking to the public and turning a compliment I am forced to yield to your decision said the magistrate sadly The clerk will now read the minutes of your examination listen While Goguet read the evidence aloud the prisoner listened without making any remark but when asked to sign the document he obstinately refused to do so fearing he said some hidden treachery A moment afterward the soldiers who had escorted him to the magistrate s room conducted him back to the Depot XIII When the prisoner had gone M Segmuller sank back in his armchair literally exhausted 
5979-42005-0000	train-other-500	He was in that state of nervous prostration which so often follows protracted but fruitless efforts He had scarcely strength enough to bathe his burning forehead and gleaming eyes with cool refreshing water
5979-42005-0001	train-other-500	This frightful examination had lasted no less than seven consecutive hours The smiling clerk who had kept his place at his desk busily writing the whole while now rose to his feet
5979-42005-0002	train-other-500	glad of an opportunity to stretch his limbs and snap his fingers cramped by holding the pen Still he was not in the least degree bored
none	none	 He invariably took a semi theatrical interest in the dramas 
5979-42005-0003	train-other-500	that were daily enacted in his presence
none	none	 his excitement being all the greater 
5979-42005-0004	train-other-500	owing to the uncertainty that shrouded the finish of the final act a finish that only too often belied the ordinary rules and deductions of writers for the stage What a knave he exclaimed
none	none	 after vainly waiting for the magistrate or the detective to express an opinion what a rascal M Segmuller ordinarily put considerable confidence in his clerk s long experience 
5979-42005-0005	train-other-500	He sometimes even went so far as to consult him doubtless somewhat in the same style that Moliere consulted his servant But on this occasion he did not accept his opinion No
none	none	 said he in a thoughtful tone that man is not a knave When I spoke to him kindly he was really touched he wept he hesitated I could have sworn that he was about to tell me everything 
5979-42005-0006	train-other-500	Ah he s a man of wonderful power observed Lecoq The detective was sincere in his praise Although the prisoner had disappointed his plans and had even insulted him
none	none	 he could not help admiring his shrewdness and courage He Lecoq had prepared himself for a strenuous struggle with this man 
5979-42005-0007	train-other-500	and he hoped to conquer in the end Nevertheless in his secret soul he felt for his adversary admiring that sympathy which a foeman worthy of one s steel always inspires
5979-42005-0008	train-other-500	What coolness what courage continued the young detective Ah there s no denying it his system of defense of absolute denial is a masterpiece It is perfect
none	none	 How well he played that difficult part of buffoon 
5979-42005-0009	train-other-500	At times I could scarcely restrain my admiration What is a famous comedian beside that fellow The greatest actors need the adjunct of stage scenery to support the illusion whereas this man entirely unaided
5979-42005-0010	train-other-500	almost convinced me even against my reason Do you know what your very appropriate criticism proves inquired the magistrate I am listening sir Ah well
none	none	 I have arrived at this conclusion either this man is really May the stroller earning his living by paying compliments as he says or else he belongs to the highest rank of society and not to the middle classes 
5979-42005-0011	train-other-500	It is only in the lowest or in the highest ranks that you encounter such grim energy as he has displayed such scorn of life as well as such remarkable presence of mind and resolution
none	none	 A vulgar tradesman attracted to the Poivriere by some shameful passion 
5979-42005-0012	train-other-500	would have confessed it long ago But sir this man is surely not the buffoon May replied the young detective No certainly not
none	none	 responded M Segmuller 
5979-42005-0013	train-other-500	we must therefore decide upon some plan of action He smiled kindly and added in a friendly voice It was unnecessary to tell you that Monsieur Lecoq Quite unnecessary
5979-42005-0014	train-other-500	since to you belongs the honor of having detected this fraud As for myself I confess that if I had not been warned in advance I should have been the dupe of this clever artist s talent The young detective bowed
none	none	 a blush of modesty tinged his cheeks 
5979-42005-0015	train-other-500	but a gleam of pleased vanity sparkled in his eyes What a difference between this friendly benevolent magistrate
none	none	 and M d Escorval 
5979-42005-0016	train-other-500	so taciturn and haughty This man at least understood appreciated and encouraged him and it was with a common theory and an equal ardor that they were about to devote themselves to a search for the truth
none	none	 Scarcely had Lecoq allowed these thoughts to flit across his mind than he reflected that his satisfaction was after all a trifle premature 
5979-42005-0017	train-other-500	and that success was still extremely doubtful With this chilling conclusion presence of mind returned Turning toward the magistrate he exclaimed You will recollect sir
5979-42005-0018	train-other-500	that the Widow Chupin mentioned a son of hers a certain Polyte Yes Why not question him
none	none	 He must know all the frequenters of the Poivriere 
5979-42005-0019	train-other-500	and might perhaps give us valuable information regarding Gustave Lacheneur and the murderer himself As he is not in solitary confinement he has probably heard of his mother s arrest but it seems to me impossible
5979-42005-0020	train-other-500	that he should suspect our present perplexity Ah you are a hundred times right exclaimed the magistrate I ought to have thought of that myself In his position he can scarcely have been tampered with as yet
5979-42005-0021	train-other-500	and I ll have him up here to morrow morning I will also question his wife
none	none	 Turning to his clerk M Segmuller added Quick Goguet 
5979-42005-0022	train-other-500	prepare a summons in the name of the wife of Hippolyte Chupin and address an order to the governor of the Depot to produce her husband But night was coming on It was already too dark to see to write
5979-42005-0023	train-other-500	and accordingly the clerk rang the bell for lights Just as the messenger who brought the lamps turned to leave the room a rap was heard at the door Immediately afterward the governor of the Depot entered
5979-42005-0024	train-other-500	During the past twenty four hours this worthy functionary had been greatly perplexed concerning the mysterious prisoner
none	none	 he had placed in secret cell No three 
5979-42005-0025	train-other-500	and he now came to the magistrate for advice regarding him I come to ask said he if I am still to retain the prisoner May in solitary confinement Yes
5979-42005-0026	train-other-500	Although I fear fresh attacks of frenzy I dislike to confine him in the strait jacket again Leave him free in his cell
none	none	 replied M Segmuller 
5979-42005-0027	train-other-500	and tell the keepers to watch him well but to treat him kindly
none	none	 By the provisions of Article six hundred thirteen of the Code 
5979-42005-0028	train-other-500	accused parties are placed in the custody of the government but the investigating magistrate is allowed to adopt such measures concerning them as he may deem necessary for the interest of the prosecution
none	none	 The governor bowed assent to M Segmuller s instructions 
5979-42005-0029	train-other-500	and then added You have doubtless succeeded in establishing the prisoner s identity Unfortunately I have not The governor shook his head with a knowing air In that case said he
5979-42005-0030	train-other-500	my conjectures were correct It seems to me evident that this man is a criminal of the worst description an old offender certainly and one who has the strongest interest in concealing his identity
5979-42005-0031	train-other-500	You will find that you have to deal with a man
none	none	 who has been sentenced to the galleys for life 
5979-42005-0032	train-other-500	and who has managed to escape from Cayenne Perhaps you are mistaken Hum I shall be greatly surprised if such should prove the case I must admit
none	none	 that my opinion in this matter is identical with that of M Gevrol 
5979-42005-0033	train-other-500	the most experienced and the most skilful of our inspectors I agree with him in thinking that young detectives are often overzealous and run after fantoms originated in their own brains Lecoq
none	none	 crimson with wrath 
5979-42005-0034	train-other-500	was about to make an angry response
none	none	 when M Segmuller motioned to him to remain silent 
5979-42005-0035	train-other-500	Then with a smile on his face the magistrate replied to the governor Upon my word my dear friend he said the more I study this affair the more convinced I am of the correctness of the theory advanced by the
none	none	 overzealous detective 
5979-42005-0036	train-other-500	But after all I am not infallible and I shall depend upon your counsel and assistance Oh I have means of verifying my assertion interrupted the governor
none	none	 and I hope before the end of the next twenty four hours that our man will have been identified 
5979-42005-0037	train-other-500	either by the police or by one of his fellow prisoners With these words he took his leave Scarcely had he done so than Lecoq sprang to his feet The young detective was furious
5979-42005-0038	train-other-500	You see that Gevrol already speaks ill of me he is jealous Ah well what does that matter to you If you succeed you will have your revenge If you are mistaken then I am mistaken too
none	none	 Then as it was already late M Segmuller confided to Lecoq s keeping the various articles the latter had accumulated in support of his theory 
5979-42005-0039	train-other-500	He also placed in his hands the diamond earring the owner of which must be discovered and the letter signed Lacheneur which had been found in the pocket of the spurious soldier
none	none	 Having given him full instructions he asked him to make his appearance promptly on the morrow and then dismissed him saying Now go and may good luck attend you XIV Long narrow and low of ceiling having on the one side a row of windows looking on to a small courtyard and on the other a range of doors each with a number on its central panel thus reminding one of some corridor in a second rate hotel such is the Galerie d Instruction at the Palais de Justice whereby admittance is gained into the various rooms occupied by the investigating magistrates Even in the daytime when it is thronged with prisoners witnesses and guards it is a sad and gloomy place But it is absolutely sinister of aspect at night time when deserted and only dimly lighted by the smoky lamp of a solitary attendant waiting for the departure of some magistrate whom business has detained later than usual Although Lecoq was not sensitive to such influences he made haste to reach the staircase and thus escape the echo of his footsteps which sounded most drearily in the silence and darkness pervading the gallery Finding an open window on the floor below he looked out to ascertain the state of the weather The temperature was much milder the snow had altogether disappeared and the pavement was almost dry A slight haze illumined by the ruddy glare of the street lamps hung like a purple mantle over the city The streets below were full of animation vehicles were rolling rapidly to and fro and the footways were too narrow for the bustling crowd which now that the labors of the day were ended was hastening homeward or in search of pleasure The sight drew a sigh from the young detective And it is in this great city he murmured in the midst of this world of people that I must discover the traces of a person I don t even know Is it possible to accomplish such a feat The feeling of despondency that had momentarily surprised him was not however of long duration Yes it is possible cried an inward voice Besides it must be done your future depends upon it Where there s a will there s a way Ten seconds later he was in the street more than ever inflamed with hope and courage Unfortunately however man can only place organs of limited power at the disposal of his boundless desires and Lecoq had not taken twenty steps along the streets before he became aware that if the spirit was willing the flesh was weak His limbs trembled and his head whirled Nature was asserting her rights during the last forty eight hours the young detective had taken scarcely a moment s rest and he had moreover now passed an entire day without food Am I going to be ill he thought sinking on to a bench And he groaned inwardly on recapitulating all that he wished to do that evening If he dealt only with the more important matters must he not at once ascertain the result of Father Absinthe s search after the man who had recognized one of the victims at the Morgue test the prisoner s assertions regarding the box of clothes left at one of the hotels surrounding the Northern Railway Station and last but not the least must he not procure the address of Polyte Chupin s wife in order to serve her with the summons to appear before M Segmuller Under the power of urgent necessity he succeeded in triumphing over his attack of weakness and rose murmuring I will go first to the Prefecture and to the Morgue then I will see But he did not find Father Absinthe at the Prefecture and no one could give any tidings of him He had not been there at all during the day Nor could any one indicate even vaguely the abode of the Widow Chupin s daughter in law On the other hand however Lecoq met a number of his colleagues who laughed and jeered at him unmercifully Ah you are a shrewd fellow they said it seems that you have just made a wonderful discovery and it s said you are going to be decorated with the Legion of Honor Gevrol s influence betrayed itself everywhere The jealous inspector had taken pains to inform all his colleagues and subordinates that poor Lecoq crazed by ambition persisted in declaring that a low vulgar murderer trying to escape justice was some great personage in disguise However the jeers and taunts of which Lecoq was the object had but little effect upon him and he consoled himself with the reflection that He laughs best who laughs last If he were restless and anxious as he walked along the Quai des Orfevres it was because he could not explain Father Absinthe s prolonged absence and because he feared that Gevrol mad with jealousy might attempt in some underhand way to frustrate his Lecoq s efforts to arrive at a solution of the mystery At the Morgue the young detective met with no better success than at the Prefecture After ringing three or four times one of the keepers opened the door and informed him that the bodies had not been identified and that the old police agent had not been seen since he went away early in the morning This is a bad beginning thought Lecoq I will go and get some dinner that perhaps will change the luck at all events I have certainly earned the bottle of good wine to which I intend to treat myself It was a happy thought A hearty meal washed down with a couple of glasses of Bordeaux sent new courage and energy coursing through his veins If he still felt a trifle weary the sensation of fatigue was at all events greatly diminished when he left the restaurant with a cigar between his lips Just at that moment he longed for Father Papillon s trap and sturdy steed Fortunately a cab was passing he hired it and as eight o clock was striking alighted at the corner of the square in front of the Northern Railway Station After a brief glance round he began his search for the hotel where the murderer pretended to have left a box of clothes It must be understood that he did not present himself in his official capacity Hotel proprietors fight shy of detectives and Lecoq was aware that if he proclaimed his calling he would probably learn nothing at all By brushing back his hair and turning up his coat collar he made however a very considerable alteration in his appearance and it was with a marked English accent that he asked the landlords and servants of various hostelries surrounding the station for information concerning a foreign workman named May He conducted his search with considerable address but everywhere he received the same reply We don t know such a person we haven t seen any one answering the description you give of him Any other answer would have astonished Lecoq so strongly persuaded was he that the prisoner had only mentioned the circumstances of a trunk left at one of these hotels in order to give a semblance of truth to his narrative Nevertheless he continued his investigation If he noted down in his memorandum book the names of all the hotels which he visited it was with a view of making sure of the prisoner s discomfiture when he was conducted to the neighborhood and asked to prove the truth of his story Eventually Lecoq reached the Hotel de Mariembourg at the corner of the Rue saint Quentin The house was of modest proportions but seemed respectable and well kept Lecoq pushed open the glass door leading into the vestibule and entered the office a neat brightly lighted room where he found a woman standing upon a chair her face on a level with a large bird cage covered with a piece of black silk She was repeating three or four German words with great earnestness to the inmate of the cage and was so engrossed in this occupation that Lecoq had to make considerable noise before he could attract her attention At length she turned her head and the young detective exclaimed Ah good evening madame you are much interested I see in teaching your parrot to talk It isn t a parrot replied the woman who had not yet descended from her perch but a starling and I am trying to teach it to say Have you breakfasted in German What can starlings talk Yes sir as well as you or I rejoined the woman jumping down from the chair Just then the bird as if it had understood the question cried very distinctly Camille Where is Camille But Lecoq was too preoccupied to pay any further attention to the incident Madame he began I wish to speak to the proprietor of this hotel I am the proprietor Oh very well I was expecting a mechanic from Leipsic to meet me here in Paris To my great surprise he has not made his appearance and I came to inquire if he was stopping here His name is May May repeated the hostess thoughtfully May He ought to have arrived last Sunday evening The woman s face brightened Wait a moment said she Was this friend of yours a middle aged man of medium size of very dark complexion wearing a full beard and having very bright eyes Lecoq could scarcely conceal his agitation This was an exact description of the supposed murderer Yes he stammered that is a very good portrait of the man Ah well he came here on Shrove Sunday in the afternoon He asked for a cheap room and I showed him one on the fifth floor The office boy was not here at the time and he insisted upon taking his trunk upstairs himself I offered him some refreshments but he declined to take anything saying that he was in a great hurry and he went away after giving me ten francs as security for the rent Where is he now inquired the young detective Dear me that reminds me replied the woman He has never returned and I have been rather anxious about him Paris is such a dangerous place for strangers It is true he spoke French as well as you or I but what of that Yesterday evening I gave orders that the commissary of police should be informed of the matter Yesterday the commissary Yes Still I don t know whether the boy obeyed me I had forgotten all about it Allow me to ring for the boy and ask him A bucket of iced water falling upon Lecoq s head could not have astonished him more than did this announcement from the proprietress of the Hotel de Mariembourg Had the prisoner indeed told the truth Was it possible Gevrol and the governor of the prison were right then and M Segmuller and he Lecoq were senseless fools pursuing a fantom These ideas flashed rapidly through the young detective s brain But he had no time for reflection The boy who had been summoned now made his appearance and proved to be a big overgrown lad with frank chubby face Fritz asked his mistress did you go to the commissary s office Yes madame What did he say He was not in but I spoke to his secretary M Casimir who said you were not to worry yourself as the man would no doubt return But he has not returned The boy rejoined with a movement of the shoulders that plainly implied How can I help that You hear sir said the hostess apparently thinking the importunate questioner would now withdraw Such however was not Lecoq s intention and he did not even move though he had need of all his self possession to retain his English accent This is very annoying said he very I am even more anxious and undecided than I was before since I am not certain that this is the man I am seeking for Unfortunately sir I can tell you nothing more calmly replied the landlady Lecoq reflected for a moment knitting his brows and biting his lips as if he were trying to discover some means of solving the mystery In point of fact he was seeking for some adroit phrase which might lead this woman to show him the register in which all travelers are compelled to inscribe their full names profession and usual residence At the same time however it was necessary that he should not arouse her suspicions But madame said he at last can t you remember the name this man gave you Was it May Try to recollect if that was the name May May Ah I have so many things to remember But now I think of it and the name must be entered in my book which if it would oblige you I can show you It is in the drawer of my writing table Whatever can I have done with my keys And while the hostess who seemed to possess about as much intelligence as her starling was turning the whole office upside down looking for her keys Lecoq scrutinized her closely She was about forty years of age with an abundance of light hair and a very fair complexion She was well preserved that is to say she was plump and healthy in appearance her glance was frank and unembarrassed her voice was clear and musical and her manners were pleasing and entirely free from affectation Ah she eventually exclaimed I have found those wretched keys at last So saying she opened her desk took out the register laid it on the table and began turning over the leaves At last she found the desired page Sunday February twentieth said she Look sir here on the seventh line May no Christian name foreign artist coming from Leipsic without papers While Lecoq was examining this record with a dazed air the woman exclaimed Ah now I can explain how it happened that I forgot the man s name and strange profession foreign artist I did not make the entry myself Who made it then The man himself while I was finding ten francs to give him as change for the louis he handed me You can see that the writing is not at all like that of other entries Lecoq had already noted this circumstance which seemed to furnish an irrefutable argument in favor of the assertions made by the landlady and the prisoner Are you sure he asked that this is the man s handwriting In his anxiety he had forgotten his English accent The woman noticed this at once for she drew back and cast a suspicious glance at the pretended foreigner I know what I am saying she said indignantly And now this is enough isn t it Knowing that he had betrayed himself and thoroughly ashamed of his lack of coolness Lecoq renounced his English accent altogether Excuse me he said if I ask one more question Have you this man s trunk in your possession Certainly You would do me an immense service by showing it to me Show it to you exclaimed the landlady angrily What do you take me for What do you want and who are you You shall know in half an hour replied the young detective realizing that further persuasion would be useless He hastily left the room ran to the Place de Roubaix jumped into a cab and giving the driver the address of the district commissary of police promised him a hundred sous over and above the regular fare if he would only make haste As might have been expected under such circumstances the poor horse fairly flew over the ground Lecoq was fortunate enough to find the commissary at his office Having given his name he was immediately ushered into the magistrate s presence and told his story in a few words It is really true that they came to inform me of this man s disappearance said the commissary Casimir told me about it this morning They came to inform you faltered Lecoq Yes yesterday but I have had so much to occupy my time Now my man how can I serve you Come with me sir compel them to show us the trunk and send for a locksmith to open it Here is the authority a search warrant given me by the investigating magistrate to use in case of necessity Let us lose no time I have a cab at the door We will start at once said the commissary The driver whipped up his horse once more and they were soon rapidly rolling in the direction of the Rue saint Quentin Now sir said the young detective permit me to ask if you know this woman who keeps the Hotel de Mariembourg Yes indeed I know her very well When I was first appointed to this district six years ago I was a bachelor and for a long while I took my meals at her table d hote Casimir my secretary boards there even now And what kind of woman is she Why upon my word my young friend Madame Milner for such is her name is a very respectable widow highly esteemed by her neighbors and having a very prosperous business If she remains a widow it is only from choice for she is very prepossessing and has plenty of suitors Then you don t think her capable of serving for the sake of a good round sum the interests of some wealthy culprit Have you gone mad interrupted the commissary What Madame Milner perjure herself for the sake of money Haven t I just told you that she is an honest woman and that she is very well off Besides she informed me yesterday that this man was missing so Lecoq made no reply the driver was pulling up they had reached their destination On seeing her obstinate questioner reappear accompanied by the commissary Madame Milner seemed to understand everything Good heavens she exclaimed a detective I might have guessed it Some crime has been committed and now my hotel has lost its reputation forever While a messenger was despatched for a locksmith the commissary endeavored to reassure and console her a task of no little difficulty and which he was some time in accomplishing At last they all went up to the missing man s room and Lecoq sprang toward the trunk Ah there was no denying it It had indeed come from Leipsic as the labels pasted upon it by the different railroad companies only too plainly proved On being opened it was moreover found to contain the various articles mentioned by the prisoner Lecoq was thunderstruck When he had seen the commissary lock the trunk and its contents up in a cupboard and take possession of the key he felt he could endure nothing more He left the room with downcast head and stumbled like a drunken man as he went down the stairs XV Mardi Gras or Shrove Tuesday was very gay that year that is to say all places of public resort were crowded When Lecoq left the Hotel de Mariembourg about midnight the streets were as full as if it had been noonday and the cafes were thronged with customers But the young detective had no heart for pleasure He mingled with the crowd without seemingly seeing it and jostled against groups of people chatting at the corners without hearing the imprecations occasioned by his awkwardness Where was he going He had no idea He walked aimlessly more disconsolate and desperate than the gambler who had staked his last hope with his last louis and lost I must yield he murmured this evidence is conclusive My presumptions were only chimeras my deductions the playthings of chance All I can now do is to withdraw with the least possible damage and ridicule from the false position I have assumed Just as he reached the boulevard however a new idea entered his brain an idea of so startling a kind that he could scarcely restrain a loud exclamation of surprise What a fool I am cried he striking his hand violently against his forehead Is it possible to be so strong in theory and yet so ridiculously weak in practise Ah I am only a child a mere novice disheartened by the slightest obstacle I meet with a difficulty and at once I lose all my courage Now let me reflect calmly What did I tell the judge about this murderer whose plan of defense so puzzles us Did I not tell him that we had to deal with a man of superior talent with a man of consummate penetration and experience a bold courageous fellow of imperturbable coolness who will do anything to insure the success of his plans Yes I told him all that and yet I give up the game in despair as soon as I meet with a single circumstance that I can not instantly explain It is evident that such a prisoner would not resort to old hackneyed commonplace expedients Time patience and research are requisite to find a flaw in his defense With such a man as he is the more appearances are against my presumptions and in favor of his narrative the more certain it is that I am right or else logic is no longer logic At this thought Lecoq burst into a hearty laugh Still continued he it would perhaps be premature to expose this theory at headquarters in Gevrol s presence He would at once present me with a certificate for admission into some lunatic asylum The young detective paused While absorbed in thought his legs obeying an instinctive impulse had brought him to his lodgings He rang the bell the door opened and he groped his way slowly up to the fourth floor He had reached his room and was about to enter when some one whom he could not distinguish in the dark called out Is that you Monsieur Lecoq Yes it s I replied the young man somewhat surprised but who are you I m Father Absinthe Oh indeed Well you are welcome I didn t recognize your voice will you come in They entered the room and Lecoq lit a candle Then the young man could see his colleague and good heavens he found him in a most pitiable condition He was as dirty and as bespattered with mud as a lost dog that has been wandering about in the rain and the mire for a week at the very least His overcoat bore the traces of frequent contact with damp walls his hat had lost its form entirely His eyes wore an anxious look and his mustache drooped despondently He spoke moreover so strangely that one might have supposed his mouth was full of sand Do you bring me bad news inquired Lecoq after a short examination of his companion Yes bad The people you were following escaped you then The old man nodded his head affirmatively It is unfortunate very unfortunate said Lecoq But it is useless to distress ourselves about it Don t be so cast down Father Absinthe To morrow between us we will repair the damage This friendly encouragement only increased the old man s evident embarrassment He blushed this veteran as if he had been a schoolgirl and raising his hands toward heaven he exclaimed Ah you wretch didn t I tell you so Why what is the matter with you inquired Lecoq Father Absinthe made no reply Approaching a looking glass that hung against the wall he surveyed himself reproachfully and began to heap cruel insults upon the reflection of his features You old good for nothing he exclaimed You vile deserter have you no shame left You were entrusted with a mission were you not And how have you fulfilled it You have got drunk you old wretch so drunk as to have lost your wits Ah you shan t escape punishment this time for even if M Lecoq is indulgent you shan t taste another drop for a week Yes you old sot you shall suffer for this escapade Come come said Lecoq you can sermonize by and by Now tell me your story Ah I am not proud of it believe me However never mind No doubt you received the letter in which I told you I was going to follow the young men who seemed to recognize Gustave Yes yes go on Well as soon as they entered the cafe into which I had followed them they began drinking probably to drive away their emotion After that they apparently felt hungry At all events they ordered breakfast I followed their example The meal with coffee and beer afterward took up no little time and indeed a couple of hours had elapsed before they were ready to pay their bill and go Good I supposed they would now return home Not at all They walked down the Rue Dauphin and I saw them enter another cafe Five minutes later I glided in after them and found them already engaged in a game of billiards At this point Father Absinthe hesitated it is no easy task to recount one s blunders to the very person who has suffered by them I seated myself at a little table he eventually resumed and asked for a newspaper I was reading with one eye and watching with the other when a respectable looking man entered and took a seat beside me As soon as he had seated himself he asked me to let him have the paper when I had finished with it I handed it to him and then we began talking about the weather At last he proposed a game of bezique I declined but we afterward compromised the matter by having a game of piquet The young men you understand were still knocking the balls about We began by playing for a glass of brandy each I won My adversary asked for his revenge and we played two games more I still kept on winning He insisted upon another game and again I won and still I drank and drank again Go on go on Ah here s the rub After that I remember nothing nothing either about the man I had been playing with or the young men It seems to me however that I recollect falling asleep in the cafe and that a long while afterward a waiter came and woke me and told me to go Then I must have wandered about along the quays until I came to my senses and decided to go to your lodgings and wait on the stairs until you returned To Father Absinthe s great surprise Lecoq seemed rather thoughtful than angry What do you think about this chance acquaintance of yours papa asked the young detective I think he was following me while I was following the others and that he entered the cafe with the view of making me drunk What was he like Oh he was a tall stoutish man with a broad red face and a flat nose and he was very unpretending and affable in manner It was he exclaimed Lecoq He Who Why the accomplice the man whose footprints we discovered the pretended drunkard a devil incarnate who will get the best of us yet if we don t keep our eyes open Don t you forget him papa and if you ever meet him again But Father Absinthe s confession was not ended Like most devotees he had reserved the worst sin for the last But that s not all he resumed and as it s best to make a clean breast of it I will tell you that it seems to me this traitor talked about the affair at the Poivriere and that I told him all we had discovered and all we intended to do Lecoq made such a threatening gesture that the old tippler drew back in consternation You wretched man exclaimed the young detective to betray our plans to the enemy But his calmness soon returned If at first sight the evil seemed to be beyond remedy on further thought it had a good side after all It sufficed to dispel all the doubts that had assailed Lecoq s mind after his visit to the Hotel de Mariembourg However quoth our hero this is not the time for deliberation I am overcome with fatigue take a mattress from the bed for yourself my friend and let us get a little sleep Lecoq was a man of considerable forethought Hence before going to bed he took good care to wind up his alarm so that it might wake him at six o clock With that to warn us he remarked to his companion as he blew out the candle there need be no fear of our missing the coach He had not however made allowance for his own extreme weariness or for the soporific effect of the alcoholic fumes with which his comrade s breath was redolent When six o clock struck at the church of saint Eustache the young detective s alarm resounded faithfully enough with a loud and protracted whir Shrill and sonorous as was the sound it failed however to break the heavy sleep of the two detectives They would indeed in all probability have continued slumbering for several hours longer if at half past seven a sturdy fist had not begun to rap loudly at the door With one bound Lecoq was out of bed amazed at seeing the bright sunlight and furious at the futility of his precautions Come in he cried to his early visitor He had no enemies to fear and could without danger sleep with his door unlocked In response to his call Father Papillon s shrewd face peered into the room Ah it is my worthy coachman exclaimed Lecoq Is there anything new Excuse me but it s the old affair that brings me here replied our eccentric friend the cabman You know the thirty francs those wretched women paid me Really I shan t sleep in peace till you have worked off the amount by using my vehicle Our drive yesterday lasted two hours and a half which according to the regular fare would be worth a hundred sous so you see I ve still more than twelve hours at your disposal That is all nonsense my friend Possibly but I am responsible for it and if you won t use my cab I ve sworn to spend those twelve hours waiting outside your door So now make up your mind He gazed at Lecoq beseechingly and it was evident that a refusal would wound him keenly Very well replied Lecoq I will take you for the morning only I ought to warn you that we are starting on a long journey Oh Cocotte s legs may be relied upon My companion and myself have business in your own neighborhood It is absolutely necessary for us to find the Widow Chupin s daughter in law and I hope we shall be able to obtain her address from the police commissary of the district where the Poivriere is situated Very well we will go wherever you wish I am at your orders A few moments later they were on their way Papillon s features wore an air of self satisfied pride as sitting erect on his box he cracked his whip and encouraged the nimble Cocotte The vehicle could not have got over the ground more rapidly if its driver had been promised a hundred sous gratuity Father Absinthe alone was sad He had been forgiven by Lecoq but he could not forget that he an old police agent had been duped as easily as if he had been some ignorant provincial The thought was humiliating and then in addition he had been fool enough to reveal the secret plans of the prosecution He knew but too well that this act of folly had doubled the difficulties of Lecoq s task The long drive in Father Papillon s cab was not a fruitless one The secretary of the commissary of police for the thirteenth arrondissement informed Lecoq that Polyte Chupin s wife lived with her child in the suburbs in the Rue de la Butte aux Cailles He could not indicate the precise number but he described the house and gave them some information concerning its occupants The Widow Chupin s daughter in law a native of Auvergne had been bitterly punished for preferring a rakish Parisian ragamuffin to one of the grimy charcoal burners of the Puy de Dome She was hardly more than twelve years of age when she first came to Paris and obtained employment in a large factory After ten years privation and constant toil she had managed to amass sou by sou the sum of three thousand francs Then her evil genius threw Polyte Chupin across her path She fell in love with this dissipated selfish rascal and he married her for the sake of her little hoard As long as the money lasted that is for some three or four months matters went on pleasantly enough But as soon as the last franc had been spent Polyte left his wife and complacently resumed his former life of idleness thieving and debauchery When at times he returned home it was merely with the view of robbing his wife of what little money she might have saved in the mean while and periodically she uncomplainingly allowed him to despoil her of the last penny of her earnings Horrible to relate this unworthy rascal even tried to trade on her good looks Here however he met with a strenuous resistance a resistance which excited not merely his own ire but also the hatred of the villain s mother that old hag the Widow Chupin The result was that Polyte s wife was subjected to such incessant cruelty and persecution that one night she was forced to fly with only the rags that covered her The Chupins mother and son believed perhaps that starvation would effect what their horrible threats and insidious counsel had failed to accomplish Their shameful expectations were not however gratified In mentioning these facts to Lecoq the commissary s secretary added that they had become widely known and that the unfortunate creature s force of character had won for her general respect Among those she frequented moreover she was known by the nickname of Toinon the Virtuous a rather vulgar but at all events sincere tribute to her worth Grateful for this information Lecoq returned to the cab The Rue de la Butte aux Cailles whither Papillon was now directed to drive proved to be very unlike the Boulevard Malesherbes and one brief glance sufficed to show that opulence had not here fixed its abode Luck seemed for the moment to have turned in Lecoq s favor At all events when he and Father Absinthe alighted at the corner of the street it so happened that the very first person the young detective questioned concerning the virtuous Toinon was well acquainted with her whereabouts The house in which she resided was pointed out and Lecoq was instructed to go upstairs to the top floor and knock at the door in front of him With such precise directions the two detectives speedily reached Madame Polyte Chupin s abode This proved to be a cold and gloomy attic of medium size windowless but provided with a small skylight A straw pallet a broken table two chairs and a few plain kitchen utensils constituted the sole appointments of this miserable garret But in spite of the occupant s evident poverty everything was neat and clean and to use a forcible expression that fell from Father Absinthe one could have eaten off the floor The two detectives entered and found a woman busily engaged in making a heavy linen sack She was seated in the centre of the room directly under the skylight so that the sun s rays might fall upon her work At the sight of two strangers she half rose from her chair surprised and perhaps a little frightened but when Lecoq had explained that they desired a few moments conversation with her she gave up her own seat and drawing the second chair from a corner invited both detectives to sit down Lecoq complied but Father Absinthe declared that he preferred to remain standing With a single glance Lecoq took an inventory of the humble abode and so to speak appraised the woman She was short stout and of commonplace appearance Her forehead was extremely low being crowned by a forest of coarse black hair while the expression of her large black eyes set very close together recalled the look of patient resignation one so often detects in ill treated and neglected animals Possibly in former days she might have possessed that fleeting attraction called the beaute du diable but now she looked almost as old as her wretched mother in law Sorrow and privation excessive toil and ill treatment had imparted to her face a livid hue reddening her eyes and stamping deep furrows round about her temples Still there was an attribute of native honesty about her which even the foul atmosphere in which she had been compelled to live had not sufficed to taint Her little boy furnished a striking contrast He was pale and puny his eyes gleamed with a phosphorescent brilliancy and his hair was of a faded flaxen tint One little circumstance attracted both detectives attention If the mother was attired in an old thin faded calico dress the child was warmly clad in stout woolen material Madame you have doubtless heard of a dreadful crime committed in your mother in law s establishment began Lecoq in a soft voice Alas yes sir replied Toinon the Virtuous quickly adding But my husband could not have been implicated in it since he is in prison Did not this objection forestalling as it were suspicion betray the most horrible apprehensions Yes I am aware of that replied Lecoq Polyte was arrested a fortnight ago Yes and very unjustly sir replied the neglected wife He was led astray by his companions wicked desperate men He is so weak when he has taken a glass of wine that they can do whatever they like with him If he were only left to himself he would not harm a child You have only to look at him As she spoke the virtuous Toinon turned her red and swollen eyes to a miserable photograph hanging against the wall This blotchy smudge portrayed an exceedingly ugly dissipated looking young man afflicted with a terrible squint and whose repulsive mouth was partially concealed by a faint mustache This rake of the barrieres was Polyte Chupin And yet despite his unprepossessing aspect there was no mistaking the fact that this unfortunate woman loved him had always loved him besides he was her husband A moment s silence followed her indication of the portrait an act which clearly revealed how deeply she worshiped her persecutor and during this pause the attic door slowly and softly opened Not of itself however for suddenly a man s head peered in The intruder whoever he was instantly withdrew uttering as he did so a low exclamation The door was swiftly closed again the key which had been left on the outside grated in the lock and the occupants of the garret could hear hurried steps descending the stairs Lecoq was sitting with his back to the door and could not therefore see the intruder s face Quickly as he had turned he had failed to see who it was and yet he was far from being surprised at the incident Intuition explained its meaning That must have been the accomplice he cried Thanks to his position Father Absinthe had seen the man s face Yes said he yes it was the same man who made me drink with him yesterday With a bound both detectives threw themselves against the door exhausting their strength in vain attempts to open it It resisted all their efforts for it was of solid oak having been purchased by the landlord from some public building in process of demolition and it was moreover furnished with a strong and massive fastening Help us cried Father Absinthe to the woman who stood petrified with astonishment give us a bar a piece of iron a nail anything The younger man was making frantic efforts to push back the bolt or to force the lock from the wood He was wild with rage At last having succeeded in forcing the door open they dashed out in pursuit of their mysterious adversary On reaching the street they eagerly questioned the bystanders Having described the man as best they could they found two persons who had seen him enter the house of Toinon the Virtuous and a third who had seen him as he left Some children who were playing in the middle of the street added that he had run off in the direction of the Rue du Moulin des Pres as fast as his legs could carry him It was in this street near the corner of the Rue de la Butte aux Cailles that Lecoq had left old Papillon waiting with the cab Let us hasten there proposed Father Absinthe perhaps Papillon can give us some information But Lecoq shook his head despondently He would go no further It would be of no use he said He had sufficient presence of mind to turn the key in the lock and that saved him He is at least ten minutes in advance of us and we should never overtake him Father Absinthe could not restrain his anger He looked upon this mysterious accomplice who had so cruelly duped him as a personal enemy and he would willingly have given a month s pay to be able to lay his hand on his shoulder Lecoq was quite as angry as his subordinate and his vanity was likewise wounded he felt however that coolness and deliberation were necessary Yes said he thoughtfully he s a shrewd and daring fellow a perfect demon He doesn t remain idle If we are working he s at work too No matter what side I turn I find him on the defensive He foiled you papa in your effort to obtain a clue concerning Gustave s identity and he made me appear a fool in arranging that little comedy at the Hotel de Mariembourg His diligence has been wonderful He has hitherto been in advance of us everywhere and this fact explains the failures that have attended all my efforts Here we arrive before him But if he came here it was because he scented danger Hence we may hope Now let us get back and question Polyte s wife Alas poor Toinon the Virtuous did not understand the affair at all She had remained upstairs holding her child by the hand and leaning over the baluster her mind in great perplexity and her eyes and ears on the alert As soon as she perceived the two detectives coming up the stairs again she hastened down to meet them In the name of heaven what does this all mean she asked Whatever has happened But Lecoq was not the man to tell his business on a landing with inquisitive ears all around him and before he answered Toinon he made her go up into her own garret and securely close the door We started in pursuit of a man who is implicated in the murders at the Poivriere he said one who came here hoping to find you alone who was frightened at seeing us A murderer faltered Toinon with clasped hands What could he want of me Who knows It is very probable that he is one of your husband s friends Oh sir Why did you not tell me just now that Polyte had some very undesirable acquaintances But don t be alarmed this does not compromise him in the least Besides you can very easily clear him of all suspicion How In what way Oh tell me at once Merely by answering me frankly and by assisting me to find the guilty party Now among your husband s friends don t you know any who might be capable of such a deed Give me the names of his acquaintances The poor woman s hesitation was evident undoubtedly she had been present at many sinister cabals and had been threatened with terrible punishment if she dared to disclose the plans formed by Polyte or his associates You have nothing to fear said Lecoq encouragingly and I promise you no one shall ever know that you have told me a word Very probably you can tell me nothing more than I know already I have heard a great deal about your former life and the brutality with which Polyte and his mother have treated you My husband has never treated me brutally said the young woman indignantly besides that matter would only concern myself And your mother in law She is perhaps a trifle quick tempered but in reality she has a good heart Then if you were so happy at the Widow Chupin s house why did you fly from it Toinon the Virtuous turned scarlet to the very roots of her hair I left for other reasons she replied There were always a great many drunken men about the house and sometimes when I was alone some of them tried to carry their pleasantry too far You may say that I have a solid fist of my own and that I am quite capable of protecting myself That s true But while I was away one day some fellows were wicked enough to make this child drink to such an excess that when I came home I found him as stiff and cold as if he were dead It was necessary to fetch a doctor or else She suddenly paused her eyes dilated From red she turned livid and in a hoarse unnatural voice she cried Toto wretched child Lecoq looked behind him and shuddered 
6081_42010_000010_000002	train-clean-100	He understood everything 
none	none	This child not yet five years old had stolen up behind him and ferreting in the pockets of his overcoat had rifled them of their contents Ah well yes exclaimed the unfortunate mother bursting into tears That s how it was Directly the child was out of my sight they used to take him into town They took him into the crowded streets and taught him to pick people s pockets and bring them everything he could lay his hands on If the child was detected they were angry with him and beat him and if he succeeded they gave him a sou to buy some sweets and kept what he had taken The luckless Toinon hid her face in her hands and sobbed in an almost unintelligible voice Ah I did not wish my little one to be a thief But what this poor creature did not tell was that the man who had led the child out into the streets to teach him to steal was his own father and her husband the ruffian Polyte Chupin The two detectives plainly understood however that such was the case and the father s crime was so horrible and the woman s grief so great that familiar as they were with all the phases of crime their very hearts were touched Lecoq s main thought however was to shorten this painful scene The poor mother s emotion was a sufficient guarantee of her sincerity Listen said he with affected harshness Two questions only and then I will leave you Was there a man named Gustave among the frequenters of the Poivriere No sir I m quite sure there wasn t Very well But Lacheneur you must know Lacheneur Yes sir I know him The young police agent could not repress an exclamation of delight At last thought he I have a clue that may lead me to the truth What kind of man is he he asked with intense anxiety Oh he is not at all like the other men who come to drink at my mother in law s shop I have only seen him once but I remember him perfectly It was on a Sunday He was in a cab He stopped at the corner of the waste ground and spoke to Polyte When he went away my husband said to me Do you see that old man there He will make all our fortunes I thought him a very respectable looking gentleman That s enough interrupted Lecoq Now it is necessary for you to tell the investigating magistrate all you know about him I have a cab downstairs Take your child with you if you like but make haste come come quickly XVI The extreme uncertainty of the result was another attraction for M Segmuller s investigating mind Given the magnitude of the difficulties that were to be overcome he rightly considered that if his efforts proved successful he would have achieved a really wonderful victory And assisted by such a man as Lecoq who had a positive genius for his calling and in whom he recognized a most valuable auxiliary he really felt confident of ultimate success Even on returning home after the fatiguing labors of the day he did not think of freeing himself from the burden of responsibility in relation to the business he had on hand or of driving away care until the morrow He dined in haste and as soon as he had swallowed his coffee began to study the case with renewed ardor He had brought from his office a copy of the prisoner s narrative which he attentively perused not once or twice but several times seeking for some weak point that might be attacked with a probability of success He analyzed every answer and weighed one expression after another striving as he did so to find some flaw through which he might slip a question calculated to shatter the structure of defense He worked thus far into the night and yet he was on his legs again at an early hour in the morning By eight o clock he was not merely dressed and shaved he had not merely taken his matutinal chocolate and arranged his papers but he was actually on his way to the Palais de Justice He had quite forgotten that his own impatience was not shared by others In point of fact the Palais de Justice was scarcely awake when he arrived there The doors had barely opened The attendants were busy sweeping and dusting or changing their ordinary garments for their official costumes Some of them standing in the windows of the long dressing room were shaking and brushing the judges and advocates gowns while in the great hall several clerks stood in a group chaffing each other while waiting for the arrival of the head registrar and the opening of the investigation offices M Segmuller thought that he had better begin by consulting the public prosecutor but he discovered that this functionary had not yet arrived Angry and impatient he proceeded to his own office and with his eyes fixed on the clock growled at the slowness of the minute hand Just after nine o clock Goguet the smiling clerk put in an appearance and speedily learned the kind of humor his master was in Ah you ve come at last gruffly ejaculated M Segmuller momentarily oblivious of the fact that he himself scarcely ever arrived before ten and that a quarter past nine was certainly early for his clerk Goguet s curiosity had indeed prompted him to hurry to the Palais still although well aware that he did not deserve a reprimand he endeavored to mumble an excuse an excuse cut short by M Segmuller in such unusually harsh tones that for once in a way Goguet s habitual smile faded from his face It s evident thought he that the wind s blowing from a bad quarter this morning with which reflection he philosophically put on his black sleeves and going to his table pretended to be absorbed in the task of mending his pens and preparing his paper In the mean while M Segmuller who was usually calmness personified and dignity par excellence paced restlessly to and fro At times he would sit down and then suddenly spring to his feet again gesticulating impatiently as he did so Indeed he seemed unable to remain quiet for a moment The prosecution is evidently making no headway thought the clerk May s prospects are encouraging Owing to the magistrate s harsh reception the idea delighted him and indeed letting his rancor have the upper hand Goguet actually offered up a prayer that the prisoner might get the better of the fight From half past nine till ten o clock M Segmuller rang for his messenger at least five times and each time he asked him the same questions Are you sure that M Lecoq has not been here this morning Inquire If he has not been here he must certainly have sent some one or else have written to me Each time the astonished doorkeeper replied No one has been here and there is no letter for you Five identical negative answers to the same inquiries only increased the magistrate s wrath and impatience It is inconceivable he exclaimed Here I am upon coals of fire and that man dares to keep me waiting Where can he be At last he ordered a messenger to go and see if he could not find Lecoq somewhere in the neighborhood perhaps in some restaurant or cafe At all events he must be found and brought back immediately said he When the man had started M Segmuller began to recover his composure We must not lose valuable time he said to his clerk I was to examine the widow Chupin s son I had better do so now Go and tell them to bring him to me Lecoq left the order at the prison In less than a quarter of an hour Polyte entered the room From head to foot from his lofty silk cap to his gaudy colored carpet slippers he was indeed the original of the portrait upon which poor Toinon the Virtuous had lavished such loving glances And yet the photograph was flattering The lens had failed to convey the expression of low cunning that distinguished the man s features the impudence of his leering smile and the mingled cowardice and ferocity of his eyes which never looked another person in the face Nor could the portrait depict the unwholesome livid pallor of his skin the restless blinking of his eyelids and the constant movement of his thin lips as he drew them tightly over his short sharp teeth There was no mistaking his nature one glance and he was estimated at his worth When he had answered the preliminary questions telling the magistrate that he was thirty years of age and that he had been born in Paris he assumed a pretentious attitude and waited to see what else was coming But before proceeding with the real matter in hand M Segmuller wished to relieve the complacent scoundrel of some of his insulting assurance Accordingly he reminded Polyte in forcible terms that his sentence in the affair in which he was now implicated would depend very much upon his behavior and answers during the present examination Polyte listened with a nonchalant and even ironical air In fact this indirect threat scarcely touched him Having previously made inquiries he had ascertained that he could not be condemned to more than six months imprisonment for the offense for which he had been arrested and what did a month more or less matter to him The magistrate who read this thought in Polyte s eyes cut his preamble short Justice said he now requires some information from you concerning the frequenters of your mother s establishment There are a great many of them sir answered Polyte in a harsh voice Do you know one of them named Gustave No sir To insist would probably awaken suspicion in Polyte s mind accordingly M Segmuller continued You must however remember Lacheneur Lacheneur No this is the first time I ve heard that name Take care The police have means of finding out a great many things The scapegrace did not flinch I am telling the truth sir he retorted What interest could I possibly have in deceiving you Scarcely had he finished speaking than the door suddenly opened and Toinon the Virtuous entered the room carrying her child in her arms On perceiving her husband she uttered a joyful exclamation and sprang toward him But Polyte stepping back gave her such a threatening glance that she remained rooted to the spot It must be an enemy who pretends that I know any one named Lacheneur cried the barriere bully I should like to kill the person who uttered such a falsehood Yes kill him I will never forgive it The messenger whom M Segmuller had instructed to go in search of Lecoq was not at all displeased with the errand for it enabled him to leave his post and take a pleasant little stroll through the neighborhood 
6081_42010_000002_000001	train-clean-100	He first of all proceeded to the Prefecture of Police going the longest way round as a matter of course but on reaching his destination he could find no one who had seen the young detective 
none	none	Accordingly M Segmuller s envoy retraced his steps and leisurely sauntered through the restaurants cafes and wine shops installed in the vicinity of the Palais de Justice and dependent on the customers it brought them Being of a conscientious turn of mind he entered each establishment in succession and meeting now and again various acquaintances he felt compelled to proffer and accept numerous glasses of the favorite morning beverage white wine Turn which way he would however loiter as long as he might there were still no signs of Lecoq He was returning in haste a trifle uneasy on account of the length of his absence when he perceived a cab pull up in front of the Palais gateway A second glance and oh great good fortune he saw Lecoq Father Absinthe and the virtuous Toinon alight from this very vehicle His peace of mind at once returned and it was in a very important and somewhat husky tone that he delivered the order for Lecoq to follow him without a minute s delay M Segmuller has asked for you a number of times said he He has been extremely impatient and he is in a very bad humor so you may expect to have your head snapped off in the most expeditious manner 
6081_42010_000004_000000	train-clean-100	Lecoq smiled as he went up the stairs 
6081_42010_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Was he not bringing with him the most potent of justifications 
6081_42010_000004_000002	train-clean-100	He thought of the agreeable surprise he had in store for the magistrate and fancied he could picture the sudden brightening of that functionary s gloomy face 
6081_42010_000005_000000	train-clean-100	And yet fate so willed it that the doorkeeper s message and his urgent appeal that Lecoq should not loiter on the way produced the most unfortunate results 
none	none	Believing that M Segmuller was anxiously waiting for him Lecoq saw nothing wrong in opening the door of the magistrate s room without previously knocking and being anxious to justify his absence he yielded moreover to the impulse that led him to push forward the poor woman whose testimony might prove so decisive When he saw however that the magistrate was not alone and when he recognized Polyte Chupin the original of the photograph in the man M Segmuller was examining his stupefaction became intense 
6081_42010_000005_000003	train-clean-100	He instantly perceived his mistake and understood its consequences 
none	none	There was only one thing to be done 
6081_42010_000006_000001	train-clean-100	He must prevent any exchange of words between the two 
none	none	Accordingly springing toward Toinon and seizing her roughly by the arm he ordered her to leave the room at once 
6081_42010_000006_000003	train-clean-100	But the poor creature was quite overcome and trembled like a leaf 
6081_42010_000006_000004	train-clean-100	Her eyes were fixed upon her unworthy husband and the happiness she felt at seeing him again shone plainly in her anxious gaze 
6081_42010_000006_000005	train-clean-100	Just for one second and then she caught his withering glance and heard his words of menace Terror stricken she staggered back and then Lecoq seized her around the waist and lifting her with his strong arms carried her out into the passage 
none	none	The whole scene had been so brief that M Segmuller was still forming the order for Toinon to be removed from the room when he found the door closed again and himself and Goguet alone with Polyte Ah ah thought the smiling clerk in a flutter of delight this is something new But as these little diversions never made him forget his duties he leaned toward the magistrate and asked Shall I take down the last words the witness uttered Certainly replied M Segmuller and word for word if you please 
6081_42010_000009_000000	train-clean-100	He paused the door opened again this time to admit the magistrate s messenger who timidly and with a rather guilty air handed his master a note and then withdrew 
none	none	This note scribbled in pencil by Lecoq on a leaf torn from his memorandum book gave the magistrate the name of the woman who had just entered his room and recapitulated briefly but clearly the information obtained in the Rue de la Butte aux Cailles That young fellow thinks of everything murmured M Segmuller The meaning of the scene that had just occurred was now explained to him He understood everything He bitterly regretted this unfortunate meeting at the same time casting the blame on his own impatience and lack of caution which as soon as the messenger had started in search of Lecoq had induced him to summon Polyte Chupin Although he could not conceal from himself the enormous influence this seemingly trivial incident might have still he would not allow himself to be cast down but prepared to resume his examination of Polyte Chupin in hopes of yet obtaining the information he desired Let us proceed he said to Polyte who had not moved since his wife had been taken from the room being to all appearances sublimely indifferent to everything passing around him 
6081_42010_000012_000001	train-clean-100	To the magistrate s proposal he carelessly nodded assent 
none	none	Was that your wife who came in just now asked M Segmuller Yes
6081_42010_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 She wished to embrace you and you repulsed her 
6081_42010_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 I didn t repulse her 
6081_42010_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 You kept her at a distance at all events 
6081_42010_000017_000001	train-clean-100	If you had a spark of affection in your nature you would at least have looked at your child which she held out to you 
6081_42010_000017_000002	train-clean-100	Why did you behave in that manner 
6081_42010_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 It wasn t the time for sentiment 
6081_42010_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 You are not telling the truth 
6081_42010_000019_000001	train-clean-100	You simply desired to attract her attention to influence her evidence 
6081_42010_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 I I influence her evidence 
6081_42010_000020_000001	train-clean-100	I don t understand you 
6081_42010_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 But for that supposition your words would have been meaningless 
6081_42010_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 What words 
6081_42010_000023_000000	train-clean-100	The magistrate turned to his clerk Goguet said he read the last remark you took down 
none	none	In a monotonous voice the smiling clerk repeated I should like to kill the person who dared to say that I knew Lacheneur Well then insisted M Segmuller what did you mean by that It s very easy to understand sir M Segmuller rose
6081_42010_000027_000001	train-clean-100	 Don t prevaricate any longer he said 
none	none	You certainly ordered your wife not to say anything about Lacheneur 
6081_42010_000027_000003	train-clean-100	That s evident 
none	none	Why did you do so 
6081_42010_000027_000005	train-clean-100	What are you afraid of her telling us Do you suppose the police are ignorant of your acquaintance with Lacheneur of your conversation with him when he came in a cab to the corner of the waste ground near your mother s wine shop and of the hopes of fortune you based upon his promises 
6081_42010_000027_000006	train-clean-100	Be guided by me confess everything while there is yet time and abandon the present course which may lead you into serious danger 
none	none	One may be an accomplice in more ways than one As these words fell on Polyte s ears it was evident his impudence and indifference had received a severe shock 
6081_42010_000028_000001	train-clean-100	He seemed confounded and hung his head as if thoroughly abashed 
6081_42010_000028_000002	train-clean-100	Still he preserved an obstinate silence and the magistrate finding that this last thrust had failed to produce any effect gave up the fight in despair 
6081_42010_000028_000003	train-clean-100	He rang the bell and ordered the guard to conduct the witness back to prison and to take every precaution to prevent him seeing his wife again 
none	none	When Polyte had departed Lecoq reentered the room
6081_42010_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 Ah sir said he despondently to think that I didn t draw out of this woman everything she knew when I might have done so easily 
none	none	But I thought you would be waiting for me and made haste to bring her here 
6081_42010_000029_000003	train-clean-100	I thought I was acting for the best 
none	none	Never mind the misfortune can be repaired
6081_42010_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 No sir no Since she has seen her husband it is quite impossible to get her to speak 
6081_42010_000031_000001	train-clean-100	She loves that rascal intensely and he has a wonderful influence over her 
none	none	You heard what he said He threatened her with death if she breathed a word about Lacheneur and she is so terrified that there is no hope of making her speak Lecoq s apprehension was based on fact as M Segmuller himself perceived the instant Toinon the Virtuous again set foot in his office The poor creature seemed nearly heartbroken and it was evident she would have given her life to retract the words that had escaped her when first questioned by Lecoq Polyte s threat had aroused the most sinister apprehensions in her mind 
6081_42010_000032_000002	train-clean-100	Not understanding his connection with the affair she asked herself if her testimony might not prove his death warrant 
none	none	Accordingly she answered all M Segmuller s questions with no or I don t know and retracted everything she had previously stated to Lecoq 
6081_42010_000032_000004	train-clean-100	She swore that she had been misunderstood that her words had been misconstrued and vowed on her mother s memory that she had never heard the name of Lacheneur before 
none	none	At last she burst into wild despairing sobs and pressed her frightened child against her breast What could be done to overcome this foolish obstinacy as blind and unreasoning as a brute s M Segmuller hesitated
6081_42010_000033_000002	train-clean-100	 You may retire my good woman said he kindly after a moment s pause but remember that your strange silence injures your husband far more than anything you could say 
6081_42010_000034_000000	train-clean-100	She left the room or rather she rushed wildly from it as though only too eager to escape and the magistrate and the detective exchanged glances of dismay and consternation 
none	none	I said so before thought Goguet the prisoner knows what he s about I would be willing to bet a hundred to one in his favor A French investigating magistrate is possessed of almost unlimited powers No one can hamper him no one can give him orders The entire police force is at his disposal One word from him and twenty agents or a hundred if need be search Paris ransack France or explore Europe If there be any one whom he believes able to throw light upon an obscure point he simply sends an order to that person to appear before him and the man must come even if he lives a hundred leagues away Such is the magistrate such are his powers On the other hand the prisoner charged with a crime but as yet un convicted is confined unless his offense be of a trivial description in what is called a secret cell He is so to say cut off from the number of the living He knows nothing of what may be going on in the world outside He can not tell what witnesses may have been called or what they may have said and in his uncertainty he asks himself again and again how far the prosecution has been able to establish the charges against him Such is the prisoner s position and yet despite the fact that the two adversaries are so unequally armed the man in the secret cell not unfrequently wins the victory If he is sure that he has left behind him no proof of his having committed the crime if he has no guilty antecedents to be afraid of he can impregnable in a defense of absolute denial brave all the attacks of justice Such was at this moment the situation of May the mysterious murderer as both M Segmuller and Lecoq were forced to admit with mingled grief and anger They had hoped to arrive at a solution of the problem by examining Polyte Chupin and his wife and they had been disappointed for the prisoner s identity remained as problematical as ever And yet exclaimed the magistrate impatiently these people know something about this matter and if they would only speak But they won t What motive is it that keeps them silent This is what we must discover Who will tell us the price that has been promised Polyte Chupin for his silence What recompense can he count upon It must be a great one for he is braving real danger Lecoq did not immediately reply to the magistrate s successive queries but it was easy to see from his knit brows that his mind was hard at work You ask me sir he eventually remarked what reward has been promised Chupin I ask on my part who can have promised him this reward Who has promised it Why plainly the accomplice who has beaten us on every point Yes rejoined Lecoq I suppose it must have been he It certainly looks like his handiwork now what artifice can he have used We know how he managed to have an interview with the Widow Chupin but how has he succeeded in getting at Polyte who is in prison closely watched The young detective s insinuation vague as it was did not escape M Segmuller What do you mean asked the latter with an air of mingled surprise and indignation You can t suppose that one of the keepers has been bribed Lecoq shook his head in a somewhat equivocal manner I mean nothing he replied I don t suspect any one All I want is information Has Chupin been forewarned or not Yes of course he has Then if that point is admitted it can only be explained in two ways Either there are informers in the prison or else Chupin has been allowed to see some visitor These suppositions evidently worried M Segmuller who for a moment seemed to hesitate between the two opinions then suddenly making up his mind he rose from his chair took up his hat and said This matter must be cleared up Come with me Monsieur Lecoq A couple of minutes later the magistrate and the detective had reached the Depot which is connected with the Palais de Justice by a narrow passage especially reserved for official use The prisoners morning rations had just been served to them and the governor was walking up and down the courtyard in the company of Inspector Gevrol As soon as he perceived M Segmuller he hastened toward him and asked if he had not come about the prisoner May As the magistrate nodded assent the governor at once added Well I was only just now telling Inspector Gevrol that I was very well satisfied with May s behavior It has not only been quite unnecessary to place him in the strait waistcoat again but his mood seems to have changed entirely He eats with a good appetite he is as gay as a lark and he constantly laughs and jests with his keeper Gevrol had pricked up his ears when he heard himself named by the governor and considering this mention to be a sufficient introduction he thought there would be no impropriety in his listening to the conversation Accordingly he approached the others and noted with some satisfaction the troubled glances which Lecoq and the magistrate exchanged M Segmuller was plainly perplexed May s gay manner to which the governor of the Depot alluded might perhaps have been assumed for the purpose of sustaining his character as a jester and buffoon it might be due to a certainty of defeating the judicial inquiry or who knows the prisoner had perhaps received some favorable news from outside With Lecoq s last words still ringing in his ears it is no wonder that the magistrate should have dwelt on this last supposition Are you quite sure he asked that no communication from outside can reach the inmates of the secret cells The governor of the Depot was cut to the quick by M Segmuller s implied doubt What were his subordinates suspected Was his own professional honesty impugned He could not help lifting his hands to heaven in mute protest against such an unjust charge Am I sure he exclaimed Then you can never have visited the secret cells You have no idea then of their situation you are unacquainted with the triple bolts that secure the doors the grating that shuts out the sunlight to say nothing of the guard who walks beneath the windows day and night Why a bird couldn t even reach the prisoners in those cells Such a description was bound to reassure the most skeptical mind and M Segmuller breathed again Now that I am easy on that score said he I should like some information about another prisoner a fellow named Chupin who isn t in the secret cells I want to know if any visitor came for him yesterday I must speak to the registrar replied the governor before I can answer you with certainty Wait a moment though here comes a man who can perhaps tell us He is usually on guard at the entrance Here Ferraud this way The man to whom the governor called hastened to obey the summons Do you know whether any one asked to see the prisoner Chupin yesterday Yes sir I went to fetch Chupin to the parlor myself And who was his visitor eagerly asked Lecoq wasn t he a tall man very red in the face Excuse me sir the visitor was a lady his aunt at least so Chupin told me Neither M Segmuller nor Lecoq could restrain an exclamation of surprise What was she like they both asked at the same time She was short replied the attendant with a very fair complexion and light hair she seemed to be a very respectable woman It must have been one of the female fugitives who escaped from the Widow Chupin s hovel exclaimed Lecoq Gevrol hitherto an attentive listener burst into a loud laugh Still that Russian princess said he Neither the magistrate nor the young detective relished this unseasonable jest You forget yourself sir said M Segmuller severely You forget that the sneers you address to your comrade also apply to me The General saw that he had gone too far and while glancing hatefully at Lecoq he mumbled an apology to the magistrate The latter did not apparently hear him for bowing to the governor he motioned Lecoq to follow him away Run to the Prefecture of Police he said as soon as they were out of hearing and ascertain how and under what pretext this woman obtained permission to see Polyte Chupin XVII On his way back to his office M Segmuller mentally reviewed the position of affairs and came to the conclusion that as he had failed to take the citadel of defense by storm he must resign himself to a regular protracted siege He was exceedingly annoyed at the constant failures that had attended all Lecoq s efforts for time was on the wing and he knew that in a criminal investigation delay only increased the uncertainty of success The more promptly a crime is followed by judicial action the easier it is to find the culprit and prove his guilt The longer investigation is delayed the more difficult it becomes to adduce conclusive evidence In the present instance there were various matters that M Segmuller might at once attend to With which should he begin Ought he not to confront May the Widow Chupin and Polyte with the bodies of their victims Such horrible meetings have at times the most momentous results and more than one murderer when unsuspectedly brought into the presence of his victim s lifeless corpse has changed color and lost his assurance Then there were other witnesses whom M Segmuller might examine Papillon the cab driver the concierge of the house in the Rue de Bourgogne where the two women flying from the Poivriere had momentarily taken refuge as well as a certain Madame Milner landlady of the Hotel de Mariembourg In addition it would also be advisable to summon with the least possible delay some of the people residing in the vicinity of the Poivriere together with some of Polyte s habitual companions and the landlord of the Rainbow where the victims and the murderer had apparently passed the evening of the crime Of course there was no reason to expect any great revelations from any of these witnesses still they might know something they might have an opinion to express and in the present darkness one single ray of light however faint might mean salvation Obeying the magistrate s orders Goguet the smiling clerk had just finished drawing up at least a dozen summonses when Lecoq returned from the Prefecture M Segmuller at once asked him the result of his errand Ah sir replied the young detective I have a fresh proof of that mysterious accomplice s skill The permit that was used yesterday to see young Chupin was in the name of his mother s sister a woman named Rose Pitard A visiting card was given her more than a week ago in compliance with a request indorsed by the commissary of police of her district The magistrate s surprise was so intense that it imparted to his face an almost ludicrous expression Is this aunt also in the plot he murmured I don t think so replied Lecoq shaking his head At all events it wasn t she who went to the prison parlor yesterday The clerks at the Prefecture remember the widow s sister very well and gave me a full description of her She s a woman over five feet high with a very dark complexion and very wrinkled and weatherbeaten about the face She s quite sixty years old whereas yesterday s visitor was short and fair and not more than forty five If that s the case interrupted M Segmuller this visitor must be one of our fugitives I don t think so Who do you suppose she was then Why the landlady of the Hotel de Mariembourg that clever woman who succeeded so well in deceiving me But she had better take care There are means of verifying my suspicions The magistrate scarcely heard Lecoq s last words so enraged was he at the inconceivable audacity and devotion displayed by so many people all of whom were apparently willing to run the greatest risks so long as they could only assure the murderer s incognito But how could the accomplice have known of the existence of this permit he asked after a pause Oh nothing could be easier sir replied Lecoq When the Widow Chupin and the accomplice had that interview at the station house near the Barriere d Italie they both realized the necessity of warning Polyte While trying to devise some means of getting to him the old woman remembered her sister s visiting card and the man made some excuse to borrow it Yes such must be the case said M Segmuller approvingly It will be necessary to ascertain however And I will ascertain interrupted Lecoq with a resolute air if you will only intrust the matter to me sir If you will authorize me I will have two spies on the watch before to night one in the Rue de la Butte aux Cailles and the other at the door of the Hotel de Mariembourg If the accomplice ventured to visit Toinon or Madame Milner he would be arrested and then we should have our turn However there was no time to waste in vain words and idle boasting Lecoq therefore checked himself and took up his hat preparatory to departure Now said he I must ask you sir for my liberty if you have any orders you will find a trusty messenger in the corridor Father Absinthe one of my colleagues I want to find out something about Lacheneur s letter and the diamond earring Go then replied M Segmuller and good luck to you Good luck Yes indeed Lecoq looked for it If up to the present moment he had taken his successive defeats good humoredly it was because he believed that he had a talisman in his pocket which was bound to insure ultimate victory I shall be very stupid if I can t discover the owner of such a valuable jewel he soliloquized referring to the diamond earring And when I find the owner I shall at the same time discover our mysterious prisoner s identity The first step to be taken was to ascertain whom the earring had been bought from It would naturally be a tedious process to go from jeweler to jeweler and ask Do you know this jewel was it set by you and if so whom did you sell it to But fortunately Lecoq was acquainted with a man whose knowledge of the trade might at once throw light on the matter This individual was an old Hollander named Van Numen who as a connoisseur in precious stones was probably without his rival in Paris He was employed by the Prefecture of Police as an expert in all such matters He was considered rich Despite his shabby appearance he was rightly considered rich and in point of fact he was indeed far more wealthy than people generally supposed Diamonds were his especial passion and he always had several in his pocket in a little box which he would pull out and open at least a dozen times an hour just as a snuff taker continually produces his snuffbox This worthy man greeted Lecoq very affably He put on his glasses examined the jewel with a grimace of satisfaction and in the tone of an oracle remarked That stone is worth eight thousand francs and it was set by Doisty in the Rue de la Paix Twenty minutes later Lecoq entered this well known jeweler s establishment Van Numen had not been mistaken Doisty immediately recognized the earring which had indeed come from his shop But whom had he sold it to He could not recollect for it had passed out of his hands three or four years before Wait a moment though said he I will just ask my wife who has a wonderful memory Madame Doisty truly deserved this eulogium A single glance at the jewel enabled her to say that she had seen this earring before and that the pair had been purchased from them by the Marchioness d Arlange You must recollect she added turning to her husband that the Marchioness only gave us nine thousand francs on account and that we had all the trouble in the world to make her pay the balance Her husband did remember this circumstance and in recording his recollection he exchanged a significant glance with his wife Now said the detective I should like to have this marchioness s address She lives in the Faubourg saint Germain replied Madame Doisty near the Esplanade des Invalides Lecoq had refrained from any sign of satisfaction while he was in the jeweler s presence But directly he had left the shop he evinced such delirious joy that the passers by asked themselves in amazement if he were not mad He did not walk but fairly danced over the stones gesticulating in the most ridiculous fashion as he addressed this triumphant monologue to the empty air At last said he this affair emerges from the mystery that has enshrouded it At last I reach the veritable actors in the drama the exalted personages whose existence I had suspected Ah Gevrol my illustrious General you talked about a Russian princess but you will be obliged to content yourself with a simple marchioness But the vertigo that had seized the young detective gradually disappeared His good sense reasserted itself and looking calmly at the situation he felt that he should need all his presence of mind penetration and sagacity to bring the expedition to a successful finish What course should he pursue on entering the marchioness s presence in order to draw from her a full confession and to obtain full particulars of the murder as well as the murderer s name It will be best to threaten her to frighten her into confession he soliloquized If I give her time for reflection I shall learn nothing He paused in his cogitations for he had reached the residence of the Marchioness d Arlange a charming mansion with a courtyard in front and garden in the rear Before entering he deemed it advisable to obtain some information concerning the inmates It is here then he murmured that I am to find the solution of the enigma Here behind these embroidered curtains dwells the frightened fugitive of the other night What agony of fear must torture her since she has discovered the loss of her earring For more than an hour standing under a neighbor s porte cochere Lecoq remained watching the house He would have liked to see the face of any one but the time passed by and not even a shadow could be detected behind the curtain not even a servant passed across the courtyard At last losing patience the young detective determined to make inquiries in the neighborhood for he could not take a decisive step without obtaining some knowledge of the people he was to encounter While wondering where he could obtain the information he required he perceived on the opposite side of the street the keeper of a wine shop smoking on his doorstep At once approaching and pretending that he had forgotten an address Lecoq politely asked for the house where Marchioness d Arlange resided Without a word and without condescending to take his pipe from his mouth the man pointed to the mansion which Lecoq had previously watched There was a way however to make him more communicative namely to enter the shop call for something to drink and invite the landlord to drink as well This was what Lecoq did and the sight of two well filled glasses unbound as by enchantment the man s hitherto silent tongue The young detective could not have found a better person to question for this same individual had been established in the neighborhood for ten years and enjoyed among the servants of the aristocratic families here residing a certain amount of confidence I pity you if you are going to the marchioness s house to collect a bill he remarked to Lecoq You will have plenty of time to learn the way here before you see your money You will only be another of the many creditors who never let her bell alone The deuce Is she as poor as that Poor Why every one knows that she has a comfortable income without counting this house But when one spends double one s income every year you know The landlord stopped short to call Lecoq s attention to two ladies who were passing along the street one of them a woman of forty dressed in black the other a girl half way through her teens There quoth the wine seller goes the marchioness s granddaughter Mademoiselle Claire with her governess Mademoiselle Smith Lecoq s head whirled Her granddaughter he stammered Yes the daughter of her deceased son if you prefer it How old is the marchioness then At least sixty but one would never suspect it She is one of those persons who live a hundred years And what an old wretch she is too She would think no more of knocking me over the head than I would of emptying this glass of wine Excuse me interrupted Lecoq but does she live alone in that great house Yes that is with her granddaughter the governess and two servants But what is the matter with you This last question was not uncalled for for Lecoq had turned deadly white The magic edifice of his hopes had crumbled beneath the weight of this man s words as completely as if it were some frail house of cards erected by a child He had only sufficient strength to murmur Nothing nothing at all Then as he could endure this torture of uncertainty no longer he went toward the marchioness s house and rang the bell The servant who came to open the door examined him attentively and then announced that Madame d Arlange was in the country He evidently fancied that Lecoq was a creditor But the young detective insisted so adroitly giving the lackey to understand so explicitly that he did not come to collect money and speaking so earnestly of urgent business that the servant finally admitted him to the hall saying that he would go and see if madame had really gone out Fortunately for Lecoq she happened to be at home and an instant afterward the valet returned requesting the young detective to follow him After passing through a large and magnificently furnished drawing room they reached a charming boudoir hung with rose colored curtains where sitting by the fireside in a large easy chair Lecoq found an old woman tall bony and terrible of aspect her face loaded with paint and her person covered with ornaments The aged coquette was Madame the Marchioness who for the time being was engaged in knitting a strip of green wool She turned toward her visitor just enough to show him the rouge on one cheek and then as he seemed rather frightened a fact flattering to her vanity she spoke in an affable tone Ah well young man said she what brings you here In point of fact Lecoq was not frightened but he was intensely disappointed to find that Madame d Arlange could not possibly be one of the women who had escaped from the Widow Chupin s hovel on the night of the murder There was nothing about her appearance that corresponded in the least degree with the descriptions given by Papillon Remembering the small footprints left in the snow by the two fugitives the young detective glanced moreover at the marchioness s feet just perceivable beneath her skirt and his disappointment reached its climax when he found that they were truly colossal in size Well are you dumb inquired the old lady raising her voice Without making a direct reply Lecoq produced the precious earring and placing it upon the table beside the marchioness remarked I bring you this jewel madame which I have found and which I am told belongs to you Madame d Arlange laid down her knitting and proceeded to examine the earring It is true she said after a moment that this ornament formerly belonged to me It was a fancy I had about four years ago and it cost me dear at least twenty thousand francs Ah Doisty the man who sold me those diamonds must make a handsome income But I had a granddaughter to educate and pressing need of money compelled me to sell them To whom asked Lecoq eagerly Eh exclaimed the old lady evidently shocked at his audacity you are very inquisitive upon my word Excuse me madame but I am anxious to find the owner of this valuable ornament Madame d Arlange regarded her visitor with an air of mingled curiosity and surprise Such honesty said she Oh oh And of course you don t hope for a sou by way of reward Madame Good good There is not the least need for you to turn as red as a poppy young man I sold these diamonds to a great Austrian lady the Baroness de Watchau And where does this lady reside At the Pere la Chaise probably since she died about a year ago Ah these women of the present day an extra waltz or the merest draft and it s all over with them In my time after each gallop we girls used to swallow a tumbler of sweetened wine and sit down between two open doors And we did very well as you see But madame insisted Lecoq the Baroness de Watchau must have left some one behind her a husband or children No one but a brother who holds a court position at Vienna and who could not leave even to attend the funeral He sent orders that all his sister s personal property should be sold not even excepting her wardrobe and the money sent to him Lecoq could not repress an exclamation of disappointment How unfortunate he murmured Why asked the old lady Under these circumstances the diamond will probably remain in your hands and I am rejoiced that it should be so It will be a fitting reward for your honesty Madame d Arlange was naturally not aware that her remark implied the most exquisite torture for Lecoq Ah if it should be as she said if he should never find the lady who had lost this costly jewel Smarting under the marchioness s unintended irony he would have liked to apostrophize her in angry terms but it could not be for it was advisable if not absolutely necessary that he should conceal his true identity Accordingly he contrived to smile and even stammered an acknowledgment of Madame d Arlange s good wishes Then as if he had no more to expect he made her a low bow and withdrew This new misfortune well nigh overwhelmed him One by one all the threads upon which he had relied to guide him out of this intricate labyrinth were breaking in his hands In the present instance he could scarcely be the dupe of some fresh comedy for if the murderer s accomplice had taken Doisty the jeweler into his confidence he would have instructed him to say that the earring had never come from his establishment and that he could not consequently tell whom it had been sold to On the contrary however Doisty and his wife had readily given Madame d Arlange s name and all the circumstances pointed in favor of their sincerity Then again there was good reason to believe in the veracity of the marchioness s assertions They were sufficiently authenticated by a significant glance which Lecoq had detected between the jeweler and his wife The meaning of this glance could not be doubted It implied plainly that both husband and wife were of opinion that in buying these earrings the marchioness engaged in one of those little speculations which are more common than many people might suppose among ladies moving in high class society Being in urgent want of ready money she had bought on credit at a high price to sell for cash at a loss As Lecoq was anxious to investigate the matter as far as possible he returned to Doisty s establishment and by a plausible pretext succeeded in gaining a sight of the books in which the jeweler recorded his transactions He soon found the sale of the earrings duly recorded specified by Madame Doisty at the date both in the day book and the ledger Madame d Arlange first paid nine thousand francs on account and the balance of the purchase money an equivalent sum had been received in instalments at long intervals subsequently Now if it had been easy for Madame Milner to make a false entry in her traveler s registry at the Hotel de Mariembourg it was absurd to suppose that the jeweler had falsified all his accounts for four years Hence the facts were indisputable and yet the young detective was not satisfied He hurried to the Faubourg Saint Honore to the house formerly occupied by the Baroness de Watchau and there found a good natured concierge who at once informed him that after the Baroness s death her furniture and personal effects had been taken to the great auction mart in the Rue Drouot the sale being conducted by M Petit the eminent auctioneer Without losing a minute Lecoq hastened to this individual s office M Petit remembered the Watchau sale very well it had made quite a sensation at the time and on searching among his papers he soon found a long catalogue of the various articles sold Several lots of jewelry were mentioned with the sums paid and the names of the purchasers but there was not the slightest allusion to these particular earrings When Lecoq produced the diamond he had in his pocket the auctioneer could not remember that he had ever seen it though of course this was no evidence to the contrary for as he himself remarked so many articles passed through his hands However this much he could declare upon oath the baroness s brother her only heir had preserved nothing not so much as a pin s worth of his sister s effects although he had been in a great hurry to receive the proceeds which amounted to the pleasant sum of one hundred and sixty seven thousand five hundred and thirty francs all expenses deducted Everything this lady possessed was sold inquired Lecoq Everything And what is the name of this brother of hers Watchau also The baroness had probably married one of her relatives Until last year her brother occupied a very prominent diplomatic position I think he now resides at Berlin Certainly this information would not seem to indicate that the auctioneer had been tampered with and yet Lecoq was not satisfied It is very strange he thought as he walked toward his lodgings that whichever side I turn in this affair I find mention of Germany The murderer comes from Leipsic Madame Milner must be a Bavarian and now here is an Austrian baroness It was too late to make any further inquiries that evening and Lecoq went to bed but the next morning at an early hour he resumed his investigations with fresh ardor There now seemed only one remaining clue to success the letter signed Lacheneur which had been found in the pocket of the murdered soldier This letter judging from the half effaced heading at the top of the note paper must have been written in some cafe on the Boulevard Beaumarchais To discover which precise cafe would be mere child s play and indeed the fourth landlord to whom Lecoq exhibited the letter recognized the paper as his But neither he nor his wife nor the young lady at the counter nor the waiters nor any of the customers present at the time had ever once heard mention made of this singular name Lacheneur And now what was Lecoq to do Was the case utterly hopeless Not yet Had not the spurious soldier declared that this Lacheneur was an old comedian Seizing upon this frail clue as a drowning man clutches at the merest fragment of the floating wreck Lecoq turned his steps in another direction and hurried from theatre to theatre asking every one from doorkeeper to manager Don t you know an actor named Lacheneur Alas one and all gave a negative reply at times indulging in some rough joke at the oddity of the name And when any one asked the young detective what the man he was seeking was like what could he reply His answer was necessarily limited to the virtuous Toinon s phrase I thought him a very respectable looking gentleman This was not a very graphic description however and besides it was rather doubtful what a woman like Polyte Chupin s wife might mean by the word respectable Did she apply it to the man s age to his personal aspect or to his apparent fortune Sometimes those whom Lecoq questioned would ask what parts this comedian of his was in the habit of playing and then the young detective could make no reply whatever He kept for himself the harassing thought that the role now being performed by the unknown Lacheneur was driving him Lecoq wild with despair Eventually our hero had recourse to a method of investigation which strange to say the police seldom employ save in extreme cases although it is at once sensible and simple and generally fraught with success It consists in examining all the hotel and lodging house registers in which the landlords are compelled to record the names of their tenants even should the latter merely sojourn under their roofs for a single night Rising long before daybreak and going to bed late at night Lecoq spent all his time in visiting the countless hotels and furnished lodgings in Paris But still and ever his search was vain He never once came across the name of Lacheneur and at last he began to ask himself if such a name really existed or if it were not some pseudonym invented for convenience He had not found it even in Didot s directory the so called Almanach Boitin where one finds all the most singular and absurd names in France those which are formed of the most fantastic mingling of syllables Still nothing could daunt him or turn him from the almost impossible task he had undertaken and his obstinate perseverance well nigh developed into monomania He was no longer subject to occasional outbursts of anger quickly repressed but lived in a state of constant exasperation which soon impaired the clearness of his mind No more theories or ingenious deductions no more subtle reasoning He pursued his search without method and without order much as Father Absinthe might have done when under the influence of alcohol Perhaps he had come to rely less upon his own shrewdness than upon chance to reveal to him the substance of the mystery of which he had as yet only detected the shadow XVIII When a heavy stone is thrown into a lake a considerable commotion ensues the water spouts and seethes and bubbles and frequently a tall jet leaps into the air But all this agitation only lasts for a moment the bubbling subsides as the circles of the passing whirlpool grow larger and larger the surface regains at last its customary smoothness and soon no trace remains of the passage of the stone now buried in the depths below So it is with the events of our daily life however momentous they may appear at the hour of their occurrence It seems as if their impressions would last for years but no they speedily sink into the depths of the past and time obliterates their passage just as the water of the lake closes over and hides the stone for an instant the cause of such commotion Thus it was that at the end of a fortnight the frightful crime committed in the Widow Chupin s drinking den the triple murder which had made all Paris shudder which had furnished the material for so many newspaper articles and the topic for such indignant comments was completely forgotten Indeed had the tragedy at the Poivriere occurred in the times of Charlemagne it could not have passed more thoroughly out of people s minds It was remembered only in three places at the Depot at the Prefecture de Police and at the Palais de Justice M Segmuller s repeated efforts had proved as unsuccessful as Lecoq s Skilful questioning ingenious insinuations forcible threats and seductive promises had proved powerless to overcome the dogged spirit of absolute denial which persistently animated not merely the prisoner May but also the Widow Chupin her son Polyte Toinon the Virtuous and Madame Milner The evidence of these various witnesses showed plainly enough that they were all in league with the mysterious accomplice but what did this knowledge avail Their attitude never varied And even if at times their looks gave the lie to their denials one could always read in their eyes an unshaken determination to conceal the truth There were moments when the magistrate overpowered by a sense of the insufficiency of the purely moral weapons at his disposal almost regretted that the Inquisition was suppressed Yes in presence of the lies that were told him lies so impudent that they were almost insults he no longer wondered at the judicial cruelties of the Middle Ages or at the use of the muscle breaking rack the flesh burning red hot pincers and other horrible instruments which by the physical torture they inflicted forced the most obstinate culprit to confess The prisoner May s manner was virtually unaltered and far from showing any signs of weakness his assurance had if anything increased as though he were confident of ultimate victory and as though he had in some way learned that the prosecution had failed to make the slightest progress On one occasion when summoned before M Segmuller he ventured to remark in a tone of covert irony Why do you keep me confined so long in a secret cell Am I never to be set at liberty or sent to the assizes Am I to suffer much longer on account of your fantastic idea that I am some great personage in disguise I shall keep you until you have confessed was M Segmuller s answer Confessed what Oh you know very well The prisoner shrugged his shoulders at these last words and then in a tone of mingled despondency and mockery retorted In that case there is no hope of my ever leaving this cursed prison It was probably this conviction that induced him to make all seeming preparations for an indefinite stay He applied for and obtained a portion of the contents of the trunk found at the Hotel de Mariembourg and evinced great joy when the various knickknacks and articles of clothing were handed over to him Thanks to the money found upon his person when arrested and deposited with the prison registrar he was moreover able to procure many little luxuries which are never denied to unconvicted prisoners no matter what may be the charges against them for they have a right to be considered as innocent until a jury has decided to the contrary To while away the time May next asked for a volume of Beranger s songs and his request being granted he spent most of the day in learning several of the ditties by heart singing them in a loud voice and with considerable taste This fancy having excited some comment he pretended that he was cultivating a talent which might be useful to him when he was set at liberty For he had no doubt of his acquittal at least so he declared and if he were anxious about the date of his trial he did not show the slightest apprehension concerning its result He was never despondent save when he spoke of his profession To all appearance he pined for the stage and in fact he almost wept when he recalled the fantastic many colored costumes clad in which he had once appeared before crowded audiences audiences that had been convulsed with laughter by his sallies of wit delivered between bursts of noisy music He seemed to have become altogether a better fellow more frank communicative and submissive He eagerly embraced every opportunity to babble about his past and over and over again did he recount the adventures of the roving life he had led while in the employ of M Simpson the showman He had of course traveled a great deal and he remembered everything he had seen possessing moreover an inexhaustible fund of amusing stories with which he entertained his custodians His manner and his words were so natural that head keepers and subordinate turnkeys alike were quite willing to give credit to his assertions The governor of the Depot alone remained unconvinced He had declared that this pretended buffoon must be some dangerous criminal who had escaped from Cayenne and who for this reason was determined to conceal his antecedents Such being this functionary s opinion he tried every means to substantiate it Accordingly during an entire fortnight May was submitted to the scrutiny of innumerable members of the police force to whom were added all the more notable private detectives of the capital No one recognized him however and although his photograph was sent to all the prisons and police stations of the empire not one of the officials could recognize his features Other circumstances occurred each of which had its influence and one and all of them speaking in the prisoner s favor For instance the second bureau of the Prefecture de Police found positive traces of the existence of a strolling artist named Tringlot who was probably the man referred to in May s story This Tringlot had been dead several years Then again inquiries made in Germany revealed the fact that a certain M Simpson was very well known in that country where he had achieved great celebrity as a circus manager In presence of this information and the negative result of the scrutiny to which May had been subjected the governor of the Depot abandoned his views and openly confessed that he had been mistaken The prisoner May he wrote to the magistrate is really and truly what he pretends to be There can be no further doubt on the subject This message it may be added was sent at Gevrol s instigation So thus it was that M Segmuller and Lecoq alone remained of their opinion This opinion was at least worthy of consideration as they alone knew all the details of the investigation which had been conducted with such strict secrecy and yet this fact was of little import It is not merely unpleasant but often extremely dangerous to struggle on against all the world and unfortunately for truth and logic one man s opinion correct though it may be is nothing in the balance of daily life against the faulty views of a thousand adversaries The May affair had soon become notorious among the members of the police force and whenever Lecoq appeared at the Prefecture he had to brave his colleagues sarcastic pleasantry Nor did M Segmuller escape scot free for more than one fellow magistrate meeting him on the stairs or in the corridor inquired with a smile what he was doing with his Casper Hauser his man in the Iron Mask in a word with his mysterious mountebank When thus assailed both M Segmuller and Lecoq could scarcely restrain those movements of angry impatience which come naturally to a person who feels certain he is in the right and yet can not prove it Ah me sometimes exclaimed the magistrate why did D Escorval break his leg Had it not been for that cursed mishap he would have been obliged to endure all these perplexities and I I should be enjoying myself like other people And I thought myself so shrewd murmured the young detective by his side Little by little anxiety did its work Magistrate and detective both lost their appetites and looked haggard and yet the idea of yielding never once occurred to them Although of very different natures they were both determined to persevere in the task they had set themselves that of solving this tantalizing enigma Lecoq indeed had resolved to renounce all other claims upon his time and to devote himself entirely to the study of the case Henceforth he said to M Segmuller I also will constitute myself a prisoner and although the suspected murderer will be unable to see me I shall not lose sight of him It so happened that there was a loft between the cell occupied by May and the roof of the prison a loft of such diminutive proportions that a man of average height could not stand upright in it This loft had neither window nor skylight and the gloom would have been intense had not a few faint sun rays struggled through the interstices of some ill adjusted tiles In this unattractive garret Lecoq established himself one fine morning just at the hour when May was taking his daily walk in the courtyard of the prison accompanied by a couple of keepers Under these circumstances there was no fear of Lecoq s movements attracting the prisoner s notice or suspicion The garret had a paved floor and first of all the young detective removed one of the stones with a pickax he had brought for the purpose Beneath this stone he found a timber beam through which he next proceeded to bore a hole of funnel shape large at the top and gradually dwindling until on piercing the ceiling of the cell it was no more than two thirds of an inch in diameter Prior to commencing his operations Lecoq had visited the prisoner s quarters and had skilfully chosen the place of the projected aperture so that the stains and graining of the beam would hide it from the view of any one below He was yet at work when the governor of the Depot and his rival Gevrol appeared upon the threshold of the loft So this is to be your observatory Monsieur Lecoq remarked Gevrol with a sneering laugh Yes sir You will not be very comfortable here I shall be less uncomfortable than you suppose I have brought a large blanket with me and I shall stretch myself out on the floor and manage to sleep here So that night and day you will have your eye on the prisoner Yes night and day Without giving yourself time to eat or drink inquired Gevrol Excuse me Father Absinthe will bring me my meals execute any errand I may have and relieve me at times if necessary The jealous General laughed but his laugh loud as it was was yet a trifle constrained Well I pity you he said Very possibly Do you know what you will look like with your eye glued to that hole Like what Tell me we needn t stand on ceremony Ah well You will look just like one of those silly naturalists who put all sorts of little insects under a magnifying glass and spend their lives in watching them Lecoq had finished his work and rose from his kneeling position You couldn t have found a better comparison General said he I owe my idea to those very naturalists you speak about so slightingly By dint of studying those little creatures as you say under a microscope these patient gifted men discover the habits and instincts of the insect world Very well then What they can do with an insect I will do with a man Oh ho said the governor of the prison considerably astonished Yes that s my plan continued Lecoq I want to learn this prisoner s secret and I will do so That I ve sworn and success must be mine for however strong his courage may be he will have his moments of weakness and then I shall be present at them I shall be present if ever his will fails him if believing himself alone he lets his mask fall or forgets his part for an instant if an indiscreet word escapes him in his sleep if his despair elicits a groan a gesture or a look I shall be there to take note of it The tone of resolution with which the young detective spoke made a deep impression upon the governor s mind For an instant he was a believer in Lecoq s theory and he was impressed by the strangeness of this conflict between a prisoner determined to preserve the secret of his identity and the agent for the prosecution equally determined to wrest it from him Upon my word my boy you are not wanting in courage and energy said he Misdirected as it may be growled Gevrol who although he spoke very slowly and deliberately was in his secret soul by no means convinced of what he said Faith is contagious and he was troubled in spite of himself by Lecoq s imperturbable assurance What if this debutant in the profession should be right and he Gevrol the oracle of the Prefecture wrong What shame and ridicule would be his portion then But once again he inwardly swore that this inexperienced youngster could be no match for an old veteran like himself and then added aloud The prefect of police must have more money than he knows what to do with to pay two men for such a nonsensical job as this Lecoq disdained to reply to this slighting remark For more than a fortnight the General had profited of every opportunity to make himself as disagreeable as possible and the young detective feared he would be unable to control his temper if the discussion continued It would be better to remain silent and to work and wait for success To succeed would be revenge enough Moreover he was impatient to see these unwelcome visitors depart believing perhaps that Gevrol was quite capable of attracting the prisoner s attention by some unusual sound As soon as they went away Lecoq hastily spread his blanket over the stones and stretched himself out upon it in such a position that he could alternately apply his eye and his ear to the aperture In this position he had an admirable view of the cell below He could see the door the bed the table and the chair only the small space near the window and the window itself were beyond his range of observation He had scarcely completed his survey when he heard the bolts rattle the prisoner was returning from his walk He seemed in excellent spirits and was just completing what was undoubtedly a very interesting story since the keeper who accompanied him lingered for a moment to hear the finish Lecoq was delighted with the success of his experiment He could hear as easily as he could see Each syllable reached his ear distinctly and he had not lost a single word of the recital which was amusing though rather coarse The turnkey soon left the cell the bolts rattled once more and the key grated in the lock After walking once or twice across his cell May took up his volume of Beranger and for an hour or more seemed completely engrossed in its contents Finally he threw himself down upon his bed Here he remained until meal time in the evening when he rose and ate with an excellent appetite He next resumed the study of his book and did not go to bed until the lights were extinguished Lecoq knew well enough that during the night his eyes would not serve him but he trusted that his ears might prove of use hoping that some telltale word might escape the prisoner s lips during his restless slumber In this expectation he was disappointed May tossed to and fro upon his pallet he sighed and one might have thought he was sobbing but not a syllable escaped his lips He remained in bed until very late the next morning but on hearing the bell sound the hour of breakfast eleven o clock he sprang from his couch with a bound and after capering about his cell for a few moments began to sing in a loud and cheerful voice the old ditty Diogene Sous ton manteau libre et content Je ris je bois sans gene The prisoner did not stop singing until a keeper entered his cell carrying his breakfast The day now beginning differed in no respect from the one that had preceded it neither did the night The same might be said of the next day and of those which followed To sing to eat to sleep to attend to his hands and nails such was the life led by this so called buffoon His manner which never varied was that of a naturally cheerful man terribly bored Such was the perfection of his acting that after six days and nights of constant surveillance Lecoq had detected nothing decisive nor even surprising And yet he did not despair He had noticed that every morning while the employees of the prison were busy distributing the prisoner s food May invariably began to sing the same ditty Evidently this song is a signal thought Lecoq What can be going on there by the window I can t see I must know to morrow Accordingly on the following morning he arranged that May should be taken on his walk at half past ten o clock and he then insisted that the governor should accompany him to the prisoner s cell That worthy functionary was not very well pleased with the change in the usual order of things What do you wish to show me he asked What is there so very curious to see Perhaps nothing replied Lecoq but perhaps something of great importance Eleven o clock sounding soon after he began singing the prisoner s song and he had scarcely finished the second line when a bit of bread no larger than a bullet adroitly thrown through the window dropped at his feet A thunderbolt falling in May s cell would not have terrified the governor as much as did this inoffensive projectile He stood in silent dismay his mouth wide open his eyes starting from their sockets as if he distrusted the evidence of his own senses What a disgrace An instant before he would have staked his life upon the inviolability of the secret cells and now he beheld his prison dishonored A communication a communication he repeated with a horrified air Quick as lightning Lecoq picked up the missile Ah murmured he I guessed that this man was in communication with his friends The young detective s evident delight changed the governor s stupor into fury Ah my prisoners are writing he exclaimed wild with passion My warders are acting as postmen By my faith this matter shall be looked into So saying he was about to rush to the door when Lecoq stopped him What are you going to do sir he asked I am going to call all the employees of this prison together and inform them that there is a traitor among them and that I must know who he is as I wish to make an example of him And if in twenty four hours from now the culprit has not been discovered every man connected with this prison shall be removed Again he started to leave the room and Lecoq this time had almost to use force to detain him Be calm sir be calm he entreated I will punish Yes yes I understand that but wait until you have regained your self possession It is quite possible that the guilty party may be one of the prisoners who assist in the distribution of food every morning What does that matter Excuse me but it matters a great deal If you noise this discovery abroad we shall never discover the truth The traitor will not be fool enough to confess his guilt We must be silent and wait We will keep a close watch and detect the culprit in the very act These objections were so sensible that the governor yielded So be it he sighed I will try and be patient But let me see the missive that was enclosed in this bit of bread Lecoq could not consent to this proposal I warned M Segmuller said he that there would probably be something new this morning and he will be waiting for me in his office We must only examine the letter in his presence This remark was so correct that the governor assented and they at once started for the Palais de Justice On their way Lecoq endeavored to convince his companion that it was wrong to deplore a circumstance which might be of incalculable benefit to the prosecution It was an illusion said he to imagine that the governor of a prison could be more cunning than the prisoners entrusted to him A prisoner is almost always a match in ingenuity for his custodians The young detective had not finished speaking when they reached the magistrate s office Scarcely had Lecoq opened the door than M Segmuller and his clerk rose from their seats They both read important intelligence in our hero s troubled face What is it eagerly asked the magistrate Lecoq s sole response was to lay the pellet of bread upon M Segmuller s desk In an instant the magistrate had opened it extracting from the centre a tiny slip of the thinnest tissue paper This he unfolded and smoothed upon the palm of his hand As soon as he glanced at it his brow contracted Ah this note is written in cipher he exclaimed with a disappointed air We must not lose patience said Lecoq quietly He took the slip of paper from the magistrate and read the numbers inscribed upon it They ran as follows two hundred thirty five fifteen three eight twenty five two sixteen two hundred eight five three hundred sixty four thirty six nineteen seven fourteen one hundred eighteen eighty four twenty three nine forty eleven ninety nine And so we shall learn nothing from this note murmured the governor Why not the smiling clerk ventured to remark There is no system of cipher which can not be read with a little skill and patience there are some people who make it their business You are right said Lecoq approvingly And I myself once had the knack of it What exclaimed the magistrate do you hope to find the key to this cipher With time yes Lecoq was about to place the paper in his breast pocket when the magistrate begged him to examine it a little further He did so and after a while his face suddenly brightened Striking his forehead with his open palm he cried I ve found it An exclamation of incredulous surprise simultaneously escaped the magistrate the governor and the clerk At least I think so added Lecoq more cautiously If I am not mistaken the prisoner and his accomplice have adopted a very simple system called the double book cipher The correspondents first agree upon some particular book and both obtain a copy of the same edition When one desires to communicate with the other he opens the book haphazard and begins by writing the number of the page Then he must find on the same page the words that will express his thoughts If the first word he wishes to write is the twentieth on the page he places number twenty after the number of the page then he begins to count one two three and so on until he finds the next word he wishes to use If this word happens to be the sixth he writes the figure six and he continues so on till he has finished his letter You see now how the correspondent who receives the note must begin He finds the page indicated and then each figure represents a word Nothing could be clearer said the magistrate approvingly If this note pursued Lecoq had been exchanged between two persons at liberty it would be folly to attempt its translation This simple system is the only one which has completely baffled inquisitive efforts simply because there is no way of ascertaining the book agreed upon But in this instance such is not the case May is a prisoner and he has only one book in his possession The Songs of Beranger Let this book be sent for The governor of the Depot was actually enthusiastic I will run and fetch it myself he interrupted But Lecoq with a gesture detained him Above all sir said he take care that May doesn t discover his book has been tampered with If he has returned from his promenade make some excuse to have him sent out of his cell again and don t allow him to return there while we are using his book Oh trust me replied the governor hastily leaving the room Less than a quarter of an hour afterward he returned carrying in triumph a little volume in thirty twomo With a trembling hand Lecoq turned to page two hundred thirty five and began to count The fifteenth word on the page was I the third afterward have the eighth following told the twenty fifth her the second your the sixteenth wishes Hence the meaning of those six numbers was I have told her your wishes The three persons who had witnessed this display of shrewdness could not restrain their admiration Bravo Lecoq exclaimed the magistrate I will no longer bet a hundred to one on May thought the smiling clerk But Lecoq was still busily engaged in deciphering the missive and soon in a voice trembling with gratified vanity he read the entire note aloud It ran as follows I have told her your wishes she submits Our safety is assured we are waiting your orders to act Hope Courage XIX Yet what a disappointment it produced after the fever of anxiety and expectation that had seized hold of everybody present This strange epistle furnished no clue whatever to the mystery and the ray of hope that had sparkled for an instant in M Segmuller s eyes speedily faded away As for the versatile Goguet he returned with increased conviction to his former opinion that the prisoner had the advantage over his accusers How unfortunate remarked the governor of the Depot with a shade of sarcasm in his voice that so much trouble and such marvelous penetration should be wasted So you think sir that I have wasted my time rejoined Lecoq in a tone of angry banter a scarlet flush mantling at the same time over his features Such is not my opinion This scrap of paper undeniably proves that if any one has been mistaken as regards the prisoner s identity it is certainly not I Very well was the reply M Gevrol and myself may have been mistaken no one is infallible But have you learned anything more than you knew before Have you made any progress Why yes Now that people know the prisoner is not what he pretends to be instead of annoying and hampering me perhaps they will assist us to discover who he really is Lecoq s tone and his allusion to the difficulties he had encountered cut the governor to the quick The knowledge that the reproof was not altogether undeserved increased his resentment and determined him to bring this discussion with an inferior to an abrupt close You are right said he sarcastically This May must be a very great and illustrious personage Only my dear Monsieur Lecoq for there is an only do me the favor to explain how such an important personage could disappear and the police not be advised of it A man of rank such as you suppose this prisoner to be usually has a family friends relatives proteges and numerous connections and yet not a single person has made any inquiry during the three weeks that this fellow May has been under my charge Come admit you never thought of that The governor had just advanced the only serious objection that could be found to the theory adopted by the prosecution He was wrong however in supposing that Lecoq had failed to foresee it for it had never once been out of the young detective s mind and he had racked his brain again and again to find some satisfactory explanation At the present moment he would undoubtedly have made some angry retort to the governor s sneering criticism as people are wont to do when their antagonists discover the weak spot in their armor had not M Segmuller opportunely intervened All these recriminations do no good he remarked calmly we can make no progress while they continue It would be much wiser to decide upon the course that is now to be pursued Thus reminded of the present situation of affairs the young detective smiled all his rancor was forgotten There is I think but one course to pursue he replied in a modest tone and I believe it will be successful by reason of its simplicity We must substitute a communication of our own composition for this one That will not be at all difficult since I have the key to the cipher I shall only be obliged to purchase a similar volume of Beranger s songs and May believing that he is addressing his accomplice will reply in all sincerity will reveal everything perhaps Excuse me interrupted the governor but how will you obtain possession of his reply Ah you ask me too much I know the way in which his letters have reached him For the rest I will watch and find a way never fear Goguet the smiling clerk could not conceal an approving grin If he had happened to have ten francs in his pocket just then he would have risked them all on Lecoq without a moment s hesitation First resumed the young detective I will replace this missive by one of my own composition To morrow at breakfast time if the prisoner gives the signal Father Absinthe shall throw the morsel of bread enclosing my note through the window while I watch the effect through the hole in the ceiling of the cell Lecoq was so delighted with this plan of his that he at once rang the bell and when the magistrate s messenger appeared he gave him half a franc and requested him to go at once and purchase some of the thinnest tissue paper When this had been procured Lecoq took his seat at the clerk s desk and provided with the volume of Beranger s songs began to compose a fresh note copying as closely as possible the forms of the figures used by the unknown correspondent The task did not occupy him more than ten minutes for fearing lest he might commit some blunder he reproduced most of the words of the original letter giving them however an entirely different meaning When completed his note read as follows I have told her your wishes she does not submit Our safety is threatened We are awaiting your orders I tremble Having acquainted the magistrate with the purport of the note Lecoq next rolled up the paper and enclosing it in the fragment of bread remarked To morrow we shall learn something new To morrow The twenty four hours that separated the young man from the decisive moment he looked forward to seemed as it were a century and he resorted to every possible expedient to hasten the passing of the time At length after giving precise instructions to Father Absinthe he retired to his loft for the night The hours seemed interminable and such was his nervous excitement that he found it quite impossible to sleep On rising at daybreak he discovered that the prisoner was already awake May was sitting on the foot of his bed apparently plunged in thought Suddenly he sprang to his feet and paced restlessly to and fro He was evidently in an unusually agitated frame of mind for he gesticulated wildly and at intervals repeated What misery My God what misery Ah my fine fellow thought Lecoq you are anxious about the daily letter you failed to receive yesterday Patience patience One of my writing will soon arrive At last the young detective heard the stir usually preceding the distribution of the food People were running to and fro sabots clicked noisily in the corridors and the keepers could be heard engaged in loud conversation By and by the prison bell began to toll It was eleven o clock and soon afterward the prisoner commenced to sing his favorite song Diogene Sous ton manteau libre et content Before he commenced the third line the slight sound caused by the fragment of bread as it fell upon the stone floor caused him to pause abruptly Lecoq at the opening in the ceiling above was holding his breath and watching with both eyes He did not miss one of the prisoner s movements not so much as the quiver of an eyelid May looked first at the window and then all round the cell as if it were impossible for him to explain the arrival of this projectile It was not until some little time had elapsed that he decided to pick it up He held it in the hollow of his hand and examined it with apparent curiosity His features expressed intense surprise and any one would have sworn that he was innocent of all complicity Soon a smile gathered round his lips and after a slight shrug of the shoulders which might be interpreted Am I a fool he hastily broke the pellet in half The sight of the paper which it contained seemed to amaze him What does all this mean wondered Lecoq The prisoner had opened the note and was examining with knitted brows the figures which were apparently destitute of all meaning to him Then suddenly rushing to the door of his cell and hammering upon it with clenched fists he cried at the top of his voice Here keeper here What do you want shouted a turnkey whose footsteps Lecoq could hear hastening along the adjoining passage I wish to speak to the magistrate Very well He shall be informed Immediately if you please I have a revelation to make He shall be sent for immediately Lecoq waited to hear no more He tore down the narrow staircase leading from the loft and rushed to the Palais de Justice to acquaint M Segmuller with what had happened What can all this mean he wondered as he darted over the pavement Are we indeed approaching a denouement This much is certain the prisoner was not deceived by my note He could only decipher it with the aid of his volume of Beranger and he did not even touch the book plainly then he hasn t read the letter M Segmuller was no less amazed than the young detective They both hastened to the prison followed by the smiling clerk who was the magistrate s inevitable shadow On their way they encountered the governor of the Depot arriving all in a flutter having been greatly excited by that important word revelation The worthy official undoubtedly wished to express an opinion but the magistrate checked him by the abrupt remark I know all about it and I am coming When they had reached the narrow corridor leading to the secret cells Lecoq passed on in advance of the rest of the party He said to himself that by stealing upon the prisoner unawares he might possibly find him engaged in surreptitiously reading the note In any case he would have an opportunity to glance at the interior of the cell May was seated beside the table his head resting on his hands At the grating of the bolt drawn by the governor himself the prisoner rose to his feet smoothed his hair and remained standing in a respectful attitude apparently waiting for the visitors to address him Did you send for me inquired the magistrate Yes sir You have I understand some revelation to make to me I have something of importance to tell you Very well these gentlemen will retire M Segmuller had already turned to Lecoq and the governor to request them to withdraw when the prisoner motioned him not to do so It is not necessary said May I am on the contrary very well pleased to speak before these gentlemen Speak then May did not wait for the injunction to be repeated Throwing his chest forward and his head back as had been his wont throughout his examinations whenever he wished to make an oratorical display he began as follows It shall be for you to say gentlemen whether I m an honest man or not The profession matters little One may perhaps act as the clown of a traveling show and yet be an honest man a man of honor Oh spare us your reflections Very well sir that suits me exactly To be brief then here is a little paper which was thrown into my cell a few minutes ago There are some numbers on it which may mean something but I have examined them and they are quite Greek to me He paused and then handing Lecoq s missive to the magistrate quietly added It was rolled up in a bit of bread This declaration was so unexpected that it struck all the officials dumb with surprise but the prisoner without seeming to notice the effect he had produced placidly continued I suppose the person who threw it made a mistake in the window I know very well that it s a mean piece of business to denounce a companion in prison It s a cowardly act and one may get into trouble by doing so still a fellow must be prudent when he s charged with murder as I am and with something very unpleasant perhaps in store for him A terribly significant gesture of severing the head from the body left no doubt whatever as to what May meant by the something very unpleasant And yet I am innocent continued May in a sorrowful reproachful tone The magistrate had by this time recovered the full possession of his faculties Fixing his eyes upon the prisoner and concentrating in one magnetic glance all his power of will he slowly exclaimed You speak falsely It was for you that this note was intended For me Then I must be the greatest of fools or why should I have sent for you to show it you For me In that case why didn t I keep it Who knew who could know that I had received it These words were uttered with such a marvelous semblance of honesty May s gaze was frank and open his voice rang so true and his reasoning was so specious that all the governor s doubts returned And what if I could prove that you are uttering a falsehood insisted M Segmuller What if I could prove it here and now You would have to lie to do so Oh pardon Excuse me I mean But the magistrate was not in a frame of mind to stickle for nicety of expression He motioned May to be silent and turning to Lecoq exclaimed Show the prisoner that you have discovered the key to his secret correspondence A sudden change passed over May s features Ah it is this agent of police who says the letter was for me he remarked in an altered tone The same agent who asserts that I am a grand seigneur Then looking disdainfully at Lecoq he added Under these circumstances there s no hope for me When the police are absolutely determined that a man shall be found guilty they contrive to prove his guilt everybody knows that And when a prisoner receives no letters an agent who wishes to show that he is corresponding knows well enough how to write to him May s features wore such an expression of marked contempt that Lecoq could scarcely refrain from making an angry reply He restrained his impulse however in obedience to a warning gesture from the magistrate and taking from the table the volume of Beranger s songs he endeavored to prove to the prisoner that each number in the note which he had shown M Segmuller corresponded with a word on the page indicated and that these various words formed several intelligible phrases This overpowering evidence did not seem to trouble May in the least After expressing the same admiration for this novel system of correspondence that a child would show for a new toy he declared his belief that no one could equal the police in such machinations What could have been done in the face of such obstinacy M Segmuller did not even attempt to argue the point but quietly retired followed by his companions Until they reached the governor s office he did not utter a word then sinking down into an armchair he exclaimed We must confess ourselves beaten This man will always remain what he is an inexplicable enigma But what is the meaning of the comedy he has just played I do not understand it at all remarked the governor Why replied Lecoq don t you see that he wished to persuade the magistrate that the first note the one that fell into the cell while you and I were there yesterday had been written by me in a mad desire to prove the truth of my theory at any cost It was a hazardous project but the importance of the result to be gained must have emboldened him to attempt it Had he succeeded I should have been disgraced and he would have remained May the stroller without any further doubt as to his identity But how could he know that I had discovered his secret correspondence and that I was watching him from the loft overhead That will probably never be explained The governor and the young detective exchanged glances of mutual distrust Eh eh thought the former yes indeed that note which fell into the cell while I was there the other day might after all have been this crafty fellow s work His Father Absinthe may have served him in the first instance just as he did subsequently While these reflections were flitting through the governor s mind Lecoq suspiciously remarked to himself Who knows but what this fool of a governor confided everything to Gevrol If he did so the General jealous as he is would not have scrupled to play one such a damaging trick His thoughts had gone no further when Goguet the smiling clerk boldly broke the silence with the trite remark What a pity such a clever comedy didn t succeed These words startled the magistrate from his reverie Yes a shameful farce said he and one I would never have authorized had I not been blinded by a mad longing to arrive at the truth Such tricks only bring the sacred majesty of justice into contempt At these bitter words Lecoq turned white with anger This was the second affront within an hour The prisoner had first insulted him and now it was the magistrate s turn I am defeated thought he I must confess it Fate is against me Ah if I had only succeeded Disappointment alone had impelled M Segmuller to utter these harsh words they were both cruel and unjust and the magistrate soon regretted them and did everything in his power to drive them from Lecoq s recollection They met every day after this unfortunate incident and every morning when the young detective came to give an account of his investigations they had a long conference together For Lecoq still continued his efforts still labored on with an obstinacy intensified by constant sneers still pursued his investigations with that cold and determined zeal which keeps one s faculties on the alert for years The magistrate however was utterly discouraged We must abandon this attempt said he All the means of detection have been exhausted I give it up The prisoner will go to the Assizes to be acquitted or condemned under the name of May I will trouble myself no more about the matter He said this but the anxiety and disappointment caused by defeat sneering criticism and perplexity as to the best course to be pursued so affected his health that he became really ill so ill that he had to take to his bed He had been confined to his room for a week or so when one morning Lecoq called to inquire after him You see my good fellow quoth M Segmuller despondently that this mysterious murderer is fatal to us magistrates Ah he is too much for us he will preserve the secret of his identity Possibly replied Lecoq At all events there is now but one way left to discover his secret we must allow him to escape and then track him to his lair This expedient although at first sight a very startling one was not of Lecoq s own invention nor was it by any means novel At all times in cases of necessity have the police closed their eyes and opened the prison doors for the release of suspected criminals And not a few dazzled by liberty and ignorant of being watched have foolishly betrayed themselves All prisoners are not like the Marquis de Lavalette protected by royal connivance and one might enumerate many individuals who have been released only to be rearrested after confessing their guilt to police spies or auxiliaries who have won their confidence Naturally however it is but seldom and only in special cases and as a last resort that such a plan is adopted Moreover the authorities only consent to it when they hope to derive some important advantage such as the capture of a whole band of criminals For instance the police perhaps arrest one of a band Now despite his criminal propensities the captured culprit often has a certain sense of honor we all know that there is honor among thieves which prompts him to refuse all information concerning his accomplices In such a case what is to be done Is he to be sent to the Assizes by himself tried and convicted while his comrades escape scot free No it is best to set him at liberty The prison doors are opened and he is told that he is free But each after step he takes in the streets outside is dogged by skilful detectives and soon at the very moment when he is boasting of his good luck and audacity to the comrades he has rejoined the whole gang find themselves caught in the snare M Segmuller knew all this and much more and yet on hearing Lecoq s proposition he made an angry gesture and exclaimed Are you mad I think not sir At all events your scheme is a most foolish one Why so sir You will recollect the famous murder of the Chaboiseaus The police soon succeeded in capturing the guilty parties but a robbery of a hundred and sixty thousand francs in bank notes and coin had been committed at the same time and this large sum of money couldn t be found The murderers obstinately refused to say where they had concealed it for of course it would prove a fortune for them if they ever escaped the gallows In the mean while however the children of the victims were ruined Now M Patrigent the magistrate who investigated the affair was the first to convince the authorities that it would be best to set one of the murderers at liberty His advice was followed and three days later the culprit was surprised unearthing the money from among a bed of mushrooms Now I believe that our prisoner Enough interrupted M Segmuller I wish to hear no more on the matter I have it seems to me forbidden you to broach the subject The young detective hung his head with a hypocritical air of submission But all the while he watched the magistrate out of the corner of his eye and noted his agitation I can afford to be silent he thought he will return to the subject of his own accord And in fact M Segmuller did return to it only a moment afterward Suppose this man were released from prison said he what would you do What would I do sir I would follow him like grim death I would not once let him out of my sight I would be his shadow And do you suppose he wouldn t discover this surveillance I should take my precautions But he would recognize you at a single glance No sir he wouldn t for I should disguise myself A detective who can t equal the most skilful actor in the matter of make up is no better than an ordinary policeman I have only practised at it for a twelvemonth but I can easily make myself look old or young dark or light or assume the manner of a man of the world or of some frightful ruffian of the barrieres I wasn t aware that you possessed this talent Monsieur Lecoq Oh I m very far from the perfection I hope to arrive at though I may venture to say that in three days from now I could call on you and talk with you for half an hour without being recognized M Segmuller made no rejoinder and it was evident to Lecoq that the magistrate had offered this objection rather in the hope of its being overruled than with the wish to see it prevail I think my poor fellow he at length observed that you are strangely deceived We have both been equally anxious to penetrate the mystery that enshrouds this strange man We have both admired his wonderful acuteness for his sagacity is wonderful so marvelous indeed that it exceeds the limits of imagination Do you believe that a man of his penetration would betray himself like an ordinary prisoner He will understand at once if he is set at liberty that his freedom is only given him so that we may surprise his secret I don t deceive myself sir May will guess the truth of course I m quite aware of that Very well Then what would be the use of attempting what you propose I have come to this conclusion replied Lecoq May will find himself strangely embarrassed even when he s set free He won t have a sou in his pocket we know he has no trade so what will he do to earn a living He may struggle along for a while but he won t be willing to suffer long Man must have food and shelter and when he finds himself without a roof over his head without even a crust of bread to break he will remember that he is rich Won t he then try to recover possession of his property Yes certainly he will He will try to obtain money endeavor to communicate with his friends and I shall wait till that moment arrives Months may elapse before seeing no signs of my surveillance he may venture on some decisive step and then I will spring forward with a warrant for his arrest in my hand And what if he should leave Paris What if he should go abroad Oh I will follow him One of my aunts has left me a little land in the provinces worth about twelve thousand francs I will sell it and spend the last sou if necessary so long as I only have my revenge This man has outwitted me as if I were a child and I must have my turn And what if he should slip through your fingers Lecoq laughed like a man that was sure of himself Let him try he exclaimed I will answer for him with my life Your idea is not a bad one said M Segmuller eventually But you must understand that law and justice will take no part in such intrigues All I can promise you is my tacit approval Go therefore to the Prefecture see your superiors With a really despairing gesture the young man interrupted M Segmuller What good would it do for me to make such a proposition he exclaimed They would not only refuse my request but they would dismiss me on the spot if my name is not already erased from the roll What dismissed after conducting this case so well Ah sir unfortunately every one is not of that opinion Tongues have been wagging busily during your illness Somehow or other my enemies have heard of the last scene we had with May and impudently declare that it was I who imagined all the romantic details of this affair being eager for advancement They pretend that the only reasons to doubt the prisoner s identity are those I have invented myself To hear them talk at the Depot one might suppose that I invented the scene in the Widow Chupin s cabin imagined the accomplices suborned the witnesses manufactured the articles of conviction wrote the first note in cipher as well as the second duped Father Absinthe and mystified the governor The deuce exclaimed M Segmuller in that case what do they think of me The wily detective s face assumed an expression of intense embarrassment Ah sir he replied with a great show of reluctance they pretend that you have allowed yourself to be deceived by me and that you haven t weighed at their proper worth the proofs I ve furnished A fleeting flush mantled over M Segmuller s forehead In a word said he they think I m your dupe and a fool besides The recollection of certain sarcastic smiles he had often detected on the faces of colleagues and subordinates alike the memory of numerous covert allusions to Casper Hauser and the Man with the Iron Mask allusions which had stung him to the quick induced him to hesitate no longer Very well I will aid you Monsieur Lecoq he exclaimed I should like you to triumph over your enemies I will get up at once and accompany you to the Palais de Justice I will see the public prosecutor myself I will speak to him and plead your case for you Lecoq s joy was intense Never no never had he dared to hope for such assistance Ah after this he would willingly go through fire on M Segmuller s behalf And yet despite his inward exultation he had sufficient control over his feelings to preserve a sober face This victory must be concealed under penalty of forfeiting the benefits that might accrue from it Certainly the young detective had said nothing that was untrue but there are different ways of presenting the truth and he had perhaps exaggerated a trifle in order to excite the magistrate s rancor and win his needful assistance I suppose remarked M Segmuller who was now quite calm again no outward sign of wounded vanity being perceptible I suppose you have decided what stratagem must be employed to lull the prisoner s suspicions if he is permitted to escape I must confess I haven t given it a thought replied Lecoq Besides what good would any such stratagem do He knows too well that he is the object of suspicion not to remain on the alert Still there is one precaution which I believe absolutely necessary indispensable indeed if we wish to be successful What precaution do you mean inquired the magistrate Well sir I think an order should be given to have May transferred to another prison It doesn t in the least matter which you can select the one you please Why should we do that Because during the few days preceding his release it is absolutely necessary he should hold no communication with his friends outside and that he should be unable to warn his accomplice Then you think he s badly guarded where he is inquired M Segmuller with seeming amazement No sir I did not say that I am satisfied that since the affair of the cipher note the governor s vigilance has been unimpeachable However news from outside certainly reaches the suspected murderer at the Depot we have had material evidence full proof of that and besides The young detective paused in evident embarrassment He plainly had some idea in his head to which he feared to give expression And besides repeated the magistrate Ah well sir I will be perfectly frank with you I find that Gevrol enjoys too much liberty at the Depot he is perfectly at home there he comes and goes as he likes and no one ever thinks of asking what he is doing where he is going or what he wants No pass is necessary for his admission and he can influence the governor just as he likes Now to tell the truth I distrust Gevrol Oh Monsieur Lecoq Yes I know very well that it s a bold accusation but a man is not master of his presentiments so there it is I distrust Gevrol Did the prisoner know that I was watching him from the loft and that I had discovered his secret correspondence was he ignorant of it To my mind he evidently knew everything as the last scene we had with him proves I must say that s my own opinion interrupted M Segmuller But how could he have known it resumed Lecoq He could not have discovered it by himself I endured tortures for a while in the hope of solving the problem But all my trouble was wasted Now the supposition of Gevrol s intervention would explain everything M Segmuller had turned pale with anger Ah if I could really believe that he exclaimed if I were sure of it Have you any proofs The young man shook his head No said he I haven t but even if my hands were full of proofs I should not dare to show them I should ruin my future Ah if ever I succeed I must expect many such acts of treachery There is hatred and rivalry in every profession And mark this sir I don t doubt Gevrol s honesty If a hundred thousand francs were counted out upon the table and offered to him he wouldn t even try to release a prisoner But he would rob justice of a dozen criminals in the mere hope of injuring me jealous as he is and fearing lest I might obtain advancement How many things these simple words explained Did they not give the key to many and many an enigma which justice has failed to solve simply on account of the jealousy and rivalry that animate the detective force Thus thought M Segmuller but he had no time for further reflection That will do said he go into the drawing room for a moment I will dress and join you there I will send for a cab for we must make haste if I am to see the public prosecutor to day Less than a quarter of an hour afterward M Segmuller who usually spent considerable time over his toilet was dressed and ready to start He and Lecoq were just getting into the cab that had been summoned when a footman in a stylish livery was seen approaching Ah Jean exclaimed the magistrate how s your master Improving sir was the reply He sent me to ask how you were and to inquire how that affair was progressing There has been no change since I last wrote to him Give him my compliments and tell him that I am out again The servant bowed Lecoq took a seat beside the magistrate and the cab started off That fellow is one of D Escorval s servants remarked M Segmuller He s richer than I and can well afford to keep a footman D Escorval s ejaculated Lecoq the magistrate who Precisely He sent his man to me two or three days ago to ascertain what we were doing with our mysterious May Then M d Escorval is interested in the case Prodigiously I conclude it is because he opened the prosecution and because the case rightfully belongs to him Perhaps he regrets that it passed out of his hands and thinks that he could have managed the investigation better himself We would have done better with it if we could I would give a good deal to see him in my place But this change would not have been at all to Lecoq s taste Ah thought he such a fellow as D Escorval would never have shown me such confidence as M Segmuller He had indeed good reason to congratulate himself for that very day M Segmuller who was a man of his word a man who never rested until he had carried his plan into execution actually induced the authorities to allow May to be set at liberty and the details of this measure only remained to be decided upon As regards the proposed transfer of the suspected murderer to another prison this was immediately carried into effect and May was removed to Mazas where Lecoq had no fear of Gevrol s interference That same afternoon moreover the Widow Chupin received her conditional release There was no difficulty as regards her son Polyte He had in the mean time been brought before the correctional court on a charge of theft and to his great astonishment had heard himself sentenced to thirteen months imprisonment After this M Segmuller had nothing to do but to wait and this was the easier as the advent of the Easter holidays gave him an opportunity to seek a little rest and recreation with his family in the provinces On the day he returned to Paris the last of the recess and by chance a Sunday he was sitting alone in his library when his cook came to tell him that there was a man in the vestibule who had been sent from a neighboring register office to take the place of a servant he had recently dismissed The newcomer was ushered into the magistrate s presence and proved to be a man of forty or thereabouts very red in the face and with carroty hair and whiskers He was moreover strongly inclined to corpulence and was clad in clumsy ill fitting garments In a complacent tone and with a strong Norman accent he informed the magistrate that during the past twenty years he had been in the employment of various literary men as well as of a physician and notary that he was familiar with the duties that would be required of him at the Palais de Justice and that he knew how to dust papers without disarranging them In short he produced such a favorable impression that although M Segmuller reserved twenty four hours in which to make further inquiries he drew a twenty franc piece from his pocket on the spot and tendered it to the Norman valet as the first instalment of his wages But instead of pocketing the proffered coin the man with a sudden change of voice and attitude burst into a hearty laugh exclaiming Do you think sir that May will recognize me Monsieur Lecoq cried the astonished magistrate The same sir and I have come to tell you that if you are ready to release May all my arrangements are now completed XX When one of the investigating magistrates of the Tribunal of the Seine wishes to examine a person confined in one of the Paris prisons he sends by his messenger to the governor of that particular jail a so called order of extraction a concise imperative formula which reads as follows The keeper of prison will give into the custody of the bearer of this order the prisoner known as in order that he may be brought before us in our cabinet at the Palais de Justice No more no less a signature a seal and everybody is bound to obey But from the moment of receiving this order until the prisoner is again incarcerated the governor of the prison is relieved of all responsibility Whatever may happen his hands are clear Minute precautions are taken however so that a prisoner may not escape during his journey from the prison to the Palais He is carefully locked up in a compartment of one of the lugubrious vehicles that may be often seen waiting on the Quai de l Horloge or in the courtyard of the Sainte Chapelle This van conveys him to the Palais and while he is awaiting examination he is immured in one of the cells of the gloomy jail familiarly known as la Souriciere or the mouse trap On entering and leaving the van the prisoner is surrounded by guards and on the road in addition to the mounted troopers who always accompany these vehicles there are prison warders or linesmen of the Garde de Paris installed in the passage between the compartments of the van and seated on the box with the driver Hence the boldest criminals ordinarily realize the impossibility of escaping from this ambulatory prison Indeed statistics record only thirty attempts at escape in a period of ten years Of these thirty attempts twenty five were ridiculous failures four were discovered before their authors had conceived any serious hope of success and only one man actually succeeded in alighting from the vehicle and even he had not taken fifty steps before he was recaptured Lecoq was well acquainted with all these facts and in preparing everything for May s escape his only fear was lest the murderer might decline to profit of the opportunity Hence it was necessary to offer every possible inducement for flight The plan the young detective had eventually decided on consisted in sending an order to Mazas for May to be despatched to the Palais de Justice He could be placed in one of the prison vans and at the moment of starting the door of his compartment would not be perfectly secured When the van reached the Palais de Justice and discharged its load of criminals at the door of the mouse trap May would purposely be forgotten and left in the vehicle while the latter waited on the Quai de l Horloge until the hour of returning to Mazas It was scarcely possible that the prisoner would fail to embrace this apparently favorable opportunity to make his escape Everything was therefore prepared and arranged according to Lecoq s directions on the Monday following the close of the Easter holidays the requisite order of extraction being entrusted to an intelligent man with the most minute instructions Now although the van in which May would journey was not to be expected at the Palais de Justice before noon it so happened that at nine o clock that same morning a queer looking loafer having the aspect of an overgrown overaged gamin de Paris might have been seen hanging about the Prefecture de Police He wore a tattered black woolen blouse and a pair of wide ill fitting trousers fastened about his waist by a leather strap His boots betrayed a familiar acquaintance with the puddles of the barrieres and his cap was shabby and dirty though on the other hand his necktie a pretentious silk scarf of flaming hue was evidently quite fresh from some haberdasher s shop No doubt it was a present from his sweetheart This uncomely being had the unhealthy complexion hollow eyes slouching mien and straggling beard common to his tribe His yellow hair cut closely at the back of the head as if to save the trouble of brushing was long in front and at the sides being plastered down over his forehead and advancing above his ears in extravagant corkscrew ringlets What with his attire his affected jaunty step his alternate raising of either shoulder and his way of holding his cigarette and of ejecting a stream of saliva from between his teeth Polyte Chupin had he been at liberty would undoubtedly have proffered a paw and greeted this barriere beauty as a pal It was the fourteenth of April the weather was lovely and on the horizon the youthful foliage of the chestnut trees in the Tuileries gardens stood out against a bright blue sky The ethereal mildness of gentle spring seemed to have a positive charm for the tattered loafer who lazily loitered in the sunlight dividing his attention between the passers by and some men who were hauling sand from the banks of the Seine Occasionally however he crossed the roadway and strange to say exchanged a few remarks with a neatly dressed long bearded gentleman who wore gold rimmed spectacles over his nose and drab silk gloves on his hands This individual exhibited all the outward characteristics of eminent respectability and seemed to take a remarkable interest in the contents of an optician s shop window Every now and then a policeman or an agent of the detective corps passed by on his way to the Prefecture and the elderly gentleman or the loafer would at times run after these officials to ask for some trifling information The person addressed replied and passed on and then the loafer and the gentleman would join each other and laughingly exclaim Good there s another who doesn t recognize us And in truth the pair had just cause for exultation good reason to be proud for of some twelve or fifteen comrades they accosted not one recognized the two detectives Lecoq and Father Absinthe For the loafer was none other than our hero and the gentleman of such eminent respectability his faithful lieutenant Ah quoth the latter with admiration I am not surprised they don t recognize me since I can t recognize myself No one but you Monsieur Lecoq could have so transformed me Unfortunately for Lecoq s vanity the good fellow spoke at a moment when the time for idle conversation had passed The prison van was just crossing the bridge at a brisk trot Attention exclaimed the young detective there comes our friend Quick to your post remember my directions and keep your eyes open Near them on the quay was a large pile of timber behind which Father Absinthe immediately concealed himself while Lecoq seizing a spade that was lying idle hurried to a little distance and began digging in the sand They did well to make haste The van came onward and turned the corner It passed the two detectives and with a noisy clang rolled under the heavy arch leading to la Souriciere May was inside as Lecoq assured himself on recognizing the keeper sitting beside the driver The van remained in the courtyard for more than a quarter of an hour When it reappeared the driver had left his perch and the quay opposite the Palais de Justice threw a covering over his horses lighted his pipe and quietly walked away The moment for action was now swiftly approaching For a few minutes the anxiety of the two watchers amounted to actual agony nothing stirred nothing moved But at last the door of the van was opened with infinite caution and a pale frightened face became visible It was the face of May The prisoner cast a rapid glance around him No one was in sight Then as swiftly and as stealthily as a cat he sprang to the ground noiselessly closed the door of the vehicle and walked quietly toward the bridge Lecoq breathed again He had been asking himself if some trifling circumstance could have been forgotten or neglected thus disarranging all his plans He had been wondering if this strange man would refuse the dangerous liberty which had been offered him But he had been anxious without cause May had fled not thoughtlessly but with premeditation From the moment when he was left alone apparently forgotten in the insecurely locked compartment until he opened the door and glanced around him sufficient time had elapsed for a man of his intellect and discernment to analyze and calculate all the chances of so grave a step Hence if he had stepped into the snare laid for him it must be with a full knowledge of the risks he had to run He and Lecoq were alone together free in the streets of Paris armed with mutual distrust equally obliged to resort to strategy and forced to hide from each other Lecoq it is true had an auxiliary Father Absinthe But who could say that May would not be aided by his redoubtable accomplice Hence it was a veritable duel the result of which depended entirely upon the courage skill and coolness of the antagonists All these thoughts flashed through the young detective s brain with the quickness of lightning Throwing down his spade and running toward a sergeant de ville who was just coming out of the Palais de Justice he gave him a letter which was ready in his pocket Take this to M Segmuller at once it is a matter of importance said he The policeman attempted to question this loafer who was in correspondence with the magistrates but Lecoq had already darted off on the prisoner s trail May had covered but a short distance He was sauntering along with his hands in his pockets his head high in the air his manner composed and full of assurance Had he reflected that it would be dangerous to run while so near the prison from which he had just escaped Or was he of opinion that as an opportunity of flight had been willingly furnished him there was no danger of immediate rearrest This was a point Lecoq could not decide At all events May showed no signs of quickening his pace even after crossing the bridge and it was with the same tranquil manner that he next crossed the Quai aux Fleurs and turned into the Rue de la Cite Nothing in his bearing or appearance proclaimed him to be an escaped prisoner Since his trunk that famous trunk which he pretended to have left at the Hotel de Mariembourg had been returned to him he had been well supplied with clothing and he never failed when summoned before the magistrate to array himself in his best apparel The garments he wore that day were black cloth and their cut combined with his manner gave him the appearance of a working man of the better class taking a holiday His tread hitherto firm and decided suddenly became uncertain when after crossing the Seine he reached the Rue saint Jacques He walked more slowly frequently hesitated and glanced continually at the shops on either side of the way Evidently he is seeking something thought Lecoq but what It was not long before he ascertained Seeing a second hand clothes shop close by May entered in evident haste Lecoq at once stationed himself under a gateway on the opposite side of the street and pretended to be busily engaged lighting a cigarette The criminal being momentarily out of sight Father Absinthe thought he could approach without danger Ah well said he there s our man changing his fine clothes for coarser garments He will ask for the difference in money and they will give it him You told me this morning May without a sou that s the trump card in our game Nonsense Before we begin to lament let us wait and see what happens It is not likely that shopkeeper will give him any money He won t buy clothing of the first passer by Father Absinthe withdrew to a little distance He distrusted these reasons but not Lecoq who gave them In the mean while in his secret soul Lecoq was cursing himself Another blunder thought he another weapon left in the hands of the enemy How was it that he who fancied himself so shrewd had not foreseen this emergency Calmness of mind returned however a moment afterward when he saw May emerge from the shop attired as when he entered it Luck had for once been in the young detective s favor May actually staggered when he stepped out on the pavement His bitter disappointment could be read in his countenance which disclosed the anguish of a drowning man who sees the frail plank which was his only hope of salvation snatched from his grasp by the ruthless waves What could have taken place This Lecoq must know without a moment s delay He gave a peculiar whistle to warn his companion that he momentarily abandoned the pursuit of him and having received a similar signal in response he entered the shop The owner was still standing behind the counter Lecoq wasted no time in parleying He merely showed his card to acquaint the man with his profession and curtly asked What did the fellow want who was just in here The shopkeeper seemed embarrassed It s a long story he stammered Then tell it said Lecoq surprised at the man s hesitation Oh it s very simple About twelve days ago a man entered my shop with a bundle under his arm He claimed to be a countryman of mine Are you an Alsatian Yes sir Well I went with this man to the wine shop at the corner where he ordered a bottle of good wine and while we drank together he asked me if I would consent to keep the package he had with him until one of his cousins came to claim it To prevent any mistake this cousin was to say certain words a countersign as it were I refused shortly and decidedly for the very month before I had got into trouble and had been charged with receiving stolen goods all by obliging a person in this way Well you never saw a man so vexed and so surprised What made me all the more determined in my refusal was that he offered me a good round sum in payment for my trouble This only increased my suspicion and I persisted in my refusal The shopkeeper paused to take breath but Lecoq was on fire with impatience And what then he insisted Well he paid for the wine and went away I had forgotten all about the matter until that man came in here just now and after asking me if I hadn t a package for him which had been left by one of his cousins began to say some peculiar words the countersign no doubt When I replied that I had nothing at all he turned as white as his shirt and I thought he was going to faint All my suspicions came back to me So when he afterward proposed that I should buy his clothes I told him I couldn t think of it All this was plain enough to Lecoq And this cousin who was here a fortnight ago what was he like asked he He was a tall rather corpulent man with a ruddy complexion and white whiskers Ah I should recognize him in an instant The accomplice exclaimed Lecoq What did you say Nothing that would interest you Thank you I am in a hurry You will see me again good morning Lecoq had not remained five minutes in the shop and yet when he emerged May and Father Absinthe were nowhere in sight Still the young detective was not at all uneasy on that score In making arrangements with his old colleague for this pursuit Lecoq had foreseen such a situation and it had been agreed that if one of them were obliged to remain behind the other who was closely following May should from time to time make chalk marks on the walls shutters and facings of the shops so as to indicate the route and enable his companion to rejoin him Hence in order to know which way to go Lecoq had only to glance at the buildings around him The task was neither long nor difficult for on the front of the third shop beyond that of the second hand clothes dealer a superb dash of the crayon instructed him to turn into the Rue Saint Jacques On he rushed in that direction his mind busy at work with the incident that had just occurred What a terrible warning that old clothes dealer s declaration had been Ah that mysterious accomplice was a man of foresight He had even done his utmost to insure his comrade s salvation in the event of his being allowed to escape What did the package the shopkeeper had spoken of contain Clothes no doubt Everything necessary for a complete disguise money papers a forged passport most likely While these thoughts were rushing through Lecoq s mind he had reached the Rue Soufflot where he paused for an instant to learn his way from the walls This was the work of a second A long chalk mark on a watchmaker s shop pointed to the Boulevard Saint Michel whither the young detective at once directed his steps The accomplice said he to himself resuming his meditation didn t succeed with that old clothes dealer but he isn t a man to be disheartened by one rebuff He has certainly taken other measures How shall I divine what they are in order to defeat them The supposed murderer had crossed the Boulevard Saint Michel and had then taken to the Rue Monsieur le Prince as Father Absinthe s dashes of the crayon proclaimed with many eloquent flourishes One circumstance reassures me the young detective murmured May s going to this shop and his consternation on finding that there was nothing for him there The accomplice had informed him of his plans but had not been able to inform him of their failure Hence from this hour the prisoner is left to his own resources The chain that bound him to his accomplice is broken there is no longer an understanding between them Everything depends now upon keeping them apart Yes everything lies in that Ah how Lecoq rejoiced that he had succeeded in having May transferred to another prison for he was convinced that the accomplice had warned May of the attempt he was going to make with the old clothes dealer on the very evening before May s removal to Mazas Hence it had not been possible to acquaint him with the failure of this scheme or the substitution of another Still following the chalk marks Lecoq now reached the Odeon theatre Here were fresh signs and what was more Father Absinthe could be perceived under the colonnade standing in front of one of the book stalls and apparently engrossed in the contemplation of a print Assuming the nonchalant manner of the loafer whose garb he wore Lecoq took his stand beside his colleague Where is he asked the young detective There replied his companion with a slight movement of his head in the direction of the steps The fugitive was indeed seated on one of the steps at the side of the theatre his elbows resting on his knees and his face hidden in his hands as if he felt the necessity of concealing the expression of his face from the passers by Undoubtedly at that moment he gave himself up for lost Alone in the midst of Paris without a penny what was to become of him He knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that he was being watched that his steps were being dogged that the first attempt he made to inform his accomplice of his whereabouts would cost him his secret the secret which he plainly held as more precious than life itself and which by immense sacrifices he had so far been able to preserve Having for some short time contemplated in silence this unfortunate man whom after all he could but esteem and admire Lecoq turned to his old companion What did he do on the way he asked He went into the shops of five dealers in second hand clothing without success Then he addressed a man who was passing with a lot of old rubbish on his shoulder but the man wouldn t even answer him Lecoq nodded his head thoughtfully The moral of this is that there s a vast difference between theory and practise he remarked Here s a fellow who has made some most discerning men believe that he s only a poor devil a low buffoon Well now he s free and this so called Bohemian doesn t even know how to go to work to sell the clothes on his back The comedian who could play his part so well on the stage has disappeared while the man remains the man who has always been rich and knows nothing of the vicissitudes of life The young detective suddenly ceased moralizing for May had risen from his seat Lecoq was only ten yards distant and could see that his face was pallid His attitude expressed profound dejection and one could read his indecision in his eyes Perhaps he was wondering if it would not be best to return and place himself again in the hands of his jailers since he was without the resources upon which he had depended After a little however he shook off the torpor that had for a time overpowered him his eyes brightened and with a gesture of defiance he left the steps crossed the open square and walked down the Rue de l Ancienne Comedie He strode onward now with the brisk determined step of a man who has a definite aim in view Who knows where he is going now murmured Father Absinthe as he trotted along by Lecoq s side I do replied the young detective And the proof is that I am going to leave you and run on in advance to prepare for his reception I may be mistaken however and as we must be prepared for any emergency leave me the chalk marks as you go along If our man doesn t come to the Hotel de Mariembourg as I think he will I shall come back here to start in pursuit of you again Just then an empty cab chanced to be passing and Lecoq hastily got into it telling the driver to take him to the Northern Railway Station by the shortest route and as quickly as possible As time was precious he handed the cabman his fare while on the road and then began to search his pocket book among the various documents confided to him by M Segmuller for a particular paper he would now require Scarcely had the cab stopped at the Place de Roubaix than the young detective alighted and ran toward the Hotel de Mariembourg where as on the occasion of his first visit he found Madame Milner standing on a chair in front of her birdcage obstinately trying to teach her starling German while the bird with equal obstinacy repeated Camille where is Camille On perceiving the individual of questionable mien who had presumed to cross her threshold the pretty widow did not deign to change her position What do you want she asked in a curt sharp voice I am the nephew of a messenger at the Palais de Justice replied Lecoq with an awkward bow in perfect keeping with his attire On going to see my uncle this morning I found him laid up with rheumatism and he asked me to bring you this paper in his stead It is a summons for you to appear at once before the investigating magistrate This reply induced Madame Milner to abandon her perch Very well she replied after glancing at the summons give me time to throw a shawl over my shoulder and I ll start Lecoq withdrew with another awkward bow but he had not reached the street before a significant grimace betrayed his inward satisfaction She had duped him once and now he had repaid her On looking round him he perceived a half built house at the corner of the Rue saint Quentin and being momentarily in want of a hiding place he concluded that he had best conceal himself there The pretty widow had only asked for sufficient time to slip on a shawl before starting but then it so happened that she was rather particular as to her personal appearance and such a plump attractive little body as herself having an eye perhaps to renewed wedlock could not possibly be expected to tie her bonnet strings in less than a quarter of an hour Hence Lecoq s sojourn behind the scaffolding of the half built house proved rather longer than he had expected and at the thought that May might arrive at any moment he fairly trembled with anxiety How much was he in advance of the fugitive Half an hour perhaps And he had accomplished only half his task At last however the coquettish landlady made her appearance as radiant as a spring morning She probably wished to make up for the time she had spent over her toilet for as she turned the corner she began to run Lecoq waited till she was out of sight and then bounding from his place of concealment he burst into the Hotel de Mariembourg like a bombshell Fritz the Bavarian lad must have been warned that the house was to be left in his sole charge for some hours for having comfortably installed himself in his mistress s own particular armchair with his legs resting on another one he had already commenced to fall asleep Wake up shouted Lecoq wake up At the sound of this voice which rang like a trumpet blast Fritz sprang to his feet frightened half out of his wits You see that I am an agent of the Prefecture of Police said the visitor showing his card Now if you wish to avoid all sorts of disagreeable things the least of which will be a sojourn in prison you must obey me The boy trembled in every limb Yes mein Herr Monsieur I mean I will obey you he stammered But what am I to do Oh very little A man is coming here in a moment you will know him by his black clothes and his long beard You must answer him word for word as I tell you And remember if you make any mistake you will suffer for it You may rely upon me sir replied Fritz I have an excellent memory The prospect of imprisonment had terrified him into abject submission He spoke the truth he would have been willing to say or do anything just then Lecoq profited by this disposition and then clearly and concisely gave the lad his instructions And now added he I must see and hear you Where can I hide myself Fritz pointed to a glass door In the dark room there sir By leaving the door ajar you can hear and you can see everything through the glass Without another word Lecoq darted into the room in question Not a moment too soon however for the bell of the outer door announced the arrival of a visitor It was May I wish to speak to the landlady he said What landlady replied the lad The person who received me when I came here six weeks ago Oh I understand interrupted Fritz it s Madame Milner you want to see but you have come too late she sold the house about a month ago and has gone back to Alsace May stamped his foot and uttered a terrible oath I have come to claim something from her he insisted Do you want me to call her successor Concealed behind the glass door Lecoq could not help admiring Fritz who was uttering these glaring falsehoods with that air of perfect candor which gives the Germans such a vast advantage over the Latin races who seem to be lying even when they are telling the truth Her successor would order me off exclaimed May I came to reclaim the money I paid for a room I never occupied Such money is never refunded May uttered some incoherent threat in which such words as downright robbery and justice could be distinguished and then abruptly walked back into the street slamming the door behind him Well did I answer properly asked Fritz triumphantly as Lecoq emerged from his hiding place Yes perfectly replied the detective And then pushing aside the boy who was standing in his way he dashed after May A vague fear almost suffocated him It had struck him that the fugitive had not been either surprised or deeply affected by the news he had heard He had come to the hotel depending upon Madame Milner s assistance and the news of this woman s departure would naturally have alarmed him for was she not the mysterious accomplice s confidential friend Had May then guessed the trick that had been played upon him And if so how Lecoq s good sense told him plainly that the fugitive must have been put on his guard and on rejoining Father Absinthe he immediately exclaimed May spoke to some one on his way to the hotel Why how could you know that exclaimed the worthy man greatly astonished Ah I was sure of it Who did he speak to To a very pretty woman upon my word fair and plump as a partridge Ah fate is against us exclaimed Lecoq with an oath I run on in advance to Madame Milner s house so that May shan t see her I invent an excuse to send her out of the hotel and yet they meet each other Father Absinthe gave a despairing gesture Ah if I had known he murmured but you did not tell me to prevent May from speaking to the passers by Never mind my old friend said Lecoq consolingly it couldn t have been helped While this conversation was going on the fugitive had reached the Faubourg Montmartre and his pursuers were obliged to hasten forward and get closer to their man so that they might not lose him in the crowd Now resumed Lecoq when they had overtaken him give me the particulars Where did they meet In the Rue Saint Quentin Which saw the other first May What did the woman say Did you hear any cry of surprise I heard nothing for I was quite fifty yards off but by the woman s manner I could see she was stupefied Ah if Lecoq could have witnessed the scene what valuable deductions he might have drawn from it Did they talk for a long time he asked For less than a quarter of an hour Do you know whether Madame Milner gave May money or not I can t say They gesticulated like mad so violently indeed that I thought they were quarreling They knew they were being watched and were endeavoring to divert suspicion If they would only arrest this woman and question her suggested Father Absinthe What good would it do Hasn t M Segmuller examined and cross examined her a dozen times without drawing anything from her Ah she s a cunning one She would declare that May met her and insisted that she should refund the ten francs he paid her for his room We must do our best however If the accomplice has not been warned already he will soon be told so we must try to keep the two men apart What ruse they will employ I can t divine But I know that it will be nothing hackneyed Lecoq s presumptions made Father Absinthe nervous The surest way perhaps ventured the latter would be to lock him up again No replied the young detective I want his secret and I ll have it What will be said of us if we two allow this man to escape us He can t be visible and invisible by turns like the devil We ll see what he is going to do now that he s got some money and a plan for he has both at the present moment I would stake my right hand upon it At that same instant as if May intended to convince Lecoq of the truth of his suspicion he entered a tobacconist s shop and emerged an instant afterward with a cigar in his mouth XXI So the landlady of the Hotel de Mariembourg had given May money There could be no further doubt on that point after the purchase of this cigar But had they agreed upon any plan Had they had sufficient time to decide on the method that May was to employ with the view of baffling his pursuit It would seem so since the fugitive s manner had now changed in more respects than one If hitherto he had seemed to care little for the danger of pursuit and capture at present he was evidently uneasy and agitated After walking so long in the full sunlight with his head high in the air he now slunk along in the shadow of the houses hiding himself as much as possible It is evident that his fears have increased in proportion with his hopes said Lecoq to his companion He was quite unnerved when we saw him at the Odeon and the merest trifle would have decided him to surrender now however he thinks he has a chance to escape with his secret The fugitive was following the boulevards but suddenly he turned into a side street and made his way toward the Temple where soon afterward Father Absinthe and Lecoq found him conversing with one of those importunate dealers in cast off garments who consider every passer by their lawful prey The vender and May were evidently debating a question of price but the latter was plainly no skilful bargainer for with a somewhat disappointed air he soon gave up the discussion and entered the shop Ah so now he has some coin he has determined on a costume remarked Lecoq Isn t that always an escaped prisoner s first impulse Soon afterward May emerged into the street His appearance was decidedly changed for he wore a pair of dark blue linen trousers of the type French navvies habitually affect and a loosely fitting coat of rough woolen material A gay silk kerchief was knotted about his throat and a black silk cap was set on one side of his head Thus attired he was scarcely more prepossessing in appearance than Lecoq and one would have hesitated before deciding which of the two it would be preferable to meet at night on a deserted highway May seemed very well pleased with his transformation and was evidently more at ease in his new attire On leaving the shop however he glanced suspiciously around him as if to ascertain which of the passers by were watching his movements He had not parted with his broadcloth suit but was carrying it under his arm wrapped up in a handkerchief The only thing he had left behind him was his tall chimney pot hat Lecoq would have liked to enter the shop and make some inquiries but he felt that it would be imprudent to do so for May had settled his cap on his head with a gesture that left no doubt as to his intentions A second later he turned into the Rue du Temple and now the chase began in earnest for the fugitive proved as swift and agile as a stag and it was no small task to keep him well in sight He had no doubt lived in England and Germany since he spoke the language of these countries like a native but one thing was certain he knew Paris as thoroughly as the most expert Parisian This was shown by the way in which he dashed into the Rue des Gravelliers and by the precision of his course through the many winding streets that lie between the Rue du Temple and the Rue Beaubourg He seemed to know this quarter of the capital by heart as well indeed as if he had spent half his life there He knew all the wine shops communicating with two streets all the byways passages and tortuous alleys Twice he almost escaped his pursuers and once his salvation hung upon a thread If he had remained in an obscure corner where he was completely hidden only an instant longer the two detectives would have passed him by and his safety would have been assured The pursuit presented immense difficulties Night was coming on and with it that light fog which almost invariably accompanies a spring sunset Soon the street lamps glimmered luridly in the mist and then it required a keen eyesight indeed to see even for a moderate distance And to add to this drawback the streets were now thronged with workmen returning home after their daily toil and with housewives intent on purchasing provisions for the evening meal while round about each dwelling there congregated its numerous denizens swarming like bees around a hive May however took advantage of every opportunity to mislead the persons who might be following him Groups collected around some cheap jack s stall street accidents a block of vehicles everything was utilized by him with such marvelous presence of mind that he often glided through the crowd without leaving any sign of his passage At last he left the neighborhood of the Rue des Gravelliers and made for a broader street Reaching the Boulevard de Sebastopol he turned to the left and took a fresh start He darted on with marvelous rapidity with his elbows pressed close to his body husbanding his breath and timing his steps with the precision of a dancing master Never pausing and without once turning his head he ever hurried on And it was at the same regular but rapid pace that he covered the Boulevard de Sebastopol crossed the Place du Chatelet and proceeded to mount the Boulevard Saint Michel Here he suddenly halted before a cab stand He spoke to one of the drivers opened the door of his vehicle and jumped in The cab started off at a rapid pace But May was not inside He had merely passed through the vehicle getting out at the other door and just as the driver was departing for an imaginary destination May slipped into an adjacent cab which left the stand at a gallop Perhaps after so many ruses after such formidable efforts after this last stratagem perhaps May believed that he was free He was mistaken Behind the cab which bore him onward and while he leaned back against the cushions to rest a man was running and this man was Lecoq Poor Father Absinthe had fallen by the way In front of the Palais de Justice he paused exhausted and breathless and Lecoq had little hope of seeing him again since he had all he could do to keep his man in sight without stopping to make the chalk marks agreed upon May had instructed his driver to take him to the Place d Italie requesting him moreover to stop exactly in the middle of the square This was about a hundred paces from the police station in which he had been temporarily confined with the Widow Chupin When the vehicle halted he sprang to the ground and cast a rapid glance around him as if looking for some dreaded shadow He could see nothing however for although surprised by the sudden stoppage Lecoq had yet had time to fling himself flat on his stomach under the body of the cab regardless of all danger of being crushed by the wheels May was apparently reassured He paid the cabman and then retraced his course toward the Rue Mouffetard With a bound Lecoq was on his feet again and started after the fugitive as eagerly as a ravenous dog might follow a bone He had reached the shadow cast by the large trees in the outer boulevards when a faint whistle resounded in his ears Father Absinthe he exclaimed in a tone of delighted surprise The same replied the old detective and quite rested thanks to a passing cabman who picked me up and brought me here Oh enough interrupted Lecoq Let us keep our eyes open May was now walking quite leisurely He stopped first before one and then before another of the numerous wine shops and eating houses that abound in this neighborhood He was apparently looking for some one or something which of the two Lecoq could not of course divine However after peering through the glass doors of three of these establishments and then turning away the fugitive at last entered the fourth The two detectives who were enabled to obtain a good view of the shop inside saw the supposed murderer cross the room and seat himself at a table where a man of unusually stalwart build ruddy faced and gray whiskered was already seated The accomplice murmured Father Absinthe Was this really the redoubtable accomplice Under other circumstances Lecoq would have hesitated to place dependence on a vague similarity in personal appearance but here probabilities were so strongly in favor of Father Absinthe s assertion that the young detective at once admitted its truth Was not this meeting the logical sequence of May and Madame Milner s chance interview a few hours before May thought Lecoq began by taking all the money Madame Milner had about her and then instructed her to tell his accomplice to come and wait for him in some cheap restaurant near here If he hesitated and looked inside the different establishments it was only because he hadn t been able to specify any particular one Now if they don t throw aside the mask it will be because May is not sure he has eluded pursuit and because the accomplice fears that Madame Milner may have been followed The accomplice if this new personage was really the accomplice had resorted to a disguise not unlike that which May and Lecoq had both adopted He wore a dirty blue blouse and a hideous old slouch hat which was well nigh in tatters He had in fact rather exaggerated his make up for his sinister physiognomy attracted especial attention even beside the depraved and ferocious faces of the other customers in the shop For this low eating house was a regular den of thieves and cut throats Among those present there were not four workmen really worthy of that name The others occupied in eating and drinking there were all more or less familiar with prison life The least to be dreaded were the barriere loafers easily recognized by their glazed caps and their loosely knotted neckerchiefs The majority of the company appeared to consist of this class And yet May that man who was so strongly suspected of belonging to the highest social sphere seemed to be perfectly at home He called for the regular ordinary and a chopine of wine and then after gulping down his soup bolted great pieces of beef pausing every now and then to wipe his mouth on the back of his sleeve But was he conversing with his neighbor This it was impossible to discern through the glass door all obscured by smoke and steam I must go in said Lecoq resolutely I must get a place near them and listen Don t think of such a thing said Father Absinthe What if they recognized you They won t recognize me If they do they ll kill you Lecoq made a careless gesture I certainly think that they wouldn t hesitate to rid themselves of me at any cost But nonsense A detective who is afraid to risk his life is no better than a low spy Why you never saw even Gevrol flinch Perhaps Father Absinthe had wished to ascertain if his companion s courage was equal to his shrewdness and sagacity If such were the case he was satisfied on this score now You my friend will remain here to follow them if they leave hurriedly resumed Lecoq who in the mean while had already turned the handle of the door Entering with a careless air and taking a seat at a table near that occupied by the fugitive and the man in the slouch hat he called for a plate of meat and a chopine of wine in a guttural voice The fugitive and the ruffian opposite him were talking but like strangers who had met by chance and not at all after the fashion of friends who have met at a rendezvous They spoke in the jargon of their pretended rank in life not that puerile slang met with in romances descriptive of low life but that obscene vulgar dialect which it is impossible to render so changeable and diverse is the signification of its words What wonderful actors thought Lecoq what perfection what method How I should be deceived if I were not absolutely certain For the moment the man in the slouch hat was giving a detailed account of the different prisons in France He described the governors of the principal houses of detention explained the divergencies of discipline in different establishments and recounted that the food at Poissy was ten times better than that at Fontevrault Lecoq having finished his repast ordered a small glass of brandy and leaning his back against the wall and closing his eyes pretended to fall asleep His ears were wide open however and he carefully listened to the conversation Soon May began talking in his turn and he narrated his story exactly as he had related it to the magistrate from the murder up to his escape without forgetting to mention the suspicions attached to his identity suspicions which afforded him great amusement he said He added that he would be perfectly happy if he had money enough to take him back to Germany but unfortunately he only had a few sous and didn t know where or how to procure any more He had not even succeeded in selling some clothing which belonged to him and which he had with him in a bundle At these words the man in the tattered felt hat declared that he had too good a heart to leave a comrade in such embarrassment He knew in the very same street an obliging dealer in such articles and he offered to take May to his place at once May s only response was to rise saying Let us start And they did start with Lecoq at their heels They walked rapidly on until passing the Rue Fer a Moulin when they turned into a narrow dimly lighted alley and entered a dingy dwelling Run and ask the concierge if there are not two doors by which any one can leave this house said Lecoq addressing Father Absinthe The latter instantly obeyed He learned however that the house had only one street door and accordingly the two detectives waited We are discovered murmured Lecoq I am sure of it May must have recognized me or the boy at the Hotel de Mariembourg has described me to the accomplice Father Absinthe made no response for just then the two men came out of the house May was jingling some coins in his hand and seemed to be in a very bad temper What infernal rascals these receivers are he grumbled However although he had only received a small sum for his clothing he probably felt that his companion s kindness deserved some reward for immediately afterward he proposed they should take a drink together and with that object in view they entered a wine shop close by They remained here for more than an hour drinking together and only left this establishment to enter one a hundred paces distant Turned out by the landlord who was anxious to shut up the two friends now took refuge in the next one they found open Here again they were soon turned out and then they hurried to another boozing den and yet again to a fifth And so after drinking innumerable bottles of wine they contrived to reach the Place Saint Michel at about one o clock in the morning Here however they found nothing to drink for all the wine shops were closed The two men then held a consultation together and after a short discussion they walked arm in arm toward the Faubourg Saint Germain like a pair of friends The liquor they had imbibed was seemingly producing its effect for they often staggered in their walk and talked not merely loudly but both at the same time In spite of the danger Lecoq advanced near enough to catch some fragments of their conversation and the words a good stroke and money enough to satisfy one reached his ears Father Absinthe s confidence wavered All this will end badly he murmured Don t be alarmed replied his friend I frankly confess that I don t understand the maneuvres of these wily confederates but what does that matter after all now the two men are together I feel sure of success sure If one runs away the other will remain and Gevrol shall soon see which is right he or I Meanwhile the two drunkards had slackened their pace By the manner in which they examined the magnificent mansions of the Faubourg Saint German one might have suspected them of the very worst intentions In the Rue de Varrennes at only a few steps from the Rue de la Chaise they suddenly paused before a wall of moderate height surrounding an immense garden The man in the slouch hat now did the talking and explained to May as the detectives could tell by his gestures that the mansion to which the garden belonged had its front entrance in the Rue de Grenelle Bah growled Lecoq how much further will they carry this nonsense They carried it farther than the young detective had ever imagined May suddenly sprang on to his companion s shoulders and raised himself to a level with the summit of the wall An instant afterward a heavy thud might have been heard He had let himself drop into the garden The man in the slouch hat remained in the street to watch The enigmatical fugitive had accomplished this strange inconceivable design so swiftly that Lecoq had neither the time nor the desire to oppose him His amazement at this unexpected misfortune was so great that for an instant he could neither think nor move But he quickly regained his self possession and at once decided what was to be done With a sure eye he measured the distance separating him from May s accomplice and with three bounds he was upon him The man in the slouched hat attempted to shout but an iron hand stifled the cry in his throat He tried to escape and to beat off his assailant but a vigorous kick stretched him on the ground as if he had been a child Before he had time to think of further resistance he was bound gagged and carried half suffocated to the corner of the Rue de la Chaise No sound had been heard not a word not an ejaculation not even a noise of shuffling nothing Any suspicious sound might have reached May on the other side of the wall and warned him of what was going on How strange murmured Father Absinthe too much amazed to lend a helping hand to his younger colleague How strange Who would have supposed Enough enough interrupted Lecoq in that harsh imperious voice which imminent peril always gives to energetic men Enough we will talk to morrow I must run away for a minute and you will remain here If May shows himself capture him don t allow him to escape I understand but what is to be done with the man who is lying there Leave him where he is I have bound him securely so there is nothing to fear When the night police pass we will give him into charge He paused and listened A short way down the street heavy measured footsteps could be heard approaching There they come said Father Absinthe Ah I dared not hope it I shall have a good chance now At the same moment two sergeants de ville whose attention had been attracted by this group at the street corner hastened toward them In a few words Lecoq explained the situation and it was decided that one of the sergeants should take the accomplice to the station house while the other remained with Father Absinthe to cut off May s retreat And now said Lecoq I will run round to the Rue de Grenelle and give the alarm To whose house does this garden belong What replied one of the sergeants in surprise don t you know the gardens of the Duke de Sairmeuse the famous duke who is a millionaire ten times over and who was formerly the friend Ah yes I know I know said Lecoq The thief resumed the sergeant walked into a pretty trap when he got over that wall There was a reception at the mansion this evening as there is every Monday and every one in the house is still up The guests are only just leaving for there were five or six carriages still at the door as we passed by Lecoq darted off extremely troubled by what he had just heard It now seemed to him that if May had got into this garden it was not for the purpose of committing a robbery but in the hope of throwing his pursuers off the track and making his escape by way of the Rue de Grenelle which he hoped to do unnoticed in the bustle and confusion attending the departure of the guests On reaching the Hotel de Sairmeuse a princely dwelling the long facade of which was brilliantly illuminated Lecoq found a last carriage just coming from the courtyard while several footmen were extinguishing the lights and an imposing Suisse dazzling to behold in his gorgeous livery prepared to close the heavy double doors of the grand entrance The young detective advanced toward this important personage Is this the Hotel de Sairmeuse he inquired The Suisse suspended his work to survey the audacious vagabond who ventured to question him and then in a harsh voice replied I advise you to pass on I want none of your jesting Lecoq had forgotten that he was clad as a barriere loafer Ah he rejoined I m not what I seem to be I m an agent of the secret service by name Lecoq Here is my card and I came to tell you that an escaped criminal has just scaled the garden wall in the rear of the Hotel de Sairmeuse A crim in al The young detective thought a little exaggeration could do no harm and might perhaps insure him more ready aid Yes he replied and one of the most dangerous kind a man who has the blood of three victims already on his hands We have just arrested his accomplice who helped him over the wall The flunky s ruby nose paled perceptibly I will summon the servants he faltered and suiting the action to the word he was raising his hand to the bell chain employed to announce the arrival of visitors when Lecoq hastily stopped him A word first said he Might not the fugitive have passed through the house and escaped by this door without being seen In that case he would be far away by this time Impossible But why Excuse me but I know what I am saying First the door opening into the garden is closed it is only open during grand receptions not for our ordinary Monday drawing rooms Secondly Monseigneur requires me to stand on the threshold of the street door when he is receiving To day he repeated this order and you may be sure that I haven t disobeyed him Since that s the case said Lecoq slightly reassured we shall perhaps succeed in finding our man Warn the servants but without ringing the bell The less noise we make the greater will be our chance of success In a moment the fifty servants who peopled the ante rooms stables and kitchens of the Hotel de Sairmeuse were gathered together The great lanterns in the coach houses and stables were lighted and the entire garden was illuminated as by enchantment If May is concealed here thought Lecoq delighted to see so many auxiliaries it will be impossible for him to escape But it was in vain that the gardens were thoroughly explored over and over again no one could be found The sheds where gardening tools were kept the conservatories the summer houses the two rustic pavilions at the foot of the garden even the dog kennels were scrupulously visited but all in vain The trees with the exception of some horse chestnuts at the rear of the garden were almost destitute of leaves but they were not neglected on that account An agile boy armed with a lantern climbed each tree and explored even the topmost branches The murderer must have left by the way he came obstinately repeated the Suisse who had armed himself with a huge pistol and who would not let go his hold on Lecoq fearing an accident perhaps To convince the Suisse of his error it was necessary for the young detective to place himself in communication with Father Absinthe and the sergeant de ville on the other side of the wall As Lecoq had expected the latter both replied that they had not once taken their eyes off the wall and that not even a mouse had crossed into the street The exploration had hitherto been conducted after a somewhat haphazard fashion each of the servants obeying his own inspiration but the necessity of a methodically conducted search was now recognized Accordingly Lecoq took such measures that not a corner not a recess could possibly escape scrutiny and he was dividing the task between his willing assistants when a new comer appeared upon the scene This was a grave smooth faced individual in the attire of a notary Monsieur Otto Monseigneur s first valet de chambre the Suisse murmured in Lecoq s ear This important personage came on behalf of Monsieur le Duc he did not say Monseigneur to inquire the meaning of all this uproar When he had received an explanation M Otto condescended to compliment Lecoq on his efficiency and to recommend that the house should be searched from garret to cellar These precautions alone would allay the fears of Madame la Duchesse He then departed and the search began again with renewed ardor A mouse concealed in the gardens of the Hotel de Sairmeuse could not have escaped discovery so minute were the investigations Not a single object of any size was left undisturbed The trees were examined leaf by leaf one might almost say Occasionally the discouraged servants proposed to abandon the search but Lecoq urged them on He ran from one to the other entreating and threatening by turns swearing that he asked only one more effort and that this effort would assuredly be crowned with success Vain promises The fugitive could not be found The evidence was now conclusive To persist in searching the garden any longer would be worse than folly Accordingly the young detective decided to recall his auxiliaries That s enough he said in a despondent voice It is now certain that the criminal is no longer in the garden Was he cowering in some corner of the great house white with fear and trembling at the noise made by his pursuers One might reasonably suppose this to be the case and such was the opinion of the servants Above all such was the opinion of the Suisse who renewed with growing assurance his affirmations of a few moments before I have not moved from the threshold of the house to night he said and I should certainly have seen any person who passed out Let us go into the house then said Lecoq But first let me ask my companion who is waiting for me in the street to join me It is unnecessary for him to remain any longer where he is When Father Absinthe had responded to the summons all the lower doors were carefully closed and guarded and the search recommenced inside the house one of the largest and most magnificent residences of the Faubourg Saint Germain But at this moment all the treasures of the universe could not have won a single glance or a second s attention from Lecoq All his thoughts were occupied with the fugitive He passed through several superb drawing rooms along an unrivaled picture gallery across a magnificent dining room with sideboards groaning beneath their load of massive plate without paying the slightest attention to the marvels of art and upholstery that were offered to his view He hurried on accompanied by the servants who were guiding and lighting him He lifted heavy articles of furniture as easily as he would have lifted a feather he moved each chair and sofa from its place he explored each cupboard and wardrobe and drew back in turns all the wall hangings window curtains and portieres A more complete search would have been impossible In each of the rooms and passages that Lecoq entered not a nook was left unexplored not a corner was forgotten At length after two hours continuous work Lecoq returned to the first floor Only five or six servants had accompanied him on his tour of inspection The others had dropped off one by one weary of this adventure which had at first possessed the attractions of a pleasure party You have seen everything gentlemen declared an old footman Everything interrupted the Suisse everything Certainly not There are the private apartments of Monseigneur and those of Madame la Duchesse still to be explored Alas murmured Lecoq What good would it be But the Suisse had already gone to rap gently at one of the doors opening into the hall His interest equaled that of the detectives They had seen the murderer enter he had not seen him go out therefore the man was in the house and he wished him to be found The door at which he had knocked soon opened and the grave clean shaven face of Otto the duke s first valet de chambre showed itself What the deuce do you want he asked in surly tones To enter Monseigneur s room replied the Suisse in order to see if the fugitive has not taken refuge there Are you crazy exclaimed the head valet de chambre How could any one have entered here Besides I can t suffer Monsieur le Duc to be disturbed He has been at work all night and he is just going to take a bath before going to bed The Suisse seemed very vexed at this rebuff and Lecoq was presenting his excuses when another voice was heard exclaiming Let these worthy men do their duty Otto Ah do you hear that exclaimed the Suisse triumphantly Very well since Monsieur le Duc permits it Come in I will light you through the apartments Lecoq entered but it was only for form s sake that he walked through the different apartments a library an admirable study and a charming smoking room As he was passing through the bed chamber he had the honor of seeing the Duc de Sairmeuse through the half open door of a small white marble bath room Ah well cried the duke affably is the fugitive still invisible Still invisible monsieur Lecoq respectfully replied The valet de chambre did not share his master s good humor I think gentlemen said he that you may spare yourselves the trouble of visiting the apartments of the duchess It is a duty we have taken upon ourselves the women and I and we have looked even in the bureau drawers Upon the landing the old footman who had not ventured to enter his master s apartments was awaiting the detectives He had doubtless received his orders for he politely inquired if they desired anything and if after such a fatiguing night they would not find some cold meat and a glass of wine acceptable Father Absinthe s eyes sparkled He probably thought that in this royal abode they must have delicious things to eat and drink such viands indeed as he had never tasted in his life But Lecoq civilly refused and left the Hotel de Sairmeuse reluctantly followed by his old companion He was eager to be alone For several hours he had been making immense efforts to conceal his rage and despair May escaped vanished evaporated The thought drove him almost mad What he had declared to be impossible had nevertheless occurred In his confidence and pride he had sworn to answer for the prisoner s head with his own life and yet he had allowed him to slip between his fingers When he was once more in the street he paused in front of Father Absinthe and crossing his arms inquired Well my friend what do you think of all this The old detective shook his head and in serene unconsciousness of his want of tact responded I think that Gevrol will chuckle with delight At this mention of his most cruel enemy Lecoq bounded from the ground like a wounded bull Oh he exclaimed Gevrol has not won the battle yet We have lost May it is a great misfortune but his accomplice remains in our hands We hold the crafty man who has hitherto defeated all our plans no matter how carefully arranged He is certainly shrewd and devoted to his friend but we will see if his devotion will withstand the prospect of hard labor in the penitentiary And that is what awaits him if he is silent and if he thus accepts the responsibility of aiding and abetting the fugitive s escape Oh I ve no fears M Segmuller will know how to draw the truth out of him So speaking Lecoq brandished his clinched fist with a threatening air and then in calmer tones he added But we must go to the station house where the accomplice was removed I wish to question him a little XXII It was six o clock and the dawn was just breaking when Father Absinthe and his companion reached the station house where they found the superintendent seated at a small table making out his report He did not move when they entered failing to recognize them under their disguises But when they mentioned their names he rose with evident cordiality and held out his hand Upon my word said he I congratulate you on your capture last night Father Absinthe and Lecoq exchanged an anxious look What capture they both asked in a breath Why that individual you sent me last night so carefully bound Well what about him The superintendent burst into a hearty laugh So you are ignorant of your good fortune said he Ah luck has favored you and you will receive a handsome reward Pray tell us what we ve captured asked Father Absinthe impatiently A scoundrel of the deepest dye an escaped convict who has been missing for three months You must have a description of him in your pocket Joseph Couturier in short On hearing these words Lecoq became so frightfully pale that Father Absinthe fearing he was going to faint raised his arms to prevent his falling A chair stood close by however and on this Lecoq allowed himself to drop Joseph Couturier he faltered evidently unconscious of what he was saying Joseph Couturier an escaped convict The superintendent certainly did not understand Lecoq s agitation any better than Father Absinthe s discomfited air You have reason to be proud of your work your success will make a sensation this morning he repeated You have captured a famous prize I can see Gevrol s nose now when he hears the news Only yesterday he was boasting that he alone was capable of securing this dangerous rascal After such an irreparable failure as that which had overtaken Lecoq the unintended irony of these compliments was bitter in the extreme The superintendent s words of praise fell on his ears like so many blows from a sledge hammer You must be mistaken he eventually remarked rising from his seat and summoning all his energy to his assistance That man is not Couturier Oh I m not mistaken you may be quite sure of that He fully answers the description appended to the circular ordering his capture and even the little finger of his left hand is lacking as is mentioned Ah that s a proof indeed groaned Father Absinthe It is indeed And I know another one more conclusive still Couturier is an old acquaintance of mine I have had him in custody before and he recognized me last night just as I recognized him After this further argument was impossible hence it was in an entirely different tone that Lecoq remarked At least my friend you will allow me to address a few questions to your prisoner Oh as many as you like But first of all let us bar the door and place two of my men before it This Couturier has a fondness for the open air and he wouldn t hesitate to dash out our brains if he only saw a chance of escape After taking these precautions the man was removed from the cage in which he had been confined He stepped forward with a smile on his face having already recovered that nonchalant manner common to old offenders who when in custody seem to lose all feeling of anger against the police They are not unlike those gamblers who after losing their last halfpenny nevertheless willingly shake hands with their adversary Couturier at once recognized Lecoq Ah said he It was you who did that business last night You can boast of having a solid fist You fell upon me very unexpectedly and the back of my neck is still the worse for your clutch Then if I were to ask a favor of you you wouldn t be disposed to grant it Oh yes all the same I have no more malice in my composition than a chicken and I rather like your face What do you want of me I should like to have some information about the man who accompanied you last night Couturier s face darkened I am really unable to give you any he replied Why Because I don t know him I never saw him before last night It s hard to believe that A fellow doesn t enlist the first comer for an expedition like yours last evening Before undertaking such a job with a man one finds out something about him I don t say I haven t been guilty of a stupid blunder replied Couturier Indeed I could murder myself for it but there was nothing about the man to make me suspect that he belonged to the secret service He spread a net for me and I jumped into it It was made for me of course but it wasn t necessary for me to put my foot into it You are mistaken my man said Lecoq The individual in question didn t belong to the police force I pledge you my word of honor he didn t For a moment Couturier surveyed Lecoq with a knowing air as if he hoped to discover whether he were speaking the truth or attempting to deceive him I believe you he said at last And to prove it I ll tell you how it happened I was dining alone last evening in a restaurant in the Rue Mouffetard when that man came in and took a seat beside me Naturally we began to talk and I thought him a very good sort of a fellow I forget how it began but somehow or other he mentioned that he had some clothes he wanted to sell and being glad to oblige him I took him to a friend who bought them from him It was doing him a good turn wasn t it Well he offered me something to drink and I returned the compliment We had a number of glasses together and by midnight I began to see double He then began to propose a plan which he swore would make us both rich It was to steal the plate from a superb mansion There would be no risk for me he would take charge of the whole affair I had only to help him over the wall and keep watch The proposal was tempting was it not You would have thought so if you had been in my place and yet I hesitated But the fellow insisted He swore that he was acquainted with the habits of the house that Monday evening was a grand gala night there and that on these occasions the servants didn t lock up the plate After a little while I consented A fleeting flush tinged Lecoq s pale cheeks Are you sure he told you that the Duc de Sairmeuse received every Monday evening he asked eagerly Certainly how else could I have known it He even mentioned the name you uttered just now a name ending in euse A strange thought had just flitted through Lecoq s mind What if May and the Duc de Sairmeuse should be one and the same person But the notion seemed so thoroughly absurd so utterly inadmissible that he quickly dismissed it despising himself even for having entertained it for a single instant He cursed his inveterate inclination always to look at events from a romantic impossible side instead of considering them as natural commonplace incidents After all there was nothing surprising in the fact that a man of the world such as he supposed May to be should know the day set aside by the Duc de Sairmeuse for the reception of his friends The young detective had nothing more to expect from Couturier He thanked him and after shaking hands with the superintendent walked away leaning on Father Absinthe s arm For he really had need of support His legs trembled his head whirled and he felt sick both in body and in mind He had failed miserably disgracefully He had flattered himself that he possessed a genius for his calling and yet he had been easily outwitted To rid himself of pursuit May had only had to invent a pretended accomplice and this simple stratagem had sufficed to nonplus those who were on his trail Father Absinthe was rendered uneasy by his colleague s evident dejection Where are we going he inquired to the Palais de Justice or to the Prefecture de Police Lecoq shuddered on hearing this question which brought him face to face with the horrible reality of his situation To the Prefecture he responded Why should I go there To expose myself to Gevrol s insults perhaps I haven t courage enough for that Nor do I feel that I have strength to go to M Segmuller and say Forgive me you have judged me too favorably I am a fool What are we to do Ah I don t know Perhaps I shall embark for America perhaps I shall throw myself into the river He had walked about a hundred yards when suddenly he stopped short No he exclaimed with a furious stamp of his foot No this affair shan t end like this I have sworn to have the solution of the enigma and I will have it For a moment he reflected then in a calmer voice he added There is one man who can save us a man who will see what I haven t been able to discern who will understand things that I couldn t Let us go and ask his advice my course will depend on his reply come After such a day and such a night it might have been expected that these two men would have felt an irresistible desire to sleep and rest But Lecoq was sustained by wounded vanity intense disappointment and yet unextinguished hope of revenge while poor Father Absinthe was not unlike some luckless cab horse which having forgotten there is such a thing as repose is no longer conscious of fatigue but travels on until he falls down dead The old detective felt that his limbs were failing him but Lecoq said It is necessary and so he walked on They both went to Lecoq s lodgings where they laid aside their disguises and made themselves trim Then after breakfasting they hastily betook themselves to the Rue saint Lazare where entering one of the most stylish houses in the street Lecoq inquired of the concierge Is M Tabaret at home Yes but he s ill was the reply Very ill asked Lecoq anxiously It is hard to tell replied the man it is his old complaint gout And with an air of hypocritical commiseration he added M Tabaret is not wise to lead the life he does Women are very well in a way but at his age The two detectives exchanged a meaning glance and as soon as they were out of hearing burst out laughing Their hilarity had scarcely ceased when they reached the first floor and rang the bell at the door of one of the apartments The buxom looking woman who appeared in answer to his summons informed them that her master would receive them although he was confined to his bed However the doctor is with him now she added But perhaps the gentlemen would not mind waiting until he has gone The gentlemen replying in the affirmative she then conducted them into a handsome library and invited them to sit down The person whom Lecoq had come to consult was a man celebrated for wonderful shrewdness and penetration well nigh exceeding the bounds of possibility For five and forty years he had held a petty post in one of the offices of the Mont de Piete just managing to exist upon the meagre stipend he received Suddenly enriched by the death of a relative of whom he had scarcely ever heard he immediately resigned his functions and the very next day began to long for the same employment he had so often anathematized In his endeavors to divert his mind he began to collect old books and heaped up mountains of tattered worm eaten volumes in immense oak bookcases But despite this pastime to many so attractive he could not shake off his weariness He grew thin and yellow and his income of forty thousand francs was literally killing him when a sudden inspiration came to his relief It came to him one evening after reading the memoirs of a celebrated detective one of those men of subtle penetration soft as silk and supple as steel whom justice sometimes sets upon the trail of crime And I also am a detective he exclaimed This however he must prove From that day forward he perused with feverish interest every book he could find that had any connection with the organization of the police service and the investigation of crime Reports and pamphlets letters and memoirs he eagerly turned from one to the other in his desire to master his subject Such learning as he might find in books did not suffice however to perfect his education Hence whenever a crime came to his knowledge he started out in quest of the particulars and worked up the case by himself Soon these platonic investigations did not suffice and one evening at dusk he summoned all his resolution and going on foot to the Prefecture de Police humbly begged employment from the officials there He was not very favorably received for applicants were numerous But he pleaded his cause so adroitly that at last he was charged with some trifling commissions He performed them admirably The great difficulty was then overcome Other matters were entrusted to him and he soon displayed a wonderful aptitude for his chosen work The case of Madame B the rich banker s wife made him virtually famous Consulted at a moment when the police had abandoned all hope of solving the mystery he proved by A plus B by a mathematical deduction so to speak that the dear lady must have stolen her own property and events soon proved that he had told the truth After this success he was always called upon to advise in obscure and difficult cases It would be difficult to tell his exact status at the Prefecture When a person is employed salary or compensation of some kind is understood but this strange man had never consented to receive a penny What he did he did for his own pleasure for the gratification of a passion which had become his very life When the funds allowed him for expenses seemed insufficient he at once opened his private purse and the men who worked with him never went away without some substantial token of his liberality Of course such a man had many enemies He did as much work and far better work than any two inspectors of police and he didn t receive a sou of salary Hence in calling him spoil trade his rivals were not far from right Whenever any one ventured to mention his name favorably in Gevrol s presence the jealous inspector could scarcely control himself and retorted by denouncing an unfortunate mistake which this remarkable man once made Inclined to obstinacy like all enthusiastic men he had indeed once effected the conviction of an innocent prisoner a poor little tailor who was accused of killing his wife This single error a grievous one no doubt in a career of some duration had the effect of cooling his ardor perceptibly and subsequently he seldom visited the Prefecture But yet he remained the oracle after the fashion of those great advocates who tired of practise at the bar still win great and glorious triumphs in their consulting rooms lending to others the weapons they no longer care to wield themselves When the authorities were undecided what course to pursue in some great case they invariably said Let us go and consult Tirauclair For this was the name by which he was most generally known a sobriquet derived from a phrase which was always on his lips He was constantly saying Il faut que cela se tire au clair That must be brought to light Hence the not altogether inappropriate appellation of Pere Tirauclair or Father Bring to Light Perhaps this sobriquet assisted him in keeping his occupation secret from his friends among the general public At all events they never suspected them His disturbed life when he was working up a case the strange visitors he received his frequent and prolonged absences from home were all imputed to a very unreasonable inclination to gallantry His concierge was deceived as well as his friends and laughing at his supposed infatuation disrespectfully called him an old libertine It was only the officials of the detective force who knew that Tirauclair and Tabaret were one and the same person Lecoq was trying to gain hope and courage by reflecting on the career of this eccentric man when the buxom housekeeper reentered the library and announced that the physician had left At the same time she opened a door and exclaimed This is the room you gentlemen can enter now XXIII On a large canopied bed sweating and panting beneath the weight of numerous blankets lay the two faced oracle Tirauclair of the Prefecture Tabaret of the Rue Saint Lazare It was impossible to believe that the owner of such a face in which a look of stupidity was mingled with one of perpetual astonishment could possess superior talent or even an average amount of intelligence With his retreating forehead and his immense ears his odious turned up nose tiny eyes and coarse thick lips M Tabaret seemed an excellent type of the ignorant pennywise petty rentier class Whenever he took his walks abroad the juvenile street Arabs would impudently shout after him or try to mimic his favorite grimace And yet his ungainliness did not seem to worry him in the least while he appeared to take real pleasure in increasing his appearance of stupidity solacing himself with the reflection that he is not really a genius who seems to be one At the sight of the two detectives whom he knew very well his eyes sparkled with pleasure Good morning Lecoq my boy said he Good morning my old Absinthe So you think enough down there of poor Papa Tirauclair to come and see him We need your advice Monsieur Tabaret Ah ah We have just been as completely outwitted as if we were babies in long clothes What was your man such a very cunning fellow Lecoq heaved a sigh So cunning he replied that if I were superstitious I should say he was the devil himself The sick man s face wore a comical expression of envy What you have found a treasure like that said he and you complain Why it is a magnificent opportunity a chance to be proud of You see my boys everything has degenerated in these days The race of great criminals is dying out those who ve succeeded the old stock are like counterfeit coins There s scarcely anything left outside a crowd of low offenders who are not worth the shoe leather expended in pursuing them It is enough to disgust a detective upon my word No more trouble emotion anxiety or excitement When a crime is committed nowadays the criminal is in jail the next morning you ve only to take the omnibus and go to the culprit s house and arrest him He s always found the more the pity But what has your fellow been up to He has killed three men Oh oh oh said old Tabaret in three different tones plainly implying that this criminal was evidently superior to others of his species And where did this happen In a wine shop near the barriere Oh yes I recollect a man named May The murders were committed in the Widow Chupin s cabin I saw the case mentioned in the Gazette des Tribunaux and your comrade Fanferlot l Ecureuil who comes to see me told me you were strangely puzzled about the prisoner s identity So you are charged with investigating the affair So much the better Tell me all about it and I will assist you as well as I can Suddenly checking himself and lowering his voice Tirauclair added But first of all just do me the favor to get up Now wait a moment and when I motion you open that door there on the left very suddenly Mariette my housekeeper who is curiosity incarnate is standing there listening I hear her hair rubbing against the lock Now The young detective immediately obeyed and Mariette caught in the act hastened away pursued by her master s sarcasms You might have known that you couldn t succeed at that he shouted after her Although Lecoq and Father Absinthe were much nearer the door than old Tirauclair neither of them had heard the slightest sound and they looked at each other in astonishment wondering whether their host had been playing a little farce for their benefit or whether his sense of hearing was really so acute as this incident would seem to indicate Now said Tabaret settling himself more comfortably upon his pillows now I will listen to you my boy Mariette will not come back again On his way to Tabaret s Lecoq had busied himself in preparing his story and it was in the clearest possible manner that he related all the particulars from the moment when Gevrol opened the door of the Poivriere to the instant when May leaped over the garden wall in the rear of the Hotel de Sairmeuse While the young detective was telling his story old Tabaret seemed completely transformed His gout was entirely forgotten According to the different phases of the recital he either turned and twisted on his bed uttering little cries of delight or disappointment or else lay motionless plunged in the same kind of ecstatic reverie which enthusiastic admirers of classical music yield themselves up to while listening to one of the great Beethoven s divine sonatas If I had been there If only I had been there he murmured regretfully every now and then through his set teeth though when Lecoq s story was finished enthusiasm seemed decidedly to have gained the upper hand It is beautiful it is grand he exclaimed And with just that one phrase It is the Prussians who are coming for a starting point Lecoq my boy I must say that you have conducted this affair like an angel Don t you mean to say like a fool asked the discouraged detective No my friend certainly not You have rejoiced my old heart I can die I shall have a successor Ah that Gevrol who betrayed you for he did betray you there s no doubt about it that obtuse obstinate General is not worthy to blacken your shoes You overpower me Monsieur Tabaret interrupted Lecoq as yet uncertain whether his host was poking fun at him or not But it is none the less true that May has disappeared and I have lost my reputation before I had begun to make it Don t be in such a hurry to reject my compliments replied old Tabaret with a horrible grimace I say that you have conducted this investigation very well but it could have been done much better very much better You have a talent for your work that s evident but you lack experience you become elated by a trifling advantage or discouraged by a mere nothing you fail and yet persist in holding fast to a fixed idea as a moth flutters about a candle Then you are young But never mind that it s a fault you will outgrow only too soon And now to speak frankly I must tell you that you have made a great many blunders Lecoq hung his head like a schoolboy receiving a reprimand from his teacher After all was he not a scholar and was not this old man his master I will now enumerate your mistakes continued old Tabaret and I will show you how on at least three occasions you allowed an opportunity for solving this mystery to escape you But Pooh pooh my boy let me talk a little while now What axiom did you start with You said Always distrust appearances believe precisely the contrary of what appears true or even probable Yes that is exactly what I said to myself And it was a very wise conclusion With that idea in your lantern to light your path you ought to have gone straight to the truth But you are young as I said before and the very first circumstance you find that seems at all probable you quite forget the rule which as you yourself admit should have governed your conduct As soon as you meet a fact that seems even more than probable you swallow it as eagerly as a gudgeon swallows an angler s bait This comparison could but pique the young detective I don t think I ve been so simple as that protested he Bah What did you think then when you heard that M d Escorval had broken his leg in getting out of his carriage Believe I believed what they told me because He paused and Tirauclair burst into a hearty fit of laughter You believed it he said because it was a very plausible story What would you have believed had you been in my place Exactly the opposite of what they told me I might have been mistaken but it would be the logical conclusion as my first course of reasoning This conclusion was so bold that Lecoq was disconcerted What he exclaimed do you suppose that M d Escorval s fall was only a fiction that he didn t break his leg Old Tabaret s face suddenly assumed a serious expression I don t suppose it he replied I m sure of it XXIV Lecoq s confidence in the oracle he was consulting was very great but even old Tirauclair might be mistaken and what he had just said seemed such an enormity so completely beyond the bounds of possibility that the young man could not conceal a gesture of incredulous surprise So Monsieur Tabaret you are ready to affirm that M d Escorval is in quite as good health as Father Absinthe or myself and that he has confined himself to his room for a couple of months to give a semblance of truth to a falsehood I would be willing to swear it But what could possibly have been his object Tabaret lifted his hands to heaven as if imploring forgiveness for the young man s stupidity And it was in you he exclaimed in you that I saw a successor a disciple to whom I might transmit my method of induction and now you ask me such a question as that Reflect a moment Must I give you an example to assist you Very well Let it be so Suppose yourself a magistrate A crime is committed you are charged with the duty of investigating it and you visit the prisoner to question him Very well This prisoner has hitherto succeeded in concealing his identity this was the case in the present instance was it not Very well Now what would you do if at the very first glance you recognized under the prisoner s disguise your best friend or your worst enemy What would you do I ask I should say to myself that a magistrate who is obliged to hesitate between his duty and his inclinations is placed in a very trying position and I should endeavor to avoid the responsibility I understand that but would you reveal this prisoner s identity remember he might be your friend or your enemy The question was so delicate that Lecoq remained silent for a moment reflecting before he replied The pause was interrupted by Father Absinthe I should reveal nothing whatever he exclaimed I should remain absolutely neutral I should say to myself others are trying to discover this man s identity Let them do so if they can but let my conscience be clear This was the cry of honesty not the counsel of a casuist I also should be silent Lecoq at last replied and it seems to me that in holding my tongue I should not fail in my duty as a magistrate On hearing these words Tabaret rubbed his hands together as he always did when he was about to present some overwhelming argument Such being the case said he do me the favor to tell me what pretext you would invent in order to withdraw from the case without exciting suspicion I don t know I can t say now But if I were placed in such a position I should find some excuse invent something And if you could find nothing better interrupted Tabaret you would adopt M d Escorval s expedient you would pretend you had broken a limb Only as you are a clever fellow you would sacrifice your arm it would be less inconvenient than your leg and you wouldn t be condemned to seclusion for several months So Monsieur Tabaret you are convinced that M d Escorval knows who May really is Old Tirauclair turned so suddenly in his bed that his forgotten gout drew from him a terrible groan Can you doubt he exclaimed Can you possibly doubt it What proofs do you want then What connection do you see between the magistrate s fall and the prisoner s attempt at suicide I wasn t there as you were I only know the story as you have told it to me I can t look at the facts with my own eyes but according to your statements which are I suppose correct this is what I understand When M d Escorval has completed his task at the Widow Chupin s house he comes to the prison to examine the supposed murderer The two men recognize each other Had they been alone mutual explanations might have ensued and affairs taken quite a different turn But they were not alone a third party was present M d Escorval s clerk So they could say nothing The magistrate asked a few common place questions in a troubled voice and the prisoner terribly agitated replied as best he could Now after leaving the cell M d Escorval no doubt said to himself I can t investigate the offenses of a man I hate He was certainly terribly perplexed When you tried to speak to him as he was leaving the prison he harshly told you to wait till the next day and a quarter of an hour later he pretended to fall down and break his leg Then you think that M d Escorval and May are enemies inquired Lecoq Don t the facts prove that beyond a doubt retorted Tabaret If they had been friends the magistrate might have acted in the same manner but then the prisoner wouldn t have attempted to strangle himself But thanks to you his life was saved for he owes his life to you During the night confined in a straight waistcoat he was powerless to injure himself Ah how he must have suffered that night What agony So in the morning when he was conducted to the magistrate s room for examination it was with a sort of frenzy that he dashed into the dreaded presence of his enemy He expected to find M d Escorval there ready to triumph over his misfortunes and he intended to say Yes it s I There is a fatality in it I have killed three men and I am in your power But there is a mortal feud between us and for that very reason you haven t the right to prolong my tortures It would be infamous cowardice if you did so However instead of M d Escorval he sees M Segmuller Then what happens He is surprised and his eyes betray the astonishment he feels when he realizes the generosity of his enemy an enemy from whom he had expected no indulgence Then a smile comes to his lips a smile of hope for he thinks since M d Escorval has not betrayed his secret that he may be able to keep it and emerge perhaps from this shadow of shame and crime with his name and honor still untarnished Old Tabaret paused and then with a sudden change of tone and an ironical gesture he added And that is my explanation Father Absinthe had risen frantic with delight Cristi he exclaimed that s it that s it Lecoq s approbation was none the less evident although unspoken He could appreciate this rapid and wonderful work of induction far better than his companion For a moment or two old Tabaret reclined upon his pillows enjoying the sweets of admiration then he continued Do you wish for further proofs my boy Recollect the perseverance M d Escorval displayed in sending to M Segmuller for information I admit that a man may have a passion for his profession but not to such an extent as that You believed that his leg was broken Then were you not surprised to find a magistrate with a broken limb suffering mortal anguish taking such wonderful interest in a miserable murderer I haven t any broken bones I ve only got the gout but I know very well that when I m suffering half the world might be judging the other half and yet the idea of sending Mariette for information would never occur to me Ah a moment s reflection would have enabled you to understand the reason of his solicitude and would probably have given you the key to the whole mystery Lecoq who was such a brilliant casuist in the Widow Chupin s hovel who was so full of confidence in himself and so earnest in expounding his theories to simple Father Absinthe Lecoq hung his head abashed and did not utter a word But he felt neither anger nor impatience He had come to ask advice and was glad that it should be given him He had made many mistakes as he now saw only too plainly and when they were pointed out to him he neither fumed nor fretted nor tried to prove that he had been right when he had been wrong This was certainly an excellent trait in his character Meanwhile M Tabaret had poured out a great glass of some cooling drink and drained it He now resumed I need not remind you of the mistake you made in not compelling Toinon Chupin to tell you all she knew about this affair while she was in your power A bird in the hand you know the proverb Be assured Monsieur Tabaret that this mistake has cost me enough to make me realize the danger of allowing a well disposed witness s zeal to cool down We will say no more about that then But I must tell you that three or four times at least it has been in your power to clear up this mystery The oracle paused awaiting some protestation from his disciple None came however If he says this thought the young detective it must indeed be so This discretion made a great impression on old Tabaret and increased the esteem he had conceived for Lecoq The first time that you were lacking in discretion said he was when you tried to discover the owner of the diamond earring found at the Poivriere I made every effort to discover the last owner You tried very hard I don t deny it but as for making every effort that s quite another thing For instance when you heard that the Baroness de Watchau was dead and that all her property had been sold what did you do You know I went immediately to the person who had charge of the sale Very well and afterwards I examined the catalogue and as among the jewels mentioned I could find none that answered the description of these diamonds I knew that the clue was quite lost There is precisely where you are mistaken exclaimed old Tirauclair exultantly If such valuable jewels are not mentioned in the catalogue of the sale the Baroness de Watchau could not have possessed them at the time of her death And if she no longer possessed them she must have given them away or sold them And who could she have sold them to To one of her lady friends very probably For this reason had I been in your place I should have found out the names of her intimate friends this would have been a very easy task and then I should have tried to win the favor of all the lady s maids in the service of these friends This would have only been a pastime for a good looking young fellow like you Then I should have shown this earring to each maid in succession until I found one who said That diamond belongs to my mistress or one who was seized with a nervous trembling And to think that this idea did not once occur to me ejaculated Lecoq Wait wait I am coming to the second mistake you made retorted the oracle What did you do when you obtained possession of the trunk which May pretended was his Why you played directly into this cunning adversary s hand How could you fail to see that this trunk was only an accessory article a bit of property got ready in mounting the comedy You should have known that it could only have been deposited with Madame Milner by the accomplice and that all its contents must have been purchased for the occasion I knew this of course but even under these circumstances what could I do What could you do my boy Well I am only a poor old man but I should have interviewed every clothier in Paris and at last some one would have exclaimed Those articles Why I sold them to an individual like this or that who purchased them for one of his friends whose measure he brought with him Angry with himself Lecoq struck his clenched hand violently upon the table beside him Sacrebleu he exclaimed that method was infallible and so simple too Ah I shall never forgive myself for my stupidity as long as I live Gently gently interrupted old Tirauclair You are going too far my dear boy Stupidity is not the proper word at all you should say carelessness thoughtlessness You are young what else could one expect What is far less inexcusable is the manner in which you conducted the chase after the prisoner was allowed to escape Alas murmured the young man now completely discouraged did I blunder in that Terribly my son and here is where I really blame you What diabolical influence induced you to follow May step by step like a common policeman This time Lecoq was stupefied Ought I to have allowed him to escape me he inquired No but if I had been by your side in the gallery of the Odeon when you so clearly divined the prisoner s intentions I should have said to you This fellow friend Lecoq will hasten to Madame Milner s house to inform her of his escape Let us run after him I shouldn t have tried to prevent his seeing her mind But when he had left the Hotel de Mariembourg I should have added Now let him go where he chooses but attach yourself to Madame Milner don t lose sight of her cling to her as closely as her own shadow for she will lead you to the accomplice that is to say to the solution of the mystery That s the truth I see it now But instead of that what did you do You ran to the hotel you terrified the boy When a fisherman has cast his bait and the fish are swimming near he doesn t sound a gong to frighten them all away Thus it was that old Tabaret reviewed the entire course of investigation and pursuit remodeling it in accordance with his own method of induction Lecoq had originally had a magnificent inspiration In his first investigations he had displayed remarkable talent and yet he had not succeeded Why Simply because he had neglected the axiom with which he started Always distrust what seems probable But the young man listened to the oracle s summing up with divided attention A thousand projects were darting through his brain and at length he could no longer restrain himself You have saved me from despair he exclaimed I thought everything was lost but I see that my blunders can be repaired What I neglected to do I can do now there is still time Haven t I the diamond earring as well as various effects belonging to the prisoner still in my possession Madame Milner still owns the Hotel de Mariembourg and I will watch her And what for my boy What for Why to find my fugitive to be sure Had the young detective been less engrossed with his idea he would have detected a slight smile that curved Papa Tirauclair s thick lips Ah my son is it possible that you don t suspect the real name of this pretended buffoon inquired the oracle somewhat despondently Lecoq trembled and averted his face He did not wish Tabaret to see his eyes No he replied I don t suspect You are uttering a falsehood interrupted the sick man You know as well as I do that May resides in the Rue de Grenelle Saint Germain and that he is known as the Duc de Sairmeuse On hearing these words Father Absinthe indulged in a hearty laugh Ah that s a good joke he exclaimed Ah ha Such was not Lecoq s opinion however Well yes Monsieur Tabaret said he the idea did occur to me but I drove it away And why if you please Because because Because you would not believe in the logical sequence of your premises but I am consistent and I say that it seems impossible the murderer arrested in the Widow Chupin s drinking den should be the Duc de Sairmeuse Hence the murderer arrested there May the pretended buffoon is the Duc de Sairmeuse XXV How this idea had entered old Tabaret s head Lecoq could not understand A vague suspicion had it is true flitted through his own mind but it was in a moment of despair when he was distracted at having lost May and when certain of Couturier s remarks furnished the excuse for any ridiculous supposition And yet now Father Tirauclair calmly proclaimed this suspicion which Lecoq had not dared seriously to entertain even for an instant to be an undoubted fact You look as if you had suddenly fallen from the clouds exclaimed the oracle noticing his visitor s amazement Do you suppose that I spoke at random like a parrot No certainly not but Tush You are surprised because you know nothing of contemporary history If you don t wish to remain all your life a common detective like your friend Gevrol you must read and make yourself familiar with all the leading events of the century I must confess that I don t see the connection M Tabaret did not deign to reply Turning to Father Absinthe he requested the old detective in the most affable tones to go to the library and fetch two large volumes entitled General Biography of the Men of the Present Age which he would find in the bookcase on the right Father Absinthe hastened to obey and as soon as the books were brought M Tabaret began turning the pages with an eager hand like a person seeking some word in a dictionary Esbayron he muttered Escars Escayrac Escher Escodica at last we have it Escorval Listen attentively my boy and you will be enlightened This injunction was entirely unnecessary Never had the young detective s faculties been more keenly on the alert It was in an emphatic voice that the sick man then read Escorval Louis Guillaume baron d Diplomatist and politician born at Montaignac December threed seventeen sixty nine of an old family of lawyers He was completing his studies in Paris at the outbreak of the Revolution and embraced the popular cause with all the ardor of youth But soon disapproving the excesses committed in the name of Liberty he sided with the Reactionists advised perhaps by Roederer who was one of his relatives Commended to the favor of the First Counsel by M de Talleyrand he began his diplomatic career with a mission to Switzerland and during the existence of the First Empire he was entrusted with many important negotiations Devoted to the Emperor he found himself gravely compromised at the advent of the Second Restoration At the time of the celebrated rising at Montaignac he was arrested on the double charge of high treason and conspiracy He was tried by a military commission and condemned to death The sentence was not executed however He owed his life to the noble devotion and heroic energy of a priest one of his friends the Abbe Midon cure of the little village of Sairmeuse The baron d Escorval had only one son who embraced the judicial profession at a very early age Lecoq was intensely disappointed I understand he remarked This is the biography of our magistrate s father Only I don t see that it teaches us anything An ironical smile curved old Tirauclair s lips It teaches us that M d Escorval s father was condemned to death he replied That s something I assure you A little patience and you will soon know everything Having found a new leaf he recommenced to read Sairmeuse Anne Marie Victor de Tingry Duc de A French general and politician born at the chateau de Sairmeuse near Montaignac in seventeen fifty eight The Sairmeuse family is one of the oldest and most illustrious in France It must not be confounded with the ducal family of Sermeuse whose name is written with an e Leaving France at the beginning of the Revolution Anne de Sairmeuse began by serving in the army of Conde Some years later he offered his sword to Russia and it is asserted by some of his biographers that he was fighting in the Russian ranks at the time of the disastrous retreat from Moscow Returning to France with the Bourbons he became notorious by the intensity of his ultra royalist opinions It is certain that he had the good fortune to regain possession of his immense family estates and the rank and dignities which he had gained in foreign lands were confirmed Appointed by the king to preside at the military commission charged with arresting and trying the conspirators of Montaignac his zeal and severity resulted in the capture and conviction of all the parties implicated Lecoq sprang up with sparkling eyes I see it clearly now he exclaimed The father of the present Duc de Sairmeuse tried to have the father of the present M d Escorval beheaded M Tabaret was the picture of complacency You see the assistance history gives said he But I have not finished my boy the present Duc de Sairmeuse also has his article which will be of interest to us So listen Sairmeuse Anne Marie Martial Son of the preceding was born in London toward the close of the last century received his early education in England and completed it at the Court of Austria which he subsequently visited on several confidential missions Heir to the opinions prejudices and animosities of his father he placed at the service of his party a highly cultivated intellect unusual penetration and extraordinary abilities A leader at a time when political passion was raging highest he had the courage to assume the sole responsibility of the most unpopular measures The hostility he encountered however eventually obliged him to retire from office leaving behind him animosities likely to terminate only with his life The sick man closed the book and with assumed modesty he asked Ah well What do you think of my little method of induction But Lecoq was too much engrossed with his own thoughts to reply to this question I think he remarked that if the Duc de Sairmeuse had disappeared for two months the period of May s imprisonment all Paris would have known of it and so You are dreaming interrupted Tabaret Why with his wife and his valet de chambre for accomplices the duke could absent himself for a year if he liked and yet all his servants would believe him to be in the house I admit that said Lecoq at last but unfortunately there is one circumstance which completely upsets the theory we have built up so laboriously And what is that if you please If the man who took part in the broil at the Poivriere had been the Duc de Sairmeuse he would have disclosed his name he would have declared that having been attacked he had only defended himself and his name alone would have opened the prison doors Instead of that what did the prisoner do He attempted to kill himself Would a grand seigneur like the Duc de Sairmeuse to whom life must be a perpetual enchantment have thought of committing suicide A mocking whistle from the old Tabaret interrupted the speaker You seem to have forgotten the last sentence in his biography M Sairmeuse leaves behind him ill will and hatred Do you know the price he might have been compelled to pay for his liberty No no more do I To explain his presence at the Poivriere and the presence of a woman who was perhaps his wife who knows what disgraceful secrets he would have been obliged to reveal Between shame and suicide he chose suicide He wished to save his name and honor intact Old Tirauclair spoke with such vehemence that even Father Absinthe was deeply impressed although to tell the truth he had understood but little of the conversation As for Lecoq he rose very pale his lips trembling a little You will excuse my hypocrisy Monsieur Tabaret he said in an agitated voice I only offered these last objections for form s sake I had thought of what you now say but I distrusted myself and I wanted to hear you say it yourself Then with an imperious gesture he added Now I know what I have to do Old Tabaret raised his hands toward heaven with every sign of intense dismay Unhappy man he exclaimed do you think of going to arrest the Duc de Sairmeuse Poor Lecoq Free this man is almost omnipotent and you an infinitesimal agent of police would be shattered as easily as glass Take care my boy don t attack the duke I wouldn t be responsible for the consequences You might imperil your life The young detective shook his head Oh I don t deceive myself said he I know that the duke is far beyond my reach at least for the present But he will be in my power again the day I learn his secret I don t fear danger but I know that if I am to succeed I must conceal myself and so I will Yes I will remain in the shade until I can unveil this mystery but then I shall reappear in my true character And if May be really the Duc de Sairmeuse I shall have my revenge End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Monsieur Lecoq v one by Emile Gaboriau END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MONSIEUR LECOQ V one This file should be named
