1963_147036_000006_000000	train-clean-100	She nodded 
none	none	Yes I read some of it she said and the colour deepened on her face He chuckled I suppose you thought it rather curious that a man in my position should bother his head to write poetry eh he asked Most of it was written before I came into this beastly shop my dear before I developed into a tradesman She made no reply and he looked at her curiously What did you think of them he asked Her lips were trembling and again he mistook the symptoms I thought they were perfectly horrible she said in a low voice Horrible He raised his eyebrows How very middle class you are Miss Rider he scoffed Those verses have been acclaimed by some of the best critics in the country as reproducing all the beauties of the old Hellenic poetry She went to speak but stopped herself and stood with lips compressed Thornton Lyne shrugged his shoulders and strode to the other end of his luxuriously equipped office Poetry like cucumbers is an acquired taste he said after a while You have to be educated up to some kind of literature I daresay there will come a time when you will be grateful that I have given you an opportunity of meeting beautiful thoughts dressed in beautiful language She looked up at this May I go now mister Lyne she asked Not yet he replied coolly You said just now you didn t understand what I was talking about I ll put it plainer this time You re a very beautiful girl as you probably know and you are destined in all probability to be the mate of a very average suburban minded person who will give you a life tantamount to slavery That is the life of the middle class woman as you probably know And why would you submit to this bondage Simply because a person in a black coat and a white collar has mumbled certain passages over you passages which have neither meaning nor to an intelligent person significance I would not take the trouble of going through such a foolish ceremony but I would take a great deal of trouble to make you happy He walked towards her slowly and laid one hand upon her shoulder Instinctively she shrank back and he laughed What do you say She swung round on him her eyes blazing but her voice under control I happen to be one of those foolish suburban minded people she said who give significance to those mumbled words you were speaking about Yet I am broad minded enough to believe that the marriage ceremony would not make you any happier or more unhappy whether it was performed or omitted But whether it were marriage or any other kind of union I should at least require a man He frowned at her What do you mean he asked and the soft quality of his voice underwent a change Her voice was full of angry tears when she answered him I should not want an erratic creature who puts horrid sentiments into indifferent verse I repeat I should want a man His face went livid Do you know whom you are talking to he asked raising his voice I am talking to Thornton Lyne said she breathing quickly the proprietor of Lyne s Stores the employer of Odette Rider who draws three pounds every week from him He was breathless with anger Be careful he gasped Be careful I am speaking to a man whose whole life is a reproach to the very name of man she went on speaking rapidly A man who is sincere in nothing who is living on the brains and reputation of his father and the money that has come through the hard work of better men You can t scare me she cried scornfully as he took a step towards her Oh yes I know I m going to leave your employment and I m leaving to night The man was hurt humiliated almost crushed by her scorn This she suddenly realised and her quick woman s sympathy checked all further bitterness I m sorry I ve been so unkind she said in a more gentle tone But you rather provoked me mister Lyne He was incapable of speech and could only shake his head and point with unsteady finger to the door Get out he whispered Odette Rider walked out of the room but the man did not move Presently however he crossed to the window and looking down upon the floor saw her trim figure move slowly through the crowd of customers and assistants and mount the three steps which led to the chief cashier s office You shall pay for this my girl he muttered He was wounded beyond forgiveness He was a rich man s son and had lived in a sense a sheltered life He had been denied the advantage which a public school would have brought to him and had gone to college surrounded by sycophants and poseurs as blatant as himself and never once had the cold breath of criticism been directed at him except in what he was wont to describe as the reptile Press He licked his dry lips and walking to his desk pressed a bell After a short wait for he had purposely sent his secretary away a girl came in Has mister Tarling come he asked Yes sir he s in the board room He has been waiting a quarter of an hour He nodded Thank you he said Shall I tell him I will go to him myself said Lyne He took a cigarette out of his gold case struck a match and lit it His nerves were shaken his hands were trembling but the storm in his heart was soothing down under the influence of this great thought Tarling What an inspiration Tarling with his reputation for ingenuity his almost sublime uncanny cleverness What could be more wonderful than this coincidence He passed with quick steps along the corridor which connected his private den with the board room and came into that spacious apartment with outstretched hand The man who turned to greet him may have been twenty seven or thirty seven He was tall but lithe rather than broad His face was the colour of mahogany and the blue eyes turned to Lyne were unwinking and expressionless That was the first impression which Lyne received He took Lyne s hand in his it was as soft as a woman s As they shook hands Lyne noticed a third figure in the room He was below middle height and sat in the shadow thrown by a wall pillar He too rose but bowed his head A Chinaman eh said Lyne looking at this unexpected apparition with curiosity Oh of course mister Tarling I had almost forgotten that you ve almost come straight from China Won t you sit down He followed the other s example threw himself into a chair and offered his cigarette case The work I am going to ask you to do I will discuss later he said But I must explain that I was partly attracted to you by the description I read in one of the newspapers of how you had recovered the Duchess of Henley s jewels and partly by the stories I heard of you when I was in China You re not attached to Scotland Yard I understand Tarling shook his head No he said quietly I was regularly attached to the police in Shanghai and I had intended joining up with Scotland Yard in fact I came over for that purpose But several things happened which made me open my own detective agency the most important of which happenings was that Scotland Yard refused to give me the free hand I require The other nodded quickly China rang with the achievements of Jack Oliver Tarling or as the Chinese criminal world had named him in parody of his name Lieh Jen The Hunter of Men Lyne judged all people by his own standard and saw in this unemotional man a possible tool and in all probability a likely accomplice The detective force in Shanghai did curious things by all accounts and were not too scrupulous as to whether they kept within the strict letter of the law There were even rumours that The Hunter of Men was not above torturing his prisoners if by so doing he could elicit confessions which could implicate some greater criminal Lyne did not and could not know all the legends which had grown around the name of The Hunter nor could he be expected in reason to differentiate between the truth and the false I pretty well know why you ve sent for me Tarling went on He spoke slowly and had a decided drawl You gave me a rough outline in your letter You suspect a member of your staff of having consistently robbed the firm for many years A mister Milburgh your chief departmental manager Lyne stopped him with a gesture and lowered his voice I want you to forget that for a little while mister Tarling he said In fact I am going to introduce you to Milburgh and maybe Milburgh can help us in my scheme I do not say that Milburgh is honest or that my suspicions were unfounded But for the moment I have a much greater business on hand and you will oblige me if you forget all the things I have said about Milburgh I will ring for him now He walked to a long table which ran half the length of the room took up a telephone which stood at one end and spoke to the operator Tell mister Milburgh to come to me in the board room please he said Then he went back to his visitor That matter of Milburgh can wait he said I m not so sure that I shall proceed any farther with it Did you make inquiries at all If so you had better tell me the gist of them before Milburgh comes Tarling took a small white card from his pocket and glanced at it What salary are you paying Milburgh Nine hundred a year replied Lyne He is living at the rate of five thousand said Tarling I may even discover that he s living at a much larger rate He has a house up the river entertains very lavishly But the other brushed aside the report impatiently No let that wait he cried I tell you I have much more important business Milburgh may be a thief Did you send for me sir He turned round quickly The door had opened without noise and a man stood on the threshold of the room an ingratiating smile on his face his hands twining and intertwining ceaselessly as though he was washing them with invisible soap CHAPTER II THE HUNTER DECLINES HIS QUARRY This is mister Milburgh said Lyne awkwardly If mister Milburgh had heard the last words of his employer his face did not betray the fact His smile was set and not only curved the lips but filled the large lustreless eyes Tarling gave him a rapid survey and drew his own conclusions The man was a born lackey plump of face bald of head and bent of shoulder as though he lived in a perpetual gesture of abasement Shut the door Milburgh and sit down This is mister Tarling Er mister Tarling is er a detective Indeed sir Milburgh bent a deferential head in the direction of Tarling and the detective watching for some change in colour some twist of face any of those signs which had so often betrayed to him the convicted wrongdoer looked in vain A dangerous man he thought He glanced out of the corner of his eye to see what impression the man had made upon Ling Chu To the ordinary eye Ling Chu remained an impassive observer But Tarling saw that faint curl of lip an almost imperceptible twitch of the nostrils which invariably showed on the face of his attendant when he smelt a criminal mister Tarling is a detective repeated Lyne He is a gentleman I heard about when I was in China you know I was in China for three months when I made my tour round the world he asked Tarling Tarling nodded Oh yes I know he said You stayed at the Bund Hotel You spent a great deal of time in the native quarter and you had rather an unpleasant experience as the result of making an experiment in opium smoking Lyne s face went red and then he laughed You know more about me than I know about you Tarling he said with a note of asperity in his voice and turned again to his subordinate I have reason to believe that there has been money stolen in this business by one of my cashiers he said Impossible sir said the shocked mister Milburgh Wholly impossible Who could have done it And how clever of you to have found it out sir I always say that you see what we old ones overlook even though it s right under our noses mister Lyne smiled complacently It will interest you to know mister Tarling he said that I myself have some knowledge of and acquaintance with the criminal classes In fact there is one unfortunate protege of mine whom I have tried very hard to reform for the past four years who is coming out of prison in a couple of days I took up this work he said modestly because I feel it is the duty of us who are in a more fortunate position to help those who have not had a chance in the cruel competition of the world Tarling was not impressed Do you know the person who has been robbing you he asked I have reason to believe it is a girl whom I have summarily dismissed to night and whom I wish you to watch The detective nodded This is rather a primitive business he said with the first faint hint of a smile he had shown Haven t you your own shop detective who could take that job in hand Petty larceny is hardly in my line I understood that this was bigger work He stopped because it was obviously impossible to explain just why he had thought as much in the presence of the man whose conduct originally had been the subject of his inquiries To you it may seem a small matter To me it is very important said mister Lyne profoundly
1963_147036_000083_000000	train-clean-100	 Here 
none	none	is a girl highly respected by all her companions and consequently a great influence on their morals who as I have reason to believe has steadily and persistently falsified my books taking money from the firm and at the same time has secured the goodwill of all with whom she has been brought into contact Obviously she is more dangerous than another individual who succumbs to a sudden temptation It may be necessary to make an example of this girl but I want you clearly to understand mister Tarling that I have not sufficient evidence to convict her otherwise I might not have called you in You want me to get the evidence eh said Tarling curiously Who is the lady may I venture to ask sir It was Milburgh who interposed the question Miss Rider replied Lyne Miss Rider Milburgh s face took on a look of blank surprise as he gasped the words Miss Rider oh no impossible Why impossible demanded mister Lyne sharply Well sir I meant stammered the manager it is so unlikely she is such a nice girl Thornton Lyne shot a suspicious glance at him You have no particular reason for wishing to shield Miss Rider have you he asked coldly No sir not at all I beg of you not to think that appealed the agitated mister Milburgh only it seems so extraordinary All things are extraordinary that are out of the common snapped Lyne It would be extraordinary if you were accused of stealing Milburgh It would be very extraordinary indeed for example if we discovered that you were living a five thousand pounds life on a nine hundred pounds salary eh Only for a second did Milburgh lose his self possession The hand that went to his mouth shook and Tarling whose eyes had never left the man s face saw the tremendous effort which he was making to recover his equanimity Yes sir that would be extraordinary said Milburgh steadily Lyne had lashed himself again into the old fury and if his vitriolic tongue was directed at Milburgh his thoughts were centred upon that proud and scornful face which had looked down upon him in his office It would be extraordinary if you were sent to penal servitude as the result of my discovery that you had been robbing the firm for years he growled and I suppose everybody else in the firm would say the same as you how extraordinary I daresay they would sir said mister Milburgh his old smile back the twinkle again returning to his eyes and his hands rubbing together in ceaseless ablutions It would sound extraordinary and it would be extraordinary and nobody here would be more surprised than the unfortunate victim ha ha Perhaps not said Lyne coldly Only I want to say a few words in your presence and I would like you to give them every attention You have been complaining to me for a month past he said speaking with deliberation about small sums of money being missing from the cashier s office It was a bold thing to say and in many ways a rash thing He was dependent for the success of his hastily formed plan not only upon Milburgh s guilt but upon Milburgh s willingness to confess his guilt If the manager agreed to stand sponsor to this lie he admitted his own peculations and Tarling to whom the turn of the conversation had at first been unintelligible began dimly to see the drift it was taking I have complained that sums of money have been missing for the past month repeated Milburgh dully The smile had gone from his lips and eyes His face was haggard he was a man at bay That is what I said said Lyne watching him Isn t that the fact There was a long pause and presently Milburgh nodded That is the fact sir he said in a low voice And you have told me that you suspected Miss Rider of defalcations Again the pause and again the man nodded Do you hear asked Lyne triumphantly I hear said Tarling quietly Now what do you wish me to do Isn t this a matter for the police I mean the regular police Lyne frowned The case has to be prepared first he said I will give you full particulars as to the girl s address and her habits and it will be your business to collect such information as will enable us to put the case in the hands of Scotland Yard I see said Tarling and smiled again Then he shook his head I m afraid I can t come into this case mister Lyne Can t come in said Lyne in astonishment Why not Because it s not my kind of job said Tarling The first time I met you I had a feeling that you were leading me to one of the biggest cases I had ever undertaken It shows you how one s instincts can lead one astray he smiled again and picked up his hat What do you mean You re going to throw up a valuable client I don t know how valuable you re likely to be said Tarling but at the present moment the signs are not particularly encouraging I tell you I do not wish to be associated with this case mister Lyne and I think there the matter can end You don t think it s worth while eh sneered Lyne Yet when I tell you that I am prepared to give you a fee of five hundred guineas If you gave me a fee of five thousand guineas or fifty thousand guineas I should still decline to be associated with this matter said Tarling and his words had the metallic quality which precludes argument At any rate I am entitled to know why you will not take up this case Do you know the girl asked Lyne loudly I have never met the lady and probably never shall said Tarling I only know that I will not be concerned with what is called in the United States of America a frame up Frame up repeated the other A frame up I dare say you know what it means I will put the matter more plainly and within your understanding For some reason or other you have a sudden grudge against a member of your staff I read your face mister Lyne and the weakness of your chin and the appetite of your mouth suggest to me that you are not over scrupulous with the women who are in your charge I guess rather than know that you have been turned down with a dull sickening thud by a decent girl and in your mortification you are attempting to invent a charge which has no substance and no foundation mister Milburgh he turned to the other and again mister Milburgh ceased to smile has his own reasons for complying with your wishes He is your subordinate and moreover the side threat of penal servitude for him if he refuses has carried some weight Thornton Lyne s face was distorted with fury I will take care that your behaviour is widely advertised he said You have brought a most monstrous charge against me and I shall proceed against you for slander The truth is that you are not equal to the job I intended giving you and you are finding an excuse for getting out The truth is replied Tarling biting off the end of a cigar he had taken from his pocket that my reputation is too good to be risked in associating with such a dirty business as yours I hate to be rude and I hate just as much to throw away good money But I can t take good money for bad work mister Lyne and if you will be advised by me you will drop this stupid scheme for vengeance which your hurt vanity has suggested it is the clumsiest kind of frame up that was ever invented and also you will go and apologise to the young lady whom I have no doubt you have grossly insulted He beckoned to his Chinese satellite and walked leisurely to the door Incoherent with rage shaking in every limb with a weak man s sense of his own impotence Lyne watched him until the door was half closed then springing forward with a strangled cry he wrenched the door open and leapt at the detective Two hands gripped his arm and lifting him bodily back into the room pushed him down into a chair A not unkindly face blinked down at him a face relieved from utter solemnity by the tiny laughter lines about the eyes mister Lyne said the mocking voice of Tarling you are setting an awful example to the criminal classes It is a good job your convict friend is in gaol Without another word he left the room CHAPTER III THE MAN WHO LOVED LYNE Two days later Thornton Lyne sat in his big limousine which was drawn up on the edge of Wandsworth Common facing the gates of the gaol Poet and poseur he was the strangest combination ever seen in man Thornton Lyne was a store keeper a Bachelor of Arts the winner of the Mangate Science Prize and the author of a slim volume The quality of the poetry therein was not very great but it was undoubtedly a slim volume printed in queerly ornate type with old fashioned esses and wide margins He was a store keeper because store keeping supplied him with caviare and peaches a handsome little two seater a six cylinder limousine for state occasions a country house and a flat in town the decorations of which ran to a figure which would have purchased many stores of humbler pretensions than Lyne s Serve First Emporium To the elder Lyne Joseph Emanuel of that family the inception and prosperity of Lyne s Serve First Emporium was due He had devised a sale system which ensured every customer being attended to the moment he or she entered one of the many departments which made up the splendid whole of the emporium It was a system based upon the age old principle of keeping efficient reserves within call Thornton Lyne succeeded to the business at a moment when his slim volume had placed him in the category of the gloriously misunderstood Because such reviewers as had noticed his book wrote of his poetry using inverted commas to advertise their scorn and because nobody bought the volume despite its slimness he became the idol of men and women who also wrote that which nobody read and in consequence developed souls with the celerity that a small boy develops stomachache For nothing in the wide world was more certain to the gloriously misunderstood than this the test of excellence is scorn Thornton Lyne might in different circumstances have drifted upward to sets even more misunderstood yea even to a set superior to marriage and soap and clean shirts and fresh air only his father died of a surfeit and Thornton became the Lyne of Lyne s Serve First His first inclination was to sell the property and retire to a villa in Florence or Capri Then the absurdity the rich humour of an idea struck him He a scholar a gentleman and a misunderstood poet sitting in the office of a store appealed to him Somebody remarked in his hearing that the idea was rich He saw himself in character and the part appealed to him To everybody s surprise he took up his father s work which meant that he signed cheques collected profits and left the management to the Soults and the Neys whom old Napoleon Lyne had relied upon in the foundation of his empire Thornton wrote an address to his three thousand employees which address was printed on decided antique paper in queerly ornate type with wide margins He quoted Seneca Aristotle Marcus Aurelius and the Iliad The address secured better and longer reviews in the newspapers than had his book He had found life a pleasant experience all the more piquant because of the amazement of innumerable ecstatic friends who clasped their hands and asked awefully How can you a man of your temperament Life might have gone on being pleasant if every man and woman he had met had let him have his own way Only there were at least two people with whom Thornton Lyne s millions carried no weight It was warm in his limousine which was electrically heated But outside on that raw April morning it was bitterly cold and the shivering little group of women who stood at a respectful distance from the prison gates drew their shawls tightly about them as errant flakes of snow whirled across the open The common was covered with a white powder and the early flowers looked supremely miserable in their wintry setting The prison clock struck eight and a wicket gate opened A man slouched out his jacket buttoned up to his neck his cap pulled over his eyes At sight of him Lyne dropped the newspaper he had been reading opened the door of the car and jumped out walking towards the released prisoner Well Sam he said genially you didn t expect me The man stopped as if he had been shot and stood staring at the fur coated figure Then Oh mister Lyne he said brokenly Oh guv nor he choked and tears streamed down his face and he gripped the outstretched hand in both of his unable to speak You didn t think I d desert you Sam eh said mister Lyne all aglow with consciousness of his virtue I thought you d given me up sir said Sam Stay huskily You re a gentleman you are sir and I ought to be ashamed of myself Nonsense nonsense Sam Jump into the car my lad Go along People will think you re a millionaire The man gulped grinned sheepishly opened the door and stepped in and sank with a sigh of comfort into the luxurious depths of the big brown cushions Gawd To think that there are men like you in the world sir Why I believe in angels I do Nonsense Sam Now you come along to my flat and I m going to give you a good breakfast and start you fair again I m going to try and keep straight sir I am s help me It may be said in truth that mister Lyne did not care very much whether Sam kept straight or not He might indeed have been very much disappointed if Sam had kept to the straight and narrow path He kept Sam as men keep chickens and prize cows and he collected Sam as other men collect stamps and china Sam was his luxury and his pose In his club he boasted of his acquaintance with this representative of the criminal classes for Sam was an expert burglar and knew no other trade and Sam s adoration for him was one of his most exhilarating experiences And that adoration was genuine Sam would have laid down his life for the pale faced man with the loose mouth He would have suffered himself to be torn limb from limb if in his agony he could have brought ease or advancement to the man who to him was one with the gods Originally Thornton Lyne had found Sam whilst that artist was engaged in burgling the house of his future benefactor It was a whim of Lyne s to give the criminal a good breakfast and to evince an interest in his future Twice had Sam gone down for a short term and once for a long term of imprisonment and on each occasion Thornton Lyne had made a parade of collecting the returned wanderer driving him home giving him breakfast and a great deal of worldly and unnecessary advice and launching him forth again upon the world with ten pounds a sum just sufficient to buy Sam a new kit of burglar s tools Never before had Sam shown such gratitude and never before had Thornton Lyne been less disinterested in his attentions There was a hot bath which Sam Stay could have dispensed with but which out of sheer politeness he was compelled to accept a warm and luxurious breakfast a new suit of clothes with not two but four five pound notes in the pocket After breakfast Lyne had his talk It s no good sir said the burglar shaking his head I ve tried everything to get an honest living but somehow I can t get on in the straight life I drove a taxicab for three months after I came out till a busy fellow A tumbled to me not having a license and brought me up under the Prevention of Crimes Act It s no use my asking you to give me a job in your shop sir because I couldn t stick it I couldn t really I m used to the open air life I like being my own master I m one of those fellows you ve read about the word begins with A Footnote A Detective Adventurers said Lyne with a little laugh Yes I think you are Sam and I m going to give you an adventure after your own heart And then he began to tell a tale of base ingratitude of a girl he had helped had indeed saved from starvation and who had betrayed him at every turn Thornton Lyne was a poet He was also a picturesque liar The lie came as easily as the truth and easier since there was a certain crudeness about truth which revolted his artistic soul And as the tale was unfolded of Odette Rider s perfidy Sam s eyes narrowed There was nothing too bad for such a creature as this She was wholly undeserving of sympathy Presently Thornton Lyne stopped his eyes fixed on the other to note the effect Show me said Sam his voice trembling Show me a way of getting even with her sir and I ll go through hell to do it That s the kind of stuff I like to hear said Lyne and poured out from the long bottle which stood on the coffee tray a stiff tot of Sam s favourite brandy Now I ll give you my idea For the rest of the morning the two men sat almost head to head plotting woe for the girl whose chief offence had been against the dignity of Thornton Lyne and whose virtue had incited the hate of that vicious man CHAPTER IV MURDER Jack Tarling lay stretched upon his hard bed a long cigarette holder between his teeth a book on Chinese metaphysics balanced on his chest at peace with the world The hour was eight o clock and it was the day that Sam Stay had been released from gaol It had been a busy day for Tarling for he was engaged in a bank fraud case which would have occupied the whole of his time had he not had a little private business to attend to This private matter was wholly unprofitable but his curiosity had been piqued He lay the book flat on his chest as the soft click of the opening door announced the coming of his retainer The impassive Ling Chu came noiselessly into the room carrying a tray which he placed upon a low table by the side of his master s bed The Chinaman wore a blue silk pyjama suit a fact which Tarling noticed You are not going out to night then Ling Chu No Lieh Jen said the man They both spoke in the soft sibilant patois of Shantung You have been to the Man with the Cunning Face For answer the other took an envelope from an inside pocket and laid it in the other s hand Tarling glanced at the address So this is where the young lady lives eh Miss Odette Rider twenty seven Carrymore Buildings Edgware Road It is a clan house where many people live said Ling Chu I myself went in your honourable service and saw people coming in and going out interminably and never the same people did I see twice It is what they call in English a flat building Ling said Tarling with a little smile What did the Man with the Cunning Face say to my letter Master he said nothing He just read and read and then he made a face like this Ling gave an imitation of mister Milburgh s smile And then he wrote as you see Tarling nodded He stared for a moment into vacancy then he turned on his elbow and lifted the cup of tea which his servant had brought him What of Face White and Weak Man Ling he asked in the vernacular You saw him I saw him master said the Chinaman gravely He is a man without a heaven Again Tarling nodded The Chinese use the word heaven instead of God and he felt that Ling had very accurately sized up mister Thornton Lyne s lack of spiritual qualities He finished the tea and swung his legs over the edge of the bed Ling he said this place is very dull and sad I do not think I shall live here Will the master go back to Shanghai asked the other without any display of emotion I think so nodded Tarling At any rate this place is too dull Just miserable little taking money easily cases and wife husband lover cases and my soul is sick These are small matters said Ling philosophically But The Master this time he spoke of the great Master Confucius has said that all greatness comes from small things and perhaps some small piece man will cut off the head of some big piece man and then they will call you to find the murderer Tarling laughed You re an optimist Ling he said No I don t think they ll call me in for a murder They don t call in private detectives in this country Ling shook his head But the master must find murderers or he will no longer be Lieh Jen the Hunter of Men You re a bloodthirsty soul Ling said Tarling this time in English which Ling imperfectly understood despite the sustained efforts of eminent missionary schools Now I ll go out he said with sudden resolution I am going to call upon the small piece woman whom White Face desires May I come with you asked Ling Tarling hesitated Yes you may come he said but you must trail me Carrymore Mansions is a great block of buildings sandwiched between two more aristocratic and more expensive blocks of flats in the Edgware Road The ground floor is given up to lock up shops which perhaps cheapened the building but still it was a sufficiently exclusive habitation for the rents as Tarling guessed to be a little too high for a shop assistant unless she were living with her family The explanation as he was to discover lay in the fact that there were some very undesirable basement flats which were let at a lower rental He found himself standing outside the polished mahogany door of one of these wondering exactly what excuse he was going to give to the girl for making a call so late at night And that she needed some explanation was clear from the frank suspicion which showed in her face when she opened the door to him Yes I am Miss Rider she said Can I see you for a few moments I m sorry she said shaking her head but I am alone in the flat so I can t ask you to come in This was a bad beginning Is it not possible for you to come out he asked anxiously and in spite of herself she smiled I m afraid it s quite impossible for me to go out with somebody I have never met before she said with just a trace of amusement in her eyes I recognise the difficulty laughed Tailing Here is one of my cards I m afraid I am not very famous in this country so you will not know my name She took the card and read it A private detective she said in a troubled voice Who has sent you Not mister Not mister Lyne he said She hesitated a moment then threw open the door wider You must come in We can talk here in the hall Do I understand mister Lyne has not sent you mister Lyne was very anxious that I should come he said I am betraying his confidence but I do not think that he has any claim upon my loyalty I don t know why I ve bothered you at all except that I feel that you ought to be put on your guard Against what she asked Against the machinations of a gentleman to whom you have been he hesitated for a word Very offensive she finished for him I don t know how offensive you ve been he laughed but I gather you have annoyed mister Lyne for some reason or other and that he is determined to annoy you I do not ask your confidence in this respect because I realise that you would hardly like to tell me But what I want to tell you is this that mister Lyne is probably framing up a charge against you that is to say inventing a charge of theft Of theft she cried in indignant amazement Against me Of theft It s impossible that he could be so wicked It s not impossible that anybody could be wicked said Tarling of the impassive face and the laughing eyes All that I know is that he even induced mister Milburgh to say that complaints have been made by Milburgh concerning thefts of money from your department That s absolutely impossible she cried emphatically mister Milburgh would never say such a thing Absolutely impossible mister Milburgh didn t want to say such a thing I give him credit for that said Tarling slowly and then gave the gist of the argument omitting any reference direct or indirect to the suspicion which surrounded Milburgh So you see he said in conclusion that you ought to be on your guard I suggest to you that you see a solicitor and put the matter in his hands You need not move against mister Lyne but it would strengthen your position tremendously if you had already detailed the scheme to some person in authority Thank you very very much mister Tarling she said warmly and looked up into his face with a smile so sweet so pathetic so helpless that Tarling s heart melted towards her And if you don t want a solicitor he said you can depend upon me

none	none	if any trouble arises You don t know how grateful I am to you mister Tarling I didn t receive you very graciously If you will forgive my saying so you would have been a fool to have received me in any other way he said She held out both hands to him he took them and there were tears in her eyes Presently she composed herself and led him into her little drawing room Of course I ve lost my job she laughed but I ve had several offers one of which I shall accept I am going to have the rest of the week to myself and to take a holiday Tarling stopped her with a gesture His ears were superhumanly sensitive Are you expecting a visitor he asked softly No said the girl in surprise Do you share this flat with somebody I have a woman who sleeps here she said She is out for the evening Has she a key The girl shook her head The man rose and Odette marvelled how one so tall could move so swiftly and without so much as a sound across the uncarpeted hallway He reached the door turned the knob of the patent lock and jerked it open A man was standing on the mat and he jumped back at the unexpectedness of Tarling s appearance The stranger was a cadaverous looking man in a brand new suit of clothes evidently ready made but he still wore on his face the curious yellow tinge which is the special mark of the recently liberated gaol bird Beg pardon he stammered but is this No eighty seven Tarling shot out a hand and gripping him by the coat drew the helpless man towards him Hullo what are you trying to do What s this you have He wrenched something from the man s hand It was not a key but a flat toothed instrument of strange construction Come in said Tarling and jerked his prisoner into the hall A swift turning back of his prisoner s coat pinioned him and then with dexterousness and in silence he proceeded to search From two pockets he took a dozen jewelled rings each bearing the tiny tag of Lyne s Store Hullo said Tarling sarcastically are these intended as a loving gift from mister Lyne to Miss Rider The man was speechless with rage If looks could kill Tarling would have died A clumsy trick said Tarling shaking his head mournfully Now go back to your boss mister Thornton Lyne and tell him that I am ashamed of an intelligent man adopting so crude a method and with a kick he dismissed Sam Stay to the outer darkness The girl who had been a frightened spectator of the scene turned her eyes imploringly upon the detective What does it mean she pleaded I feel so frightened What did that man want You need not be afraid of that man or any other man said Tarling briskly I m sorry you were scared He succeeded in calming her by the time her servant had returned and then took his leave Remember I have given you my telephone number and you will call me up if there is any trouble Particularly he said emphatically if there is any trouble to morrow But there was no trouble on the following day though at three o clock in the afternoon she called him up I am going away to stay in the country she said I got scared last night Come and see me when you get back said Tarling who had found it difficult to dismiss the girl from his mind I am going to see Lyne to morrow By the way the person who called last night is a protege of mister Thornton Lyne s a man who is devoted to him body and soul and he s the fellow we ve got to look after By Jove It almost gives me an interest in life He heard the faint laugh of the girl Must I be butchered to make a detective s holiday she mocked and he grinned sympathetically Any way I ll see Lyne to morrow he said The interview which Jack Tarling projected was destined never to take place On the following morning an early worker taking a short cut through Hyde Park found the body of a man lying by the side of a carriage drive He was fully dressed save that his coat and waistcoat had been removed Wound about his body was a woman s silk night dress stained with blood The hands of the figure were crossed on the breast and upon them lay a handful of daffodils At eleven o clock that morning the evening newspapers burst forth with the intelligence that the body had been identified as that of Thornton Lyne and that he had been shot through the heart CHAPTER V FOUND IN LYNE S POCKET The London police are confronted with a new mystery which has features so remarkable that it would not be an exaggeration to describe this crime as the Murder Mystery of the Century A well known figure in London Society mister Thornton Lyne head of an important commercial organisation a poet of no mean quality and a millionaire renowned for his philanthropic activities was found dead in Hyde Park in the early hours of this morning in circumstances which admit of no doubt that he was most brutally murdered At half past five Thomas Savage a bricklayer s labourer employed by the Cubitt Town Construction Company was making his way across Hyde Park en route to his work He had crossed the main drive which runs parallel with the Bayswater Road when his attention was attracted to a figure lying on the grass near to the sidewalk He made his way to the spot and discovered a man who had obviously been dead for some hours The body had neither coat nor waistcoat but about the breast on which his two hands were laid was a silk garment tightly wound about the body and obviously designed to stanch a wound on the left side above the heart The extraordinary feature is that the murderer must not only have composed the body but had laid upon its breast a handful of daffodils The police were immediately summoned and the body was removed The police theory is that the murder was not committed in Hyde Park but the unfortunate gentleman was killed elsewhere and his body conveyed to the Park in his own motor car which was found abandoned a hundred yards from the scene of the discovery We understand that the police are working upon a very important clue and an arrest is imminent mister J O Tarling late of the Shanghai Detective Service read the short account in the evening newspaper and was unusually thoughtful Lyne murdered It was an extraordinary coincidence that he had been brought into touch with this young man only a few days before Tarling knew nothing of Lyne s private life though from his own knowledge of the man during his short stay in Shanghai he guessed that that life was not wholly blameless He had been too busy in China to bother his head about the vagaries of a tourist but he remembered dimly some sort of scandal which had attached to the visitor s name and puzzled his head to recall all the circumstances He put down the newspaper with a little grimace indicative of regret If he had only been attached to Scotland Yard what a case this would have been for him Here was a mystery which promised unusual interest His mind wandered to the girl Odette Rider What would she think of it She would be shocked he thought horrified It hurt him to feel that she might be indirectly even remotely associated with such a public scandal and he realised with a sudden sense of dismay that nothing was less unlikely than that her name would be mentioned as one who had quarrelled with the dead man Pshaw he muttered shrugging off the possibility as absurd and walking to the door called his Chinese servant Ling Chu came silently at his bidding Ling Chu he said the white faced man is dead Ling Chu raised his imperturbable eyes to his master s face All men die some time he said calmly This man quick die That is better than long die Tarling looked at him sharply How do you know that he quick die he demanded These things are talked about said Ling Chu without hesitation But not in the Chinese language replied Tarling and Ling Chu you speak no English I speak a little master said Ling Chu and I have heard these things in the streets Tarling did not answer immediately and the Chinaman waited Ling Chu he said after awhile this man came to Shanghai whilst we were there and there was trouble trouble Once he was thrown out from Wing Fu s tea house where he had been smoking opium Also there was another trouble do you remember The Chinaman looked him straight in the eyes I am forgetting he said This white face was a bad man I am glad he is dead Humph said Tarling and dismissed his retainer Ling Chu was the cleverest of all his sleuths a man who never lifted his nose from the trail once it was struck and he had been the most loyal and faithful of Tarling s native trailers But the detective never pretended that he understood Ling Chu s mind or that he could pierce the veil which the native dropped between his own private thoughts and the curious foreigner Even native criminals were baffled in their interpretation of Ling Chu s views and many a man had gone to the scaffold puzzling the head which was soon to be snicked from his body over the method by which Ling Chu had detected his crime Tarling went back to the table and picked up the newspaper but had hardly begun to read when the telephone bell rang He picked up the receiver and listened To his amazement it was the voice of Cresswell the Assistant Commissioner of Police who had been instrumental in persuading Tarling to come to England Can you come round to the Yard immediately Tarling said the voice I want to talk to you about this murder Surely said Tarling I ll be with you in a few minutes In five minutes he was at Scotland Yard and was ushered into the office of Assistant Commissioner Cresswell The white haired man who came across to meet him with a smile of pleasure in his eyes disclosed the object of the summons I m going to bring you into this case Tarling he said It has certain aspects which seem outside the humdrum experience of our own people It is not unusual as you know he said as he motioned the other to a chair for Scotland Yard to engage outside help particularly when we have a crime of this character to deal with The facts you know he went on as he opened a thin folder These are the reports which you can read at your leisure Thornton Lyne was to say the least eccentric His life was not a particularly wholesome one and he had many undesirable acquaintances amongst whom was a criminal and ex convict who was only released from gaol a few days ago That s rather extraordinary said Tarling lifting his eyebrows What had he in common with the criminal Commissioner Cresswell shrugged his shoulders My own view is that this acquaintance was rather a pose of Lyne s He liked to be talked about It gave him a certain reputation for character amongst his friends Who is the criminal asked Tarling He is a man named Stay a petty larcenist and in my opinion a much more dangerous character than the police have realised Is he began Tarling But the Commissioner shook his head I think we can rule him out from the list of people who may be suspected of this murder he said Sam Stay has very few qualities that would commend themselves to the average man but there can be no doubt at all that he was devoted to Lyne body and soul When the detective temporarily in charge of the case went down to Lambeth to interview Stay he found him lying on his bed prostrate with grief with a newspaper containing the particulars of the murder by his side The man is beside himself with sorrow and threatens to do in the person who is responsible for this crime You can interview him later I doubt whether you will get much out of him because he is absolutely incoherent Lyne was something more than human in his eyes and I should imagine that the only decent emotion he has had in his life is this affection for a man who was certainly good to him whether he was sincere in his philanthropy or otherwise Now here are a few of the facts which have not been made public Cresswell settled himself back in his chair and ticked off on his fingers the points as he made them You know that around Lyne s chest a silk night dress was discovered Tarling nodded Under the night dress made into a pad evidently with the object of arresting the bleeding were two handkerchiefs neatly folded as though they had been taken from a drawer They were ladies handkerchiefs so we may start on the supposition that there is a woman in the case Tarling nodded Now another peculiar feature of the case which happily has escaped the attention of those who saw the body first and gave particulars to the newspapers was that Lyne though fully dressed wore a pair of thick felt slippers They were taken out of his own store yesterday evening as we have ascertained by Lyne himself who sent for one of his assistants to his office and told him to get a pair of very soft soled slippers The third item is that Lyne s boots were discovered in the deserted motor car which was drawn up by the side of the road a hundred yards from where the body was lying And the fourth feature and this explains why I have brought you into the case is that in the car was discovered his bloodstained coat and waistcoat In the right hand pocket of the latter garment said Cresswell speaking slowly was found this He took from his drawer a small piece of crimson paper two inches square and handed it without comment to the detective Tarling took the paper and stared Written in thick black ink were four Chinese characters tzu chao fan nao He brought this trouble upon himself CHAPTER VI THE MOTHER OF ODETTE RIDER The two men looked at one another in silence Well said the Commissioner at last Tarling shook his head That s amazing he said and looked at the little slip of paper between his finger and thumb You see why I am bringing you in said the Commissioner If there is a Chinese end to this crime nobody knows better than you how to deal with it I have had this slip translated It means He brought this trouble upon himself Literally self look for trouble said Tarling But there is one fact which you may not have noticed If you will look at the slip you will see that it is not written but printed He passed the little red square across the table and the Commissioner examined it That s true he said in surprise I did not notice that Have you seen these slips before Tarling nodded A few years ago he said There was a very bad outbreak of crime in Shanghai mostly under the leadership of a notorious criminal whom I was instrumental in getting beheaded He ran a gang called The Cheerful Hearts you know the fantastic titles which these Chinese gangs adopt It was their custom to leave on the scene of their depredations the Hong or sign manual of the gang It was worded exactly as this slip only it was written These visiting cards of The Cheerful Hearts were bought up as curios and commanded high prices until some enterprising Chinaman started printing them so that you could buy them at almost any stationer s shop in Shanghai just as you buy picture post cards The Commissioner nodded And this is one of those This is such a one How it came here heaven knows he said It is certainly the most remarkable discovery The Commissioner went to a cupboard unlocked it and took out a suit case which he placed upon the table and opened Now said the Commissioner look at this Tarling This was a stained garment which Tarling had no difficulty in recognising as a night dress He took it out and examined it Save for two sprays of forget me nots upon the sleeves it was perfectly plain and was innocent of lace or embroidery It was found round his body and here are the handkerchiefs He pointed to two tiny squares of linen so discoloured as to be hardly recognisable Tarling lifted the flimsy garment with its evidence of the terrible purpose for which it had been employed and carried it to the light Are there laundry marks None whatever said the Commissioner Or on the handkerchiefs None replied mister Cresswell The property of a girl who lived alone said Tarling She is not very well off but extremely neat fond of good things but not extravagant eh How do you know that asked the Commissioner surprised Tarling laughed The absence of laundry marks shows that she washes her silk garments at home and probably her handkerchiefs also which places her amongst the girls who aren t blessed with too many of this world s goods The fact that it is silk and good silk and that the handkerchiefs are good linen suggests a woman who takes a great deal of trouble yet whom one would not expect to find over dressed Have you any other clue None said the Commissioner We have discovered that mister Lyne had rather a serious quarrel with one of his employees a Miss Odette Rider Tarling caught his breath It was he told himself absurd to take so keen an interest in a person whom he had not seen for more than ten minutes and who a week before was a perfect stranger But somehow the girl had made a deeper impression upon him than he had realised This man who had spent his life in the investigation of crime and in the study of criminals had found little time to interest himself in womanhood and Odette Rider had been a revelation to him I happen to know there was a quarrel I also know the cause he said and related briefly the circumstances under which he himself had met Thornton Lyne What have you against her he said with an assumption of carelessness which he did not feel Nothing definite said the Commissioner Her principal accuser is the man Stay Even he did not accuse her directly but he hinted that she was responsible in some way which he did not particularise for Thornton Lyne s death I thought it curious that he should know anything about this girl but I am inclined to think that Thornton Lyne made this man his confidant What about the man asked Tarling Can he account for his movements last night and early this morning His statement replied the Commissioner is that he saw mister Lyne at his flat at nine o clock and that mister Lyne gave him five pounds in the presence of Lyne s butler He said he left the flat and went to his lodgings in Lambeth where he went to bed very early All the evidence we have been able to collect supports his statement We have interviewed Lyne s butler and his account agrees with Stay s Stay left at five minutes past nine and at twenty five minutes to ten exactly half an hour later Lyne himself left the house driving his two seater He was alone and told the butler he was going to his club How was he dressed asked Tarling That is rather important nodded the Commissioner For he was in evening dress until nine o clock in fact until after Stay had gone when he changed into the kit in which he was found dead Tarling pursed his lips He d hardly change from evening into day dress to go to his club he said He left Scotland Yard a little while after this a much puzzled man His first call was at the flat in Edgware Road which Odette Rider occupied She was not at home and the hall porter told him that she had been away since the afternoon of the previous day Her letters were to be sent on to Hertford He had the address because it was his business to intercept the postman and send forward the letters Hillington Grove Hertford Tarling was worried There was really no reason why he should be he told himself but he was undoubtedly worried And he was disappointed too He felt that if he could have seen the girl and spoken with her for a few minutes he could have completely disassociated her from any suspicion which might attach In fact that she was away from home that she had disappeared from her flat on the eve of the murder would be quite enough as he knew to set the official policeman nosing on her trail Do you know whether Miss Rider has friends at Hertford he asked the porter Oh yes sir said the man nodding Miss Rider s mother lives there Tarling was going when the man detained him with a remark which switched his mind back to the murder and filled him with a momentary sense of hopeless dismay I m rather glad Miss Rider didn t happen to be in last night sir he said Some of the tenants upstairs were making complaints Complaints about what asked Tarling and the man hesitated I suppose you re a friend of the young lady s aren t you and Tarling nodded Well it only shows you said the porter confidentially how people are very often blamed for something they did not do The tenant in the next flat is a bit crotchety he s a musician and rather deaf If he hadn t been deaf he wouldn t have said that Miss Rider was the cause of his being wakened up I suppose it was something that happened outside What did he hear asked Tarling quickly and the porter laughed Well sir he thought he heard a shot and a scream like a woman s It woke him up I should have thought he had dreamt it but another tenant who also lives in the basement heard the same sound and the rum thing was they both thought it was in Miss Rider s flat What time was this They say about midnight sir said the porter but of course it couldn t have happened because Miss Rider had not been in and the flat was empty Here was a disconcerting piece of news for Tarling to carry with him on his railway journey to Hertford He was determined to see the girl and put her on her guard and though he realised that it was not exactly his duty to put a suspected criminal upon her guard and that his conduct was to say the least of it irregular such did not trouble him very much He had taken his ticket and was making his way to the platform when he espied a familiar figure hurrying as from a train which had just come in and apparently the man saw Tarling even before Tarling had recognised him for he turned abruptly aside and would have disappeared into the press of people had not the detective overtaken him Hullo mister Milburgh he said Your name is Milburgh if I remember aright The manager of Lyne s Store turned rubbing his hands his habitual smile upon his face Why to be sure he said genially it s mister Tarling the detective gentleman What sad news this is mister Tarling How dreadful for everybody concerned I suppose it has meant an upset at the Stores this terrible happening Oh yes sir said Milburgh in a shocked voice Of course we closed the Store for the day It is dreadful the most dreadful thing within my experience Is anybody suspected sir he asked Tarling shook his head It is a most mysterious circumstance mister Milburgh he said And then May I ask if any provision had been made to carry on the business in the event of mister Lyne s sudden death Again Milburgh hesitated and seemed reluctant to reply I am of course in control he said as I was when mister Lyne took his trip around the world I have received authority also from mister Lyne s solicitors to continue the direction of the business until the Court appoints a trustee Tarling eyed him narrowly What effect has this murder had upon you personally he asked bluntly Does it enhance or depreciate your position Milburgh smiled Unhappily he said it enhances my position because it gives me a greater authority and a greater responsibility I would that the occasion had never arisen mister Tarling I m sure you do said Tarling dryly remembering Lyne s accusations against the other s probity After a few commonplaces the men parted Milburgh On the journey to Hertford Tarling analysed that urbane man and found him deficient in certain essential qualities weighed him and found him wanting in elements which should certainly form part of the equipment of a trustworthy man At Hertford he jumped into a cab and gave the address Hillington Grove sir That s about two miles out said the cabman It s missus Rider you want Tarling nodded You ain t come with the young lady she was expecting said the driver No replied Tarling in surprise I was told to keep my eyes open for a young lady explained the cabman vaguely A further surprise awaited the detective He expected to discover that Hillington Grove was a small suburban house bearing a grandiose title He was amazed when the cabman turned through a pair of impressive gates and drove up a wide drive of some considerable length turning eventually on to a gravelled space before a large mansion It was hardly the kind of home he would have expected for the parent of a cashier at Lyne s Store and his surprise was increased when the door was opened by a footman He was ushered into a drawing room beautifully and artistically furnished He began to think that some mistake had been made and was framing an apology to the mistress of the house when the door opened and a lady entered Her age was nearer forty than thirty but she was still a beautiful woman and carried herself with the air of a grand dame She was graciousness itself to the visitor but Tarling thought he detected a note of anxiety both in her mien and in her voice I m afraid there s some mistake he began I have probably found the wrong missus Rider I wanted to see Miss Odette Rider The lady nodded That is my daughter she said Have you any news of her I am quite worried about her Worried about her said Tarling quickly Why what has happened Isn t she here Here said missus Rider wide eyed Of course she is not But hasn t she been here asked Tarling Didn t she arrive here two nights ago missus Rider shook her head My daughter has not been she replied But she promised to come and spend a few days with me and last night I received a telegram wait a moment I will get it for you She was gone a few moments and came back with a little buff form which she handed to the detective He looked and read My visit cancelled Do not write to me at flat I will communicate with you when I reach my destination The telegram had been handed in at the General Post Office London and was dated nine o clock three hours according to expert opinion before the murder was committed CHAPTER VII THE WOMAN IN THE CASE May I keep this telegram asked Tarling The woman nodded He saw that she was nervous ill at ease and worried I can t quite understand why Odette should not come she said Is there any particular reason That I can t say said Tarling But please don t let it worry you missus Rider She probably changed her mind at the last moment and is staying with friends in town Then you haven t seen her asked missus Rider anxiously I haven t seen her for several days Is anything wrong Her voice shook for a second but she recovered herself You see she made an attempt to smile I have been in the house for two or three days and I have seen neither Odette nor nor anybody else she added quickly Who was she expecting to see wondered Tarling and why did she check herself Was it possible that she had not heard of the murder He determined to test her Your daughter is probably detained in town owing to mister Lyne s death he said watching her closely She started and went white mister Lyne s death she stammered Has he died That young man He was murdered in Hyde Park yesterday morning said Tarling and she staggered back and collapsed into a chair Murdered Murdered she whispered Oh God Not that not that Her face was ashen white and she was shaking in every limb this stately woman who had walked so serenely into the drawing room a few minutes before Presently she covered her face with her hands and began to weep softly and Tarling waited Did you know mister Lyne he asked after a while 
1963_147036_000013_000000	train-clean-100	She shook her head 
1963_147036_000020_000000	train-clean-100	She shook her head 
1963_147036_000023_000000	train-clean-100	She shook her head 
none	none	Have you heard any stories about mister Lyne She looked up None she said listlessly except that he was not a very nice man Forgive me asking you but are you very much interested He hesitated and she lifted her head He did not know how to put this question into words It puzzled him that the daughter of this woman who was evidently well off should be engaged in a more or less humble capacity in Lyne s Store He wanted to know whether she knew that the girl had been dismissed and whether that made much difference to her Then again his conversation with Odette Rider had not led him to the conclusion that she could afford to throw up her work She spoke of finding another job and that did not sound as though her mother was in a good position Is there any necessity for your daughter working for a living he asked bluntly and she dropped her eyes It is her wish she said in a low voice She does not get on with people about here she added hastily There was a brief silence then he rose and offered his hand I do hope I haven t worried you with my questions he said and I daresay you wonder why I have come I will tell you candidly that I am engaged in investigating this murder and I was hoping to hear that your daughter in common with the other people who were brought into contact with mister Lyne might give me some thread of a clue which would lead to more important things A detective she asked and he could have sworn there was horror in her eyes A sort of detective he laughed but not a formidable one I hope missus Rider She saw him to the door and watched him as he disappeared down the drive then walked slowly back to the room and stood against the marble mantelpiece her head upon her arms weeping softly Jack Tarling left Hertford more confused than ever He had instructed the fly driver to wait for him at the gates and this worthy he proceeded to pump missus Rider had been living in Hertford for four years and was greatly respected Did the cabman know the daughter Oh yes he had seen the young lady once or twice but She don t come very often he explained By all accounts she doesn t get on with her father Her father I did not know she had a father said Tarling in surprise Yes there was a father He was an infrequent visitor and usually came up from London by the late train and was driven in his own brougham to the house He had not seen him indeed very few people had but by all accounts he was a very nice man and well connected in the City Tarling had telegraphed to the assistant who had been placed at his disposal by Scotland Yard and Detective Inspector Whiteside was waiting for him at the station Any fresh news asked Tarling Yes sir there s rather an important clue come to light said Whiteside I ve got the car here sir and we might discuss it on the way back to the Yard What is it asked Tarling We got it from mister Lyne s manservant said the inspector It appears that the butler had been going through mister Lyne s things acting on instructions from headquarters and in a corner of his writing desk a telegram was discovered I ll show it you when I get to the Yard It has a very important bearing upon the case and I think may lead us to the murderer On the word telegram Tarling felt mechanically in his pockets for the wire which missus Rider had given him from her daughter Now he took it out and read it again It had been handed in at the General Post Office at nine o clock exactly That s extraordinary sir Detective Inspector Whiteside sitting by his side had overlooked the wire What is extraordinary asked Tarling with an air of surprise I happened to see the signature to that wire Odette isn t it said the Scotland Yard man Yes nodded Tarling Why What is there extraordinary in that Well sir said Whiteside it s something of a coincidence that the telegram which was found in mister Lyne s desk and making an appointment with him at a certain flat in the Edgware Road was also signed Odette and he bent forward looking at the wire still in the astonished Tarling s hand and he said in triumph it was handed in exactly at the same time as that An examination of the telegram at Scotland Yard left no doubt in the detective s mind that Whiteside had spoken nothing but the truth An urgent message was despatched to the General Post Office and in two hours the original telegrams were before him They were both written in the same hand The first to her mother saying that she could not come the second to Lyne running Will you see me at my flat to night at eleven o clock ODETTE RIDER Tarling s heart sank within him This amazing news was stunning It was impossible impossible he told himself again and again that this girl could have killed Lyne Suppose she had Where had they met Had they gone driving together and had she shot him in making the circuit of the Park But why should he be wearing list slippers Why should his coat be off and why should the night dress be bound round and round his body He thought the matter out but the more he thought the more puzzled he became It was a very depressed man who interviewed an authority that night and secured from him a search warrant Armed with this and accompanied by Whiteside he made his way to the flat in Edgware Road and showing his authority secured a pass key from the hall porter who was also the caretaker of the building Tarling remembered the last time he had gone to the flat and it was with a feeling of intense pity for the girl that he turned the key in the lock and stepped into the little hall reaching out his hand and switching on the light as he did so There was nothing in the hall to suggest anything unusual There was just that close and musty smell which is peculiar to all buildings which have been shut up even for a few days But there was something else Tarling sniffed and Whiteside sniffed A dull burnt smell some pungent scorched odour which he recognised as the stale stench of exploded cordite He went into the tiny dining room everything was neat nothing displaced That s curious said Whiteside pointing to the sideboard and Tarling saw a deep glass vase half filled with daffodils Two or three blossoms had either fallen or had been pulled out and were lying shrivelled and dead on the polished surface of the sideboard Humph said Tarling I don t like this very much He turned and walked back into the hall and opened another door which stood ajar Again he turned on the light He was in the girl s bedroom He stopped dead and slowly examined the room But for the disordered appearance of the chest of drawers there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the room At the open doors of the bureau a little heap of female attire had been thrown pell mell upon the floor All these were eloquent of hasty action Still more was a small suit case half packed an the bed also left in a great hurry Tarling stepped into the room and if he had been half blind he could not have missed the last and most damning evidence of all The carpet was of a biscuit colour and covered the room flush to the wainscot Opposite the fireplace was a big dark red irregular stain Tarling s face grew tense This is where Lyne was shot he said And look there said Whiteside excitedly pointing to the chest of drawers Tarling stepped quickly across the room and pulled out a garment which hung over the edge of the drawer It was a night dress a silk night dress with two little sprays of forget me nots embroidered on the sleeves It was the companion to that which had been found about Lyne s body And there was something more The removal of the garment from the drawer disclosed a mark on the white enamel of the bureau It was a bloody thumb print The detective looked round at his assistant and the expression of his face was set in its hardest mask Whiteside he said quietly swear out a warrant for the arrest of Odette Rider on a charge of wilful murder Telegraph all stations to detain this girl and let me know the result Without another word he turned from the room and walked back to his lodgings CHAPTER VIII THE SILENCING OF SAM STAY There was a criminal in London who was watched day and night It was no new experience to Sam Stay to find an unconcerned looking detective strolling along behind him but for the first time in his life the burglar was neither disconcerted nor embarrassed by these attentions The death of Thornton Lyne had been the most tragic blow which had ever overtaken him And if they had arrested him he would have been indifferent For this hang dog criminal with the long melancholy face lined and seamed and puckered so that he appeared to be an old man had loved Thornton Lyne as he had loved nothing in his wild and barren life Lyne to him had been some divine creature possessed gifts and qualities which no other would have recognised in him In Sam s eyes Lyne could have done no wrong By Sam Stay s standard he stood for all that was beautiful in human nature Thornton Lyne was dead Dead dead dead Every footfall echoed the horrible unbelievable word The man was incapable of feeling every other pain was deadened in this great suffering which was his And who had been the cause of it all Whose treachery had cut short this wonderful life He ground his teeth at the thought Odette Rider He remembered the name He remembered all the injuries she had done to this man his benefactor He remembered that long conversation which Lyne and he had had on the morning of Sam s release from prison and the plannings which had followed He could not know that his hero was lying and that in his pique and hurt vanity he was inventing grievances which had no foundation and offences which had never been committed He only knew that because of the hate which lay in Thornton Lyne s heart justifiable hate from Sam s view the death of this great man had been encompassed He walked aimlessly westward unconscious of and uncaring for his shadower and had reached the end of Piccadilly when somebody took him gently by the arm He turned and as he recognised an acquaintance his thick lips went back in an ugly snarl It s all right Sam said the plain clothes policeman with a grin There s no trouble coming to you I just want to ask you a few questions You fellows have been asking questions day and night since since that happened growled Sam Nevertheless he permitted himself to be mollified and led to a seat in the Park Now I m putting it to you straight Sam said the policeman We ve got nothing against you at the Yard but we think you might be able to help us You knew mister Lyne he was very decent to you Here shut up said Sam savagely I don t want to talk about it I don t want to think about it D ye hear He was the grandest fellow that ever was was mister Lyne God bless him Oh my God My God he wailed and to the detective s surprise this hardened criminal buried his face in his hands That s all right Sam I know he was a nice fellow Had he any enemies he might have talked to a chap like you where he wouldn t have talked to his friends Sam red eyed looked up suspiciously Am I going to get into any trouble for talking he said None at all Sam said the policeman quickly Now you be a good lad and do all you can to help us and maybe if you ever get into trouble we ll put one in for you Do you see Did anybody hate him Sam nodded Was it a woman asked the detective with studied indifference It was replied the other with an oath Damn her it was He treated her well did mister Lyne She was broke half starving he took her out of the gutter and put her into a good place and she went about making accusations against him He poured forth a stream of the foulest abuse which the policeman had ever heard That s the kind of girl she was Slade he went on addressing the detective as criminals will familiarly by their surnames She ain t fit to walk the earth His voice broke Might I ask her name demanded Slade Again Sam looked suspiciously around Look here he said leave me to deal with her I ll settle with her and don t you worry That would only get you into trouble Sam mused Slade Just give us her name Did it begin with an R How do I know growled the criminal I can t spell Her name was Odette Rider said the other eagerly That s her She used to be cashier in Lyne s Store Now just quieten yourself down and tell me all Lyne told you about her will you my lad Sam Stay stared at him and then a slow look of cunning passed over his face If it was her he breathed If I could only put her away for it Nothing better illustrated the mentality of this man than the fact that the thought of shopping the girl had not occurred to him before That was the idea a splendid idea Again his lips curled back and he eyed the detective with a queer little smile All right sir he said I ll tell the head split I m not going to tell you That s as it ought to be Sam said the detective genially You can tell mister Tarling or mister Whiteside and they ll make it worth your while The detective called a cab and together they drove not to Scotland Yard but to Tarling s little office in Bond Street It was here that the man from Shanghai had established his detective agency and here he waited with the phlegmatic Whiteside for the return of the detective he had sent to withdraw Sam Stay from his shadower The man shuffled into the room looked resentfully from one to the other nodded to both and declined the chair which was pushed forward for him His head was throbbing in an unaccountable way as it had never throbbed before There were curious buzzes and noises in his ears It was strange that he had not noticed this until he came into the quiet room to meet the grave eyes of a hard faced man whom he did not remember having seen before Now Stay said Whiteside whom at least the criminal recognised we want to hear what you know about this murder Stay pressed his lips together and made no reply Sit down said Tarling and this time the man obeyed Now my lad Tarling went on and when he was in a persuasive mood his voice was silky they tell me that you were a friend of mister Lyne s Sam nodded He was good to you was he not Good The man drew a deep breath I d have given my heart and soul to save him from a minute s pain I would sir I m telling you straight and may I be struck dead if I m lying He was an angel on earth my God if ever I lay me hands on that woman I ll strangle her I ll put her out I ll not leave her till she s torn to rags His voice rose specks of foam stood on his lips his whole face seemed transfigured in an ecstasy of hate She s been robbing him and robbing him for years he shouted He looked after her and protected her and she went and told lies about him she did She trapped him His voice rose to a scream and he made a move forward towards the desk both fists clenched till the knuckles showed white Tarling sprang up for he recognised the signs Before another word could be spoken the man collapsed in a heap on the floor and lay like one dead Tarling was round the table in an instant turned the unconscious man on his back and lifting one eyelid examined the pupil Epilepsy or something worse he said This thing has been preying on the poor devil s mind phone an ambulance Whiteside will you Shall I give him some water Tarling shook his head He won t recover for hours if he recovers at all he said If Sam Stay knows anything to the detriment of Odette Rider he is likely to carry his knowledge to the grave And in his heart of hearts J O Tarling felt a little sense of satisfaction that the mouth of this man was closed CHAPTER IX WHERE THE FLOWERS CAME FROM Where was Odette Rider That was a problem which had to be solved She had disappeared as though the earth had opened and swallowed her up Every police station in the country had been warned all outgoing ships were being watched tactful inquiries had been made in every direction where it was likely she might be found and the house at Hertford was under observation day and night Tarling had procured an adjournment of the inquest for whatever might be his sentiments towards Odette Rider he was it seemed more anxious to perform his duty to the State and it was very necessary that no prurient minded coroner should investigate too deeply into the cause and the circumstances leading up to Thornton Lyne s death lest the suspected criminal be warned Accompanied by Inspector Whiteside he reexamined the flat to which the bloodstained carpet pointed unmistakably as being the scene of the murder The red thumb prints on the bureau had been photographed and were awaiting comparison with the girl s the moment she was apprehended Carrymore Mansions where Odette Rider lived were as has been described a block of good class flats the ground floor being given over to shops The entrance to the flats was between two of these and a flight of stairs led down to the basement Here were six sets of apartments with windows giving out to the narrow areas which ran parallel to the side streets on either side of the block The centre of the basement consisted of a large concrete store room about which were set little cubicles or cellars in which the tenants stored such of their baggage furniture et cetera as they did not need It was possible he discovered to pass from the corridor of the basement flat into the store room and out through a door at the back of the building into a small courtyard Access to the street was secured through a fairly large door placed there for the convenience of tenants who wished to get their coal and heavy stores delivered In the street behind the block of flats was a mews consisting of about a dozen shut up stables all of which were rented by a taxicab company and now used as a garage If the murder was committed in the flat it was by this way the body would have been carried to the mews and here too a car would attract little attention Inquiries made amongst employees of the cab company some of whom occupied little rooms above their garages elicited the important information that the car had been seen in the mews on the night of the murder a fact it seemed which had been overlooked in the preliminary police investigations The car was a two seater Daimler with a yellow body and a hood This was an exact description of Thornton Lyne s machine which had been found near the place where his body was discovered The hood of the car was up when it was seen in the mews and the time apparently was between ten and eleven on the night of the murder But though he pursued the most diligent inquiries Tarling failed to discover any human being who had either recognised Lyne or observed the car arrive or depart The hall porter of the flats on being interviewed was very emphatic that nobody had come into the building by the main entrance between the hours of ten and half past It was possible he admitted that they could have come between half past ten and a quarter to eleven because he had gone to his office which proved to be a stuffy little place under the stairs to change from his uniform into his private clothes before going home He was in the habit of locking the front door at eleven o clock Tenants of the mansions had pass keys to the main door and of all that happened after eleven he would be ignorant He admitted that he may have gone a little before eleven that night but even as to this he was not prepared to swear In fact said Whiteside afterwards his evidence would lead nowhere At the very hour when somebody might have come into the flat that is to say between half past ten and a quarter to eleven he admits he was not on duty Tarling nodded He had made a diligent search of the floor of the basement corridor through the store room into the courtyard but had found no trace of blood Nor did he expect to find any such trace since it was clear that if the murder had been committed in the flat and the night dress which was wound about the dead man s body was Odette Rider s there would be no bleeding Of one thing I am satisfied he said if Odette Rider committed this murder she had an accomplice It was impossible that she could have carried or dragged this man into the open and put him into the car carried him again from the car and laid him on the grass The daffodils puzzle me said Whiteside Why should he be found with daffodils on his chest And why if he was murdered here should she trouble to pay that tribute of her respect Tarling shook his head He was nearer a solution to the latter mystery than either of them knew His search of the flat completed he drove to Hyde Park and guided by Whiteside made his way to the spot where the body was found It was on a gravelled sidewalk nearer to the grass than to the road and Whiteside described the position of the body Tarling looked round and suddenly uttered an exclamation I wonder he said pointing to a flower bed Whiteside stared then laughed That curious he said We seem to see nothing but daffodils in this murder The big bed to which Tarling walked was smothered with great feathery bells that danced and swayed in the light spring breezes Humph said Tarling Do you know anything about daffodils Whiteside Whiteside shook his head with a laugh All daffodils are daffodils to me Is there any difference in them I suppose there must be Tarling nodded These are known as Golden Spurs he said a kind which is very common in England The daffodils in Miss Rider s flat are the variety known as the Emperor Well said Whiteside Well said the other slowly the daffodils I saw this morning which were found on Lyne s chest were Golden Spurs He knelt down by the side of the bed and began pushing aside the stems examining the ground carefully Here you are he said He pointed to a dozen jagged stems That is where the daffodils were plucked I d like to swear to that Look they were all pulled together by one hand Somebody leaned over and pulled a handful Whiteside looked dubious Mischievous boys sometimes do these things Only in single stalks said Tarling and the regular flower thieves are careful to steal from various parts of the bed so that the loss should not be reported by the Park gardeners Then you suggest I suggest that whoever killed Thornton Lyne found it convenient for some reason best known to himself or herself to ornament the body as it was found and the flowers were got from here Not from the girl s flat at all I m sure of that replied Tarling emphatically In fact I knew that this morning when I d seen the daffodils which you had taken to Scotland Yard Whiteside scratched his nose in perplexity The further this case goes the more puzzled I am he said Here is a man a wealthy man who has apparently no bitter enemies discovered dead in Hyde Park with a woman s silk night dress wound round his chest with list slippers on his feet and a Chinese inscription in his pocket and further to puzzle the police a bunch of daffodils on the chest That was a woman s act mister Tarling he said suddenly 
1963_147036_000068_000000	train-clean-100	Tarling started 
none	none	How do you mean he asked It was a woman s act to put flowers on the man said Whiteside quietly Those daffodils tell me of pity and compassion and perhaps repentance A slow smile dawned on Tarling s face My dear Whiteside he said you are getting sentimental And here he added looking up attracted to the spot is a gentleman I seem to be always meeting mister Milburgh I think Milburgh had stopped at the sight of the detective and looked as if he would have been glad to have faded away unobserved But Tarling had seen him and Milburgh came forward with his curious little shuffling walk a set smile on his face the same worried look in his eyes which Tarling had seen once before Good morning gentlemen he said with a flourish of his top hat I suppose mister Tarling nothing has been discovered At any rate I didn t expect to discover you here this morning smiled Tarling I thought you were busy at the Stores Milburgh shifted uneasily The place has a fascination for me he said huskily I I can t keep away from it He dropped his eyes before Tarling s keen gaze and repeated the question Is there any fresh news I ought to ask you that said Tarling quietly The other looked up You mean Miss Rider he asked No sir nothing has been found to her detriment and I cannot trace her present address although I have pursued the most diligent inquiries It is very upsetting There was a new emphasis in his voice Tarling remembered that when Lyne had spoken to Milburgh before and had suggested that the girl had been guilty of some act of predation Milburgh had been quick to deny the possibility Now his manner was hostile to the girl indefinitely so but sufficiently marked for Tarling to notice it Do you think that Miss Rider had any reason for running away asked the detective Milburgh shrugged his shoulders In this world he said unctuously one is constantly being deceived by people in whom one has put one s trust In other words you suspect Miss Rider of robbing the firm Up went mister Milburgh s plump hands I would not say that he said I would not accuse a young woman of such an act of treachery to her employers and I distinctly refuse to make any charges until the auditors have completed their work There is no doubt he added carefully that Miss Rider had the handling of large sums of money and she of all people in the business and particularly in the cashier s department would have been able to rob the firm without the knowledge of either myself or poor mister Lyne This of course is confidential He laid one hand appealingly on Tarling s arm and that worthy nodded Have you any idea where she would be Again Milburgh shook his head The only thing he hesitated and looked into Tarling s eyes Well asked the detective impatiently There is a suggestion of course that she may have gone abroad I do not offer that suggestion only I know that she spoke French very well and that she had been to the Continent before Tarling stroked his chin thoughtfully To the Continent eh he said softly Well in that case I shall search the Continent for on one thing I am determined and that is to find Odette Rider and beckoning to his companion he turned on his heel and left the obsequious mister Milburgh staring after him CHAPTER X THE WOMAN AT ASHFORD Tarling went back to his lodgings that afternoon a puzzled and baffled man Ling Chu his impassive Chinese servant had observed those symptoms of perplexity before but now there was something new in his master s demeanour a kind of curt irritation an anxiety which in the Hunter of Men had not been observed before The Chinaman went silently about the business of preparing his chief s tea and made no reference to the tragedy or to any of its details He had set the table by the side of the bed and was gliding from the room in that cat like way of his when Tarling stopped him Ling Chu he said speaking in the vernacular you remember in Shanghai when the Cheerful Hearts committed a crime how they used to leave behind their hong Yes master I remember it very well said Ling Chu calmly They were certain words on red paper and afterwards you could buy them from the shops because people desired to have these signs to show to their friends Many people carried these things said Tarling slowly and the sign of the Cheerful Hearts was found in the pocket of the murdered man Ling Chu met the other s eyes with imperturbable calmness Master he said may not the white faced man who is now dead have brought such a thing from Shanghai He was a tourist and tourists buy these foolish souvenirs Tarling nodded again That is possible he said I have already thought that such might have been the case Yet why should he have this sign of the Cheerful Hearts in his pocket on the night he was murdered Master said the Chinaman why should he have been murdered Tarling s lips curled in a half smile By which I suppose you mean that one question is as difficult to answer as the other he said All right Ling Chu that will do His principal anxiety for the moment was not this or any other clue which had been offered but the discovery of Odette Rider s present hiding place Again and again he turned the problem over in his mind At every point he was baffled by the wild improbability of the facts that he had discovered Why should Odette Rider be content to accept a servile position in Lyne s Stores when her mother was living in luxury at Hertford Who was her father that mysterious father who appeared and disappeared at Hertford and what part did he play in the crime And if she was innocent why had she disappeared so completely and in circumstances so suspicious And what did Sam Stay know The man s hatred of the girl was uncanny At the mention of her name a veritable fountain of venom had bubbled up and Tarling had sensed the abysmal depths of this man s hate and something of his boundless love for the dead man He turned impatiently on the couch and reached out his hand for his tea when there came a soft tap at the door and Ling Chu slipped into the room The Bright Man is here he said and in these words announced Whiteside who brought into the room something of his alert fresh personality which had earned him the pseudonym which Ling Chu had affixed Well mister Tarling said the Inspector taking out a little notebook I m afraid I haven t done very much in the way of discovering the movements of Miss Rider but so far as I can find out by inquiries made at Charing Cross booking office several young ladies unattended have left for the Continent in the past few days You cannot identify any of these with Miss Rider asked Tarling in a tone of disappointment The detective shook his head Despite his apparent unsuccess he had evidently made some discovery which pleased him for there was nothing gloomy in his admission of failure You have found out something though suggested Tarling quickly and Whiteside nodded Yes he said by the greatest of luck I ve got hold of a very curious story I was chatting with some of the ticket collectors and trying to discover a man who might have seen the girl I have a photograph of her taken in a group of Stores employees and this I have had enlarged as it may be very useful Tarling nodded Whilst I was talking with the man on the gate Whiteside proceeded a travelling ticket inspector came up and he brought rather an extraordinary story from Ashford On the night of the murder there was an accident to the Continental Express I remember seeing something about it said Tarling but my mind has been occupied by this other matter What happened A luggage truck which was standing on the platform fell between two of the carriages and derailed one of them explained Whiteside The only passenger who was hurt was a Miss Stevens Apparently it was a case of simple concussion and when the train was brought to a standstill she was removed to the Cottage Hospital where she is to day Apparently the daughter of the travelling ticket inspector is a nurse at the hospital and she told her father that this Miss Stevens before she recovered consciousness made several references to a mister Lyne and a mister Milburgh Tarling was sitting erect now watching the other through narrowed lids Go on he said quietly I could get very little from the travelling inspector except that his daughter was under the impression that the lady had a grudge against mister Lyne and that she spoke even more disparagingly of mister Milburgh Tarling had risen and slipped off his silk dressing gown before the other could put away his notebook He struck a gong with his knuckles and when Ling Chu appeared gave him an order in Chinese which Whiteside could not follow You re going to Ashford I thought you would said Whiteside Would you like me to come along No thank you said the other I ll go myself I have an idea that Miss Stevens may be the missing witness in the case and may throw greater light upon the happenings of the night before last than any other witness we have yet interviewed He found he had to wait an hour before he could get a train for Ashford and he passed that hour impatiently walking up and down the broad platform Here was a new complication in the case Who was Miss Stevens and why should she be journeying to Dover on the night of the murder He reached Ashford and with difficulty found a cab for it was raining heavily and he had come provided with neither mackintosh nor umbrella The matron of the Cottage Hospital reassured him on one point Oh yes Miss Stevens is still in the hospital she said and he breathed a sigh of relief There was just a chance that she might have been discharged and again the possibility that she would be difficult to trace The matron showed him the way through a long corridor terminating in a big ward Before reaching the door of the ward there was a smaller door on the right We put her in this private ward because we thought it might be necessary to operate said the matron and opened the door Tarling walked in Facing him was the foot of the bed and in that bed lay a girl whose eyes met his He stopped dead as though he were shot For Miss Stevens was Odette Rider CHAPTER XI THORNTON LYNE IS DEAD For a time neither spoke Tarling walked slowly forward pulled a chair to the side of the bed and sat down never once taking his eyes off the girl Odette Rider The woman for whom the police of England were searching against whom a warrant had been issued on a charge of wilful murder and here in a little country hospital For a moment and a moment only Tarling was in doubt Had he been standing outside the case and watching it as a disinterested spectator or had this girl never come so closely into his life bringing a new and a disturbing influence so that the very balance of his judgment was upset he would have said that she was in hiding and had chosen this hospital for a safe retreat The very name under which she was passing was fictitious a suspicious circumstance in itself The girl s eyes did not leave his He read in their clear depths a hint of terror and his heart fell He had not realised before that the chief incentive he found in this case was not to discover the murderer of Thornton Lyne but to prove that the girl was innocent mister Tarling she said with a queer little break in her voice I I did not expect to see you It was a lame opening and it seemed all the more feeble to her since she had so carefully rehearsed the statement she had intended making For her waking moments since the accident had been filled with thoughts of this hard faced man what he would think what he would say and what in certain eventualities he would do I suppose not said Tarling gently I am sorry to hear you have had rather a shaking Miss Rider She nodded and a faint smile played about the corners of her mouth It was nothing very much she said Of course it was very harried at first and what do you want The last words were blurted out She could not keep up the farce of a polite conversation There was a moment s silence and then Tarling spoke I wanted to find you he said speaking slowly and again he read her fear Well she hesitated and then said desperately and just a little defiantly you have found me Tarling nodded And now that you have found me she went on speaking rapidly what do you want She was resting on her elbow her strained face turned towards him her eyes slightly narrowed watching him with an intensity of gaze which betrayed her agitation I want to ask you a few questions said Tarling and slipped a little notebook from his pocket balancing it upon his knee To his dismay the girl shook her head I don t know that I am prepared to answer your questions she said more calmly but there is no reason why you should not ask them Here was an attitude wholly unexpected And Odette Rider panic stricken he could understand If she had burst into a fit of weeping if she had grown incoherent in her terror if she had been indignant or shame faced any of these displays would have fitted in with his conception of her innocence or apprehension of her guilt In the first place he asked bluntly why are you here under the name of Miss Stevens She thought a moment then shook her head That is a question I am not prepared to answer she said quietly I won t press it for a moment said Tarling because I realise that it is bound up in certain other extraordinary actions of yours Miss Rider The girl flushed and dropped her eyes and Tarling went on Why did you leave London secretly without giving your friends or your mother any inkling of your plans She looked up sharply Have you seen mother she asked quietly and again her eyes were troubled I ve seen your mother said Tarling I have also seen the telegram you sent to her Come Miss Rider won t you let me help you Believe me a great deal more depends upon your answers than the satisfaction of my curiosity You must realise how very serious your position is He saw her lips close tightly and she shook her head I have nothing to say she said with a catch of her breath If if you think I have She stopped dead Finish your sentence said Tarling sternly If I think you have committed this crime She nodded He put away his notebook before he spoke again and leaning over the bed took her hand Miss Rider 
1963_147036_000029_000002	train-clean-100	I want to help you 
none	none	he said earnestly and I can help you best if you re frank with me I tell you I do not believe that you committed this act I tell you now that though all the circumstances point to your guilt I have absolute confidence that you can produce an answer to the charge For a moment her eyes filled with tears but she bit her lip and smiled bravely into his face That is good and sweet of you mister Tarling and I do appreciate your kindness But I can t tell you anything I can t I can t She gripped his wrist in her vehemence and he thought she was going to break down but again with an extraordinary effort of will which excited his secret admiration she controlled herself You re going to think very badly of me she said and I hate the thought mister Tarling you don t know how I hate it I want you to think that I am innocent but I am going to make no effort to prove that I was not guilty You re mad he interrupted her roughly Stark raving mad You must do something do you hear You ve got to do something She shook her head and the little hand which rested on his closed gently about two of his fingers I can t she said simply I just can t Tarling pushed back the chair from the bed He could have groaned at the hopelessness of the girl s case If she had only given him one thread that would lead him to another clue if she only protested her innocence His heart sank within him and he could only shake his head helplessly Suppose he said huskily that you are charged with this crime Do you mean to tell me that you will not produce evidence that could prove your innocence that you will make no attempt to defend yourself She nodded I mean that she said My God You don t know what you re saying he cried starting up You re mad Odette stark mad She only smiled for the fraction of a second and that at the unconscious employment of her Christian name I m not at all mad she said I am very sane She looked at him thoughtfully and then of a sudden seemed to shrink back and her face went whiter You you have a warrant for me she whispered He nodded And you re going to arrest me He shook his head No he said briefly I am leaving that to somebody else I have sickened of the case and I m going out of it He sent you here she said slowly He Yes I remember You were working with him or he wanted you to work with him Of whom are you speaking asked Tarling quickly Thornton Lyne said the girl Tarling leaped to his feet and stared down at her Thornton Lyne he repeated Don t you know Know what asked the girl with a frown That Thornton Lyne is dead said Tarling and that it is for his murder that a warrant has been issued for your arrest She looked at him for a moment with wide staring eyes Dead she gasped Dead Thornton Lyne dead You don t mean that you don t mean that She clutched at Tarling s arm Tell me that isn t true He did not do it he dare not do it She swayed forward and Tarling dropping on his knees beside the bed caught her in his arms as she fainted CHAPTER XII THE HOSPITAL BOOK While the nurse was attending to the girl Tarling sought an interview with the medical officer in charge of the hospital I don t think there s a great deal the matter with her said the doctor In fact she was fit for discharge from hospital two or three days ago and it was only at her request that we let her stay Do I understand that she is wanted in connection with the Daffodil Murder As a witness said Tarling glibly He realised that he was saying a ridiculous thing because the fact that a warrant was out for Odette Rider must have been generally known to the local authorities Her description had been carefully circulated and that description must have come to the heads of hospitals and public institutions The next words of the doctor confirmed his knowledge As a witness eh he said dryly Well I don t want to pry into your secrets or rather into the secrets of Scotland Yard but she is fit to travel just as soon as you like There was a knock on the door and the matron came into the doctor s office Miss Rider wishes to see you sir she said addressing Tarling and the detective taking up his hat went back to the little ward He found the girl more composed but still deathly white She was out of bed sitting in a big arm chair wrapped in a dressing gown and she motioned Tarling to pull up a chair to her side She waited until after the door had closed behind the nurse then she spoke It was very silly of me to faint mister Tarling but the news was so horrible and so unexpected Won t you tell me all about it You see I have not read a newspaper since I have been in the hospital I heard one of the nurses talk about the Daffodil Murder that is not the She hesitated and Tarling nodded He was lighter of heart now almost cheerful He had no doubt in his mind that the girl was innocent and life had taken on a rosier aspect Thornton Lyne he began was murdered on the night of the fourteenth He was last seen alive by his valet about half past nine in the evening Early next morning his body was found in Hyde Park He had been shot dead and an effort had been made to stanch the wound in his breast by binding a woman s silk night dress round and round his body On his breast somebody had laid a bunch of daffodils Daffodils repeated the girl wonderingly But how His car was discovered a hundred yards from the place Tarling continued and it was clear that he had been murdered elsewhere brought to the Park in his car and left on the sidewalk At the time he was discovered he had on neither coat nor vest and on his feet were a pair of list slippers But I don t understand said the bewildered girl What does it mean Who had She stopped suddenly and the detective saw her lips tighten together as though to restrain her speech Then suddenly she covered her face with her hands Oh it s terrible terrible she whispered I never thought I never dreamed oh it is terrible Tarling laid his hand gently on her shoulder Miss Rider he said you suspect somebody of this crime Won t you tell me She shook her head without looking up I can say nothing she said But don t you see that suspicion will attach to you urged Tarling A telegram was discovered amongst his belongings asking him to call at your flat that evening She looked up quickly A telegram from me she said I sent no telegram Thank God for that cried Tarling fervently Thank God for that But I don t understand mister Tarling A telegram was sent to mister Lyne asking him to come to my flat Did he go to my flat Tarling nodded I have reason to believe he did he said gravely The murder was committed in your flat My God she whispered You don t mean that Oh no no it is impossible Briefly he recited all his discoveries He knew that he was acting in a manner which from the point of view of police ethics was wholly wrong and disloyal He was placing her in possession of all the clues and giving her an opportunity to meet and refute the evidence which had been collected against her He told her of the bloodstains on the floor and described the night dress which had been found around Thornton Lyne s body That was my night dress she said simply and without hesitation Go on please mister Tarling He told her of the bloody thumb prints upon the door of the bureau On your bed he went on I found your dressing case half packed She swayed forward and threw out her hands groping blindly Oh how wicked how wicked she wailed He did it he did it Who demanded Tarling He took the girl by the shoulder and shook her Who was the man You must tell me Your own life depends upon it Don t you see Odette I want to help you I want to clear your name of this terrible charge You suspect somebody I must have his name She shook her head and turned her pathetic face to his I can t tell you she said in a low voice I can say no more I knew nothing of the murder until you told me I had no idea no thought I hated Thornton Lyne I hated him but I would not have hurt him it is dreadful dreadful Presently she grew calmer I must go to London at once she said Will you please take me back She saw his embarrassment and was quick to understand its cause You you have a warrant haven t you He nodded On the charge of murder He nodded again She looked at him in silence for some moments I shall be ready in half an hour she said and without a word the detective left the room He made his way back to the doctor s sanctum and found that gentleman awaiting him impatiently I say said the doctor that s all bunkum about this girl being wanted as a witness I had my doubts and I looked up the Scotland Yard warning which I received a couple of days ago She s Odette Rider and she s wanted on a charge of murder Got it first time said Tarling dropping wearily into a chair Do you mind if I smoke Not a bit said the doctor cheerfully I suppose you re taking her with you Tarling nodded I can t imagine a girl like that committing a murder said doctor Saunders She doesn t seem to possess the physique necessary to have carried out all the etceteras of the crime I read the particulars in the Morning Globe The person who murdered Thornton Lyne must have carried him from his car and laid him on the grass or wherever he was found and that girl couldn t lift a large sized baby Tarling jerked his head in agreement Besides doctor Saunders went on she hasn t the face of a murderer I don t mean to say that because she s pretty she couldn t commit a crime but there are certain types of prettiness which have their origin in spiritual beauty and Miss Stevens or Rider as I suppose I should call her is one of that type I m one with you there said Tarling I am satisfied in my own mind that she did not commit the crime but the circumstances are all against her The telephone bell jingled and the doctor took up the receiver and spoke a few words A trunk call he said explaining the delay in receiving acknowledgment from the other end of the wire He spoke again into the receiver and then handed the instrument across the table to Tarling It s for you he said I think it is Scotland Yard Tarling put the receiver to his ear It is Whiteside said a voice Is that you mister Tarling We ve found the revolver Where asked Tarling quickly In the girl s flat came the reply Tarling s face fell But after all that was nothing unexpected He had no doubt in his mind at all that the murder had been committed in Odette Rider s flat and if that theory were accepted the details were unimportant as there was no reason in the world why the pistol should not be also found near the scene of the crime In fact it would have been remarkable if the weapon had not been discovered on those premises Where was it he asked In the lady s work basket said Whiteside Pushed to the bottom and covered with a lot of wool and odds and ends of tape What sort of a revolver is it asked Tarling after a pause A Colt automatic was the reply There were six live cartridges in the magazine and one in the breach The pistol had evidently been fired for the barrel was foul We ve also found the spent bullet in the fireplace Have you found your Miss Stevens Yes said Tarling quietly Miss Stevens is Odette Rider He heard the other s whistle of surprise Have you arrested her Not yet said Tarling Will you meet the next train in from Ashford I shall be leaving here in half an hour He hung up the receiver and turned to the doctor I gather they ve found the weapon said the interested medico Yes replied Tarling they have found the weapon Humph said the doctor rubbing his chin thoughtfully A pretty bad business He looked at the other curiously What sort of a man was Thornton Lyne he asked Tarling shrugged his shoulders Not the best of men I m afraid he said but even the worst of men are protected by the law and the punishment which will fall to the murderer Or murderess smiled the doctor Murderer said Tarling shortly The punishment will not be affected by the character of the dead man doctor Saunders puffed steadily at his pipe It s rum a girl like that being mixed up in a case of this description he said Most extraordinary There was a little tap at the door and the matron appeared Miss Stevens is ready she said and Tarling rose doctor Saunders rose with him and going to a shelf took down a large ledger and placing it on his table opened it and took up a pen I shall have to mark her discharge he said turning over the leaves and running his finger down the page Here she is Miss Stevens concussion and shock He looked at the writing under his hand and then lifted his eyes to the detective When was this murder committed he asked On the night of the fourteenth On the night of the fourteenth repeated the doctor thoughtfully At what time The hour is uncertain said Tarling impatient and anxious to finish his conversation with this gossiping surgeon some time after eleven Some time after eleven repeated the doctor It couldn t have been committed before When was the man last seen alive At half past nine said Tarling with a little smile You re not going in for criminal investigation are you doctor Not exactly smiled Saunders Though I am naturally pleased to be in a position to prove the girl s innocence Prove her innocence What do you mean demanded Tarling quickly The murder could not have been committed before eleven o clock The dead man was last seen alive at half past nine Well said Tarling Well repeated doctor Saunders at nine o clock the boat train left Charing Cross and at half past ten Miss Rider was admitted to this hospital suffering from shock and concussion For a moment Tarling said nothing and did nothing He stood as though turned to stone staring at the doctor with open mouth Then he lurched forward gripped the astonished medical man by the hand and wrung it That s the best bit of news I have had in my life he said huskily CHAPTER XIII TWO SHOTS IN THE NIGHT The journey back to London was one the details of which were registered with photographic realism in Tarling s mind for the rest of his life The girl spoke little and he himself was content to meditate and turn over in his mind the puzzling circumstances which had surrounded Odette Rider s flight In the very silences which occurred between the interchanges of conversation was a comradeship and a sympathetic understanding which both the man and the girl would have found it difficult to define Was he in love with her He was shocked at the possibility of such a catastrophe overtaking him Love had never come into his life It was a hypothetical condition which he had never even considered He had known men to fall in love just as he had known men to suffer from malaria or yellow fever without considering that the same experience might overtake him A shy reticent man behind that hard mask was a diffidence unsuspected by his closest friends So that the possibility of being in love with Odette Rider disturbed his mind because he lacked sufficient conceit to believe that such a passion could be anything but hopeless That any woman could love him he could not conceive And now her very presence the fragrant nearness of her at once soothed and alarmed him Here was a detective virtually in charge of a woman suspected of murder and he was frightened of her He knew the warrant in his pocket would never be executed and that Scotland Yard would not proceed with the prosecution because though Scotland Yard makes some big errors it does not like to have its errors made public The journey was all too short and it was not until the train was running slowly through a thin fog which had descended on London that he returned to the subject of the murder and only then with an effort I am going to take you to an hotel for the night he said and in the morning I will ask you to come with me to Scotland Yard to talk to the Chief Then I am not arrested she smiled No I don t think you re arrested He smiled responsively But I m afraid that you are going to be asked a number of questions which may be distressing to you You see Miss Rider your actions have been very suspicious You leave for the Continent under an assumed name and undoubtedly the murder was committed in your flat She shivered Please please don t talk about that she said in a low voice He felt a brute but he knew that she must undergo an examination at the hands of men who had less regard for her feelings I do wish you would be frank with me he pleaded I am sure I could get you out of all your troubles without any difficulty mister Lyne hated me she said I think I touched him on his tenderest spot poor man his vanity You yourself know how he sent that criminal to my flat in order to create evidence against me He nodded Did you ever meet Stay before he asked She shook her head I think I have heard of him she said I know that mister Lyne was interested in a criminal and that this criminal worshipped him Once mister Lyne brought him to the Stores and wanted to give him a job but the man would not accept it mister Lyne once told me that Sam Stay would do anything in the world for him Stay thinks you committed the murder said Tarling bluntly Lyne has evidently told stories about you and your hatred for him and I really think that Stay would have been more dangerous to you than the police only fortunately the little crook has gone off his head She looked at him in astonishment Mad she asked Poor fellow Has this awful thing driven him Tarling nodded He was taken to the County Asylum this morning He had a fit in my office and when he recovered he seemed to have lost his mind completely Now Miss Rider you re going to be frank with me aren t you She looked at him again and smiled sadly I m afraid I shan t be any more frank than I have been mister Tarling she said If you want me to tell you why I assumed the name of Stevens or why I ran away from London I cannot tell you I had a good reason she paused and I may yet have a better reason for running away She nearly said again but checked the word He laid his hand on hers When I told you of this murder he said earnestly I knew by your surprise and agitation that you were innocent Later the doctor was able to prove an alibi which cannot be shaken But Miss Rider when I surprised you you spoke as though you knew who committed the crime You spoke of a man and it is that man s name I want She shook her head That I shall never tell you she said simply But don t you realise that you may be charged with being an accessory before or after the act he urged Don t you see what it means to you and to your mother Her eyes closed at the mention of her mother s name as though to shut out the vision of some unpleasant possibility Don t talk about it don t talk about it she murmured please mister Tarling Do as you wish Let the police arrest me or try me or hang me but do not
1963_147036_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 ask me 
none	none	to say any more because I will not I will not Tarling sank back amongst the cushions baffled and bewildered and no more was said Whiteside was waiting for the train and with him were two men who were unmistakably branded Scotland Yard Tarling drew him aside and explained the situation in a few words Under the circumstances he said I shall not execute the warrant Whiteside agreed It is quite impossible that she could have committed the murder he said I suppose the doctor s evidence is unshakable Absolutely said Tarling and it is confirmed by the station master at Ashford who has the time of the accident logged in his diary and himself assisted to lift the girl from the train Why did she call herself Miss Stevens asked Whiteside And what induced her to leave London so hurriedly Tarling gave a despairing gesture That is one of the things I should like to know he said and the very matter upon which Miss Rider refuses to enlighten me I am taking her to an hotel he went on To morrow I will bring her down to the Yard But I doubt if the Chief can say anything that will induce her to talk Was she surprised when you told her of the murder Did she mention anybody s name asked Whiteside Tarling hesitated and then for one of the few times in his life he lied No he said she was just upset she mentioned nobody He took the girl by taxi to the quiet little hotel he had chosen a journey not without its thrills for the fog was now thick and saw her comfortably fixed I can t be sufficiently grateful to you mister Tarling for your kindness she said at parting and if I could make your task any easier I would He saw a spasm of pain pass across her face I don t understand it yet it seems like a bad dream she said half to herself I don t want to understand it somehow I want to forget I want to forget What do you want to forget asked Tarling She shook her head Don t ask me she said Please please don t ask me He walked down the big stairway a greatly worried man He had left the taxi at the door To his surprise he found the cab had gone and turned to the porter What happened to my taxi he said I didn t pay him off Your taxi sir said the head porter I didn t see it go I ll ask one of the boys As assistant porter who had been in the street told a surprising tale A gentleman had come up out of the murk had paid off the taxi which had disappeared The witness to this proceeding had not seen the gentleman s face All he knew was that this mysterious benefactor had walked away in an opposite direction to that in which the cab had gone and had vanished into the night Tarling frowned That s curious he said Get me another taxi I m afraid you ll find that difficult sir The hotel porter shook his head You see how the fog is we always get them thick about here it s rather late in the year for fogs Tarling cut short his lecture on meteorology buttoned up his coat and turned out of the hotel in the direction of the nearest underground station The hotel to which he had taken the girl was situated in a quiet residential street and at this hour of the night the street was deserted and the fog added something to its normal loneliness Tarling was not particularly well acquainted with London but he had a rough idea of direction The fog was thick but he could see the blurred nimbus of a street lamp and was midway between two of these when he heard a soft step behind him It was the faintest shuffle of sound and he turned quickly Instinctively he threw up his hands and stepped aside Something whizzed past his head and struck the pavement with a thud Sandbag he noted mentally and leapt at his assailant As quickly his unknown attacker jumped back There was a deafening report His feet were scorched with burning cordite and momentarily he released his grip of his enemy s throat which he had seized He sensed rather than saw the pistol raised again and made one of those lightning falls which he had learnt in far off days from Japanese instructors of ju jitsu Head over heels he went as the pistol exploded for the second time It was a clever trick designed to bring the full force of his foot against his opponent s knee But the mysterious stranger was too quick for him and when Tailing leapt to his feet he was alone But he had seen the face big and white and vengeful It was glimpse and guess work but he was satisfied that he knew his man He ran in the direction he thought the would be assassin must have taken but the fog was patchy and he misjudged He heard the sound of hurrying footsteps and ran towards them only to find that it was a policeman attracted by the sound of shots The officer had met nobody He must have gone the other way said Tarling and raced off in pursuit without however coming up with his attacker Slowly he retraced his footsteps to where he had left the policeman searching the pavement for same clue which would identify the assailant of the night The constable was using a small electric lamp which he had taken from his pocket Nothing here sir he said Only this bit of red paper Tarling took the small square of paper from the man s hand and examined it under the light of the lamp a red square on which were written four words in Chinese He brought this trouble upon himself It was the same inscription as had been found neatly folded in the waistcoat pocket of Thornton Lyne that morning he was discovered lying starkly dead CHAPTER XIV THE SEARCH OF MILBURGH S COTTAGE mister Milburgh had a little house in one of the industrial streets of Camden Town It was a street made up for the most part of blank walls pierced at intervals with great gates 
1920-147026-0001	train-other-500	through which one could procure at times a view of gaunt factories and smoky looking chimney stacks mister Milburgh s house was the only residence in the road if one excepted the quarters of caretakers and managers and it was agreed by all who saw his tiny demesne
none	none	 that mister Milburgh had a good landlord The house was a detached cottage in about half an acre of ground a one storey building monopolising the space which might have been occupied by factory extension Both the factory to the right and the left had made generous offers to acquire the ground but mister Milburgh s landlord had been adamant There were people who suggested that mister Milburgh s landlord was mister Milburgh himself But how could that be mister Milburgh s salary was something under Lfour hundred a year and the cottage site was worth at least Lfour thousand 
1920-147026-0002	train-other-500	Canvey Cottage as it was called stood back from the road behind a lawn innocent of flowers and the lawn itself was protected from intrusion by high iron railings which mister Milburgh s landlord had had erected at considerable cost
none	none	 To reach the house it was necessary to pass through an iron gate and traverse a stone flagged path to the door of the cottage On the night when Tarling of Scotland Yard was the victim of a murderous assault mister Milburgh unlocked the gate and passed through 
1920-147026-0003	train-other-500	locking and double locking the gate behind him He was alone and as was his wont he was whistling a sad little refrain which had neither beginning nor end He walked slowly up the stone pathway
none	none	 unlocked the door of his cottage 
1920-147026-0004	train-other-500	and stood only a moment on the doorstep to survey the growing thickness of the night before he closed and bolted the door and switched on the electric light He was in a tiny hallway plainly but nicely furnished
1920-147026-0005	train-other-500	The note of luxury was struck by the Zohn etchings which hung on the wall and which mister Milburgh stopped to regard approvingly He hung up his coat and hat slipped off the galoshes he was wearing for it was wet underfoot
1920-147026-0006	train-other-500	and passing through a door which opened from the passage came to his living room The same simple note of furniture and decoration was observable here The furniture was good the carpet under his feet thick and luxurious
1920-147026-0007	train-other-500	He snicked down another switch and an electric radiator glowed in the fireplace Then he sat down at the big table
none	none	 which was the most conspicuous article of furniture in the room It was practically covered with orderly little piles of paper 
1920-147026-0008	train-other-500	most of them encircled with rubber bands He did not attempt to touch or read them but sat looking moodily at his blotting pad preoccupied and absent
1920-147026-0009	train-other-500	Presently he rose with a little grunt and crossing the room unlocked a very commonplace and old fashioned cupboard the top of which served as a sideboard From the cupboard he took a dozen little books and carried them to the table
1920-147026-0010	train-other-500	They were of uniform size and each bore the figures of a year They appeared to be and indeed were diaries but they were not mister Milburgh s diaries One day he chanced to go into Thornton Lyne s room at the Stores
1920-147026-0011	train-other-500	and had seen these books arrayed on a steel shelf of Lyne s private safe The proprietor s room overlooked the ground floor of the Stores and Thornton Lyne at the time was visible to his manager and could not under any circumstances surprise him
none	none	 so mister Milburgh had taken out one volume and read with more than ordinary interest the somewhat frank and expansive diary 
1920-147026-0012	train-other-500	which Thornton Lyne had kept He had only read a few pages on that occasion
none	none	 but later he had an opportunity of perusing the whole year s record and had absorbed a great deal of information which might have been useful to him in the future 
1920-147026-0013	train-other-500	had not Thornton Lyne met his untimely end at the hands of an unknown murderer On the day when Thornton Lyne s body was discovered in Hyde Park with a woman s night dress wrapped around the wound in his breast mister Milburgh had for reasons of expediency
none	none	 and assisted by a duplicate key of Lyne s safe 
1920-147026-0014	train-other-500	removed those diaries to a safer place They contained a great deal that was unpleasant for mister Milburgh particularly the current diary for Thornton Lyne had set down not only his experiences but his daily happenings his thoughts poetical and otherwise
none	none	 and had stated very exactly and in libellous terms his suspicions of his manager The diary provided mister Milburgh with a great deal of very interesting reading matter and now he turned to the page where he had left off the night before and continued his study 
1920-147026-0015	train-other-500	It was a page easy to find because he had thrust between the leaves a thin envelope of foreign make containing certain slips of paper
none	none	 and as he took out his improvised book mark a thought seemed to strike him 
1920-147026-0016	train-other-500	and he felt carefully in his pocket He did not discover the thing for which he was searching and with a smile he laid the envelope carefully on the table and went on at the point where his studies had been interrupted
1920-147026-0017	train-other-500	Lunched at the London Hotel and dozed away the afternoon Weather fearfully hot Had arranged to make a call upon a distant cousin a man named Tarling who is in the police force at Shanghai but too much of a fag
1920-147026-0018	train-other-500	Spent evening at Chu Han s dancing hall Got very friendly with a pretty little Chinese girl who spoke pigeon English Am seeing her to morrow at Ling Foo s She is called The Little Narcissus I called her My Little Daffodil 
none	none	mister Milburgh stopped in his reading Little Daffodil he repeated then looked at the ceiling and pinched his thick lips Little Daffodil he said again and a big smile dawned on his face He was still engaged in reading when a bell shrilled in the hall 
1920-147026-0019	train-other-500	He rose to his feet and stood listening and the bell rang again He switched off the light pulled aside the thick curtain which hid the window and peered out through the fog He could just distinguish in the light of the street lamp two or three men standing at the gate
1920-147026-0020	train-other-500	He replaced the curtain turned up the light again took the books in his arms and disappeared with them into the corridor The room at the back was his bedroom and into this he went making no response to the repeated jingle of the bell for fully five minutes
1920-147026-0021	train-other-500	At the end of that time he reappeared but now he was in his pyjamas over which he wore a heavy dressing gown He unlocked the door and shuffled in his slippers down the stone pathway to the gate Who s that he asked
1920-147026-0022	train-other-500	Tarling You know me said a voice mister Tarling said Milburgh in surprise Really this is an unexpected pleasure Come in come in gentlemen Open the gate said Tarling briefly
1920-147026-0023	train-other-500	Excuse me while I go and get the key said Milburgh I didn t expect visitors at this hour of the night He went into the house took a good look round his room and then reappeared taking the key from the pocket of his dressing gown
none	none	 It had been there all the time if the truth be told 
1920-147026-0024	train-other-500	but mister Milburgh was a cautious man and took few risks Tarling was accompanied by Inspector Whiteside and another man whom Milburgh rightly supposed was a detective Only Tarling and the Inspector accepted his invitation to step inside
1920-147026-0025	train-other-500	the third man remaining on guard at the gate Milburgh led the way to his cosy sitting room I have been in bed some hours and I m sorry to have kept you so long
none	none	 Your radiator is still warm said Tarling quietly stooping to feel the little stove mister Milburgh chuckled Isn t that clever of you to discover that he said admiringly The fact is I was so sleepy when I went to bed several hours ago 
1920-147026-0026	train-other-500	that I forgot to turn the radiator off and it was only when I came down to answer the bell that I discovered I had left it switched on Tarling stooped and picked the butt end of a cigar out of the hearth It was still alight
1920-147026-0027	train-other-500	You ve been smoking in your sleep mister Milburgh he said dryly No no said the airy mister Milburgh I was smoking that when I came downstairs to let you in I instinctively put a cigar in my mouth the moment I wake up in the morning
1920-147026-0028	train-other-500	It is a disgraceful habit and really is one of my few vices he admitted I threw it down when I turned out the radiator Tarling smiled Won t you sit down said Milburgh seating himself in the least comfortable of the chairs
none	none	 You see his smile was apologetic as he waved his hand to the table the work is frightfully heavy now that poor mister Lyne is dead I am obliged to bring it home and I can assure you mister Tarling that there are some nights when I work till daylight 
1920-147026-0029	train-other-500	getting things ready for the auditor Do you ever take exercise asked Tarling innocently Little night walks in the fog for the benefit of your health A puzzled frown gathered on Milburgh s face
1920-147026-0030	train-other-500	Exercise mister Tarling he said with an air of mystification I don t quite understand you Naturally I shouldn t walk out on a night like this What an extraordinary fog for this time of the year Do you know Paddington at all
1920-147026-0031	train-other-500	No said mister Milburgh except that there is a station there which I sometimes use
none	none	 But perhaps you will explain to me the meaning of this visit 
1920-147026-0032	train-other-500	The meaning is said Tarling shortly that I have been attacked to night by a man of your build and height who fired twice at me at close quarters I have a warrant
none	none	 mister Milburgh s eyes narrowed 
1920-147026-0033	train-other-500	I have a warrant to search this house For what demanded Milburgh boldly For a revolver or an automatic pistol and anything else I can find Milburgh rose You re at liberty to search the house from end to end he said
1920-147026-0034	train-other-500	Happily it is a small one as my salary does not allow of an expensive establishment Do you live here alone asked Tarling
none	none	 Quite replied Milburgh A woman comes in at eight o clock to morrow morning to cook my breakfast and make the place tidy but I sleep here by myself I am very much hurt he was going on You will be hurt much worse said Tarling dryly and proceeded to the search It proved to be a disappointing one for there was no trace of any weapon 
1920-147026-0035	train-other-500	and certainly no trace of the little red slips
none	none	 which he had expected to find in Milburgh s possession For he was not searching for the man who had assailed him but for the man who had killed Thornton Lyne He came back to the little sitting room where Milburgh had been left with the Inspector and apparently he was unruffled by his failure Now mister Milburgh he said brusquely I want to ask you 
1920-147026-0036	train-other-500	Have you ever seen a piece of paper like this before
none	none	 He took a slip from his pocket and spread it on the table 
1920-147026-0037	train-other-500	Milburgh looked hard at the Chinese characters on the crimson square and then nodded You have said Tarling in surprise
none	none	 Yes sir said mister Milburgh complacently 
1920-147026-0038	train-other-500	I should be telling an untruth if I said I had not
none	none	 Nothing is more repugnant to me than to deceive anybody 
1920-147026-0039	train-other-500	That I can imagine said Tarling I am sorry you are sarcastic mister Tarling said the reproachful Milburgh but I assure you that I hate and loathe an untruth Where have you seen these papers
none	none	 On mister Lyne s desk was the surprising answer On Lyne s desk Milburgh nodded The late mister Thornton Lyne he said came back from the East with a great number of curios and amongst them were a number of slips of paper 
1920-147026-0040	train-other-500	covered with Chinese characters similar to this I do not understand Chinese he said because I have never had occasion to go to China The characters may have been different one from the other but to my unsophisticated eye they all look alike
1920-147026-0041	train-other-500	You ve seen these slips on Lyne s desk said Tarling Then why did you not tell the police before You know that the police attach a great deal of importance to the discovery of one of these things in the dead man s pocket mister Milburgh nodded
1920-147026-0042	train-other-500	It is perfectly true that I did not mention the fact to the police he said but you understand mister Tarling that I was very much upset by the sad occurrence which drove everything else out of my mind
none	none	 It would have been quite possible that you would have found one or two of these strange inscriptions in this very house 
1920-147026-0043	train-other-500	He smiled in the detective s face
none	none	 mister Lyne was very fond of distributing the curios he brought from the East to his friends he went on 
1920-147026-0044	train-other-500	He gave me that dagger you see hanging on the wall which he bought at some outlandish place in his travels He may have given me a sample of these slips I remember his telling me a story about them which I cannot for the moment recall
none	none	 He would have continued retailing reminiscences of his late employer 
1920-147026-0045	train-other-500	but Tarling cut him short and with a curt good night withdrew
none	none	 Milburgh accompanied him to the front gate and locked the door upon the three men before he went back to his sitting room smiling quietly to himself I am certain that the man was Milburgh said Tarling I am as certain as that I am standing here 
1920-147026-0046	train-other-500	Have you any idea why he should want to out you asked Whiteside None in the world replied Tarling Evidently my assailant was a man who had watched my movements and had probably followed the girl and myself to the hotel in a cab
1920-147026-0047	train-other-500	When I disappeared inside he dismissed his own and then took the course of dismissing my cab which he could easily do by paying the man his fare and sending him off A cabman would accept that dismissal without suspicion He then waited for me in the fog
1920-147026-0048	train-other-500	and followed me until he got me into a quiet part of the road where he first attempted to sandbag and then to shoot me But why asked Whiteside again Suppose Milburgh knew something about this murder which is very doubtful
1920-147026-0049	train-other-500	what benefit would it be to him to have you put out of the way
none	none	 If I could answer that question replied Tarling grimly I could tell you who killed Thornton Lyne CHAPTER XV THE OWNER OF THE PISTOL All trace of the fog of the night before had disappeared when Tarling looked out from his bedroom window later that morning The streets were flooded with yellow sunshine and there was a tang in the air which brought the colour to the cheek and light to the eye of the patient Londoner Tarling stretched his arms and yawned in the sheer luxury of living before he took down his silk dressing gown and went in to the breakfast which Ling Chu had laid for him The blue bloused Chinaman who stood behind his master s chair poured out the tea and laid a newspaper on one side of the plate and letters on the other Tarling ate his breakfast in silence and pushed away the plate Ling Chu he said in the vernacular of Lower China I shall lose my name as the Man Hunter for this case puzzles me beyond any other Master said the Chinaman in the same language there is a time in all cases when the hunter feels that he must stop and weep I myself had this feeling when I hunted down Wu Fung the strangler of Hankow Yet he added philosophically one day I found him and he is sleeping on the Terrace of Night He employed the beautiful Chinese simile for death Yesterday I found the little young woman said Tarling after a pause In this quaint way did he refer to Odette Rider You may find the little young woman and yet not find the killer said Ling Chu standing by the side of the table his hands respectfully hidden under his sleeves For the little young woman did not kill the white faced man How do you know asked Tarling and the Chinaman shook his head The little young woman has no strength master he said Also it is not known that she has skill in the driving of the quick cart You mean the motor asked Tarling quickly and Ling Chu nodded By Jove I never thought of that said Tarling Of course whoever killed Thornton Lyne must have put his body in the car and driven him to the Park But how do you know that she does not drive Because I have asked said the Chinaman simply Many people know the little young woman at the great Stores where the white faced man lived and they all say that she does not drive the quick cart Tarling considered for a while Yes it is true talk he said The little young woman did not kill the white faced man because she was many miles away when the murder was committed That we know The question is who did The Hunter of Men will discover said Ling Chu I wonder said Tarling He dressed and went to Scotland Yard He had an appointment with Whiteside and later intended accompanying Odette Rider to an interview before the Assistant Commissioner Whiteside was at Scotland Yard before him and when Tarling walked into his room was curiously examining an object which lay before him on a sheet of paper It was a short barrelled automatic pistol Hullo he said interested Is that the gun that killed Thornton Lyne That s the weapon said the cheerful Whiteside An ugly looking brute isn t it Where did you say it was discovered At the bottom of the girl s work basket This has a familiar look to me said Tarling lifting the instrument from the table By the way is the cartridge still in the chamber Whiteside shook his head No I removed it he said I ve taken the magazine out too I suppose you ve sent out the description and the number to all the gunsmiths Whiteside nodded Not that it s likely to be of much use he said This is an American made pistol and unless it happens to have been sold in England there is precious little chance of our discovering its owner Tarling was looking at the weapon turning it over and over in his hand Presently he looked at the butt and uttered an exclamation Following the direction of his eyes Whiteside saw two deep furrows running diagonally across the grip What are they he asked They look like two bullets fired at the holder of the revolver some years ago which missed him but caught the butt Whiteside laughed Is that a piece of your deduction mister Tarling he asked No said Tarling that is a bit of fact That pistol is my own CHAPTER XVI THE HEIR Your pistol said Whiteside incredulously my dear good chap you are mad How could it be your pistol It is nevertheless my pistol said Tarling quietly I recognised it the moment I saw it on your desk and thought there must be some mistake These furrows prove that there is no mistake at all It has been one of my most faithful friends and I carried it with me in China for six years Whiteside gasped And you mean to tell me he demanded that Thornton Lyne was killed with your pistol Tarling nodded It is an amazing but bewildering fact he said That is undoubtedly my pistol and it is the same that was found in Miss Rider s room at Carrymore Mansions and I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that it was by a shot fired from this weapon that Thornton Lyne lost his life There was a long silence Well that beats me said Whiteside laying the weapon on the table At every turn some new mystery arises This is the second jar I ve had to day The second said Tarling He put the question idly for his mind was absorbed in this new and to him tremendous aspect of the crime Thornton Lyne had been killed by his pistol That to him was the most staggering circumstance which had been revealed since he had come into the case Yes Whiteside was saying it s the second setback With an effort Tarling brought his mind back from speculating upon the new mystery Do you remember this said Whiteside He opened his safe and took out a big envelope from which he extracted a telegram Yes this is the telegram supposed to have been sent by Odette Rider asking mister Lyne to call at her flat It was found amongst the dead man s effects when the house was searched To be exact corrected Whiteside it was discovered by Lyne s valet a man named Cole who seems to be a very honest person against whom no suspicion could be attached I had him here this morning early to make further inquiries into Lyne s movements on the night of the murder He s in the next room by the way I ll bring him in He pushed a bell and gave his instructions to the uniformed policeman who came Presently the door opened again and the officer ushered in a respectable looking middle aged man who had domestic service written all over him Just tell mister Tarling what you told me said Whiteside About that telegram sir asked Cole Yes I m afraid I made a bit of a mistake there but I got flurried with this awful business and I suppose I lost my head a bit What happened asked Tarling Well sir this telegram I brought up the next day to mister Whiteside that is to say the day after the murder Tarling nodded And when I brought it up I made a false statement It s a thing I ve never done before in my life but I tell you I was scared by all these police inquiries What was the false statement asked Tarling quickly Well sir said the servant twisting his hat nervously I said that it had been opened by mister Lyne As a matter of fact the telegram wasn t delivered until a quarter of an hour after mister Lyne left the place It was I who opened it when I heard of the murder Then thinking that I should get into trouble for sticking my nose into police business I told mister Whiteside that mister Lyne had opened it He didn t receive the telegram asked Tarling No sir The two detectives looked at one another Well what do you make of that Whiteside I m blest if I know what to think of it said Whiteside scratching his head We depended upon that telegram to implicate the girl It breaks a big link in the chain against her Supposing it was not already broken said Tarling almost aggressively And it certainly removes the only possible explanation for Lyne going to the flat on the night of the murder You re perfectly sure Cole that that telegram did not reach mister Lyne Perfectly sir said Cole emphatically I took it in myself After mister Lyne drove off I went to the door of the house to get a little fresh air and I was standing on the top step when it came up If you notice sir it s marked received at nine point twenty that means the time it was received at the District Post Office and that s about two miles from our place It couldn t possibly have got to the house before mister Lyne left and I was scared to death that you clever gentlemen would have seen that I was so clever that I didn t see it admitted Tarling with a smile Thank you mister Cole that will do When the man had gone he sat down on a chair opposite Whiteside and thrust his hands into his pockets with a gesture of helplessness Well I m baffled he said Let me recite the case Whiteside because it s getting so complicated that I m almost forgetting its plainest features On the night of the fourteenth Thornton Lyne is murdered by some person or persons unknown presumably in the flat of Odette Rider his former cashier residing at Carrymore Mansions Bloodstains are found upon the floor and there is other evidence such as the discovery of the pistol and the spent bullet which emphasises the accuracy of that conclusion Nobody sees mister Lyne come into the flat or go out He is found in Hyde Park the next morning without his coat or vest a lady s silk night dress identified as Odette Rider s wrapped tightly round his breast and two of Odette Rider s handkerchiefs are found over the wound Upon his body are a number of daffodils and his car containing his coat vest and boots is found by the side of the road a hundred yards away Have I got it right Whiteside nodded Whatever else is at fault he smiled your memory is unchallengeable A search of the bedroom in which the crime was committed reveals a bloodstained thumb print on the white bureau and a suit case identified as Odette Rider s half packed upon the bed Later a pistol which is mine is found in the lady s work basket hidden under repairing material The first suggestion is that Miss Rider is the murderess That suggestion is refuted first by the fact that she was at Ashford when the murder was committed unconscious as a result of a railway accident and the second point in her favour is that the telegram discovered by Lyne s valet purporting to be signed by the girl inviting Lyne to her flat at a certain hour was not delivered to the murdered man He rose to his feet Come along and see Cresswell he said This case is going to drive me mad Assistant Commissioner Cresswell heard the story the two men had to tell and if he was astounded he did not betray any signs of his surprise This looks like being the murder case of the century he said Of course you cannot proceed any further against Miss Rider and you were wise not to make the arrest However she must be kept under observation because apparently she knows or think she knows the person who did commit the murder She must be watched day and night and sooner or later she will lead you to the man upon whom her suspicions rest Whiteside had better see her he said turning to Tarling He may get a new angle of her view I don t think there s much use in bringing her down here And by the way Tarling all the accounts of Lyne s Stores have been placed in the hands of a clever firm of chartered accountants Dashwood and Solomon of saint Mary Axe If you suspect there has been any peculation on the part of Lyne s employees and if that peculation is behind the murder we shall probably learn something which will give you a clue Tarling nodded How long will the examination take he asked They think a week The books have been taken away this morning which reminds me that your friend mister Milburgh I think that is his name is giving every assistance to the police to procure a faithful record of the firm s financial position He looked up at Tarling and scratched his nose So it was committed with your pistol Tarling he said with a little smile That sounds bad It sounds mad laughed Tarling I m going straight back to discover what happened to my pistol and how it got into that room I know that it was safe a fortnight ago because I took it to a gunsmith to be oiled Where do you keep it as a rule In the cupboard with my colonial kit said Tarling Nobody has access to my room except Ling Chu who is always there when I m out Ling Chu is your Chinese servant Not exactly a servant smiled Tarling He is one of the best native thief catchers I have ever met He is a man of the greatest integrity and I would trust him with my life Murdered with your pistol eh asked the Commissioner There was a little pause and then I suppose Lyne s estate will go to the Crown He has no relations and no heir You re wrong there said Tarling quietly The Commissioner looked up in surprise Has he an heir he asked He has a cousin said Tarling with a little smile a relationship close enough to qualify him for Lyne s millions unfortunately Why unfortunately asked mister Cresswell Because I happen to be the heir said Tarling CHAPTER XVII THE MISSING REVOLVER Tarling walked out of Scotland Yard on to the sunlit Embankment trouble in his face He told himself that the case was getting beyond him and that it was only the case and its development which worried him The queer little look which had dawned on the Commissioner s face when he learnt that the heir to the murdered Thornton Lyne s fortune was the detective who was investigating his murder and that Tarling s revolver had been found in the room where the murder had been committed aroused nothing but an inward chuckle That suspicion should attach to him was he told himself poetic justice for in his day he himself had suspected many men innocent or partly innocent He walked up the stairs to his room and found Ling Chu polishing the meagre stock of silver which Tarling possessed Ling Chu was a thief catcher and a great detective but he had also taken upon himself the business of attending to Tarling s personal comfort The detective spoke no word out went straight to the cupboard where he kept his foreign kit On a shelf in neat array and carefully folded were the thin white drill suits he wore in the tropics His sun helmet hung on a peg and on the opposite wall was a revolver holster hanging by a strap He lifted the holster It was empty He had had no doubts in his mind that the holster would be empty and closed the door with a troubled frown Ling Chu he said quietly You speak me Lieh Jen said the man putting down the spoons and rubber he was handling Where is my revolver It is gone Lieh Jen said the man calmly How long has it been gone I miss him four days said Ling Chu calmly Who took it demanded Tarling I miss him four days said the man There was an interval of silence and Tarling nodded his head slowly Very good Ling Chu he said there is no more to be said For all his outward calm he was distressed in mind Was it possible that anybody could have got into the room in Ling Chu s absence he could only remember one occasion when they had been out together and that was the night he had gone to the girl s flat and Ling Chu had shadowed him What if Ling Chu He dismissed the thought as palpably absurd What interest could Ling Chu have in the death of Lyne whom he had only seen once the day that Thornton Lyne had called Tarling into consultation at the Stores That thought was too fantastic to entertain but nevertheless it recurred again and again to him and in the end he sent his servant away with a message to Scotland Yard determined to give even his most fantastic theory as thorough and impartial an examination as was possible The flat consisted of four rooms and a kitchen There was Tarling s bedroom communicating with his dining and sitting room There was a spare room in which he kept his boxes and trunks it was in this room that the revolver had been put aside and there was the small room occupied by Ling Chu He gave his attendant time to get out of the house and well on his journey before he rose from the deep chair where he had been sitting in puzzled thought and began his inspection Ling Chu s room was small and scrupulously clean Save for the bed and a plain black painted box beneath the bed there was no furniture The well scrubbed boards were covered with a strip of Chinese matting and the only ornamentation in the room was supplied by a tiny red lacquer vase which stood on the mantelpiece Tarling went back to the outer door of the flat and locked it before continuing his search If there was any clue to the mystery of the stolen revolver it would be found here in this black box A Chinaman keeps all his possessions within six sides as the saying goes and certainly the box was very well secured It was ten minutes before he managed to find a key to shift the two locks with which it was fastened The contents of the box were few Ling Chu s wardrobe was not an extensive one and did little more than half fill the receptacle Very carefully he lifted out the one suit of clothes the silk shirts the slippers and the odds and ends of the Chinaman s toilet and came quickly to the lower layer Here he discovered two lacquer boxes neither of which were locked or fastened The first of these contained sewing material the second a small package wrapped in native paper and carefully tied about with ribbon Tarling undid the ribbon opened the package and found to his surprise a small pad of newspaper cuttings In the main they were cuttings from colloquial journals printed in Chinese characters but there were one or two paragraphs evidently cut from one of the English papers published in Shanghai He thought at first that these were records of cases in which Ling Chu had been engaged and though he was surprised that the Chinaman should have taken the trouble to collect these souvenirs especially the English cuttings he did not think at first that there was any significance in the act He was looking for some clue what he knew not which would enable him to explain to his own satisfaction the mystery of the filched pistol He read the first of the European cuttings idly but presently his eyes opened wide There was a fracas at Ho Hans s tea room last night due apparently to the too persistent attentions paid by an English visitor to the dancing girl the little Narcissus who is known to the English or such as frequent Ho Hans s rooms as The Little Daffodil He gasped The Little Daffodil He let the cutting drop on his knee and frowned in an effort of memory He knew Shanghai well He knew its mysterious under world and had more than a passing acquaintance with Ho Hans s tea rooms Ho Hans s tea room was in fact the mask which hid an opium den that he had been instrumental in cleaning up just before he departed from China And he distinctly remembered the Little Daffodil He had had no dealings with her in the way of business for when he had had occasion to go into Ho Hans s tea rooms he was usually after bigger game than the graceful little dancer It all came back to him in a flash He had heard men at the club speaking of the grace of the Little Daffodil and her dancing had enjoyed something of a vogue amongst the young Britishers who were exiled in Shanghai The next cutting was also in English and ran A sad fatality occurred this morning a young Chinese girl O Ling the sister of Inspector Ling Chu of the Native Police being found in a dying condition in the yard at the back of Ho Hans s tea rooms The girl had been employed at the shop as a dancer much against her brother s wishes and figured in a very unpleasant affair reported in these columns last week It is believed that the tragic act was one of those save face suicides which are all too common amongst native women Tarling whistled a soft long understanding whistle The Little Daffodil And the sister of Ling Chu He knew something of the Chinese something of their uncanny patience something of their unforgiving nature This dead man had put an insult not only upon the little dancing girl but upon the whole of her family In China disgrace to one is a disgrace to all and she realising the shame that the notoriety had brought upon her brother had taken what to her as a Chinese girl had been the only way out But what was the shame Tarling searched through the native papers and found several flowery accounts not any two agreed save on one point that an Englishman and a tourist had made public love to the girl no very great injury from the standpoint of the Westerner a Chinaman had interfered and there had been a rough house Tarling read the cuttings through from beginning to end then carefully replaced them in the paper package and put them away in the little lacquer box at the bottom of the trunk As carefully he returned all the clothes he had removed relocked the lid and pushed it under the iron bedstead Swiftly he reviewed all the circumstances Ling Chu had seen Thornton Lyne and had planned his vengeance To extract Tarling s revolver was an easy matter but why if he had murdered Lyne would he have left the incriminating weapon behind That was not like Ling Chu that was the act of a novice But how had he lured Thornton Lyne to the flat And how did he know a thought struck him Three nights before the murder Ling Chu discussing the interview which had taken place at Lyne s Stores had very correctly diagnosed the situation Ling Chu knew that Thornton Lyne was in love with the girl and desired her and it would not be remarkable if he had utilised his knowledge to his own ends But the telegram which was designed to bring Lyne to the flat was in English and Ling Chu did not admit to a knowledge of that language Here again Tarling came to a dead end Though he might trust the Chinaman with his life he was perfectly satisfied that this man would not reveal all that he knew and it was quite possible that Ling Chu spoke English as well as he spoke his own native tongue and the four dialects of China I give it up said Tarling half to himself and half aloud He was undecided as to whether he should wait for his subordinate s return from Scotland Yard and tax him with the crime or whether he should let matters slide for a day or two and carry out his intention to visit Odette Rider He took that decision leaving a note for the Chinaman and a quarter of an hour later got out of his taxi at the door of the West Somerset Hotel Odette Rider was in that he knew and waiting for him She looked pale and her eyes were tired as though she had slept little on the previous night but she greeted him with that half smile of hers I ve come to tell you that you are to be spared the ordeal of meeting the third degree men of Scotland Yard he said laughingly and her eyes spoke her relief Haven t you been out this beautiful morning he asked innocently and this time she laughed aloud What a hypocrite you are mister Tarling she replied You know very well I haven t been out and you know too that there are three Scotland Yard men watching this hotel who would accompany me in any constitutional I took How did you know that he asked without denying the charge Because I ve been out she said naively and laughed again You aren t so clever as I thought you were she rallied him I quite expected when I said I d not been out to hear you tell me just where I d been how far I walked and just what I bought Some green sewing silk six handkerchiefs and a tooth brush said Tarling promptly and the girl stared at him in comic dismay Why of course I ought to have known you better than that she said Then you do have watchers Watchers and talkers said Tarling gaily I had a little interview with the gentleman in the vestibule of the hotel and he supplied me with quite a lot of information Did he shadow you She shook her head I saw nobody she confessed though I looked most carefully Now what are you going to do with me mister Tarling For answer Tarling took from his pocket a flat oblong box The girl looked wonderingly as he opened the lid and drew forth a slip of porcelain covered with a thin film of black ink and two white cards His hand shook as he placed them on the table and suddenly the girl understood You want my finger prints she asked and he nodded I just hate asking you he said but Show me how to do it she interrupted and he guided her He felt disloyal a very traitor and perhaps she realised what he was thinking for she laughed as she wiped her stained finger tips Duty s duty she mocked him and now tell me this are you going to keep me under observation all the time For a little while said Tarling gravely In fact until we get the kind of information we want He put away the box into his pocket as she shook her head That means you re not going to tell us anything said Tarling I think you are making a very great mistake but really I am not depending upon your saying a word I depend entirely upon Upon what she asked curiously as he hesitated Upon what others will tell me said Tarling Others What others Her steady eyes met his There was once a famous politician who said Wait and see said Tarling advice which I am going to ask you to follow Now I will tell you something Miss Rider he went on To morrow I am going to take away your watchers though I should advise you to remain at this hotel for a while It is obviously impossible for you to go back to your flat The girl shivered Don t talk about that she said in a low voice But is it necessary that I should stay here There is an alternative he said speaking slowly an alternative he said looking at her steadily and it is that you should go to your mother s place at Hertford She looked up quickly That is impossible she said He was silent for a moment Why don t you make a confidant of me Miss Rider he said I should not abuse your trust Why don t you tell me something about your father My father she looked at him in amazement My father did you say He nodded But I have no father said the girl Have you he found a difficulty in framing his words and it seemed to him that she must have guessed what was coming Have you a lover he asked at length What do you mean she countered and there was a note of hauteur in her voice I mean this said Tarling steadily What is mister Milburgh to you Her hand went up to her mouth and she looked at him in wide eyed distress then Nothing she said huskily Nothing nothing CHAPTER XVIII THE FINGER PRINTS Tarling his hands thrust into his pockets his chin dropped his shoulders bent slowly walked the broad pavement of the Edgware Road 
2090-147030-0001	train-other-500	on his way from the girl s hotel to his flat He dismissed with good reason the not unimportant fact that he himself was suspect He a comparatively unknown detective from Shanghai was by reason of his relationship to Thornton Lyne
2090-147030-0002	train-other-500	and even more so because his own revolver had been found on the scene of the tragedy the object of some suspicion on the part of the higher authorities who certainly would not pooh pooh the suggestion that he was innocent of any association with the crime
2090-147030-0003	train-other-500	because he happened to be engaged in the case He knew that the whole complex machinery of Scotland Yard was working and working at top speed to implicate him in the tragedy Silent and invisible though that work may be
2090-147030-0004	train-other-500	it would nevertheless be sure He smiled a little and shrugged himself from the category of the suspected
none	none	 First and most important of the suspects was Odette Rider 
2090-147030-0005	train-other-500	That Thornton Lyne had loved her he did not for one moment imagine Thornton Lyne was not the kind of man who loved Rather had he desired and very few women had thwarted him
none	none	 Odette Rider was an exception 
2090-147030-0006	train-other-500	Tarling only knew of the scene which had occurred between Lyne and the girl on the day he had been called in but there must have been many other painful interviews painful for the girl humiliating for the dead millionaire Anyway he thought thankfully it would not be Odette
none	none	 He had got into the habit of thinking of her as Odette a discovery which had amused him 
2090-147030-0007	train-other-500	He could rule her out because obviously she could not be in two places at once When Thornton Lyne was discovered in Hyde Park with Odette Rider s night dress round about his wound
none	none	 the girl herself was lying in a cottage hospital at Ashford fifty miles away 
2090-147030-0008	train-other-500	But what of Milburgh that suave and oily man Tarling recalled the fact that he had been sent for by his dead relative to inquire into Milburgh s mode of living and that Milburgh was under suspicion of having robbed the firm
2090-147030-0009	train-other-500	Suppose Milburgh had committed the crime Suppose to hide his defalcations
none	none	 he had shot his employer dead There was a flaw in this reasoning 
2090-147030-0010	train-other-500	because the death of Thornton Lyne would be more likely to precipitate the discovery of the manager s embezzlements
none	none	 there would be an examination of accounts and everything would come out 
2090-147030-0011	train-other-500	Milburgh himself was not unmindful of this argument in his favour as was to be revealed As against this Tarling thought it was notorious that criminals did foolish things
2090-147030-0012	train-other-500	They took little or no account of the immediate consequences of their act and a man like Milburgh in his desperation might in his very frenzy overlook the possibility of his crime coming to light
none	none	 through the very deed he had committed to cover himself up 
2090-147030-0013	train-other-500	He had reached the bottom of Edgware Road and was turning the corner of the street looking across to the Marble Arch
none	none	 when he heard a voice hail him and turning saw a cab breaking violently to the edge of the pavement It was Inspector Whiteside who jumped out 
2090-147030-0014	train-other-500	I was just coming to see you he said I thought your interview with the young lady would be longer Just wait a moment till I ve paid the cabman by the way I saw your Chink servant and gather you sent him to the Yard on a spoof errand
2090-147030-0015	train-other-500	When he returned he met Tarling s eye and grinned sympathetically I know what s in your mind he said frankly but really the Chief thinks it no more than an extraordinary coincidence
none	none	 I suppose you made inquiries about your revolver 
2090-147030-0016	train-other-500	Tarling nodded And can you discover how it came to be in the possession of he paused the murderer of Thornton Lyne
none	none	 I have a theory half formed it is true but still a theory said Taxiing 
2090-147030-0017	train-other-500	In fact it s hardly so much a theory as an hypothesis Whiteside grinned again
none	none	 This hair splitting in the matter of logical terms never did mean much in my young life he said but I take it you have a hunch Without any more to do Tarling told the other of the discovery he had made in Ling Chu s box 
2090-147030-0018	train-other-500	the press cuttings descriptive of the late mister Lyne s conduct in Shanghai
none	none	 and its tragic sequel Whiteside listened in silence There may be something on that side he said at last when Tarling had finished 
2090-147030-0019	train-other-500	I ve heard about your Ling Chu He s a pretty good policeman isn t he The best in China said Tarling promptly but I m not going to pretend that I understand his mind These are the facts The revolver or rather the pistol was in my cupboard
2090-147030-0020	train-other-500	and the only person who could get at it was Ling Chu There is the second and more important fact imputing motive that Ling Chu had every reason to hate Thornton Lyne the man who had indirectly been responsible for his sister s death
none	none	 I have been thinking the matter over 
2090-147030-0021	train-other-500	and I now recall that Ling Chu was unusually silent after he had seen Lyne He has admitted to me that he has been to Lyne s Store
none	none	 and in fact has been pursuing inquiries there 
2090-147030-0022	train-other-500	We happened to be discussing the possibility of Miss Rider committing the murder and Ling Chu told me that Miss Rider could not drive a motor car and when I questioned him as to how he knew this he told me that he had made several inquiries at the Store This I knew nothing about
2090-147030-0023	train-other-500	Here is another curious fact Tarling went on I have always been under the impression that Ling Chu did not speak English
none	none	 except a few words of pigeon that Chinamen pick up through mixing with foreign devils Yet he pushed his inquiries at Lyne s Store amongst the employees and it is a million to one against his finding any shop girl who spoke Cantonese 
2090-147030-0024	train-other-500	I ll put a couple of men on to watch him said Whiteside
none	none	 but Tarling shook his head It would be a waste of good men he said because Ling Chu could lead them just where he wanted to 
2090-147030-0025	train-other-500	I tell you he is a better sleuth than any you have got at Scotland Yard
none	none	 and he has an absolute gift for fading out of the picture under your very nose 
2090-147030-0026	train-other-500	Leave Ling Chu to me I know the way to deal with him he added grimly The Little Daffodil said Whiteside thoughtfully repeating the phrase which Tarling had quoted
none	none	 That was the Chinese girl s name eh 
2090-147030-0027	train-other-500	By Jove It s something more than a coincidence don t you think Tarling
none	none	 It may be or may not be said Tarling 
2090-147030-0028	train-other-500	there is no such word as daffodil in Chinese In fact I am not so certain that the daffodil is a native of China at all though China s a mighty big place Strictly speaking the girl was called The Little Narcissus
none	none	 but as you say it may be something more than a coincidence that the man who insulted her 
2090-147030-0029	train-other-500	is murdered whilst her brother is in London They had crossed the broad roadway as they were speaking and had passed into Hyde Park Tarling thought whimsically that this open space exercised the same attraction on him as it did upon mister Milburgh
2090-147030-0030	train-other-500	What were you going to see me about he asked suddenly remembering that Whiteside had been on his way to the hotel when they had met I wanted to give you the last report about Milburgh Milburgh again
none	none	 All conversation all thought all clues led to that mystery man 
2090-147030-0031	train-other-500	But what Whiteside had to tell was not especially thrilling Milburgh had been shadowed day and night and the record of his doings was a very prosaic one But it is out of prosaic happenings that big clues are born
none	none	 I don t know how Milburgh expects the inquiry into Lyne s accounts will go said Whiteside but he is evidently connected or expects to be connected with some other business 
2090-147030-0032	train-other-500	What makes you say that asked Tarling Well replied Whiteside he has been buying ledgers and Tarling laughed That doesn t seem to be a very offensive proceeding he said good humouredly
2090-147030-0033	train-other-500	What sort of ledgers Those heavy things which are used in big offices You know the sort of thing that it takes one man all his time to lift He bought three at Roebuck s in City Road and took them to his house by taxi
2090-147030-0034	train-other-500	Now my theory said Whiteside earnestly is that this fellow is no ordinary criminal if he is a criminal at all It may be that he has been keeping a duplicate set of books
none	none	 That is unlikely interrupted Tarling and I say this with due respect for your judgment Whiteside It would want to be something more than an ordinary criminal to carry all the details of Lyne s mammoth business in his head 
2090-147030-0035	train-other-500	and it is more than possible that your first theory was right namely that he contemplates either going with another firm or starting a new business of his own The second supposition is more likely Anyway it is no crime to own a ledger or even three
2090-147030-0036	train-other-500	By the way when did he buy these books Yesterday said Whiteside early in the morning before Lyne s opened How did your interview with Miss Rider go off Tarling shrugged his shoulders
none	none	 He felt a strange reluctance to discuss the girl with the police officer 
2090-147030-0037	train-other-500	and realised just how big a fool he was in allowing her sweetness to drug him
none	none	 I am convinced that whoever she may suspect she knows nothing of the murder he said shortly Then she does suspect somebody 
2090-147030-0038	train-other-500	Tarling nodded Who
none	none	 Again Tarling hesitated I think she suspects Milburgh he said He put his hand in the inside of his jacket and took out a pocket case opened it 
2090-147030-0039	train-other-500	and drew forth the two cards bearing the finger impressions he had taken of Odette Rider It required more than an ordinary effort of will to do this
none	none	 though he would have found it difficult to explain just what tricks his emotions were playing 
2090-147030-0040	train-other-500	Here are the impressions you wanted he said Will you take them Whiteside took the cards with a nod and examined the inky smudges and all the time Tarling s heart stood still

2090-147030-0043	train-other-500	which is rather extraordinary Very interesting Well asked Tarling impatiently almost savagely Interesting
none	none	 said Whiteside again but none of these correspond to the thumb prints on the bureau Thank God for that said Tarling fervently Thank God for that CHAPTER XIX LING CHU TELLS THE TRUTH The firm of Dashwood and Solomon occupied a narrow fronted building in the heart of the City of London Its reputation stood as high as any and it numbered amongst its clients the best houses in Britain Both partners had been knighted and it was Sir Felix Solomon who received Tarling in his private office Sir Felix was a tall good looking man well past middle age rather brusque of manner but kindly withal and he looked up over his glasses as the detective entered Scotland Yard eh he said glancing at Tarling s card Well I can give you exactly five minutes mister Tarling I presume you ve come to see me about the Lyne accounts Tarling nodded We have not been able to start on these yet said Sir Felix though we are hoping to go into them to morrow We re terribly rushed just now and we ve had to get in an extra staff to deal with this new work the Government has put on us by the way you know that we are not Lyne s accountants they are Messrs Purbrake Store but we have taken on the work at the request of mister Purbrake who very naturally wishes to have an independent investigation as there seems to be some question of defalcation on the part of one of the employees This coupled with the tragic death of mister Lyne has made it all the more necessary that an outside firm should be called in to look into the books That I understand said Tarling and of course the Commissioner quite appreciates the difficulty of your task I ve come along rather to procure information for my own purpose as I am doubly interested Sir Felix looked up sharply mister Tarling he repeated looking at the card again Why of course I understand that letters of administration are to be applied for on your behalf I believe that is so said Tarling quietly But my interest in the property is more or less impersonal at the moment The manager of the business is a mister Milburgh Sir Felix nodded He has been most useful and helpful he said And certainly if the vague rumours I have heard have any substantial foundation namely that Milburgh is suspected of robbing the firm then he is assuredly giving us every assistance to convict himself You have all the books in your keeping Absolutely replied Sir Felix emphatically The last three books unearthed by mister Milburgh himself came to us only this morning In fact those are they he pointed to a brown paper parcel standing on a smaller table near the window The parcel was heavily corded and was secured again by red tape which was sealed Sir Felix leaned over and pressed a bell on the table and a clerk came in Put those books with the others in the strong room he said and when the man had disappeared staggering under the weight of the heavy volumes he turned to Tarling We re keeping all the books and accounts of Lyne s Stores in a special strong room he said They are all under seal and those seals will be broken in the presence of mister Milburgh as an interested party and a representative of the Public Prosecutor When will this be asked Tarling To morrow afternoon or possibly to morrow morning We will notify Scotland Yard as to the exact hour because I suppose you will wish to be represented He rose briskly thereby ending the interview It was another dead end thought Tarling as he went out into saint Mary Axe and boarded a westward bound omnibus The case abounded in these culs de sac which seemed to lead nowhere Cul de sac No one had been supplied by Odette Rider cul de sac No two might very easily lead to the dead end of Milburgh s innocence He felt a sense of relief however that the authorities had acted so promptly in impounding Lyne s books An examination into these might lead to the discovery of the murderer and at any rate would dispel the cloud of suspicion which still surrounded Odette Rider He had gone to Dashwood and Solomon to make himself personally acquainted with that string in the tangled skein which he was determined to unravel and now with his mind at rest upon that subject he was returning to settle matters with Ling Chu that Chinese assistant of his who was now as deeply under suspicion as any suspect in the case He had spoken no more than the truth when he had told Inspector Whiteside that he knew the way to deal with Ling Chu A Chinese criminal and he was loath to believe that Ling Chu that faithful servant came under that description is not to be handled in the Occidental manner and he who had been known throughout Southern China as the Hunter of Men had a reputation for extracting truth by methods which no code of laws would sanction He walked into his Bond Street flat shut the door behind him and locked it putting the key in his pocket He knew Ling Chu would be in because he had given him instructions that morning to await his return The Chinaman came into the hall to take his coat and hat and followed Tarling into the sitting room Close the door Ling Chu said Tarling in Chinese I have something to say to you The last words were spoken in English and the Chinaman looked at him quickly Tarling had never addressed him in that language before and the Chinaman knew just what this departure portended Ling Chu said Tarling sitting at the table his chin in his hand watching the other with steady eyes you did not tell me that you spoke English The master has never asked me said the Chinaman quietly and to Tarling s surprise his English was without accent and his pronunciation perfect That is not true said Tarling sternly When you told me that you had heard of the murder I said that you did not understand English and you did not deny it It is not for me to deny the master said Ling Chu as coolly as ever I speak very good English I was trained at the Jesuit School in Hangkow but it is not good for a Chinaman to speak English in China or for any to know that he understands Yet the master must have known I spoke English and read the language for why should I keep the little cuttings from the newspapers in the box which the master searched this morning Tarling s eyes narrowed So you knew that did you he said The Chinaman smiled It was a most unusual circumstance for Ling Chu had never smiled within Tarling s recollection The papers were in certain order some turned one way and some turned the other When I saw them after I came back from Scotland Yard they had been disturbed They could not disturb themselves master and none but you would go to my box There was a pause awkward enough for Tarling who felt for the moment a little foolish that his carelessness had led to Ling Chu discovering the search which had been made of his private property I thought I had put them back as I had found them he said knowing that nothing could be gained by denying the fact that he had gone through Ling Chu s trunk Now you will tell me Ling Chu did those printed words speak the truth Ling Chu nodded It is true master he said The Little Narcissus or as the foreigners called her the Little Daffodil was my sister She became a dancer in a tea house against my wish our parents being dead She was a very good girl master and as pretty as a sprig of almond blossom Chinese women are not pretty to the foreigner s eyes but little Daffodil was like something cast in porcelain and she had the virtues of a thousand years Tarling nodded She was a good girl he repeated this time speaking in Chinese and using a phrase which had a more delicate shade of meaning She lived good and she died good said the Chinaman calmly The speech of the Englishman offended her and he called her many bad names because she would not come and sit on his knee and if he put shame upon her by embracing her before the eyes of men she was yet good and she died very honourably Another interval of silence I see said Tarling quietly And when you said you would come with me to England did you expect to meet the bad Englishman 
2010_147045_000071_000000	train-clean-360	Ling Chu shook his head 
none	none	I had put it from my mind he said until I saw him that day in the big shop Then the evil spirit which I had thought was all burnt out inside me blazed up again He stopped And you desired his death said Tarling and a nod was his answer You shall tell me all Ling Chu said Tarling The man was now pacing the room with restless strides his emotion betrayed only by the convulsive clutching and unclutching of his hands The Little Daffodil was very dear to me he said Soon I think she would have married and have had children and her name would have been blessed after the fashion of our people for did not the Great Master say What is more worshipful than the mother of children And when she died master my heart was empty for there was no other love in my life And then the Ho Sing murder was committed and I went into the interior to search for Lu Fang and that helped me to forget I had forgotten till I saw him again Then the old sorrow grew large in my soul and I went out To kill him said Tarling quietly To kill him repeated the man Tell me all said Tarling drawing a long breath It was the night you went to the little girl said Ling Chu Tarling knew that he spoke of Odette Rider I had made up my mind to go out but I could not find an excuse because master you have given me orders that I must not leave this place whilst you are out So I asked if I might go with you to the house of many houses To the flat nodded Tarling Yes go on I had taken your quick quick pistol and had loaded it and put it in my overcoat pocket You told me to trail you but when I had seen you on your way I left you and went to the big shop To the big shop said Tarling in surprise But Lyne did not live in his stores So I discovered said Ling Chu simply I thought in such a large house he would have built himself a beautiful room In China many masters live in their shops So I went to the big store to search it Did you get in asked Tarling in surprise and again Ling Chu smiled That was very easy he said The master knows how well I climb and there were long iron pipes leading to the roof Up one of these I climbed Two sides of the shop are on big streets One side is on a smaller street and the fourth side is in a very small piece street with few lights It was up this side that I went On the roof were many doors and to such a man as me there was no difficulty Go on said Tarling again I came down from floor to floor always in darkness but each floor I searched carefully but found nothing but great bundles and packing cases and long bars Counters corrected Tarling Yes nodded Ling Chu they are called counters And then at last I came to the floor where I had seen The Man He paused First I went to the great room where we had met him and that was locked I opened it with a key but it was in darkness and I knew nobody was there Then I went along a passage very carefully because there was a light at the other end and I came to an office Empty of course It was empty said the Chinaman but a light was burning and the desk cover was open I thought he must be there and I slipped behind the bureau taking the pistol from my pocket Presently I heard a footstep I peeped out and saw the big white faced man Milburgh said Tarling So he is called replied the Chinaman He sat at the young man s desk I knew it was the young man s desk because there were many pictures upon it and flowers such as he would have The big man had his back to me What was he doing asked Tarling He was searching the desk looking for something Presently I saw him take from one of the drawers which he opened an envelope From where I stood I could see into the drawer and there were many little things such as tourists buy in China From the envelope he took the Hong Tarling started He knew of the Hong to which the man referred It was the little red slip of paper bearing the Chinese characters which was found upon Thornton Lyne s body that memorable morning in Hyde Park Yes yes he said eagerly What happened then He put the envelope in his pocket and went out I heard him walking along the passage and then I crept out from my hiding place and I also looked at the desk I put the revolver down by my side because I wanted both hands for the search but I found nothing only one little piece book that the master uses to write down from day to day all that happens to him A diary thought Tarling Well and what next he asked I got up to search the room and tripped over a wire It must have been the wire attached to the electric light above the desk for the room suddenly became dark and at that moment I heard the big man s footsteps returning and slipped out of the door And that is all master said Ling Chu simply I went back to the roof quickly for fear I should be discovered and it should bring dishonour to you Tarling whistled And left the pistol behind he said That is nothing but the truth said Ling Chu I have dishonoured myself in your eyes and in my heart I am a murderer for I went to that place to kill the man who had brought shame to me and to my honourable relation And left the pistol behind said Tarling again And Milburgh found it CHAPTER XX mister MILBURGH SEES IT THROUGH Ling Chu s story was not difficult to believe It was less difficult to believe that he was lying There is no inventor in the world so clever so circumstantial so exact as to detail as the Chinaman He is a born teller of stories and piecer together of circumstances that fit so closely that it is difficult to see the joints Yet the man had been frank straightforward patently honest He had even placed himself in Tarling s power by his confession of his murderous intention Tarling could reconstruct the scene after the Chinaman had left Milburgh stumbling in in the dark striking a match and discovering a wall plug had been pulled away reconnecting the lamp and seeing to his amazement a murderous looking pistol on the desk It was possible that Milburgh finding the pistol had been deceived into believing that he had overlooked it on his previous search But what had happened to the weapon between the moment that Ling Chu left it on Thornton Lyne s private desk and when it was discovered in the work basket of Odette Rider in the flat at Carrymore Mansions And what had Milburgh been doing in the store by himself so late at night And more particularly what had he been doing in Thornton Lyne s private room It was unlikely that Lyne would leave his desk unlocked and the only inference to be drawn was that Milburgh had unlocked it himself with the object of searching its contents And the Hong Those sinister little squares of red paper with the Chinese characters one of which had been found in Thornton Lyne s pocket The explanation of their presence in Thornton Lyne s desk was simple He had been a globetrotter and had collected curios and it was only natural that he should collect these slips of paper which were on sale in most of the big Chinese towns as a souvenir of the predatory methods of the Cheerful Hearts His conversation with Ling Chu would have to be reported to Scotland Yard and that august institution would draw its own conclusions In all probability they would be most unfavourable to Ling Chu who would come immediately under suspicion Tarling however was satisfied or perhaps it would be more accurate to say inclined to be satisfied with his retainer s statement Some of his story was susceptible to verification and the detective lost no time in making his way to the Stores The topographical situation was as Ling Chu had described it Tarling went to the back of the big block of buildings into the small quiet street of which Ling Chu had spoken and was able to distinguish the iron rain pipe one of many up which the Chinaman had clambered Ling Chu would negotiate that task without any physical distress He could climb like a cat as Tarling knew and that part of his story put no great tax upon the detective s credulity He walked back to the front of the shop passed the huge plate glass windows fringed now with shoppers with whom Lyne s Store had acquired a new and morbid interest and through the big swinging doors on to the crowded floor mister Milburgh was in his office said a shop walker and led the way mister Milburgh s office was much larger and less ornate than his late employer s He greeted Tarling effusively and pushed an arm chair forward and produced a box of cigars We re in rather a turmoil and upset now mister Tarling he said in his ingratiating voice with that set smile of his which never seemed to leave his face The auditors or rather I should say the accountants have taken away all the books and of course that imposes a terrible strain on me mister Tarling It means that we ve got to organise a system of interim accounts and you as a business man will understand just what that means You work pretty hard mister Milburgh said Tarling Why yes sir smiled Milburgh I ve always worked hard You were working pretty hard before mister Lyne was killed were you not asked Tarling Yes hesitated Milburgh I can say honestly that I was Very late at night Milburgh still smiled but there was a steely look in his eye as he answered Frequently I worked late at night Do you remember the night of the eleventh asked Tarling Milburgh looked at the ceiling for inspiration Yes I think I do I was working very late that night In your own office No replied the other readily I did most of my work in mister Lyne s office at his request he added A bold statement to make to a man who knew that Lyne suspected him of robbing the firm But Milburgh was nothing if not bold Did he also give you the key of his desk asked the detective dryly Yes sir beamed mister Milburgh of course he did You see mister Lyne trusted me absolutely He said this so naturally and with such assurance that Tarling was staggered Before he had time to speak the other went on Yes I can truthfully say that I was in mister Lyne s confidence He told me a great deal more about himself than he has told anybody and One moment said Tarling and he spoke slowly Will you please tell me what you did with the revolver which you found on mister Lyne s desk It was a Colt automatic and it was loaded Blank astonishment showed in mister Milburgh s eyes A loaded pistol he asked raising his eyebrows but my dear good mister Tarling whatever are you talking about I never found a loaded pistol on mister Lyne s desk poor fellow mister Lyne objected as much to these deadly weapons as myself Here was a facer for Tarling but he betrayed no sign either of disappointment or surprise Milburgh was frowning as though he were attempting to piece together some half forgotten recollection Is it possible he said in a shocked voice that when you examined my house the other day it was with the object of discovering such a weapon as this It s quite possible said Tarling coolly and even probable Now I m going to be very straightforward with you mister Milburgh I suspect you know a great deal more about this murder than you have told us and that you had ever so much more reason for wishing mister Lyne was dead than you are prepared to admit at this moment Wait he said as the other opened his mouth to speak I am telling you candidly that the object of my first visit to these Stores was to investigate happenings which looked very black against you It was hardly so much the work of a detective as an accountant he said but mister Lyne thought that I should be able to discover who was robbing the firm And did you asked Milburgh coolly There was the ghost of a smile still upon his face but defiance shone in his pale eyes I did not because I went no further in the matter after you had expressed your agreement with mister Lyne that the firm had been robbed by Odette Rider He saw the man change colour and pushed home his advantage I am not going to inquire too closely into your reasons for attempting to ruin an innocent girl he said sternly That is a matter for your own conscience But I tell you mister Milburgh that if you are innocent both of the robbery and of the murder then I ve never met a guilty person in my life What do you mean asked the man loudly Do you dare to accuse me I accuse you of nothing more than this said Tarling that I am perfectly satisfied that you have been robbing the firm for years I am equally satisfied that even if you did not kill mister Lyne you at least know who did You re mad sneered Milburgh but his face was white Supposing it were true that I had robbed the firm why should I want to kill mister Thornton Lyne The mere fact of his death would have brought an examination into the accounts This was a convincing argument the more so as it was an argument which Tarling himself had employed As to your absurd and melodramatic charges of robbing the firm Milburgh went on the books are now in the hands of an eminent firm of chartered accountants who can give the lie to any such statement as you have made He had recovered something of his old urbanity and now stood or rather straddled with his legs apart his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat beaming benignly upon the detective I await the investigation of that eminent firm Messrs Dashwood and Solomon with every confidence and without the least perturbation he said Their findings will vindicate my honour beyond any question I shall see this matter through Tarling looked at him I admire your nerve he said and left the office without another word CHAPTER XXI COVERING THE TRAIL Tarling had a brief interview with his assistant Whiteside and the Inspector to his surprise accepted his view of Ling Chu s confession I always thought Milburgh was a pretty cool customer Whiteside said thoughtfully But he has more gall than I gave him credit for I would certainly prefer to believe your Chink than I would believe Milburgh And by the way your young lady has slipped the shadow What are you talking about asked Tarling in surprise I am referring to your Miss Odette Rider and why on earth a grown up police officer with your experience should blush I can t imagine I m not blushing said Tarling What about her I ve had two men watching her explained Whiteside and whenever she has taken her walks abroad she has been followed as you know In accordance with your instructions I was taking off those shadows to morrow but to day she went to Bond Street and either Jackson was careless it was Jackson who was on the job or else the young lady was very sharp at any rate he waited for half an hour for her to come out of the shop and when she didn t appear he walked in and found there was another entrance through which she had gone Since then she has not been back to the hotel I don t like that said Tarling a little troubled I wished her to be under observation as much for her own protection as anything else I wish you would keep a man at the hotel and telephone me just as soon as she returns Whiteside nodded I ve anticipated your wishes in that respect he said Well what is the next move I m going to Hertford to see Miss Rider s mother and incidentally I may pick up Miss Rider who is very likely to have gone home Whiteside nodded What do you expect to find out from the mother he asked I expect to learn a great deal said Tarling There is still a minor mystery to be discovered For example who is the mysterious man who comes and goes to Hertford and just why is missus Rider living in luxury whilst her daughter is working for her living at Lyne s Store There s something in that agreed Whiteside Would you like me to come along with you Thanks smiled Tarling I can do that little job by myself Reverting to Milburgh began Whiteside As we always revert to Milburgh groaned Tarling Yes Well I don t like his assurance said Whiteside It looks as if all our hopes of getting a clue from the examination of Lyne s accounts are fated to be dashed There s something in that said Tarling I don t like it myself The books are in the hands of one of the best chartered accountants in the country and if there has been any monkey business he is the fellow who is certain to find it and not only that but to trace whatever defalcations there are to the man responsible Milburgh is not fool enough to imagine that he won t be found out once the accountants get busy and his cheeriness in face of exposure is to say the least disconcerting Their little conference was being held in a prosaic public tea room opposite the House of Commons a tea room the walls of which had they ears could have told not a few of Scotland Yard s most precious secrets Tarling was on the point of changing the subject when he remembered the parcel of books which had arrived at the accountant s office that morning Rather late said Whiteside thoughtfully By Jove I wonder You wonder what I wonder if they were the three books that Milburgh bought yesterday The three ledgers Whiteside nodded But why on earth should he want to put in three new ledgers they were new weren t they That doesn t seem to me to be a very intelligent suggestion And yet He jumped up almost upsetting the table in his excitement Quick Whiteside Get a cab while I settle the bill he said Where are you going Hurry up and get the cab said Tarling and when he had rejoined his companion outside and the taxi was bowling along the Thames Embankment I m going to saint Mary Axe So I gathered from your directions to the cabman said Whiteside But why saint Mary Axe at this time of the afternoon The very respectable Dashwood and Solomon will not be glad to see you until to morrow I m going to see these books said Tarling the books which Milburgh sent to the accountants this morning What do you expect to find I ll tell you later was Tarling s reply He looked at his watch They won t be closed yet thank heaven The taxi was held up at the juncture of the Embankment and Blackfriars Bridge and was held up again for a different reason in Queen Victoria Street Suddenly there was a clang clang of gongs and all traffic drew to one side to allow the passage of a flying motor fire engine Another and another followed in succession A big fire said Whiteside Or it may be a little one because they get very panicky in the City and they ll put in a divisional call for a smoking chimney The cab moved on and had crossed Cannon Street when it was again held up by another roaring motor this time bearing a fire escape Let s get out of the cab we ll walk said Tarling They jumped out and Whiteside paid the driver This way said Tarling We ll make a short cut Whiteside had stopped to speak to a policeman Where s the fire constable he asked saint Mary Axe sir was the policeman s reply A big firm of chartered accountants Dashwood and Solomon You know them sir I m told the place is blazing from cellar to garret Tarling showed his teeth in an unamused grin as the words came to him And all the proof of Milburgh s guilt gone up in smoke eh he said I think I know what those books contained a little clockwork detonator and a few pounds of thermite to burn up all the clues to the Daffodil Murder CHAPTER XXII THE HEAVY WALLET All that remained of the once stately if restricted premises of Messrs Dashwood and Solomon was a gaunt looking front wall blackened by the fire Tarling interviewed the Chief of the Fire Brigade It ll be days before we can get inside said that worthy and I very much doubt if there s anything left intact The whole of the building has been burnt out you can see for yourself the roof has gone in and there s very little chance of recovering anything of an inflammable nature unless it happens to be in a safe Tarling caught sight of the brusque Sir Felix Solomon gazing without any visible evidence of distress upon the wreckage of his office We are covered by insurance said Sir Felix philosophically and there is nothing of any great importance except of course those documents and books from Lyne s Store They weren t in the fire proof vault asked Tarling and Sir Felix shook his head No he said they were in a strong room and curiously enough it was in that strong room where the fire originated The room itself was not fire proof and it would have been precious little use if it had been as the fire started inside The first news we received was when a clerk going down to the basement saw flames leaping out between the steel bars which constitute the door of No four vault Tarling nodded I need not ask you whether the books which mister Milburgh brought this morning had been placed in that safe Sir Felix he said and the knight looked surprised Of course not They were placed there whilst you were in the office he said Why do you ask Because in my judgment those books were not books at all in the usually understood sense Unless I am at fault the parcel contained three big ledgers glued together the contents being hollowed out and that hollow filled with thermite a clockwork detonator or the necessary electric apparatus to start a spark at a given moment The accountant stared at him You re joking he said but Tarling shook his head I was never more serious in my life But who would commit such an infernal act as that Why one of my clerks was nearly burnt to death The man who would commit such an infernal act as that repeated Tarling slowly is the man who has every reason for wishing to avoid an examination of Lyne s accounts You don t mean I ll mention no names for the moment and if inadvertently I have conveyed the identity of the gentleman of whom I have been speaking I hope you will be good enough to regard it as confidential said Tarling and went back to his crestfallen subordinate No wonder Milburgh was satisfied with the forthcoming examination he said bitterly The devil had planted that parcel and had timed it probably to the minute Well there s nothing more to be done to night with Milburgh He looked at his watch I m going back to my flat and afterwards to Hertford he said He had made no definite plan as to what line he should pursue after he reached Hertford He had a dim notion that his investigation hereabouts might if properly directed lead him nearer to the heart of the mystery This pretty faded woman who lived in such style and whose husband was so seldom visible might give him a key Somewhere it was in existence that key by which he could decipher the jumbled code of the Daffodil Murder and it might as well be at Hertford as nearer at hand It was dark when he came to the home of missus Rider for this time he had dispensed with a cab and had walked the long distance between the station and the house desiring to avoid attention The dwelling stood on the main road It had a high wall frontage of about three hundred and fifty feet The wall was continued down the side of a lane and at the other end marked the boundary of a big paddock The entrance to the grounds was through a wrought iron gate of strength the design of which recalled something which he had seen before On his previous visit the gate had been unfastened and he had had no difficulty in reaching the house Now however it was locked He put his flashlight over the gate and the supporting piers and discovered a bell evidently brand new and recently fixed He made no attempt to press the little white button but continued his reconnaissance About half a dozen yards inside the gateway was a small cottage from which a light showed and apparently the bell communicated with this dwelling Whilst he was waiting he heard a whistle and a quick footstep coming up the road and drew into the shadow Somebody came to the gate he heard the faint tinkle of a bell and a door opened The new comer was a newspaper boy who pushed a bundle of evening papers through the iron bars and went off again Tarling waited until he heard the door of the cottage or lodge close Then he made a circuit of the house hoping to find another entrance There was evidently a servants entrance at the back leading from the lane but this too was closed Throwing his light up he saw that there was no broken glass on top of the wall as there had been in the front of the house and making a jump he caught the stone coping and drew himself up and astride He dropped into the darkness on the other side without any discomfort to himself and made his cautious way towards the house Dogs were the danger but apparently missus Rider did not keep dogs and his progress was unchallenged He saw no light either in the upper or lower windows until he got to the back Here was a pillared porch above which had been built what appeared to be a conservatory Beneath the porch was a door and a barred window but it was from the conservatory above that a faint light emanated He looked round for a ladder without success But the portico presented no more difficulties than the wall had done By stepping on to the window sill and steadying himself against one of the pillars he could reach an iron stanchion which had evidently been placed to support the framework of the superstructure From here to the parapet of the conservatory itself was but a swing This glass house had casement windows one of which was open and he leaned on his elbows and cautiously intruded his head The place was empty The light came from an inner room opening into the glass sheltered balcony Quickly he slipped through the windows and crouched under the shadow of a big oleander The atmosphere of the conservatory was close and the smell was earthy He judged from the hot water pipes which his groping hands felt that it was a tiny winter garden erected by the owner of the house for her enjoyment in the dark cold days French windows admitted to the inner room and peering through the casement curtains which covered them Tarling saw missus Rider She was sitting at a desk a pen in her hand her chin on her finger tips She was not writing but staring blankly at the wall as though she were at a loss for what to say The light came from a big alabaster bowl hanging a foot below the ceiling level and it gave the detective an opportunity of making a swift examination The room was furnished simply if in perfect taste and had the appearance of a study Beside her desk was a green safe half let into the wall and half exposed There were a few prints hanging on the walls a chair or two a couch half hidden from the detective s view and that was all He had expected to see Odette Rider with her mother and was disappointed Not only was missus Rider alone but she conveyed the impression that she was practically alone in the house Tarling knelt watching her for ten minutes until he heard a sound outside He crept softly back and looked over the edge of the portico in time to see a figure moving swiftly along the path It was riding a bicycle which did not carry a light Though he strained his eyes he could not tell whether the rider was man or woman It disappeared under the portico and he heard the grating of the machine as it was leant against one of the pillars the click of a key in the lock and the sound of a door opening Then he crept back to his observation post overlooking the study missus Rider had evidently not heard the sound of the door opening below and sat without movement still staring at the wall before her Presently she started and looked round towards the door Tarling noted the door noted too the electric switch just in view Then the door opened slowly He saw missus Rider s face light up with pleasure then somebody asked a question in a whisper and she answered he could just hear her words No darling nobody Tarling held his breath and waited Then of a sudden the light in the room was extinguished Whoever had entered had turned out the light He heard a soft footfall coming towards the window looking into the conservatory and the rattle of the blinds as they were lowered Then the light went up again but he could see nothing or hear nothing Who was missus Rider s mysterious visitor There was only one way to discover but he waited a little longer waited in fact until he heard the soft slam of a safe door closing before he slipped again through the window and dropped to the ground The bicycle was as he had expected leaning against one of the pillars He could see nothing and did not dare flash his lamp but his sensitive fingers ran over its lines and he barely checked an exclamation of surprise It was a lady s bicycle He waited a little while then withdrew to a shrubbery opposite the door on the other side of the drive up which the cyclist had come He had not long to wait before the door under the portico opened again and closed Somebody jumped on to the bicycle as Tarling leaped from his place of concealment He pressed the key of his electric lamp but for some reason it did not act He felt rather than heard a shiver of surprise from the person on the machine I want you said Tarling and put out his hands He missed the rider by the fraction of an inch but saw the machine swerve and heard the soft thud of something falling A second later the machine and rider had disappeared in the pitch darkness He re fixed his lamp Pursuit he knew was useless without his lantern and cursing the maker thereof he adjusted another battery and put the light on the ground to see what it was that the fugitive had dropped He thought he heard a smothered exclamation behind him and turned swiftly But nobody came within the radius of his lamp He must be getting nervy he thought and continued his inspection of the wallet It was a long leather portfolio about ten inches in length and five inches in depth and it was strangely heavy He picked it up felt for the clasp and found instead two tiny locks He made another examination by the light of his lantern an examination which was interrupted by a challenge from above Who are you It was missus Rider s voice and just then it was inconvenient for him to reveal himself Without a word in answer he switched off his light and slipped into the bushes and more as the result of instinct than judgment regained the wall at almost the exact spot he had crossed it The road was empty and there was no sign of the cyclist There was only one thing to do and that was to get back to town as quickly as possible and examine the contents of the wallet at his leisure It was extraordinary heavy for its size he was reminded of that fact by his sagging pocket The road back to Hertford seemed interminable and the clocks were chiming a quarter of eleven when he entered the station yard Train to London sir said the porter You ve missed the last train to London by five minutes CHAPTER XXIII THE NIGHT VISITOR Tarling was less in a dilemma than in that condition of uncertainty which is produced by having no definite plans one way or the other There was no immediate necessity for his return to town and his annoyance at finding the last train gone was due rather to a natural desire to sleep in his own bed than to any other cause He might have got a car from a local garage and motored to London if there had been any particular urgency but he told himself he might as well spend the night in Hertford as in Bond Street If he had any leanings towards staying at Hertford it was because he was anxious to examine the contents of the wallet at his leisure If he had any call to town it might be discovered in his anxiety as to what had happened to Odette Rider whether she had returned to her hotel or was still marked missing by the police He could at any rate get into communication with Scotland Yard and satisfy his mind on that point He turned back from the station in search of lodgings He was to find that it was not so easy to get rooms as he had imagined The best hotel in the place was crowded out as a result of an agricultural convention which was being held in the town He was sent on to another hotel only to find that the same state of congestion existed and finally after half an hour s search he found accommodation at a small commercial hotel which was surprisingly empty His first step was to get into communication with London and this was established without delay Nothing had been heard of Odette Rider and the only news of importance was that the ex convict Sam Stay had escaped from the county lunatic asylum to which he had been removed Tarling went up to the commodious sitting room He was mildly interested in the news about Stay for the man had been a disappointment This criminal whose love for Thornton Lyne had as Tarling suspected rightly been responsible for his mental collapse might have supplied a great deal of information as to the events which led up to the day of the murder and his dramatic breakdown had removed a witness who might have offered material assistance to the police Tarling closed the door of his sitting room behind him pulled the wallet from his pocket and laid it on the table He tried first with his own keys to unfasten the flap but the locks defied him The heaviness of the wallet surprised and piqued him but he was soon to find an explanation for its extraordinary weight He opened his pocket knife and began to cut away the leather about the locks and uttered an exclamation So that was the reason for the heaviness of the pouch it was only leather covered Beneath this cover was a lining of fine steel mail The wallet was really a steel chain bag the locks being welded to the chain and absolutely immovable He threw the wallet back on the table with a laugh He must restrain his curiosity until he got back to the Yard where the experts would make short work of the best locks which were ever invented Whilst he sat watching the thing upon the table and turning over in his mind the possibility of its contents he heard footsteps pass his door and mount the stairway opposite which his sitting room was situated Visitors in the same plight as himself he thought Somehow being in a strange room amidst unfamiliar surroundings gave the case a new aspect It was an aspect of unreality They were all so unreal the characters in this strange drama Thornton Lyne seemed fantastic and fantastic indeed was his end Milburgh with his perpetual smirk his little stoop his broad fat face and half bald head missus Rider a pale ghost of a woman who flitted in and out of the story or rather hovered about it never seeming to intrude yet never wholly separated from its tragic process Ling Chu imperturbable bringing with him the atmosphere of that land of intrigue and mystery and motive China Odette Rider alone was real She was life warm palpitating wonderful Tarling frowned and rose stiffly from his chair He despised himself a little for this weakness of his Odette Rider A woman still under suspicion of murder a woman whom it was his duty if she were guilty to bring to the scaffold and the thought of her turned him hot and cold He passed through to his bedroom which adjoined the sitting room put the wallet on a table by the side of his bed locked the bedroom door opened the windows and prepared himself as best he could for the night There was a train leaving Hertford at five in the morning and he had arranged to be called in time to catch it He took off his boots coat vest collar and tie unbuckled his belt he was one of those eccentrics to whom the braces of civilisation were anathema and lay down on the outside of the bed pulling the eiderdown over him Sleep did not come to him readily He turned from side to side thinking thinking thinking Suppose there had been some mistake in the time of the accident at Ashford Suppose the doctors were wrong and Thornton Lyne was murdered at an earlier hour Suppose Odette Rider was in reality a cold blooded He growled away the thought He heard the church clock strike the hour of two and waited impatiently for the quarter to chime he had heard every quarter since he had retired to bed But he did not hear that quarter He must have fallen into an uneasy sleep for he began to dream He dreamt he was in China again and had fallen into the hands of that baneful society the Cheerful Hearts He was in a temple lying on a great black slab of stone bound hand and foot and above him he saw the leader of the gang knife in hand peering down into his face with a malicious grin and it was the face of Odette Rider He saw the knife raised and woke sweating The church clock was booming three and a deep silence lay on the world But there was somebody in his room He knew that and lay motionless peering out of half closed eyes from one corner to the other There was nobody to be seen nothing to be heard but his sixth sense told him that somebody was present He reached out his hand carefully and silently to the table and searched for the wallet It was gone Then he heard the creak of a board and it came from the direction of the door leading to the sitting room With one bound he was out of bed in time to see the door flung open and a figure slip through He was after it in a second The burglar might have escaped but unexpectedly there was a crash and a cry He had fallen over a chair and before he could rise Tarling was on him and had flung him back He leapt to the door it was open He banged it close and turned the key Now let s have a look at you said Tarling grimly and switched on the light He fell back against the door his mouth open in amazement for the intruder was Odette Rider and in her hand she held the stolen wallet CHAPTER XXIV THE CONFESSION OF ODETTE RIDER 
1963_147036_000003_000000	train-clean-100	He could only gaze in stupified silence 
none	none	You he said wonderingly The girl was pale and her eyes never left his face She nodded Yes it is I she said in a low voice You he said again and walked towards her He held out his hand and she gave him the wallet without a word Sit down he said kindly He thought she was going to faint
1963_147036_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 I hope I didn t hurt you 
none	none	I hadn t the slightest idea She shook her head Oh I m not hurt she said wearily not hurt in the way you mean She drew a chair to the table and dropped her face upon her hands and he stood by embarrassed almost terrified by this unexpected development So you were the visitor on the bicycle he said at last
1963_147036_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 I didn t suspect 
none	none	It struck him at that moment that it was not an offence for Odette Rider to go up to her mother s house on a bicycle or even to take away a wallet which was probably hers If there was any crime at all he had committed it in retaining something to which he had no right 
1963_147036_000017_000002	train-clean-100	She looked up at his words 
none	none	I 
1963_147036_000018_000001	train-clean-100	On the bicycle she asked 
1963_147036_000018_000002	train-clean-100	 No it was not I 
1963_147036_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Not you 
none	none	She shook her head I was in the grounds I saw you using your lamp and I was quite close to you when you picked up the wallet she said listlessly but I was not on the bicycle
1963_147036_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 Who was it he asked 
none	none	She shook her head
1963_147036_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 May I have that please 
none	none	She held out her hand and he hesitated 
1963_147036_000026_000000	train-clean-100	After all he had no right or title to this curious purse 
none	none	He compromised by putting it on the table and she did not attempt to take it Odette he said gently and walked round to her laying his hand on her shoulder Why don t you tell me Tell you what she asked without looking up Tell me all there is to be told he said
1963_147036_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 I could help you 
none	none	I want to help you 
1963_147036_000030_000000	train-clean-100	She looked up at him 
none	none	Why do you want to help me she asked simply He was tongue tied for a second
1963_147036_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Because I love you he said and his voice shook 
none	none	It did not seem to him that he was talking The words came of their own volition He had no more intention of telling her he loved her indeed he had no more idea that he did love her than Whiteside would have had Yet he knew he spoke the truth and that a power greater than he had framed the words and put them on his lips The effect on the girl seemed extraordinary to him 
1963_147036_000035_000001	train-clean-100	She did not shrink back she did not look surprised 
none	none	She showed no astonishment whatever She just brought her eyes back to the table and said Oh That calm almost uncannily calm acceptance of a fact which Tarling had not dared to breathe to himself was the second shock of the evening It was as though she had known it all along He was on his knees by her side and his arm was about her shoulders even before his brain had willed the act My girl my girl he said gently
1963_147036_000038_000001	train-clean-100	 Won t you please tell me 
none	none	Her head was still bent and her voice was so low as to be almost inaudible Tell you what she asked What you know of this business he said Don t you realise how every new development brings you more and more under suspicion What business do you mean He hesitated The murder of Thornton Lyne I know nothing of that She made no response to that tender arm of his but sat rigid Something in her attitude chilled him and he dropped her hand and rose When she looked up she saw that his face was white and set 
1963_147036_000045_000003	train-clean-100	He walked to the door and unlocked it 
none	none	I m not going to ask you any more he said quietly You know best why you came to me to night I suppose you followed me and took a room I heard somebody going upstairs soon after I arrived She nodded Do you want this she asked and pointed to the wallet on the table
1963_147036_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Take it away with you 
none	none	She got up to her feet unsteadily and swayed toward him In a second he was by her side his arms about her She made no resistance but rather he felt a yielding towards him which he had missed before Her pale face was upturned to his and he stooped and kissed her Odette Odette he whispered Don t you realise that I love you and would give my life to save you from unhappiness Won t you tell me everything please No no no she murmured with a little catch in her voice Please don t ask me I am afraid 
1963_147036_000052_000003	train-clean-100	Oh I am afraid 
none	none	He crushed her in his arms his cheek against hers his lips tingling with the caress of her hair But there is nothing to be afraid of nothing he said eagerly If you were as guilty as hell I would save you If you are shielding somebody I would shield them because I love you Odette No no she cried and pushed him back both her little hands pressing against his chest Don t ask me don t ask me Ask me Tarling swung round There was a man standing in the doorway in the act of closing the door behind him Milburgh he said between his teeth Milburgh smiled the other mockingly I am sorry to interrupt this beautiful scene but the occasion is a desperate one and I cannot afford to stand on ceremony mister Tarling Tarling put the girl from him and looked at the smirking manager One comprehensive glance the detective gave him noted the cycling clips and the splashes of mud on his trousers and understood So you were the cyclist eh he said That s right said Milburgh it is an exercise to which I am very partial What do you want asked Tarling alert and watchful I want you to carry out your promise mister Tarling said Milburgh smoothly Tarling stared at him
1963_147036_000066_000000	train-clean-100	 My promise he said what promise 
none	none	To protect not only the evil doer but those who have compromised themselves in an effort to shield the evil doer from his or her own wicked act Tarling started
1963_147036_000069_000000	train-clean-100	 Do you mean to say he said hoarsely 
none	none	Do you mean to accuse I accuse nobody said Milburgh with a wide sweep of his hands I merely suggest that both Miss Rider and myself are in very serious trouble and that you have it in your power to get us safely out of this country to one where extradition laws cannot follow Tarling took one step towards him and Milburgh shrank back Do you accuse Miss Rider of complicity in this murder he demanded Milburgh smiled but it was an uneasy smile I make no accusation he said and as to the murder he shrugged his shoulders You will understand better when you read the contents of that wallet which I was endeavouring to remove to a place of safety 
1963_147036_000075_000000	train-clean-100	Tarling picked up the wallet from the table and looked at it 
none	none	I shall see the contents of this wallet to morrow he said Locks will present very little difficulty You can read the contents to night said Milburgh smoothly and pulled from his pocket a chain at the end of which dangled a small bunch of keys Here is the key he said
1963_147036_000077_000002	train-clean-100	 Unlock and read to night 
none	none	Tarling took the key in his hand inserted it in first one tiny lock and then in the other The catches snapped open and he threw back the flap Then a hand snatched the portfolio from him and he turned to see the girl s quivering face and read the terror in her eyes No no she cried almost beside herself no for God s sake no Tarling stepped back He saw the malicious little smile on Milburgh s face and could have struck him down Miss Rider does not wish me to see what is in this case he said And for an excellent reason sneered Milburgh Here 
1963_147036_000084_000000	train-clean-100	It was the girl s voice surprisingly clear and steady 
none	none	Her shaking hands held the paper she had taken from the wallet and she thrust it toward the detective There is a reason she said in a low voice But it is not the reason you suggest 
1963_147036_000086_000000	train-clean-100	Milburgh had gone too far 
none	none	Tarling saw his face lengthen and the look of apprehension in his cold blue eyes Then without further hesitation he opened the paper and read The first line took away his breath THE CONFESSION OF ODETTE RIDER Good God he muttered and read on There were only half a dozen lines and they were in the firm caligraphy of the girl I Odette Rider hereby confess that for three years I have been robbing the firm of Lyne s Stores Limited and during that period have taken the sum of Ltwenty five thousand Tarling dropped the paper and caught the girl as she fainted CHAPTER XXV MILBURGH S LAST BLUFF Milburgh had gone too far He had hoped to carry through this scene without the actual disclosure of the confession In his shrewd clever way he had realised before Tarling himself that the detective from Shanghai this heir to the Lyne millions had fallen under the spell of the girl s beauty and all his conjectures had been confirmed by the scene he had witnessed no less than by the conversation he had overheard before the door was opened He was seeking immunity and safety The man was in a panic though this Tarling did not realise and was making his last desperate throw for the life that he loved that life of ease and comfort to secure which he had risked so much Milburgh had lived in terror that Odette Rider would betray him and because of his panicky fear that she had told all to the detective that night he brought her back to London from Ashford he had dared attempt to silence the man whom he believed was the recipient of the girl s confidence Those shots in the foggy night which had nearly ended the career of Jack Tarling had their explanation in Milburgh s terror of exposure One person in the world one living person could place him in the felon s dock and if she betrayed him Tarling had carried the girl to a couch and had laid her down He went quickly into his bedroom switching on the light to get a glass of water It was Milburgh s opportunity A little fire was burning in the sitting room Swiftly he picked the confession from the floor and thrust it into his pocket On a little table stood a writing cabinet From this he took a sheet of the hotel paper crumpled it up and thrust it into the fire It was blazing when Tarling returned What are you doing he asked halting by the side of the couch I am burning the young lady s confession said Milburgh calmly I do not think it is desirable in the interests Wait said Tarling calmly He lowered the girl s head and sprinkled some of the water on her face and she opened her eyes with a little shudder Tarling left her for a second and walked to the fire The paper was burnt save a scrap of the edge that had not caught and this he lifted gingerly looked at it for a moment then cast his eyes round the room He saw that the stationery cabinet had been disturbed and laughed It was neither a pleasant nor an amused laugh That s the idea eh he said walked to the door closed it and stood with his back to it Now Milburgh you can give me that confession you ve got in your pocket I ve burnt it mister Tarling You re a liar said Tarling calmly You knew very well I wouldn t let you go out of this room with that confession in your pocket and you tried to bluff me by burning a sheet of writing paper I want that confession I assure you began Milburgh I want that confession said Tarling and with a sickly smile Milburgh put his hand in his pocket and drew out the crumpled sheet Now if you are anxious to see it burn said Tarling you will have an opportunity He read the statement again and put it into the fire watched it until it was reduced to ashes then beat the ashes down with a poker That s that said Tarling cheerfully I suppose you know what you ve done said Milburgh You ve destroyed evidence which you as an officer of the law Cut that out replied Tarling shortly For the second time that night he unlocked the door and flung it wide open Milburgh you can go I know where I can find you when I want you he said You ll be sorry for this said Milburgh Not half as sorry as you ll be by the time I m through with you retorted Tarling I shall go straight to Scotland Yard fumed the man white with passion Do by all means said the detective coolly and be good enough to ask them to detain you until I come With this shot he closed the door upon the retreating man The girl was sitting now on the edge of the sofa her brave eyes surveying the man who loved her What have you done she asked I ve destroyed that precious confession of yours said Tarling cheerfully It occurred to me in the space of time it took to get from you to my wash stand that that confession may have been made under pressure I am right aren t I She nodded Now you wait there a little while I make myself presentable and I ll take you home Take me home said the startled girl Not to mother no no She mustn t ever know On the contrary she must know I don t know what it is she mustn t know said Tarling with a little smile but there has been a great deal too much mystery already and it is not going to continue She rose and walked to the fireplace her elbows on the mantelpiece and her head back I ll tell you all I can Perhaps you re right she said There has been too much mystery You asked me once who was Milburgh She turned and half faced him I won t ask you that question any more he said quietly I know You know Yes Milburgh is your mother s second husband Her eyes opened How did you find out that I guessed that he smiled and she keeps her name Rider at Milburgh s request He asked her not to reveal the fact that she was married again Isn t that so She nodded Mother met him about seven years ago We were at Harrogate at the time You see mother had a little money and I think mister Milburgh thought it was much more than it actually was He was a very agreeable man and told mother that he had a big business in the city Mother believes that he is very well off Tarling whistled I see he said Milburgh has been robbing his employers and spending the money on your mother She shook her head That is partly true and partly untrue she said Mother has been an innocent participant He bought this house at Hertford and furnished it lavishly he kept two cars until a year ago when I made him give them up and live more simply You don t know what these years have meant mister Tarling since I discovered how deeply mother would be dragged down by the exposure of his villainy How did you find it out It was soon after the marriage said the girl I went into Lyne s Store one day and one of the employees was rude to me I shouldn t have taken much notice but an officious shop walker dismissed the girl on the spot and when I pleaded for her reinstatement he insisted that I should see the manager I was ushered into a private office and there I saw mister Milburgh and realised the kind of double life he was living He made me keep his secret painted a dreadful picture of what would happen and said he could put everything right if I would come into the business and help him He told me he had large investments which were bringing in big sums and that he would apply this money to making good his defalcations That was why I went into Lyne s Store but he broke his word from the very beginning Why did he put you there asked Tarling Because if there had been another person said the girl he might have been detected He knew that any inquiries into irregularities of accounts would come first to my department and he wanted to have somebody there who would let him know He did not betray this thought said the girl but I guessed that that was the idea at the back of his mind She went on to tell him something of the life she had lived the humiliation she suffered in her knowledge of the despicable part she was playing From the first I was an accessory she said It is true that I did not steal but my reason for accepting the post was in order to enable him as I thought to right a grievous wrong and to save my mother from the shame and misery which would follow the exposure of Milburgh s real character She looked at him with a sad little smile I hardly realise that I am speaking to a detective she said and all that I have suffered during these past years has been in vain but the truth must come now whatever be the consequences She paused And now I am going to tell you what happened on the night of the murder CHAPTER XXVI IN missus RIDER S ROOM There was a deep silence Tarling could feel his heart thumping almost noisily After I had left Lyne s Store she said I had decided to go to mother to spend two or three days with her before I began looking for work mister Milburgh only went to Hertford for the weekends and I couldn t stay in the same house with him knowing all that I knew I left my flat at about half past six that evening but I am not quite sure of the exact time It must have been somewhere near then because I was going to catch the seven o clock train to Hertford I arrived at the station and had taken my ticket and was stooping to pick up my bag when I felt a hand on my arm and turning saw mister Milburgh He was in a state of great agitation and distress and asked me to take a later train and accompany him to the Florentine Restaurant where he had taken a private room He told me he had very bad news and that I must know I put my bag in the cloak room and went off with him and over the dinner I only had a cup of tea as a matter of fact he told me that he was on the verge of ruin He said that mister Lyne had sent for a detective which was you and had the intention of exposing him only mister Lyne s rage against me was so great that for the moment he was diverted from his purpose Only you can save me said Milburgh I I said in astonishment how can I save you Take the responsibility for the theft upon yourself he said Your mother is involved in this heavily Does she know He nodded I found afterwards that he was lying to me and was preying upon my love for mother I was dazed and horrified said the girl at the thought that poor dear mother might be involved in this horrible scandal and when he suggested that I should write a confession at his dictation and should leave by the first train for the Continent until the matter blew over I fell in with his scheme without protest and that is all Why did you come to Hertford to night asked Tarling Again she smiled To get the confession she said simply I knew Milburgh would keep it in the safe I saw him when I left the hotel he had telephoned to me and made the appointment at the shop where I slipped the detectives and it was there that he told me she stopped suddenly and went red He told you I was fond of you said Tarling quietly and she nodded He threatened to take advantage of that fact and wanted to show you the confession I see said Tarling and heaved a deep sigh of relief Thank God he said fervently For what she asked looking at him in astonishment That everything is clear To morrow I will arrest the murderer of Thornton Lyne No no not that she said and laid her hand on his shoulder her distressed face looking into his surely not that mister Milburgh could not have done it he could not be so great a scoundrel Who sent the wire to your mother saying you were not coming down Milburgh replied the girl Did he send two wires do you remember said Tarling She hesitated Yes he did she said I don t know who the other was to It was the same writing anyway he said But Dear he said you must not worry any more about it There is a trying time ahead of you but you must be brave both for your own sake and for your mother s and for mine he added Despite her unhappiness she smiled faintly You take something for granted don t you she asked Am I doing that he said in surprise You mean she went redder than ever that I care enough for you that I would make an effort for your sake I suppose I do said Tarling slowly it s vanity I suppose Perhaps it is instinct she said and squeezed his arm I must take you back to your mother s place he said The walk from the house to the station had been a long and tedious one The way back was surprisingly short even though they walked at snail s pace There never was a courting such as Tarling s and it seemed unreal as a dream The girl had a key of the outer gate and they passed through together Does your mother know that you are in Hertford asked Tarling suddenly Yes replied the girl I saw her before I came after you Does she know He did not care to finish the sentence No said the girl she does not know Poor woman it will break her heart She is very fond of Milburgh Sometimes he is most kind to mother She loves him so much that she accepted his mysterious comings and goings and all the explanations which he offered without suspicion They had reached the place where he had picked up the wallet and above him gloomed the dark bulk of the portico with its glass house atop The house was in darkness no lights shone anywhere I will take you in through the door under the portico It is the way mister Milburgh always comes Have you a light He had his electric lamp in his pocket and he put a beam upon the key hole She inserted the key and uttered a note of exclamation for the door yielded under her pressure and opened It is unlocked she said I am sure I fastened it Tarling put his lamp upon the lock and made a little grimace The catch had been wedged back into the lock so that it could not spring out again How long were you in the house he asked quickly Only a few minutes said the girl I went in just to tell mother and I came out immediately Did you close the door behind you when you went in The girl thought a moment Perhaps I didn t she said No of course not I didn t come back this way mother let me out by the front door Tarling put his light into the hall and saw the carpeted stairs half a dozen feet away He guessed what had happened Somebody had seen the door ajar and guessing from the fact that she had left it open that she was returning immediately had slipped a piece of wood which looked to be and was in fact the stalk of a match between the catch of the spring lock and its sheath What has happened asked the girl in a troubled voice Nothing said Tarling airily It was probably your disreputable step father did this He may have lost his key He could have gone in the front door said the girl uneasily Well I ll go first said Tarling with a cheerfulness which he was far from feeling He went upstairs his lamp in one hand an automatic pistol in the other The stairs ended in a balustraded landing from which two doors opened That is mother s room said the girl pointing to the nearest A sense of impending trouble made her shiver Tarling put his arms about her encouragingly He walked to the door of the room turned the handle and opened it There was something behind the door which held it close and exerting all his strength he pushed the door open sufficiently far to allow of his squeezing through On the desk a table lamp was burning the light of which was hidden from the outside by the heavily curtained windows but it was neither at the window nor at the desk that he was looking missus Rider lay behind the door a little smile on her face the haft of a dagger standing out with hideous distinctness beneath her heart CHAPTER XXVII THE LAUGH IN THE NIGHT Tarling gave one glance before he turned to the girl who was endeavouring to push past him and catching her by the arm gently thrust her back into the passage What is wrong What is wrong she asked in a terrified whisper Oh let me go to mother She struggled to escape from his grip but he held her firmly You must be brave for your own sake for everybody s sake he entreated her Still holding her arm he forced her to the door of the second inner room His hand felt for the electric switch and found it He was in what appeared to be a spare bedroom plainly furnished and from this a door led apparently into the main building Where does that door lead he asked but she did not appear to hear him Mother mother she was moaning what has happened to my mother Where does that door lead he asked again and for answer she slipped her trembling hand into her pocket and produced a key He opened the door and found himself in a rectangular gallery overlooking the hall She slipped past him but he caught her and pushed her back I tell you you must be calm Odette he said firmly you must not give way Everything depends upon your courage Where are the servants Then unexpectedly she broke away from him and raced back through the door into the wing they had left He followed in swift pursuit For God s sake Odette don t don t he cried as she flung herself against the door and burst into her mother s room One glance she gave then she fell on the floor by the side of her dead mother and flinging her arms about the form kissed the cold lips Tarling pulled her gently away and half carried half supported her back to the gallery A dishevelled man in shirt and trousers whom Tarling thought might be the butler was hurrying along the corridor Arouse any women who are in the house said Tarling in a low voice missus Rider has been murdered Murdered sir said the startled man You don t mean that Quick said Tarling sharply Miss Rider has fainted again They carried her into the drawing room and laid her on the couch and Tarling did not leave her until he had seen her in the hands of two women servants He went back with the butler to the room where the body lay He turned on all the lights and made a careful scrutiny of the room The window leading on to the glass covered balcony where he had been concealed a few hours before was latched locked and bolted The curtains which had been drawn presumably by Milburgh when he came for the wallet were undisturbed From the position in which the dead woman lay and the calm on her face he thought death must have come instantly and unexpectedly Probably the murderer stole behind her whilst she was standing at the foot of the sofa which he had partly seen through the window It was likely that to beguile the time of waiting for her daughter s return she had taken a book from a little cabinet immediately behind the door and support for this theory came in the shape of a book which had evidently fallen out of her hand between the position in which she was found and the book case Together the two men lifted the body on to the sofa You had better go down into the town and inform the police said Tarling Is there a telephone here Yes sir replied the butler Good that will save you a journey said the detective He notified the local police officials and then got on to Scotland Yard and sent a messenger to arouse Whiteside The faint pallor of dawn was in the sky when he looked out of the window but the pale light merely served to emphasise the pitch darkness of the world He examined the knife which had the appearance of being a very ordinary butcher s knife There were some faint initials burnt upon the hilt but these had been so worn by constant handling that there was only the faintest trace of what they had originally been He could see an M and two other letters that looked like C and A M C A He puzzled his brain to interpret the initials Presently the butler came back The young lady is in a terrible state sir and I have sent for doctor Thomas Tarling nodded You have done very wisely he said Poor girl she has had a terrible shock Again he went to the telephone and this time he got into connection with a nursing home in London and arranged for an ambulance to pick up the girl without further delay When he had telephoned to Scotland Yard he had asked as an after thought that a messenger should be sent to Ling Chu instructing him to come without delay He had the greatest faith in the Chinaman particularly in a case like this where the trail was fresh for Ling Chu was possessed of super human gifts which only the blood hound could rival Nobody must go upstairs he instructed the butler When the doctor and the coroner s officer come they must be admitted by the principal entrance and if I am not here you must understand that under no circumstances are those stairs leading to the portico to be used He himself went out of the main entrance to make a tour of the grounds He had little hope that that search would lead to anything Clues there might be in plenty when the daylight revealed them but the likelihood of the murderer remaining in the vicinity of the scene of his crime was a remote one The grounds were extensive and well wooded Numerous winding paths met and forked aimlessly radiating out from the broad gravel paths about the house to the high walls which encircled the little estate In one corner of the grounds was a fairly large patch innocent of bush and offering no cover at all He made a casual survey of this sweeping his light across the ordered rows of growing vegetables and was going away when he saw a black bulk which had the appearance even in the darkness of a gardener s house He swept this possible cover with his lamp Was his imagination playing him a trick or had he caught the briefest glimpse of a white face peering round the corner He put on his light again There was nothing visible He walked to the building and round it There was nobody in sight He thought he saw a dark form under the shadow of the building moving towards the belt of pines which surrounded the house on the three sides He put on his lamp again but the light was not powerful enough to carry the distance required and he went forward at a jog trot in the direction he had seen the figure disappear He reached the pines and went softly Every now and again he stopped and once he could have sworn he heard the cracking of a twig ahead of him He started off at a run in pursuit and now there was no mistaking the fact that somebody was still in the wood He heard the quick steps of his quarry and then there was silence He ran on but must have overshot the mark for presently he heard a stealthy noise behind him In a flash he turned back Who are you he said Stand out or I ll fire 
2010_147045_000023_000000	train-clean-360	There was no answer 
none	none	and he waited He heard the scraping of a boot against the brick work and he knew that the intruder was climbing the wall He turned in the direction of the sound but again found nothing Then from somewhere above him came such a trill of demoniacal laughter as chilled his blood The top of the wall was concealed by the overhanging branch of a tree and his light was valueless Come down he shouted I ve got you covered Again came that terrible laugh half fear half derision and a voice shrill and harsh came down to him Murderer Murderer You killed Thornton Lyne damn you I ve kept this for you take it Something came crashing through the trees something small and round a splashing drop as of water fell on the back of Tarling s hand and he shook it off with a cry for it burnt like fire He heard the mysterious stranger drop from the coping of the wall and the sound of his swift feet He stooped and picked up the article which had been thrown at him It was a small bottle bearing a stained chemist s label and the word Vitriol CHAPTER XXVIII THE THUMB PRINT It was ten o clock in the morning and Whiteside and Tarling were sitting on a sofa in their shirt sleeves sipping their coffee Tarling was haggard and weary in contrast to the dapper inspector of police Though the latter had been aroused from his bed in the early hours of the morning he at least had enjoyed a good night s sleep They sat in the room in which missus Rider had been murdered and the rusty brown stains on the floor where Tarling had found her were eloquent of the tragedy They sat sipping their coffee neither man talking and they maintained this silence for several minutes each man following his own train of thought Tarling for reasons of his own had not revealed his own adventure and he had told the other nothing of the mysterious individual who he was he pretty well guessed whom he had chased through the grounds Presently Whiteside lit a cigarette and threw the match in the grate and Tarling roused himself from his reverie with a jerk What do you make of it he asked Whiteside shook his head If there had been property taken it would have had a simple explanation But nothing has gone Poor girl Tarling nodded Terrible he said The doctor had to drug her before he could get her to go Where is she asked Whiteside I sent her on an ambulance to a nursing home in London said Tarling shortly This is awful Whiteside It s pretty bad said the detective inspector scratching his chin The young lady could supply no information Nothing absolutely nothing She had gone up to see her mother and had left the door ajar intending to return by the same way after she had interviewed missus Rider As a matter of fact she was let out by the front door Somebody was watching and apparently thought that she was coming out by the way she went in waited for a time and then as she did not reappear followed her into the building And that somebody was Milburgh said Whiteside Tarling made no reply He had his own views and for the moment was not prepared to argue It was obviously Milburgh said Whiteside He comes to you in the night we know that he is in Hertford We know too that he tried to assassinate you because he thought the girl had betrayed him and you had unearthed his secret He must have killed his wife who probably knows much more about the murder than the daughter Tarling looked at his watch Ling Chu should be here by now he said Oh you sent for Ling Chu did you said Whiteside in surprise I thought that you d given up that idea I phoned again a couple of hours ago said Tarling H m said Whiteside Do you think that he knows anything about this Tarling shook his head I believe the story he told me Of course when I made the report to Scotland Yard I did not expect that you people would be as credulous as I am but I know the man He has never lied to me Murder is a pretty serious business said Whiteside If a man didn t lie to save his neck he wouldn t lie at all There was the sound of a motor below and Tarling walked to the window Here is Ling Chu he said and a few minutes later the Chinaman came noiselessly into the room Tarling greeted him with a curt nod and without any preliminary told the story of the crime He spoke in English he had not employed Chinese since he discovered that Ling Chu understood English quite as well as he understood Cantonese and Whiteside was able from time to time to interject a word or correct some little slip on Tarling s part The Chinaman listened without comment and when Tarling had finished he made one of his queer jerky bows and went out of the room Here are the letters said Whiteside after the man had gone Two neat piles of letters were arranged on missus Rider s desk and Tarling drew up a chair This is the lot he said Yes said Whiteside I ve been searching the house since eight o clock and I can find no others Those on the right are all from Milburgh You ll find they re simply signed with an initial a characteristic of his but they bear his town address You ve looked through them asked Tarling Read em all replied the other There s nothing at all incriminating in any of them They re what I would call bread and butter letters dealing with little investments which Milburgh has made in his wife s name or rather in the name of missus Rider It s easy to see from these how deeply the poor woman was involved without her knowing that she was mixing herself up in a great conspiracy Tarling assented One by one he took the letters from their envelopes read them and replaced them He was half way through the pile when he stopped and carried a letter to the window Listen to this he said Forgive the smudge but I am in an awful hurry and I have got my fingers inky through the overturning of an ink bottle Nothing startling in that said Whiteside with a smile Nothing at all admitted Tarling But it happens that our friend has left a very good and useful thumb print At least it looks too big for a finger print Let me see it said Whiteside springing up He went to the other s side and looked over his shoulder at the letter in his hand and whistled He turned a glowing face upon Tarling and gripped his chief by the shoulder We ve got him he said exultantly We ve got him as surely as if we had him in the pen What do you mean asked Tarling I ll swear to that thumb print replied Whiteside It s identical with the blood mark which was left on Miss Rider s bureau on the night of the murder Are you sure Absolutely said Whiteside speaking quickly Do you see that whorl Look at those lineations They re the same I have the original photograph in my pocket somewhere He searched his pocket book and brought out a photograph of a thumb print considerably enlarged Compare them cried Whiteside in triumph Line for line ridge for ridge and furrow for furrow it is Milburgh s thumb print and Milburgh is my man He took up his coat and slipped it on Where are you going Back to London said Whiteside grimly to secure a warrant for the arrest of George Milburgh the man who killed Thornton Lyne the man who murdered his wife the blackest villain at large in the world to day CHAPTER XXIX THE THEORY OF LING CHU Upon this scene came Ling Chu imperturbable expressionless bringing with him his own atmosphere of mystery Well said Tarling what have you discovered and even Whiteside checked his enthusiasm to listen Two people came up the stairs last night said Ling Chu also the master He looked at Tarling and the latter nodded Your feet are clear he said also the feet of the small piece woman also the naked feet The naked feet said Tarling and Ling Chu assented What was the naked foot man or woman asked Whiteside It may have been man or woman replied the Chinaman but the feet were cut and were bleeding There is mark of blood on the gravel outside Nonsense said Whiteside sharply Let him go on warned Tarling A woman came in and went out continued Ling Chu That was Miss Rider said Tarling Then a woman and a man came then the bare footed one came because the blood is over the first women s footmarks How do you know which was the first woman and which was the second asked Whiteside interested in spite of himself The first woman s foot was wet said Ling Chu But there had been no rain said the detective in triumph She was standing on the grass said Ling Chu and Tarling nodded his head remembering that the girl had stood on the grass in the shadow of the bushes watching his adventure with Milburgh But there is one thing I do not understand master said Ling Chu There is the mark of another woman s foot which I cannot find on the stair in the hall This woman walked all round the house I think she walked round twice and then she walked into the garden and through the trees Tarling stared at him Miss Rider came straight from the house on to the road he said and into Hertford after me There is the mark of a woman who has walked round the house insisted Ling Chu and therefore I think it was a woman whose feet were bare Are there any marks of a man beside us three I was coming to that said Ling Chu There is a very faint trace of a man who came early because the wet footsteps are over his also he left but there is no sign of him on the gravel only the mark of a wheel track That was Milburgh said Tarling If a foot has not touched the ground explained Ling Chu it would leave little trace That is why the woman s foot about the house is so hard for me for I cannot find it on the stair Yet I know it came from the house because I can see it leading from the door Come master I will show you He led the way down the stairs into the garden and then for the first time Whiteside noticed that the Chinaman was bare footed You haven t mixed your own footmarks up with somebody else s he asked jocularly Ling Chu shook his head I left my shoes outside the door because it is easier for me to work so he said calmly slipping his feet into his small shoes He led the way to the side of the house and there pointed out the footprints They were unmistakably feminine Where the heel was was a deep crescent shaped hole which recurred at intervals all round the house Curiously enough they were to be found in front of almost every window as though the mysterious visitor had walked over the garden border as if seeking to find an entrance They look more like slippers than shoes to me They re undoubtedly a woman s said Whiteside examining one of the impressions What do you think Tarling Tarling nodded and led the way back to the room What is your theory Ling Chu he asked Somebody came into the house said the Chinaman squeezed through the door below and up the stairs First that somebody killed and then went to search the house but could not get through the door That s right said Whiteside You mean the door that shuts off this little wing from the rest of the house That was locked was it not Tarling when you made the discovery Yes said Tarling it was locked When they found they could not get into the house Ling Chu went on they tried to get through one of the windows They they said Tarling impatiently Who are they Do you mean the woman The new theory was disturbing He had pierced the second actor in the tragedy a brown vitriol burn on the back of his hand reminded him of his existence but who was the third I mean the woman replied Ling Chu quietly But who in God s name wanted to get into the house after murdering missus Rider asked Whiteside irritably Your theory is against all reason Ling Chu When a person has committed a murder they want to put as much distance between themselves and the scene of the crime as they can in the shortest possible space of time Ling Chu did not reply How many people are concerned in this murder said Tarling A bare footed man or woman came in and killed missus Rider a second person made the round of the house trying to get in through one of the windows Whether it was one person or two I cannot tell replied Ling Chu Tarling made a further inspection of the little wing It was as Ling Chu had said and as he had explained to the Chinaman cut off from the rest of the house and had evidently been arranged to give mister Milburgh the necessary privacy upon his visits to Hertford The wing consisted of three rooms a bedroom leading from the sitting room evidently used by missus Rider for her clothes were hanging in the wardrobe the sitting room in which the murder was committed and the spare room through which he had passed with Odette to the gallery over the hall It was through the door in this room that admission was secured to the house There s nothing to be done but to leave the local police in charge and get back to London said Tarling when the inspection was concluded And arrest Milburgh suggested Whiteside Do you accept Ling Chu s theory Tarling shook his head I am loath to reject it he said because he is the most amazingly clever tracker He can trace footmarks which are absolutely invisible to the eye and he has a bushman s instinct which in the old days in China led to some extraordinary results They returned to town by car Ling Chu riding beside the chauffeur smoking an interminable chain of cigarettes Tarling spoke very little during the journey his mind being fully occupied with the latest development of a mystery the solution of which still evaded him The route through London to Scotland Yard carried him through Cavendish Place where the nursing home was situated in which Odette Rider lay He stopped the car to make inquiries and found that the girl had recovered from the frenzy of grief into which the terrible discovery of the morning had thrown her and had fallen into a quiet sleep That s good news anyway he said rejoining his companion I was half beside myself with anxiety You take a tremendous interest in Miss Rider don t you asked Whiteside dryly Tarling brindled then laughed Oh yes I take an interest he admitted but it is very natural Why natural asked Whiteside Because replied Tarling deliberately Miss Rider is going to be my wife Oh said Whiteside in blank amazement and had nothing more to say The warrant for Milburgh s arrest was waiting for them and placed in the hands of Whiteside for execution We ll give him no time said the officer I m afraid he s had a little too much grace and we shall be very lucky if we find him at home As he had suspected the house in Camden Town was empty and the woman who came daily to do the cleaning of the house was waiting patiently by the iron gate mister Milburgh she told them usually admitted her at half past eight Even if he was in the country he was back at the house before her arrival Whiteside fitted a skeleton key into the lock of the gate opened it the charwoman protesting in the interests of her employer and went up the flagged path The door of the cottage was a more difficult proposition being fitted with a patent lock Tarling did not stand on ceremony but smashed one of the windows and grinned as he did so Listen to that The shrill tinkle of a bell came to their ears Burglar alarm said Tarling laconically and pushed back the catch threw up the window and stepped into the little room where he had interviewed mister Milburgh The house was empty They went from room to room searching the bureaux and cupboards In one of these Tarling made a discovery It was no more than a few glittering specks which he swept from a shelf into the palm of his hand If that isn t thermite I m a Dutchman he said At any rate we ll be able to convict mister Milburgh of arson if we can t get him for murder We ll send this to the Government analyst right away Whiteside If Milburgh did not kill Thornton Lyne he certainly burnt down the premises of Dashwood and Solomon to destroy the evidence of his theft It was Whiteside who made the second discovery mister Milburgh slept on a large wooden four poster He s a luxurious devil said Whiteside Look at the thickness of those box springs He tapped the side of that piece of furniture and looked round with a startled expression A bit solid for a box spring isn t it he asked and continued his investigation tearing down the bed valance Presently he was rewarded by finding a small eyelet hole in the side of the mattress He took out his knife opened the pipe cleaner and pressed the narrow blade into the aperture There was a click and two doors ludicrously like the doors which deaden the volume of gramophone music flew open Whiteside put in his hand and pulled something out Books he said disappointedly Then brightening up They are diaries I wonder if the beggar kept a diary He piled the little volumes on the bed and Tarling took one and turned the leaves Thornton Lyne s diary he said This may be useful One of the volumes was locked It was the newest of the books and evidently an attempt had been made to force the lock for the hasp was badly wrenched mister Milburgh had in fact made such an attempt but as he was engaged in a systematic study of the diaries from the beginning he had eventually put aside the last volume after an unsuccessful effort to break the fastening Is there nothing else asked Tarling Nothing said the disappointed inspector looking into the interior There may be other little cupboards of this kind he added But a long search revealed no further hiding place Nothing more is to be done here said Tarling Keep one of your men in the house in case Milburgh turns up Personally I doubt very much whether he will put in an appearance Do you think the girl has frightened him I think it is extremely likely said Tarling I will make an inquiry at the Stores but I don t suppose he will be there either This surmise proved to be correct Nobody at Lyne s Store had seen the manager or received word as to his whereabouts Milburgh had disappeared as though the ground had opened and swallowed him No time was lost by Scotland Yard in communicating particulars of the wanted man to every police station in England Within twenty four hours his description and photograph were in the hands of every chief constable and if he had not succeeded in leaving the country which was unlikely during the time between the issue of the warrant and his leaving Tarling s room in Hertford his arrest was inevitable At five o clock that afternoon came a new clue A pair of ladies shoes mud stained and worn had been discovered in a ditch on the Hertford road four miles from the house where the latest murder had been committed This news came by telephone from the Chief of the Hertford Constabulary with the further information that the shoes had been despatched to Scotland Yard by special messenger It was half past seven when the little parcel was deposited on Tarling s table He stripped the package of its paper opened the lid of the cardboard box and took out a distorted looking slipper which had seen better days A woman s undoubtedly he said Do you note the crescent shaped heel Look said Whiteside pointing to some stains on the whitey brown inner sock That supports Ling Chu s theory The feet of the person who wore these were bleeding Tailing examined the slippers and nodded He turned up the tongue in search of the maker s name and the shoe dropped from his hand What s on earth the matter asked Whiteside and picked it up He looked and laughed helplessly for on the inside of the tongue was a tiny label bearing the name of a London shoemaker and beneath written in ink Miss O Rider CHAPTER XXX WHO KILLED missus RIDER The matron of the nursing home received Tarling Odette she said had regained her normal calm but would require a few days rest She suggested she should be sent to the country I hope you re not going to ask her a lot of questions mister Tarling said the matron because she really isn t fit to stand any further strain There s only one question I m going to ask said Tarling grimly He found the girl in a prettily furnished room and she held out her hand to him in greeting He stooped and kissed her and without further ado produced the shoe from his pocket Odette dear he said gently is this yours She looked at it and nodded Why yes where did you find it Are you sure it is yours I m perfectly certain it s mine she smiled It s an old slipper I used to wear Why do you ask Where did you see it last The girl closed her eyes and shivered In mother s room she said Oh mother mother She turned her head to the cushion of the chair and wept and Tarling soothed her It was some time before she was calm but then she could give no further information It was a shoe that mother liked because it fitted her We both took the same size Her voice broke again and Tarling hastened to change the conversation More and more he was becoming converted to Ling Chu s theory He could not apply to that theory the facts which had come into his possession On his way back from the nursing home to police headquarters he reviewed the Hertford crime Somebody had come into the house bare footed with bleeding feet and having committed the murder had looked about for shoes The old slippers had been the only kind which the murderer could wear and he or she had put them on and had gone out again after making the circuit of the house Why had this mysterious person tried to get into the house again and for whom or what were they searching If Ling Chu was correct obviously the murderer could not be Milburgh If he could believe the evidence of his senses the man with the small feet had been he who had shrieked defiance in the darkness and had hurled the vitriol at his feet He put his views before his subordinate and found Whiteside willing to agree with him But it does not follow said Whiteside that the bare footed person who was apparently in missus Rider s house committed the murder Milburgh did that right enough don t worry There is less doubt that he committed the Daffodil Murder Tarling swung round in his chair he was sitting on the opposite side of the big table that the two men used in common I think I know who committed the Daffodil Murder he said steadily I have been working things out and I have a theory which you would probably describe as fantastic What is it asked Whiteside but the other shook his head He was not for the moment prepared to reveal his theory Whiteside leaned back in his chair and for a moment cogitated The case from the very beginning is full of contradictions he said Thornton Lyne was a rich man by the way you re a rich man now Tarling and I must treat you with respect Tarling smiled Go on he said He had queer tastes a bad poet as is evidenced by his one slim volume of verse He was a poseur proof of which is to be found in his patronage of Sam Stay who by the way has escaped from the lunatic asylum I suppose you know that I know that said Tarling Go on Lyne falls in love with a pretty girl in his employ continued Whiteside Used to having his way when he lifted his finger all women that in earth do dwell must bow their necks to the yoke He is repulsed by the girl and in his humiliation immediately conceives for her a hatred beyond the understanding of any sane mortal So far your account doesn t challenge contradiction said Tarling with a little twinkle in his eye That is item number one continued Whiteside ticking the item off on his fingers Item number two is mister Milburgh an oleaginous gentleman who has been robbing the firm for years and has been living in style in the country on his ill earned gains From what he hears or knows he gathers that the jig is up He is in despair when he realises that Thornton Lyne is desperately in love with his step daughter What is more likely than that he should use his step daughter in order to influence Thornton Lyne to take the favourable view of his delinquencies Or what is more likely interrupted Tarling than that he would put the blame for the robberies upon the girl and trust to her paying a price to Thornton Lyne to escape punishment Right again I ll accept that possibility said Whiteside Milburgh s plan is to get a private interview under exceptionally favourable circumstances with Thornton Lyne He wires to that gentleman to meet him at Miss Rider s flat relying upon the magic of the name And Thornton Lyne comes in list slippers said Tarling sarcastically That doesn t wash Whiteside No it doesn t admitted the other But I m getting at the broad aspects of the case Lyne comes He is met by Milburgh who plays his trump card of confession and endeavours to switch the young man on to the solution which Milburgh had prepared Lyne refuses there is a row and is desperation Milburgh shoots Thornton Lyne Tarling shook his head He mused a while then It s queer he said The door opened and a police officer came in Here are the particulars you want he said and handed Whiteside a typewritten sheet of paper What is this said Whiteside when the man had gone Oh here is our old friend Sam Stay A police description He read on Height five foot four sallow complexion wearing a grey suit and underclothing bearing the markings of the County Asylum Hullo What is it said Tarling This is remarkable said Whiteside and read When the patient escaped he had bare feet He takes a very small size in shoes probably four or five A kitchen knife is missing and the patient may be armed Boot makers should be warned Bare feet Tarling rose from the table with a frown on his face Sam Stay hated Odette Rider The two men exchanged glances Now do you see who killed missus Rider asked Tarling She was killed by one who saw Odette Rider go into the house and did not see her come out who went in after her to avenge as he thought his dead patron He killed this unhappy woman the initials on the knife M C A stand for Middlesex County Asylum and he brought the knife with him and discovered his mistake then having searched for a pair of shoes to cover his bleeding feet and having failed to get into the house by any other way made a circuit of the building looking for Odette Rider and seeking an entrance at every window Whiteside looked at him in astonishment It s a pity you ve got money he said admiringly When you retire from this business there ll be a great detective lost CHAPTER XXXI SAM STAY TURNS UP I have seen you somewhere before ain t I The stout clergyman in the immaculate white collar beamed benevolently at the questioner and shook his head with a gentle smile No my dear friend I do not think I have ever seen you before It was a little man shabbily dressed and looking ill His face was drawn and lined he had not shaved for days and the thin black stubble of hair gave him a sinister look The clergyman had just walked out of Temple Gardens and was at the end of Villiers Street leading up to the Strand when he was accosted He was a happy looking clergyman and something of a student too if the stout and serious volume under his arm had any significance I ve seen you before said the little man I ve dreamt about you If you ll excuse me said the clergyman I am afraid I cannot stay I have an important engagement Hold hard said the little man in so fierce a tone that the other stopped I tell you I ve dreamt about you I ve seen you dancing with four black devils with no clothes on and you were all fat and ugly He lowered his voice and was speaking in a fierce earnest monotone as though he was reciting some lesson he had been taught The clergyman took a pace back in alarm Now my good man he said severely you ought not to stop gentlemen in the street and talk that kind of nonsense I have never met you before in my life My name is the Reverend Josiah Jennings Your name is Milburgh said the other Yes that s it Milburgh He used to talk about you That lovely man here He clutched the clergyman s sleeve and Milburgh s face went a shade paler There was a concentrated fury in the grip on his arm and a strange wildness in the man s speech Do you know where he is In a beautivault built like an ouse in Highgate Cemetery There s two little doors that open like the door of a church and you go down some steps to it Who are you asked Milburgh his teeth chattering Don t you know me The little man peered at him You ve heard him talk about me Sam Stay why I worked for two days in your Stores I did And you you ve only got what he s given you Every penny you earned he gave you did mister Lyne He was a friend to everybody to the poor even to a hook like me His eyes filled with tears and mister Milburgh looked round to see if he was being observed Now don t talk nonsense he said under his breath and listen my man if anybody asks you whether you have seen mister Milburgh you haven t you understand Oh I understand said the man But I knew you There s nobody connected with him that I don t remember He lifted me up out of the gutter he did He s my idea of God They had reached a quiet corner of the Gardens and Milburgh motioned the man to sit beside him on a garden seat For the first time that day he experienced a sense of confidence in the wisdom of his choice of disguise The sight of a clergyman speaking with a seedy looking man might excite comment but not suspicion After all it was the business of clergymen to talk to seedy looking men and they might be seen engaged in the most earnest and confidential conversation and he would suffer no loss of caste Sam Stay looked at the black coat and the white collar in doubt How long have you been a clergyman mister Milburgh he asked Oh er for a little while said mister Milburgh glibly trying to remember what he had heard about Sam Stay But the little man saved him the labour of remembering They took me away to a place in the country he said but you know I wasn t mad mister Milburgh He wouldn t have had a fellow hanging round him who was mad would he You re a clergyman eh He nodded his head wisely then asked with a sudden eagerness Did he make you a clergyman He could do wonderful things could mister Lyne couldn t he Did you preach over him when they buried him in that little vault in Ighgate I ve seen it I go there every day mister Milburgh said Sam I only found it by accident Also Thornton Lyne his son There s two little doors that open like church doors mister Milburgh drew a long sigh Of course he remembered now Sam Stay had been removed to a lunatic asylum and he was dimly conscious of the fact that the man had escaped It was not a pleasant experience talking with an escaped lunatic It might however be a profitable one mister Milburgh was a man who let very few opportunities slip What could he make out of this he wondered Again Sam Stay supplied the clue I m going to settle with that girl He stopped and closed his lips tightly and looked with a cunning little smile at Milburgh I didn t say anything did I he asked with a queer little chuckle I didn t say anything that would give me away did I No my friend said mister Milburgh still in the character of the benevolent pastor To what girl do you refer The face of Sam Stay twisted into a malignant smile There s only one girl he said between his teeth and I ll get her I ll settle with her I ve got something here he felt in his pocket in a vague aimless way I thought I had it I ve carried it about so long but I ve got it somewhere I know I have So you hate Miss Rider do you asked Milburgh Hate her The little fellow almost shouted the words his face purple his eyes starting from his head his two hands twisted convulsively I thought I d finished her last night he began and stopped The words had no significance for mister Milburgh since he had seen no newspapers that day Listen Sam went on Have you ever loved anybody mister Milburgh was silent To him Odette Rider was nothing but about the woman Odette Rider had called mother and the woman he called wife circled the one precious sentiment in his life Yes I think I have he said after a pause Why Well you know how I feel don t you said Sam Stay huskily You know how I want to get the better of this party who brought him down She lured him on lured him on oh my God He buried his face in his hands and swayed from side to side mister Milburgh looked round in some apprehension No one was in sight Odette would be the principal witness against him and this man hated her He had small cause for loving her She was the one witness that the Crown could produce now that he had destroyed the documentary evidence of his crime What case would they have against him if they stood him in the dock at the Old Bailey if Odette Rider were not forthcoming to testify against him He thought the matter over cold bloodedly as a merchant might consider some commercial proposition which is put before him He had learnt that Odette Rider was in London in a nursing home as the result of a set of curious circumstances He had called up Lyne s Store that morning on the telephone to discover whether there had been any inquiries for him and had heard from his chief assistant that a number of articles of clothing had been ordered to be sent to this address for Miss Rider s use He had wondered what had caused her collapse and concluded that it was the result of the strain to which the girl had been subjected in that remarkable interview which she and he had had with Tarling at Hertford on the night before Suppose you met Miss Rider he said What could you do Sam Stay showed his teeth in a grin Well anyway you re not likely to meet her for some time She is in a nursing home said Milburgh and the nursing home he went on deliberately is at three hundred four Cavendish Place three hundred four Cavendish Place repeated Sam That s near Regent Street isn t it I don t know where it is said mister Milburgh She is at three hundred four Cavendish Place so that it is very unlikely that you will meet her for some time He rose to his feet and he saw the man was shaking from head to foot like a man in the grip of ague three hundred four Cavendish Place he repeated and without another word turned his back on mister Milburgh and slunk away That worthy gentleman looked after him and shook his head and then rising turned and walked in the other direction It was just as easy to take a ticket for the Continent at Waterloo station as it was at Charing Cross In many ways it was safer CHAPTER XXXII THE DIARY OF THORNTON LYNE Tarling should have been sleeping Every bone and sinew in him ached for rest His head was sunk over a table in his flat Lyne s diaries stood in two piles on the table the bigger pile that which he had read the lesser being those which Tarling had yet to examine The diaries had been blank books containing no printed date lines In some cases one book would cover a period of two or three years in other cases three or four books would be taken up by the record of a few months The pile on the left grew and the pile on the right became smaller until there was only one book a diary newer than the others which had been fastened by two brass locks but had been opened by the Scotland Yard experts Tarling took up this volume and turned the leaves As he had expected it was the current diary that on which Thornton Lyne had been engaged at the time of his murder Tarling opened the book in a spirit of disappointment The earlier books had yielded nothing save a revelation of the writer s egotism He had read Lyne s account of the happenings in Shanghai but after all that was nothing fresh and added little to the sum of the detective s knowledge He did not anticipate that the last volume would yield any more promising return for his study Nevertheless he read it carefully and presently drawing a writing pad toward him he began to note down excerpts from the diary There was the story told in temperate language and with surprising mildness of Odette Rider s rejection of Thornton Lyne s advances It was a curiously uninteresting record until he came to a date following the release of Sam Stay from gaol and here Thornton Lyne enlarged upon the subject of his humiliation Stay is out of prison the entry ran It is pathetic to see how this man adores me I almost wish sometimes that I could keep him out of gaol but if I did so and converted him into a dull respectable person I should miss these delicious experiences which his worship affords It is good to bask in the bright sunlight of his adoration I talked to him of Odette A strange matter to discuss with a lout but he was so wonderful a listener I exaggerated the temptation was great How he loathed her by the time I was through he actually put forward a plan to spoil her looks as he put it He had been working in the same prison gang as a man who was undergoing a term of penal servitude for doing in his girl that way vitriol was used and Sam suggested that he should do the work I was horrified but it gave me an idea He says he can give me a key that will open any door Suppose I went in the dark And I could leave a clue behind What clue Here is a thought Suppose I left something unmistakably Chinese Tarling had evidently been friendly with the girl something Chinese might place him under suspicion The diary ended with the word suspicion an appropriate ending Tarling read the passages again and again until he almost had them by heart Then he closed the book and locked it away in his drawer He sat with his chin on his hand for half an hour He was piecing together the puzzle which Thornton Lyne had made so much more simple The mystery was clearing up Thornton Lyne had gone to that flat not in response to the telegram but with the object of compromising and possibly ruining the girl He had gone with the little slip of paper inscribed with Chinese characters intending to leave the Hong in a conspicuous place that somebody else might be blamed for his infamy Milburgh had been in the flat for another purpose The two men had met there had been a quarrel and Milburgh had fired the fatal shot That part of the story solved the mystery of Thornton Lyne s list slippers and his Chinese characters his very presence there was cleared up He thought of Sam Stay s offer It came in a flash to Tarling that the man who had thrown the bottle of vitriol at him who had said he had kept it for years was Sam Stay Stay with his scheme for blasting the woman who he believed had humiliated his beloved patron And now for Milburgh the last link in the chain Tarling had arranged for the superintendent in charge of the Cannon Row Police Station to notify him if any news came through The inspector s message did not arrive and Tarling went down through Whitehall to hear the latest intelligence at first hand That was to be precious little As he was talking there arrived on the scene an agitated driver the proprietor of a taxicab which had been lost An ordinary case such as come the way of the London police almost every day The cabman had taken a man and a woman to one of the West End theatres and had been engaged to wait during the evening and pick them up when the performance was through After setting down his fares he had gone to a small eating house for a bit of supper When he came out the cab had disappeared I know who done it he said vehemently and if I had him here I d How do you know He looked in at the coffee shop while I was eating my bit of food What did he look like asked the station inspector He was a man with a white face said the victim I could pick him out of a thousand And what s more he had a brand new pair of boots on Tarling had strolled away from the officer s desk whilst this conversation was in progress but now he returned Did he speak at all he asked Yes sir said the cabman I happened to ask him if he was looking for anybody and he said no and then went on to talk a lot of rubbish about a man who had been the best friend any poor chap could have had My seat happened to be nearest the door that s how I got into conversation with him I thought he was off his nut Yes yes go on said Tarling impatiently What happened then Well he went out said the cabman and presently I heard a cab being cranked up I thought it was one of the other drivers there were several cabs outside The eating house is a place which cabmen use and I didn t take very much notice until I came out and found my cab gone and the old devil I d left in charge in a public house drinking beer with the money this fellow had given him Sounds like your man sir said the inspector looking at Tarling That s Sam Stay all right he said but it s news to me that he could drive a taxi The inspector nodded Oh I know Sam Stay all right sir We ve had him in here two or three times He used to be a taxi driver didn t you know that Tarling did not know that He had intended looking up Sam s record that day but something had occurred to put the matter out of his mind Well he can t go far he said You ll circulate the description of the cab I suppose He may be easier to find He can t hide the cab as well as he can hide himself and if he imagines that the possession of a car is going to help him to escape he s making a mistake Tarling was going back to Hertford that night and had informed Ling Chu of his intention He left Cannon Row Police Station walked across the road to Scotland Yard to confer with Whiteside who had promised to meet him He was pursuing independent inquiries and collecting details of evidence regarding the Hertford crime Whiteside was not in when Tarling called and the sergeant on duty in the little office by the main door hurried forward This came for you two hours ago sir he said We thought you were in Hertford This was a letter addressed in pencil and mister Milburgh had made no attempt to disguise his handwriting Tarling tore open the envelope and read the contents Dear mister Tarling it began I have just read in the Evening Press with the deepest sorrow and despair the news that my dearly Beloved wife Catherine Rider has been foully murdered How terrible to think that a few hours ago I was conversing with her assassin as I believe Sam Stay to be and had inadvertently given him information as to where Miss Rider was to be found I beg of you that you will lose no time in saving her from the hands of this cruel madman who seems to have only one idea and that to avenge the death of the late mister Thornton Lyne When this reaches you I shall be beyond the power of human vengeance for I have determined to end a life which has held so much sorrow and disappointment M He was satisfied that mister Milburgh would not commit suicide and the information was superfluous that Sam Stay had murdered missus Rider It was the knowledge that this vengeful lunatic knew where Odette Rider was staying which made Tarling sweat Where is mister Whiteside he asked He has gone to Cambours Restaurant to meet somebody sir said the sergeant The somebody was one of Milburgh s satellites at Lyne s Store Tarling must see him without delay The inspector had control of all the official arrangements connected with the case and it would be necessary to consult him before he could place detectives to watch the nursing home in Cavendish Place He found a cab and drove to Cambours which was in Soho and was fortunate enough to discover Whiteside in the act of leaving I didn t get much from that fellow Whiteside began when Tarling handed him the letter The Scotland Yard man read it through without comment and handed it back Of course he hasn t committed suicide It s the last thing in the world that men of the Milburgh type ever think about seriously He is a cold blooded villain Imagine him sitting down to write calmly about his wife s murderer What do you think of the other matter the threat against Odette Whiteside nodded There may be something in it he said Certainly we cannot take risks Has anything been heard of Stay Tarling told the story of the stolen taxicab We ll have him said Whiteside confidently He ll have no pals and without pals in the motor business it is practically impossible to get a car away He got into Tarling s cab and a few minutes later they were at the nursing home The matron came to them a sedate motherly lady I m sorry to disturb you at this hour of the night said Tarling sensing her disapproval But information has come to me this evening which renders it necessary that Miss Rider should be guarded Guarded said the matron in surprise I don t quite understand you mister Tarling I had come down to give you rather a blowing up about Miss Rider You know she is absolutely unfit to go out I thought I made that clear to you when you were here this morning Go out said the puzzled Tarling What do you mean She is not going out It was the matron s turn to be surprised But you sent for her half an hour ago she said I sent for her said Tarling turning pale Tell me please what has happened About half an hour ago or it may be a little longer said the matron a cabman came to the door and told me that he had been sent by the authorities to fetch Miss Rider at once she was wanted in connection with her mother s murder Something in Tarling s face betrayed his emotion Did you not send for her she asked in alarm Tarling shook his head What was the man like who called he asked A very ordinary looking man rather under sized and ill looking it was the taxi driver You have no idea which way they went No replied the matron I very much objected to Miss Rider going at all but when I gave her the message which apparently had come from you she insisted upon going Tarling groaned Odette Rider was in the power of a maniac who hated her who had killed her mother and had cherished a plan for disfiguring the beauty of the girl whom he believed had betrayed his beloved master Without any further words he turned and left the waiting room followed by Whiteside It s hopeless he said when they were outside hopeless hopeless My God How terrible I dare not think of it If Milburgh is alive he shall suffer He gave directions to the cab driver and followed Whiteside into the cab I m going back to my flat to pick up Ling Chu he said I can t afford to lose any help he may be able to give us Whiteside was pardonably piqued I don t know if your Ling Chu will be able to do very much in the way of trailing a taxicab through London And then recognising something of the other s distress he said more gently Though I agree with you that every help we can get we shall need On their arrival at the Bond Street flat Tarling opened the door and went upstairs followed by the other The flat was in darkness an extraordinary circumstance for it was an understood thing that Ling Chu should not leave the house whilst his master was out And Ling Chu had undoubtedly left The dining room was empty The first thing Tarling saw when he turned on the light was a strip of rice paper on which the ink was scarcely dry Just half a dozen Chinese characters and no more If you return before I learn that I go to find the little little woman read Tarling in astonishment Then he knows she s gone Thank God for that he said I wonder He stopped He thought he had heard a low moan and catching the eye of Whiteside he saw that the Scotland Yard man had detected the same sound Sounds like somebody groaning he said Listen He bent his head and waited and presently it came again In two strides Tarling was at the door of Ling Chu s sleeping place but it was locked He stooped to the key hole and listened and again heard the moan With a thrust of his shoulder he had broken the door open and dashed in The sight that met his eyes was a remarkable one There was a man lying on the bed stripped to the waist His hands and his legs were bound and a white cloth covered his face But what Tarling saw before all else was that across the centre of the broad chest were four little red lines which Tarling recognised They were persuaders by which native Chinese policemen secretly extract confessions from unwilling criminals light cuts with a sharp knife on the surface of the skin and after He looked around for the torture bottle but it was not in sight Who is this he asked and lifted the cloth from the man s face It was Milburgh 
2010_147045_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER XXXIII
none	none	 LING CHU TORTURER Much had happened to mister Milburgh between the time of his discovery lying bound and helpless and showing evidence that he had been in the hands of a Chinese torturer and the moment he left Sam Stay 
2010_147045_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He had read of the murder and had been shocked and in his way grieved 
2010_147045_000006_000000	train-clean-360	It was not to save Odette Rider that he sent his note to Scotland Yard but rather to avenge himself upon the man who had killed the only woman in the world who had touched his warped nature 
none	none	Nor had he any intention of committing suicide 
2010_147045_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He had the passports which he had secured a year before in readiness for such a step he had kept that clerical uniform of his by him all that time and was ready at a moment s notice to leave the country 
2010_147045_000007_000000	train-clean-360	His tickets were in his pocket and when he despatched the district messenger to Scotland Yard he was on his way to Waterloo station to catch the Havre boat train 
none	none	The police he knew would be watching the station but he had no fear that they would discover beneath the benign exterior of a country clergyman the wanted manager of Lyne s Store even supposing that there was a warrant out for his arrest He was standing at a bookstall purchasing literature to while away the hours of the journey when he felt a hand laid on his arm and experienced a curious sinking sensation 
2010_147045_000008_000001	train-clean-360	He turned to look into a brown mask of a face he had seen before 
none	none	Well my man he asked with a smile what can I do for you 
2010_147045_000010_000000	train-clean-360	He had asked the question in identical terms of Sam Stay his brain told him that much mechanically 
none	none	You will come with me mister Milburgh said Ling Chu
2010_147045_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 It will be better for you if you do not make any trouble 
2010_147045_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 You are making a mistake 
2010_147045_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 If I am making a mistake said Ling Chu calmly you have only to tell that policeman that I have mistaken you for Milburgh who is wanted by the police on a charge of murder and I shall get into very serious trouble 
2010_147045_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Milburgh s lips were quivering with fear and his face was a pasty grey 
2010_147045_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I will come he said 
none	none	Ling Chu walked by his side and they passed out of Waterloo station The journey to Bond Street remained in Milburgh s memory like a horrible dream 
2010_147045_000016_000002	train-clean-360	He was not used to travelling on omnibuses being something of a sybarite who spared nothing to ensure his own comfort 
2010_147045_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Ling Chu on the contrary had a penchant for buses and seemed to enjoy them 
2010_147045_000017_000000	train-clean-360	No word was spoken until they reached the sitting room of Tarling s flat Milburgh expected to see the detective 
none	none	He had already arrived at the conclusion that Ling Chu was but a messenger who had been sent by the man from Shanghai to bring him to his presence 
2010_147045_000017_000002	train-clean-360	But there was no sign of Tarling 
2010_147045_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Now my friend what do you want he asked 
2010_147045_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 It is true I am mister Milburgh but when you say that I have committed murder you are telling a wicked lie 
2010_147045_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He had gained some courage because he had expected in the first place to be taken immediately to Scotland Yard and placed in custody 
none	none	The fact that Tarling s flat lay at the end of the journey seemed to suggest that the situation was not as desperate as he had imagined Ling Chu turning suddenly upon Milburgh gripped him by the wrist half turning as he did so Before Milburgh knew what was happening he was lying on the floor face downwards with Ling Chu s knee in the small of his back 
2010_147045_000020_000002	train-clean-360	He felt something like a wire loop slipped about his wrists and suffered an excruciating pain as the Chinaman tightened the connecting link of the native handcuff 
2010_147045_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Get up said Ling Chu sternly and exerting a surprising strength lifted the man to his feet 
none	none	What are you going to do said Milburgh his teeth chattering with fear There was no answer 
2010_147045_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Ling Chu gripped the man by one hand and opening the door with the other pushed him into a room which was barely furnished Against the wall there was an iron bed and on to this the man was pushed collapsing in a heap 
2010_147045_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The Chinese thief catcher went about his work in a scientific fashion First he fastened and threaded a length of silk rope through one of the rails of the bed and into the slack of this he lifted Milburgh s head so that he could not struggle except at the risk of being strangled 
2010_147045_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Ling Chu turned him over unfastened the handcuffs and methodically bound first one wrist and then the other to the side of the bed 
2010_147045_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What are you going to do repeated Milburgh but the Chinaman made no reply 
2010_147045_000027_000000	train-clean-360	He produced from a belt beneath his blouse a wicked looking knife and the manager opened his mouth to shout 
2010_147045_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He was beside himself with terror but any cause for fear had yet to come 
none	none	The Chinaman stopped the cry by dropping a pillow on the man s face and began deliberately to cut the clothing on the upper part of his body
2010_147045_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 If you cry out he said calmly the people will think it is I who am singing 
none	none	Chinamen have no music in their voices and sometimes when I have sung my native songs people have come up to discover who was suffering
2010_147045_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 You are acting illegally breathed Milburgh in a last attempt to save the situation 
none	none	For your crime you will suffer imprisonment
2010_147045_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall be fortunate said Ling Chu for prison is life 
none	none	But you will hang at the end of a long rope He had lifted the pillow from Milburgh s face and now that pallid man was following every movement of the Chinaman with a fearful eye Presently Milburgh was stripped to the waist and Ling Chu regarded his handiwork complacently 
2010_147045_000032_000000	train-clean-360	He went to a cupboard in the wall and took out a small brown bottle which he placed on a table by the side of the bed 
2010_147045_000032_000001	train-clean-360	Then he himself sat upon the edge of the bed and spoke 
2010_147045_000032_000002	train-clean-360	His English was almost perfect though now and again he hesitated in the choice of a word and there were moments when he was a little stilted in his speech and more than a little pedantic 
2010_147045_000032_000003	train-clean-360	He spoke slowly and with great deliberation 
2010_147045_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You do not know the Chinese people 
2010_147045_000033_000001	train-clean-360	You have not been or lived in China When I say lived I do not mean staying for a week at a good hotel in one of the coast towns 
2010_147045_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Your mister Lyne lived in China in that way 
2010_147045_000033_000003	train-clean-360	It was not a successful residence 
2010_147045_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I know nothing about mister Lyne interrupted Milburgh sensing that Ling Chu in some way associated him with Thornton Lyne s misadventures 
none	none	Good said Ling Chu tapping the flat blade of his knife upon his palm If you had lived in China in the real China you might have a dim idea of our people and their characteristics 
2010_147045_000035_000001	train-clean-360	It is said that the Chinaman does not fear death or pain which is a slight exaggeration because I have known criminals who feared both 
2010_147045_000036_000000	train-clean-360	His thin lips curved for a second in the ghost of a smile as though at some amusing recollection 
2010_147045_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Then he grew serious again 
2010_147045_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 From the Western standpoint we are a primitive people 
2010_147045_000037_000001	train-clean-360	From our own point of view we are rigidly honourable 
2010_147045_000037_000002	train-clean-360	Also and this I would emphasise He did in fact emphasise his words to the terror of mister Milburgh with the point of his knife upon the other s broad chest though so lightly was the knife held that Milburgh felt nothing but the slightest tingle 
2010_147045_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 We do not set the same value upon the rights of the individual as do you people in the West 
2010_147045_000038_000001	train-clean-360	For example he explained carefully we are not tender with our prisoners if we think that by applying a little pressure to them we can assist the process of justice 
2010_147045_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you mean asked Milburgh a grisly thought dawning upon his mind 
none	none	In Britain and in America too I understand though the Americans are much more enlightened on this subject when you arrest a member of a gang you are content with cross examining him and giving him full scope for the exercise of his inventive power 
2010_147045_000040_000001	train-clean-360	You ask him questions and go on asking and asking and you do not know whether he is lying or telling the truth 
2010_147045_000041_000000	train-clean-360	mister Milburgh began to breathe heavily 
2010_147045_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Has that idea sunk into your mind asked Ling Chu 
none	none	I don t know what you mean said mister Milburgh in a quavering voice All I know is that you are committing a most 
2010_147045_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Ling Chu stopped him with a gesture 
2010_147045_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I am perfectly well aware of what I am doing he said 
2010_147045_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 Now listen to me 
2010_147045_000045_000002	train-clean-360	A week or so ago mister Thornton Lyne your employer was found dead in Hyde Park 
none	none	He was dressed in his shirt and trousers and about his body in an endeavour to stanch the wound somebody had wrapped a silk night dress 
2010_147045_000045_000004	train-clean-360	He was killed in the flat of a small lady whose name I cannot pronounce but you will know her 
2010_147045_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Milburgh s eyes never left the Chinaman s and he nodded 
none	none	He was killed by you said Ling Chu slowly because he had discovered that you had been robbing him and you were in fear that he would hand you over to the police
2010_147045_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a lie roared Milburgh 
2010_147045_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 It s a lie I tell you it s a lie 
2010_147045_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall discover whether it is a lie in a few moments said Ling Chu 
2010_147045_000050_000000	train-clean-360	He put his hand inside his blouse and Milburgh watched him fascinated but he produced nothing more deadly than a silver cigarette case which he opened 
2010_147045_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He selected a cigarette and lit it and for a few minutes puffed in silence his thoughtful eyes fixed upon Milburgh 
2010_147045_000050_000002	train-clean-360	Then he rose and went to the cupboard and took out a larger bottle and placed it beside the other 
none	none	Ling Chu pulled again at his cigarette and then threw it into the grate It is in the interests of all parties he said in his slow halting way that the truth should be known both for the sake of my honourable master Lieh Jen the Hunter and his honourable Little Lady 
2010_147045_000053_000000	train-clean-360	He took up his knife and bent over the terror stricken man 
2010_147045_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 For God s sake don t don t half screamed half sobbed Milburgh 
2010_147045_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 This will not hurt you said Ling Chu and drew four straight lines across the other s breast 
2010_147045_000055_000001	train-clean-360	The keen razor edge seemed scarcely to touch the flesh yet where the knife had passed was a thin red mark like a scratch 
2010_147045_000056_000000	train-clean-360	Milburgh scarcely felt a twinge of pain only a mild irritating smarting and no more 
2010_147045_000056_000001	train-clean-360	The Chinaman laid down the knife and took up the smaller bottle 
2010_147045_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 In this he said is a vegetable extract 
none	none	It is what you would call capsicum but it is not quite like your pepper because it is distilled from a native root 
2010_147045_000057_000002	train-clean-360	In this bottle he picked up the larger is a Chinese oil which immediately relieves the pain which capsicum causes 
none	none	What are you going to do asked Milburgh struggling
2010_147045_000058_000001	train-clean-360	 You dog 
2010_147045_000058_000002	train-clean-360	You fiend 
2010_147045_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 With a little brush I will paint capsicum on these places He touched Milburgh s chest with his long white ringers 
2010_147045_000059_000001	train-clean-360	 Little by little millimetre by millimetre my brush will move and you will experience such pain as you have never experienced before 
none	none	It is pain which will rack you from head to foot and will remain with you all your life in memory Sometimes he said philosophically it drives me mad but I do not think it will drive you mad 
2010_147045_000060_000000	train-clean-360	He took out the cork and dipped a little camel hair brush in the mixture withdrawing it moist with fluid 
2010_147045_000060_000001	train-clean-360	He was watching Milburgh all the time and when the stout man opened his mouth to yell he thrust a silk handkerchief which he drew with lightning speed from his pocket into the open mouth 
2010_147045_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait wait gasped the muffled voice of Milburgh 
2010_147045_000061_000001	train-clean-360	 I have something to tell you something that your master should know 
2010_147045_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 That is very good said Ling Chu coolly and pulled out the handkerchief 
2010_147045_000062_000001	train-clean-360	 You shall tell me the truth 
2010_147045_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 What truth can I tell you asked the man sweating with fear 
2010_147045_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Great beads of sweat were lying on his face 
2010_147045_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 You shall confess the truth that you killed Thornton Lyne said Ling Chu 
2010_147045_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 That is the only truth I want to hear 
2010_147045_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 I swear I did not kill him 
2010_147045_000065_000001	train-clean-360	I swear it I swear it raved the prisoner Wait wait he whimpered as the other picked up the handkerchief 
none	none	Do you know what has happened to Miss Rider 
2010_147045_000066_000000	train-clean-360	The Chinaman checked his movement 
none	none	To Miss Rider he said quickly He pronounced the word Lider 
2010_147045_000068_000000	train-clean-360	Brokenly gaspingly breathlessly Milburgh told the story of his meeting with Sam Stay 
2010_147045_000068_000001	train-clean-360	In his distress and mental anguish he reproduced faithfully not only every word but every intonation and the Chinaman listened with half closed eyes 
2010_147045_000068_000002	train-clean-360	Then when Milburgh had finished he put down his bottle and thrust in the cork 
2010_147045_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 My master would wish that the little woman should escape danger he said 
2010_147045_000069_000001	train-clean-360	 To night he does not return so I must go myself to the hospital you can wait 
none	none	Let me go said Milburgh I will help you Ling Chu shook his head
2010_147045_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 You can wait he said with a sinister smile 
2010_147045_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 I will go first to the hospital and afterwards if all is well I will return for you 
none	none	He took a clean white towel from the dressing table and laid it over his victim s face Upon the towel he sprinkled the contents of a third bottle which he took from the cupboard and Milburgh remembered no more until he looked up into the puzzled face of Tarling an hour later CHAPTER XXXIV THE ARREST Tarling stooped down and released the cords which bound Milburgh to the couch The stout man was white and shaking and had to be lifted into a sitting position He sat there on the edge of the bed his face in his hands for five minutes and the two men watched him curiously Tarling had made a careful examination of the cuts on his chest and was relieved to discover that Ling Chu he did not doubt that the Chinaman was responsible for Milburgh s plight had not yet employed that terrible torture which had so often brought Chinese criminals to the verge of madness Whiteside picked up the clothes which Ling Chu had so systematically stripped from the man s body and placed them on the bed by Milburgh s side Then Tarling beckoned the other into the outer room What does it all mean asked Whiteside It means said Tarling grimly that my friend Ling Chu has been trying to discover the murderer of Thornton Lyne by methods peculiarly Chinese Happily he was interrupted probably as a result of Milburgh telling him that Miss Odette Rider had been spirited away He looked back to the drooping figure by the side of the bed He s a little bigger than I he said but I think some of my clothes will fit him He made a hasty search of his wardrobe and came back with an armful of clothes Come Milburgh he said rouse yourself and dress The man looked up his lower lip trembling pathetically I rather think these clothes though they may be a bad fit will suit you a little better than your clerical garb said Tarling sardonically Without a word Milburgh took the clothes in his arms and they left him to dress They heard his heavy footfall and presently the door opened and he came weakly into the sitting room and dropped into a chair Do you feel well enough to go out now asked Whiteside Go out said Milburgh looking up in alarm Where am I to go To Cannon Row Police Station said the practical Whiteside I have a warrant for your arrest Milburgh on a charge of wilful murder arson forgery and embezzlement Wilful murder Milburgh s voice was high and squeaky and his shaking hands went to his mouth You cannot charge me with wilful murder No no no I swear to you I am innocent Where did you see Thornton Lyne last asked Tarling and the man made a great effort to compose himself I saw him last alive in his office he began When did you see Thornton Lyne last asked Tarling again Alive or dead Milburgh did not reply Presently Whiteside dropped his hand on the man s shoulder and looked across at Tarling Come along he said briskly It is my duty as a police officer to warn you that anything you now say will be taken down and used as evidence against you at your trial Wait wait said Milburgh His voice was husky and thick He looked round Can I have a glass of water he begged licking his dry lips Tarling brought the refreshment which the man drank eagerly The water seemed to revive something of his old arrogant spirit for he got up from his chair jerked at the collar of his ill fitting coat it was an old shooting coat of Tarling s and smiled for the first time I think gentlemen he said with something of his old airiness you will have a difficulty in proving that I am concerned in the murder of Thornton Lyne You will have as great a difficulty in proving that I had anything to do with the burning down of Solomon s office I presume that constitutes the arson charge And most difficult of all will be your attempt to prove that I was concerned in robbing the firm of Thornton Lyne The lady who robbed that firm has already made a confession as you mister Tarling are well aware He smiled at the other but Tarling met his eye I know of no confession he said steadily mister Milburgh inclined his head with a smirk Though he still bore the physical evidence of the bad time through which he had been he had recovered something of his old confidence The confession was burnt he said and burnt by you mister Tarling And now I think your bluff has gone on long enough My bluff said Tarling in his turn astonished What do you mean by bluff I am referring to the warrant which you suggest has been issued for my arrest said Milburgh That s no bluff It was Whiteside who spoke and he produced from his pocket a folded sheet of paper which he opened and displayed under the eyes of the man And in case of accidents said Whiteside and deftly slipped a pair of handcuffs upon the man s wrists It may have been Milburgh s overweening faith in his own genius It may have been and probably was a consciousness that he had covered his trail too well to be detected One or other of these causes had kept him up but now he collapsed To Tarling it was amazing that the man had maintained this show of bravado to the last though in his heart he knew that the Crown had a very poor case against Milburgh if the charge of embezzlement and arson were proceeded with It was on the murder alone that a conviction could be secured and this Milburgh evidently realised for he made no attempt in the remarkable statement which followed to do more than hint that he had been guilty of robbing the firm He sat huddled up in his chair his manacled hands clasped on the table before him and then with a jerk sat upright If you ll take off these things gentlemen he said jangling the connecting chain of the handcuffs I will tell you something which may set your mind at rest on the question of Thornton Lyne s death Whiteside looked at his superior questioningly and Tarling nodded A few seconds later the handcuffs had been removed and mister Milburgh was soothing his chafed wrists The psychologist who attempted to analyse the condition of mind in which Tarling found himself would be faced with a difficult task He had come to the flat beside himself with anxiety at the disappearance of Odette Rider He had intended dashing into his rooms and out again though what he intended doing thereafter he had no idea The knowledge that Ling Chu was on the track of the kidnapper had served as an opiate to his jagged nerves otherwise he could not have stayed and listened to the statement Milburgh was preparing to make Now and again it came back to him like a twinge of pain that Odette Rider was in danger and he wanted to have done with this business to bundle Milburgh into a prison cell and devote the whole of his energies to tracing her Such a twinge came to him now as he watched the stout figure at the table Before you start he said tell me this What information did you give to Ling Chu which led him to leave you I told him about Miss Rider said Milburgh and I advanced a theory it was only a theory as to what had happened to her I see said Tarling Now tell your story and tell it quickly my friend and try to keep to the truth Who murdered Thornton Lyne Milburgh twisted his head slowly towards him and smiled If you could explain how the body was taken from Odette Rider s flat he said slowly and left in Hyde Park I could answer you immediately For to this minute I believe that Thornton Lyne was killed by Odette Rider Tarling drew a long breath That is a lie he said mister Milburgh was in no way put out Very well he said Now perhaps you will be kind enough to listen to my story CHAPTER XXXV MILBURGH S STORY I do not intend said mister Milburgh in his best oracular manner describing all the events which preceded the death of the late Thornton Lyne Nor will I go to any length to deal with his well known and even notorious character He was not a good employer he was suspicious unjust and in many ways mean mister Lyne was I admit suspicious of me He was under the impression that I had robbed the firm of very considerable sums of money a suspicion which I in turn had long suspected and had confirmed by a little conversation which I overheard on the first day I had the pleasure of seeing you mister Tarling Tarling remembered that fatal day when Milburgh had come into the office at the moment that Lyne was expressing his views very freely about his subordinate Of course gentlemen said Milburgh I do not for one moment admit that I robbed the firm or that I was guilty of any criminal acts I admit there were certain irregularities certain carelessnesses for which I was morally responsible and beyond that I admit nothing If you are making a note he turned to Whiteside who was taking down the statement in shorthand I beg of you to make a special point of my denial Irregularities and carelessnesses he repeated carefully Beyond that I am not prepared to go In other words you are not confessing anything I am not confessing anything agreed mister Milburgh with heavy gravity It is sufficient that mister Lyne suspected me and that he was prepared to employ a detective in order to trace my defalcations as he termed them It is true that I lived expensively that I own two houses one in Camden Town and one at Hertford but then I had speculated on the Stock Exchange and speculated very wisely But I am a sensitive man gentlemen and the knowledge that I was responsible for certain irregularities preyed upon my mind Let us say for example that I knew somebody had been robbing the firm but that I was unable to detect that somebody Would not the fact that I was morally responsible for the finances of Lyne s Stores cause me particular unhappiness You speak like a book said Whiteside and I for one don t believe a word you say I think you were a thief Milburgh but go on your own sweet way I thank you said mister Milburgh sarcastically Well gentlemen matters had come to a crisis I felt my responsibility I knew somebody had been robbing the house and I had an idea that possibly I would be suspected and that those who were dear to me his voice shook for a moment broke and grew husky those who were dear to me he repeated would be visited with my sins of omission Miss Odette Rider had been dismissed from the firm of Lyne s Stores in consequence of her having rejected the undesirable advances of the late mister Lyne mister Lyne turned the whole weight of his rage against this girl and that gave me an idea The night after the interview or it may have been the same night I refer to the interview which mister Tarling had with the late Thornton Lyne I was working late at the office I was in fact clearing up mister Lyne s desk I had occasion to leave the office and on my return found the place in darkness I re connected the light and then discovered on the desk a particularly murderous looking revolver In the statement I made to you sir he turned to Tarling I said that that pistol had not been found by me and indeed I professed the profoundest ignorance of its existence I regret to confess to you that I was telling an untruth I did find the pistol I put it in my pocket and I took it home It is probable that with that pistol mister Lyne was fatally shot Tarling nodded I hadn t the slightest doubt about that Milburgh You also had another automatic pistol purchased subsequent to the murder from John Wadham s of Holborn Circus mister Milburgh bowed his head That is perfectly true sir he said I have such a weapon I live a very lonely kind of life and You need not explain I merely tell you said Tarling that I know where you got the pistol with which you shot at me on the night I brought Odette Rider back from Ashford mister Milburgh closed his eyes and there was resignation written largely on his face the resignation of an ill used and falsely accused man I think it would be better not to discuss controversial subjects he said If you will allow me I will keep to the facts Tarling could have laughed at the sublime impertinence of the man but that he was growing irritable with the double strain which was being imposed upon him It was probable that had not this man accused Odette Rider of the murder he would have left him to make his confession to Whiteside and have gone alone in his hopeless search for the taxicab driven by Sam Stay To resume continued mister Milburgh I took the revolver home You will understand that I was in a condition of mind bordering upon a nervous breakdown I felt my responsibilities very keenly and I felt that if mister Lyne would not accept my protestations of innocence there was nothing left for me but to quit this world In other words you contemplated suicide said Whiteside You have accurately diagnosed the situation said Milburgh ponderously Miss Rider had been dismissed and I was on the point of ruin Her mother would be involved in the crash those were the thoughts which ran through my mind as I sat in my humble dining room in Camden Town Then the idea flashed upon me I wondered whether Odette Rider loved her mother sufficiently well to make the great sacrifice to take full responsibility for the irregularities which had occurred in the accounts department of Lyne s Stores and clear away to the Continent until the matter blew over I intended seeing her the next day but I was still doubtful as to whether she would fall in with my views Young people nowadays he said sententiously are terribly selfish As it happened I just caught her as she was leaving for Hertford and I put the situation before her The poor girl was naturally shocked but she readily fell in with my suggestion and signed the confession which you mister Tarling so thoughtfully burnt Whiteside looked at Tarling I knew nothing of this he said a little reproachfully Go on said Tarling I will explain that afterwards I had previously wired the girl s mother that she would not be home that night I also wired to mister Lyne asking him to meet me at Miss Rider s flat I took the liberty of fixing Miss Rider s name to the invitation thinking that that would induce him to come It also covered you said Tarling and kept your name out of the business altogether Yes said mister Milburgh as though the idea had not struck him before yes it did that I had sent Miss Rider off in a hurry I begged that she would not go near the flat and I promised that I myself would go there pack the necessary articles for the journey and take them down in a taxi to Charing Cross I see said Tarling so it was you who packed the bag Half packed it corrected mister Milburgh You see I d made a mistake in the time the train left It was only when I was packing the bag that I realised it was impossible for me to get down to the station in time I had made arrangements with Miss Rider that if I did not turn up I would telephone to her a quarter of an hour before the train left She was to await me in the lounge of a near by hotel I had hoped to get to her at least an hour before the train left because I did not wish to attract attention to myself or he added to Miss Rider When I looked at my watch and realised that it was impossible to get down I left the bag as it was half packed and went outside to the tube station and telephoned How did you get in and out asked Tarling The porter on duty at the door said he saw nobody I went out the back way explained mister Milburgh It is really the simplest thing in the world to get into Miss Rider s basement flat by way of the mews behind All the tenants have keys to the back door so that they can bring their cycles in and out or get in their coals I know that said Tarling Go on I am a little in advance of the actual story said Milburgh The business of packing the bag takes my narrative along a little farther than I intended it to go Having said good bye to Miss Rider I passed the rest of the evening perfecting my plans It would serve no useful purpose said Milburgh with an airy wave of his hand if I were to tell you the arguments I intended putting before him If they did not include the betrayal of Miss Rider I m a Dutchman said Tarling I pretty well know the arguments you intended using Then mister Tarling allow me to congratulate you upon being a thought reader said Milburgh because I have not revealed my secret thoughts to any human being However that is beside the point I intended to plead with mister Lyne I intended to offer him the record of years of loyal service to his sainted father and if the confession was not accepted and if he still persisted in his revengeful plan then mister Tarling I intended shooting myself before his eyes He said this with rare dramatic effect but Tarling was unimpressed and Whiteside looked up from his notes with a twinkle in his eye You hobby seems to be preparing for suicide and changing your mind he said I am sorry to hear you speak so flippantly on a solemn subject said Milburgh As I say I waited a little too long but I was anxious for complete darkness to fall before I made my way into the flat This I did easily because Odette had lent me her key I found her bag with no difficulty it was in the dining room on a shelf and placing the case upon her bed I proceeded as best I could for I am not very familiar with the articles of feminine toilette to put together such things as I knew she would require on the journey I was thus engaged when as I say it occurred to me that I had mistaken the time of the train and looking at my watch I saw to my consternation that I should not be able to get down to the station in time Happily I had arranged to call her up as I have already told you One moment said Tarling How were you dressed How was I dressed Let me think I wore a heavy overcoat I know said mister Milburgh for the night was chilly and a little foggy if you remember Where was the revolver In the overcoat pocket replied Milburgh immediately Had you your overcoat on Milburgh thought for a moment No I had not I had hung it up on a hook at the foot of the bed near the alcove which I believe Miss Rider used as a wardrobe And when you went out to telephone had you your overcoat No that I am perfectly certain about said Milburgh readily I remember thinking later how foolish it was to bring an overcoat out and not use it Go on said Tarling Well I reached the station called up the hotel and to my surprise and annoyance Miss Rider did not answer I asked the porter who answered my phone call whether he had seen a young lady dressed in so and so waiting in the lounge and he replied no Therefore said mister Milburgh emphatically you will agree that it is possible that Miss Rider was not either at the station or at the hotel and there was a distinct possibility that she had doubled back We want the facts interrupted Whiteside We have enough theories Tell us what happened Then we will draw our own conclusions Very good sir replied Milburgh courteously By the time I had telephoned it was half past nine o clock You will remember that I had wired to mister Lyne to meet me at the flat at eleven Obviously there was no reason why I should go back to the flat until a few minutes before mister Lyne was due to let him in You asked me just now sir he turned to Tarling whether I had my overcoat on and I can state most emphatically that I had not I was going back to the flat with the intention of collecting my overcoat when I saw a number of people walking about the mews behind the block I had no desire to attract attention as I have told you before so I stood waiting until these people who were employees of a motor car company which had a garage behind the flat had dispersed Now waiting at the corner of a mews on a cold spring night is a cold business and seeing that it would be some time before the mews would be clear I went back to the main street and strolled along until I came to a picture palace I am partial to cinematograph displays explained mister Milburgh and although I was not in the mood for entertainment yet I thought the pictures would afford a pleasant attraction I forget the name of the film It is not necessary that you should tell us for the moment said Tarling Will you please make your story as short as possible Milburgh was silent for a moment I am coming now to the most extraordinary fact he said and I would ask you to bear in mind every detail I give you It is to my interest that the perpetrator of this terrible crime should be brought to justice Tarling s impatient gesture arrested his platitudes but mister Milburgh was in no way abashed When I got back to the mews I found it deserted Standing outside the door leading to the storerooms and cellars was a two seater car There was nobody inside or in attendance and I looked at it curiously not realising at the moment that it was mister Thornton Lyne s What did interest me was the fact that the back gate which I had left locked was open So too was the door leading to what I would call the underground room it was little better through which one had to pass to reach Odette s flat by the back way I opened the door of the flat said mister Milburgh impressively and walked in I had extinguished the light when I went but to my surprise I saw through the transom of Odette s bedroom that a light was burning within I turned the handle and even before I saw into the room my nose was assailed by a smell of burning powder The first sight which met my gaze was a man lying on the floor He was on his face but I turned him over and to my horror it was mister Thornton Lyne He was unconscious and bleeding from a wound in the chest said mister Milburgh and at the moment I thought he was dead To say that I was shocked would be mildly to describe my terrible agitation My first thought and first thoughts are sometimes right was that he had been shot down by Odette Rider who for some reason had returned The room however was empty and a curious circumstance about which I will tell you was that the window leading out to the area of the flat was wide open It was protected with heavy bars said Tarling so nobody could have escaped that way I examined the wound Milburgh went on nodding his agreement with Tarling s description and knew that it was fatal I do not think however that mister Thornton Lyne was dead at this time My next thought was to stanch the wound and I pulled open the drawer and took out the first thing which came to my hand which was a night dress I had to find a pad and employed two of Odette s handkerchiefs for the purpose First of all I stripped him of his coat and his vest a task of some difficulty then I fixed him up as best I could I knew his case was hopeless and indeed I believe said mister Milburgh soberly I believe he was dead even before the bandaging was completed Whilst I was doing something I found it was possible to forget the terrible position in which I would find myself if somebody came into the room The moment I saw the case was hopeless and had a second to think I was seized with a blind panic I snatched my overcoat from the peg and ran out of the room through the back way into the mews and reached Camden Town that night a mental and physical wreck Did you leave the lights burning asked Tarling mister Milburgh thought for a moment Yes he said I left the lights burning And you left the body in the flat That I swear replied Milburgh And the revolver when you got home was it in your pocket mister Milburgh shook his head Why did you not notify the police Because I was afraid admitted mister Milburgh I was scared to death It is a terrible confession to make but I am a physical coward There was nobody in the room persisted Tarling Nobody so far as I could see I tell you the window was open You say it is barred that is true but a very thin person could slip between those bars A woman Impossible said Tarling shortly The bars have been very carefully measured and nothing bigger than a rabbit could get through And you have no idea who carried the body away None whatever replied Milburgh firmly Tarling had opened his mouth to say something when a telephone bell shrilled and he picked up the instrument from the table on which it stood It was a strange voice that greeted him a voice husky and loud as though it were unused to telephoning Tarling the name shouted the voice quickly That is my name said Tarling She s a friend of yours ain t she asked the voice There was a chuckle A cold shiver ran down Tarling s spine for though he had never met the man instinct told him that he was speaking to Sam Stay You ll find her to morrow screamed the voice what s left of her The woman who lured him on what s left of her There was a click and the receiver was hung up Tarling was working the telephone hook like a madman What exchange was that he asked and the operator after a moment supplied the information that it was Hampstead CHAPTER XXXVI AT HIGHGATE CEMETERY Odette Rider sat back in a corner of the smooth running taxicab Her eyes were closed for the inevitable reaction had come Excitement and anxiety had combined to give her the strength to walk to the cab with a firm step which had surprised the matron but now in the darkness and solitude she was conscious of a depression both physical and mental which left her without the will or power for further effort The car sped through interminably long streets in what direction she neither knew nor cared Remember that she did not even know where the nursing home was situated It might have been on the edge of London for all she was aware Once that was as the car was crossing Bond Street from Cavendish Square she saw people turn and look at the cab and a policeman pointed and shouted something She was too preoccupied to worry her head as to the cause She appreciated in a dim vague way the skill of the taxi driver who seemed to be able to grope his way through and around any obstruction of traffic and it was not until she found the cab traversing a country road that she had any suspicion that all was not well Even then her doubts were allayed by her recognition of certain landmarks which told her she was on the Hertford Road Of course she thought I should be wanted at Hertford rather than in London and she settled herself down again Suddenly the cab stopped backed down a side lane and turned in the direction from whence they had come When he had got his car s head right Sam Stay shut off his engine descended from his seat and opened the door Come on out of that he said sharply Why what began the bewildered girl but before she could go much farther the man dived in gripped her by the wrist and pulled her out with such violence that she fell You don t know me eh The words were his as he thrust his face into hers gripping her shoulders so savagely that she could have cried out in pain She was on her knees struggling to get to her feet and she looked up at the little man wonderingly I know you she gasped You are the man who tried to get into my flat He grinned And I know you he laughed harshly You re the devil that lured him on The best man in the world he s in the little vault in Highgate Cemetery The door is just like a church And that s where you ll be to night damn you Down there I m going to take you Down down down and leave you with him because he wanted you He was gripping her by both wrists glaring down into her face and there was something so wolfish so inhuman in the madman s staring eyes that her mouth went dry and when she tried to scream no sound came Then she lurched forward towards him and he caught her under the arms and dragged her to her feet Fainted eh You ll faint me lady he chuckled Don t you wish you might never come round eh I ll bet you would if you knew if you knew He dropped her on the grass by the side of the road took a luggage strap from the front of the cab and bound her hands Then he picked up the scarf she had been wearing and tied it around her mouth With an extraordinary display of strength he lifted her without effort and put her back into the corner of the seat Then he slammed the door mounted again to his place and sent the car at top speed in the direction of London They were on the outskirts of Hampstead when he saw a sign over a tobacconist s shop and stopped the car a little way beyond at the darkest part of the road He gave a glance into the interior The girl had slid from the seat to the floor and lay motionless He hurried back to the tobacconist s where the telephone sign had been At the back of his fuddled brain lingered an idea that there was somebody who would be hurt That cruel looking devil who was cross examining him when he fell into a fit Tarling Yes that was the name Tarling It happened to be a new telephone directory and by chance Tarling s name although a new subscriber had been included In a few seconds he was talking to the detective He hung up the receiver and came out of the little booth and the shopman who had heard his harsh loud voice looked at him suspiciously but Sam Stay was indifferent to the suspicions of men He half ran half walked back to where his cab was standing leaped into the seat and again drove the machine forward To Highgate Cemetery That was the idea The gates would be closed but he could do something Perhaps he would kill her first and then get her over the wall afterwards It would be a grand revenge if he could get her into the cemetery alive and thrust her the living down amongst the dead through those little doors which opened like church doors to the cold dank vault below He screamed and sang with joy at the thought and those pedestrians who saw the cab flash past rocking from side to side turned at the sound of the wild snatch of song for Sam Stay was happy as he had not been happy in his life before But Highgate Cemetery was closed The gloomy iron gates barred all entrance and the walls were high It was a baffling place because houses almost entirely surrounded it and he was half an hour seeking a suitable spot before he finally pulled up before a place where the wall did not seem so difficult There was nobody about and little fear of interruption on the part of the girl He had looked into the cab and had seen nothing save a huddled figure on the floor So she was still unconscious he thought He ran the car on to the sidewalk then slipped down into the narrow space between car and wall and jerked open the door Come on he cried exultantly He reached out his fingers and then something shot from the car something lithe and supple something that gripped the little man by the throat and hurled him back against the wall Stay struggled with the strength of lunacy but Ling Chu held him in a grip of steel CHAPTER XXXVII LING CHU RETURNS Tarling dropped the telephone receiver on its hook and had sunk into a chair with a groan His face was white whiter than the prisoner s who sat opposite him and he seemed to have gone old all of a sudden What is it asked Whiteside quietly Who was the man Stay said Tarling Stay He has Odette It s awful awful Whiteside thoughtful preoccupied Milburgh his face twitching with fear watched the scene curiously I m beaten said Tarling and at that moment the telephone bell rang again He lifted the receiver and bent over the table and Whiteside saw his eyes open in wide amazement It was Odette s voice that greeted him It is I Odette Odette Are you safe Thank God for that he almost shouted Thank God for that Where are you I am at a tobacconist s shop in there was a pause while she was evidently asking somebody the name of the street and presently she came back with the information But this is wonderful said Tarling I ll be with you immediately Whiteside get a cab will you How did you get away It s rather a long story she said Your Chinese friend saved me That dreadful man stopped the cab near a tobacconist s shop to telephone Ling Chu appeared by magic I think he must have been lying on top of the cab because I heard him come down by the side He helped me out and stood me in a dark doorway taking my place Please don t ask me any more I am so tired Half an hour later Tarling was with the girl and heard the story of the outrage Odette Rider had recovered something of her calm and before the detective had returned her to the nursing home she had told him the story of her adventure I must have fainted she said When I woke up I was lying at the bottom of the cab which was moving at a tremendous rate I thought of getting back to the seat but it occurred to me that if I pretended to be faint I might have a chance of escape When I heard the cab stop I tried to rise but I hadn t sufficient strength But help was near I heard the scraping of shoes on the leather top of the car and presently the door opened and I saw a figure which I knew was not the cabman s He lifted me out and fortunately the cab had stopped opposite a private house with a big porch and to this he led me Wait he said There is a place where you may telephone a little way along Wait till we have gone Then he went back to the cab closed the door noiselessly and immediately afterwards I saw Stay running along the path In a few seconds the cab had disappeared and I dragged myself to the shop and that s all No news had been received of Ling Chu when Tarling returned to his flat Whiteside was waiting and told him that he had put Milburgh into the cells and that he would be charged the following day I can t understand what has happened to Ling Chu He should be back by now said Tarling It was half past one in the morning and a telephone inquiry to Scotland Yard had produced no information It is possible of course Tarling went on that Stay took the cab on to Hertford The man has developed into a dangerous lunatic All criminals are more or less mad said the philosophical Whiteside I wonder what turned this fellow s brain Love said Tarling The other looked at him in surprise Love he repeated incredulously and Tarling nodded Undoubtedly Sam Stay adored Lyne It was the shock of his death which drove him mad Whiteside drummed his fingers on the table thoughtfully What do you think of Milburgh s story he asked and Tarling shrugged his shoulders It is most difficult to form a judgment he said The man spoke as though he were telling the truth and something within me convinces me that he was not lying And yet the whole thing is incredible Of course Milburgh has had time to make up a pretty good story warned Whiteside He is a fairly shrewd man this Milburgh and it was hardly likely that he would tell us a yarn which was beyond the range of belief That is true agreed the other nevertheless I am satisfied he told almost the whole of the truth Then who killed Thornton Lyne Tarling rose with a gesture of despair You are apparently as far from the solution of that mystery as I am and yet I have formed a theory which may sound fantastic There was a light step upon the stair and Tarling crossed the room and opened the door Ling Chu came in his calm inscrutable self and but for the fact that his forehead and his right hand were heavily bandaged carrying no evidence of his tragic experience Hello Ling Chu said Tarling in English you re hurt Not badly said Ling Chu Will the master be good enough to give me a cigarette I lost all mine in the struggle Where is Sam Stay Ling Chu lit the cigarette before he answered blew out the match and placed it carefully in the ash tray on the centre of the table The man is sleeping on the Terrace of Night said Ling Chu simply Dead said the startled Tarling The Chinaman nodded Did you kill him Again Ling Chu paused and puffed a cloud of cigarette smoke into the air He was dying for many days so the doctor at the big hospital told me I hit his head once or twice but not very hard He cut me a little with a knife but it was nothing Sam Stay is dead eh said Tarling thoughtfully Well that removes a source of danger to Miss Rider Ling Chu The Chinaman smiled It removes many things master because before this man died his head became good You mean he was sane He was sane master said Ling Chu and he wished to speak to paper So the big doctor at the hospital sent for a judge or one who sits in judgment A magistrate Yes a magistrate said Ling Chu nodding a little old man who lives very near the hospital and he came complaining because it was so late an hour Also there came a man who wrote very rapidly in a book and when the man had died he wrote more rapidly on a machine and gave me these papers to bring to you detaining others for himself and for the judge who spoke to the man He fumbled in his blouse and brought out a roll of paper covered with typewriting Tarling took the documents and saw that it consisted of several pages Then he looked up at Ling Chu First tell me Ling Chu he said what happened You may sit Ling Chu with a jerky little bow pulled a chair from the wall and sat at a respectful distance from the table and Tarling noting the rapid consumption of his cigarette passed him the box You must know master that against your wish and knowledge I took the large faced man and put him to the question These things are not done in this country but I thought it best that the truth should be told Therefore I prepared to give him the torture when he told me that the small small girl was in danger So I left him not thinking that your excellency would return until the morning and I went to the big house where the small small girl was kept and as I came to the corner of the street I saw her get into a quick quick car It was moving off long before I came to it and I had to run it was very fast But I held on behind and presently when it stopped at this street to cross I scrambled up the back and lay flat upon the top of the cab I think people saw me do this and shouted to the driver but he did not hear Thus I lay for a long time and the car drove out into the country and after a while came back but before it came back it stopped and I saw the man talking to the small small woman in angry tones I thought he was going to hurt her and I waited ready to jump upon him but the lady went into the realms of sleep and he lifted her back into the car Then he came back to the town and again he stopped to go into a shop I think it was to telephone for there was one of those blue signs which you can see outside a shop where the telephone may be used by the common people Whilst he had gone in I got down and lifted the small small woman out taking the straps from her hands and placing her in a doorway Then I took her place We drove for a long time till he stopped by a high wall and then master there was a fight said Ling Chu simply It took me a long time to overcome him and then I had to carry him We came to a policeman who took us in another car to a hospital where my wounds were dressed Then they came to me and told me the man was dying and wished to see somebody because he had that in his heart for which he desired ease So he talked master and the man wrote for an hour and then he passed to his fathers that little white faced man He finished abruptly as was his custom Tarling took the papers up and opened them glanced through page after page Whiteside sitting patiently by without interrupting When Tarling had finished the documents he looked across the table Thornton Lyne was killed by Sam Stay he said and Whiteside stared at him But he began I have suspected it for some time but there were one or two links in the evidence which were missing and which I was unable to supply Let me read you the statement of Sam Stay CHAPTER THE LAST THE STATEMENT OF SAM STAY My name is Sam Stay I was born at Maidstone in the County of Kent My age is twenty nine years I left school at the age of eleven and got mixed up with a bad set and at the age of thirteen I was convicted for stealing from a shop and was sent to Borstal Institute for four years On my release from Borstal I went to London and a year later was convicted of house breaking receiving a sentence of twelve months imprisonment with hard labour On my release from prison I was taken up by a society who taught me motor driving and I secured a licence in another name as a taxicab driver and for twelve months drove a cab on the streets At the end of that period I was convicted for stealing passengers baggage and was sent to prison for eighteen months It was after my release from this term of imprisonment that I first met mister Thornton Lyne I met him in the following manner I had been given a letter from the Prisoners Aid Society and went to mister Thornton Lyne to get a job He took a great interest in me and from the very first was the best friend I had ever had His kindness was wonderful and I think there never was a man in the world with such a beautiful nature as his He assisted me many times and although I went back to prison he never deserted me but helped me as a friend and was never disgusted when I got into trouble I was released from gaol in the spring of this year and was met at the prison gates by mister Thornton Lyne in a beautiful motor car He treated me as though I were a prince and took me home to his grand house and gave me food and beautiful wine He told me that he had been very much upset by a young lady whom he had looked after This young lady worked for him and he had given her work when she was starving He said that she had been spreading lies about him and that she was a bad girl I had never seen this person whose name was Odette Rider but I felt full of hatred towards her and the more he spoke about the girl the more determined I was to have revenge on her When he told me that she was very beautiful I remembered in the same gang as me at Wandsworth Gaol there had been a man named Selser That is the name as far as I can remember He was serving a lagging a term of penal servitude for throwing vitriol in the face of his girl She had let him down and had married another man while he was serving a term of imprisonment I believe she was very beautiful When Selser got out he laid wait for her and threw vitriol in her face and he has often told me that he didn t regret it So that when mister Lyne told me that the girl was beautiful this idea struck me that I would have revenge upon her I was living in Lambeth at the house of an old lag who practically took nobody but crooks as lodgers It cost more than ordinary lodging but it was worth it because if the police made any inquiries the landlord or his wife would always give wrong information I went to this place because I intended committing a burglary at Muswell Hill with a man who was released from gaol two or three days before me who knew the crib and asked me when we were at work one day if I would go in with him on the job I thought there might be a chance of getting away with the stuff if I could get somebody to swear that I hadn t left the house that night I told the landlord I had a job on the fourteenth and gave him Lone I saw mister Lyne on the fourteenth at his house and put the idea up to him I showed him the vitriol which I had bought in the Waterloo Road and he said he would not hear of my doing it I thought he only said that because he did not want to be mixed up in the case He asked me to leave the girl to him and he would settle with her I left his house about nine o clock at night telling him I was going back to my lodgings But really I went to the block of flats in the Edgware Road where this girl Rider lived I knew the flat because I had been there the night before at mister Lyne s suggestion to plant some jewellery which had been taken from the store His idea was that he would pinch her for theft I had not been able to get into the house owing to the presence there of a detective named Tarling but I had had a very good look round and I knew the way in without coming through the front door where a porter was always on duty I had no difficulty either in getting into the building or into the flat I thought it best to go in early because the girl might be out at the theatre and I should have a chance of concealing myself before her return When I got into the flat I found it was in darkness This suited my purpose very well I went from one room to another At last I came to the bedroom I made an inspection of the room looking about for a likely place where I could hide At the foot of the bed was an alcove covered by a curtain where several dresses and a dressing gown were hanging and I found that I could easily get in there behind the clothes and nobody would be the wiser There were two clothes hooks projecting outside the curtain just inside the alcove I mention these because of something which happened later Whilst I was prying around I heard a key turn in the lock and switched off the lights I had just time to get into the alcove when the door opened and a man named Milburgh appeared He turned on the lights as he came into the room and shut the door after him He looked around as though he was thinking about something and then taking off his coat he hung it on one of the hooks near the alcove I held my breath fearing that he would look inside but he did not He walked about the room as though he was looking for something and again I was afraid that I should be discovered after all but by and by he went out and came back with a small suit case It was after he had gone that I saw poking out of the pocket of the overcoat which had been hung on the hook the butt of a pistol I didn t quite know what to make of it but thinking that it was better in my pocket than in his if I were discovered I lifted it out of the pocket and slipped it into my own After a while he came back as I say and started packing the bag on the bed Presently he looked at his watch and said something to himself turned out the lights and hurried out I waited and waited for him to come back but nothing happened and knowing that I would have plenty of time if he came back again I had a look at the pistol I had It was an automatic and it was loaded I had never worked with a gun in my life but I thought I might as well take this as I intended committing a crime which might land me in jug for the term of my natural life I thought I might as well be hung as go to penal servitude Then I put out the lights and sat down by the window waiting for Miss Rider s return I lit a cigarette and opened the window to let out the smell of the smoke I took out the bottle of vitriol removed the cork and placed it on a stool near by I don t know how long I waited in the dark but about eleven o clock as far as I can judge I heard the outer door click very gently and a soft foot in the hall I knew it wasn t Milburgh because he was a heavy man This person moved like a cat In fact I did not hear the door of the bedroom open I waited with the vitriol on the stool by my side for the light to be switched on but nothing happened I don t know what made me do it but I walked towards the person who had come into the room Then before I knew what had happened somebody had gripped me I was half strangled by an arm which had been thrown round my neck and I thought it was Milburgh who had detected me the first time and had come back to pinch me I tried to push him away but he struck me on the jaw I was getting frightened for I thought the noise would rouse the people and the police would come and I must have lost my head Before I knew what had happened I had pulled the gun out of my pocket and fired point blank I heard a sound like a thud of the body falling The pistol was still in my hand and my first act was to get rid of it I felt a basket by my legs in the darkness It was full of cotton and wool and stuff and I pushed the pistol down to the bottom and then groped across the room and switched on the lights As I did so I heard the key turn in the lock again I gave one glance at the body which had fallen on its face and then I dived for the alcove The man who came in was Milburgh His back was to me As he turned the body over I could not see its face I saw him take something out of the drawer and bind it round the chest and I saw him strip off the coat and vest but not until he had gone out and I came from the recess did I realise that the man I had killed was dear mister Lyne I think I must have gone raving mad with grief I don t know what I did All I thought of was that there must be some chance and he wasn t dead at all and he must be got away to a hospital We had discussed the plan of going into the flat and he had told me how he would bring his car to the back I rushed out of the flat going through the back way Sure enough there was the car waiting and nobody was about I came back to the bedroom and lifted him in my arms and carried him back to the car propping him up in the seat Then I went back and got his coat and vest and threw them on to the seat by him I found his boots were also in the car and then for the first time I noticed that he had slippers on his feet I have been a taxi driver so I know how to handle a car and in a few minutes I was going along the Edgware Road on my way to saint George s Hospital I turned in through the park because I didn t want people to see me and it was when I had got into a part where nobody was about that I stopped the car to have another look at him I realised that he was quite dead I sat in that car with him for the best part of two hours crying as I never have cried then after a while I roused myself and carried him out and laid him on the sidewalk some distance from the car I had enough sense to know that if he were found dead in my company it would go very badly with me but I hated leaving him and after I had folded his arms I sat by him for another hour or two He seemed so cold and lonely that it made my heart bleed to leave him at all In the early light of morning I saw a bed of daffodils growing close by and I plucked a few and laid them on his breast because I loved him Tarling finished reading and looked at his assistant That is the end of the Daffodil Mystery he said A fairly simple explanation Whiteside Incidentally it acquits our friend Milburgh who looks like escaping conviction altogether A week later two people were walking slowly along the downs overlooking the sea They had walked for a mile in complete silence then suddenly Odette Rider said I get very easily tired Let us sit down Tarling obediently sunk down by her side I read in the newspapers this morning mister Tarling she said that you have sold Lyne s Store That s true said Tarling There are very many reasons why I do not want to go into the business or stay in London She did not look at him but played with the blades of grass she had plucked Are you going abroad she asked We are said Tarling We she looked at him in surprise Who are we I am referring to myself and a girl to whom I made violent love at Hertford said Tarling and she dropped her eyes I think you were sorry for me she said and you were rather led into your wild declaration of of Love suggested Tarling That s the word she replied with a little smile You were led to say what you did because of my hopeless plight I was led to say what I did said Tarling because I loved you Where are you we going she asked awkwardly To South America said Tarling for a few months Then afterwards to my well beloved China for the cool season Why to South America asked the girl Because said Tarling I was reading an article on horticulture in this morning s papers and I learnt that daffodils do not grow in the Argentine POPULAR NOVELS BY EDGAR WALLACE Published by Ward Lock company Limited In Various Editions SANDERS OF THE RIVER BONES BOSAMBO OF THE RIVER BONES IN LONDON THE KEEPERS OF THE KING
