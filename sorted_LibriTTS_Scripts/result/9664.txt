happened I haven t interrupted anything have I any little celebration or anything of that sort Eve was one of the first to congratulate me AN AMIABLE CHARLATAN CHAPTER I THE MAN AT STEPHANO s The thing happened so suddenly that I really had very little time to make up my mind what course to adopt under somewhat singular circumstances I was seated at my favorite table against the wall on the right hand side in Stephano s restaurant with a newspaper propped up before me a glass of hock by my side and a portion of the plat du jour which happened to be chicken en casserole on the plate in front of me I was in fact halfway through dinner when without a word of warning a man who seemed to enter with a lightfooted speed that considering his size was almost incredible drew a chair toward him and took the vacant place at my table My glass of wine and my plate were moved with smooth and marvelous haste to his vicinity Under cover of the tablecloth a packet I could not tell what it contained was thrust into my hand Sir he said raising my glass of wine to his lips I am forced to take somewhat of a liberty You can render me the service of a lifetime Kindly accept the situation I stared at him for a moment quite blankly Then I recognized him and transferring at once the packet to my trousers pocket I drew another glass toward me and poured out the remainder of my half bottle of hock So much at any rate I felt I had saved I shall offer you presently my self invited guest continued with his mouth full of my chicken the fullest explanation I shall also ask you to do me the honor of dining with me I think I am right in saying that we are not altogether strangers I know you very well by sight I told him I have seen you here several times before with a young lady Exactly he agreed My daughter sir Then for the sake of your daughter I said with an enthusiasm that was not in the least assumed I can assure you that whether as host or guest you are very welcome to sit at my table As for this packet Keep it for a few moments my young friend the newcomer interrupted just while I recover my breath that is all Have confidence in me Things may happen here very shortly Sit tight and you will never regret it My name so far as you are concerned is Joseph H Parker Tell me you are facing the door some one has just entered Who is it A stranger I replied a stranger to this place I am sure He is tall and dark he is a little lantern jawed a hatchet shaped face I should call it My man right enough mister Joseph H Parker muttered Don t seem to notice him particularly he added but tell me what he is doing He seems to have entered in a hurry I announced and is now taking off his overcoat He is wearing I perceive a bowler hat a dinner jacket the wrong shaped collar and he appears to have forgotten to change his boots That s Cullen all right mister Joseph H Parker groaned You re a person of observation sir Well I ve been in tighter corners than this thanks to you Who is mister Cullen and what does he want I asked mister Cullen my guest declared sampling the fresh bottle of wine which had just been brought to him is one of those misguided individuals whose lack of faith in his fellows will bring him some time or other to a bad end My young friend sip that wine thoughtfully don t hurry over it and tell me whether my choice is not better than yours Possibly I remarked with a glance at the yellow seal your pocket is longer By the by your friend is coming toward us It is not a question of pocket mister Parker continued disregarding my remark it is a question of taste and judgment discrimination is perhaps the word I should use Now in my younger days Eh What s that The person named Cullen had paused at my table His hand was resting gently upon the shoulder of my self invited guest mister Parker looked up and appeared to recognize him with much surprise You my dear fellow he exclaimed Say I m delighted to see you I am sure But would you mind just a little lower with your fingers Too professional a touch altogether mister Cullen smiled and from that moment I took a dislike to him a dislike that did much toward determining the point of view from which I was inclined to consider various succeeding incidents He was by no means a person of prepossessing appearance His cheeks were colorless save for a sort of yellowish tinge His mouth reminded me of the mouth of a horse his teeth were irregular and poor Yet there was about the man a certain sense of power His eyes were clear and bright His manner was imbued with the reserve strength of a man who knows his own mind and does not fear to speak it I am sorry to interrupt you at your dinner mister Parker he said his eyes traveling all over the table as though taking in its appointments and condition Of no consequence at all mister Parker assured him in fact I have nearly finished If you are thinking of dining here let me recommend this chicken en casserole I have tasted nothing so good for days mister Cullen thanked him mechanically His mind however was obviously filled with other things He was puzzled You must have a double about this evening I fancy he remarked I could have sworn I saw you coming out of a certain little house in Adam Street not a couple of minutes ago You know the little house I mean mister Parker smiled Seems as though that double were all right he said I am halfway through my dinner as you can see and I m a slow eater especially in pleasant company Shake hands with my friend mister Paul Walmsley mister Cullen My surprise at hearing my own name correctly given was only equaled by the admiration I also felt for my companion s complete and absolute assurance mister Cullen and I exchanged a perfunctory handshake which left me without any change in my feelings toward him Another of my mistakes I suppose mister Cullen said quietly I am afraid on this occasion however that I must trouble you mister Parker An affair of a few moments only I won t even suggest Bow Street at present If you could take a stroll with me even into Luigi s office would do mister Parker put down his knife and fork with a little gesture of irritation His broad good natured face was for the moment clouded Say Cullen he remonstrated don t you think you re carrying this a bit too far you know There isn t a man I enjoy a half hour s chat with more than you but in the middle of dinner dinner with a friend too I try to do my duty mister Cullen interrupted and I am afraid that I am not at liberty to study your comfort mister Parker sighed heavily Do you mind Walmsley having my plate kept warm and reminding the man that I ordered asparagus to follow my new friend remarked as he rose to his feet mister Cullen wants a word or two with me in private and mister Cullen is a man who will have his own way I nodded as indifferently as possible and the two men walked off together toward the entrance Then I summoned my waiter Bring me I ordered a fresh portion of chicken and order some asparagus to follow Keep my friend s chicken warm and order him some asparagus also Leaning back in my chair I tried to puzzle out the probable meaning of this somewhat extraordinary happening My acquiescence in the attitude that had been so suddenly forced upon me was owing entirely to one circumstance mister Joseph H Parker I had recognized at his first entrance as a regular habitue of the restaurant He was usually accompanied by a young lady who from the first moment I had seen her had produced an effect upon my not too susceptible disposition for which I was wholly unable to account but which was the sole reason why I had given up my club and all other restaurants and occupied that particular place for the last fortnight I had put the two down as an American and his daughter traveling in England for pleasure and my continual presence at the restaurant was wholly inspired by the hope that some opportunity might arise by means of which I could make their acquaintance Adventures in the ordinary sense of the word had never appealed to me I was privileged to possess many charming acquaintances among the other sex but not one of them had ever inspired me with anything save the most ordinary feelings of friendship and admiration The opportunity I desired had now apparently come I had made the acquaintance of mister Joseph H Parker made it in an unceremonious manner perhaps but still under circumstances that would probably result in his being willing to acknowledge himself my debtor I had a packet of something belonging to him in my pocket which was presumably valuable His friend mister Cullen I detested and the reference to Bow Street puzzled me However I had no doubt that in a few minutes everything would be explained Meantime I permitted myself to indulge in certain very pleasurable anticipations In the course of about a quarter of an hour mister Joseph H Parker reappeared He came down the room humming a tune and apparently quite pleased with himself I took the opportunity of studying his personal appearance a little more closely He was not tall but he was distinctly fat He had a large double chin but a certain freshness of complexion and massiveness about his forehead relieved his face from any suspicion of grossness He had a large and humorous mouth delightful eyes and plentiful eyebrows His iron gray hair was brushed carefully back from his forehead He gave one the idea of strength notwithstanding the disabilities of his figure He smiled contentedly as he seated himself once more at my table Really he began I scarcely know how to excuse myself mister Walmsley However thanks to you we can now dine in comfort Until now I fear I have taken your good offices very much for granted but I assure you it will give me the greatest pleasure to make your closer acquaintance and to impress upon you my extreme sense of obligation You are very kind I replied By the by might I ask how you know my name My young friend mister Parker said eying with approval the fresh portion of chicken that had been brought him it is my business to know many things I go about the world with my eyes and ears open Things that escape other people interest me Your name is mister Paul Walmsley You are one of a class of men that practically doesn t exist in America You have no particular occupation that I know of save that you have a small estate in the country which no doubt takes up some of your time You have rooms in London which you occupy occasionally You probably write a little I have noticed that you are fond of watching people You really seem to know a good deal about me I confessed a little taken aback I am not far from the mark am I You are not I admitted As regards your lack of occupation mister Parker went on I am not the man to blame you for it There are very few things in life a man can settle down to nowadays To a person of imagination the ordinary routine of the professions and the ordinary curriculum of business life is a species of slavery We live in overcivilized times There seems to be very little room anywhere for a man to gratify his natural instincts for change and adventure I murmured my acquiescence with his sentiments and my companion paused for a few minutes his whole attention devoted to his dinner Might one inquire I asked after a brief pause as to your own profession You are an American are you not I am most certainly an American mister Parker assented In business I asked mister Parker looked round Our table was comparatively isolated I am an adventurer he replied mysteriously I stared at him and repeated the word He beamed pleasantly upon me An adventurer My daughter whom you have seen here with me is an adventuress We live by our wits and we do pretty well at it Sometimes we live in luxury Sometimes we are up against it good and hard The Ritz one day you know and Bloomsbury the next but lots of fun all the time I looked at him a little blankly To a certain extent I suppose you are joking I asked To no extent at all he assured me By the by as regards that packet would you mind just slipping it under this newspaper I withdrew it from my pocket and obeyed him at once mister Parker s fingers seemed to play with it for a moment and I noticed at that moment what a strong and capable hand he seemed to have with fingers of unusual length and suppleness A dark faced maitre d hotel who presided over our portion of the room came up smiling with an inquiry as to our coffee He exchanged a casual sentence or two with mister Parker bowed and passed on mister Parker a moment later with a little smile lifted the newspaper The packet had disappeared He noticed my look of surprise and seemed gratified A mere trifle that he declared I can assure you that I could have taken it out of your pocket if I had desired without your feeling a thing Wonderful I murmured feeling distinctly uncomfortable Just a gift he continued modestly We all have our talents you know I have ordered some special coffee I was beginning to think rapidly now By the by I asked what is mister Cullen s profession He is a detective mister Parker answered without hesitation and to my mind a singularly bad one For two months he has had what they call his eye on me Between ourselves I think he will have his eye on me still in another two months time I am sure I hope so for I frankly admit that half the savor of life would be gone if my friend mister Cullen were to finally give me up as a bad job and leave me alone I suppose that something of what I was feeling was reflected in my face I had always considered myself a man of the world and I was interested enough in my fellows to enjoy mixing with all classes But there was the girl You are thinking my companion began softly Your friend I interrupted has just entered the restaurant He is coming toward this table mister Parker s expression never changed Not a muscle twitched His tone was even careless Just as well perhaps he remarked that we worked that little conjuring trick The detective stood once more at our table My instinctive dislike of him was now an accomplished thing I hated his smile of subdued triumph and all my fundamental ideas as to law and order were seriously affected by it I was distinctly on the side of my new acquaintance I am sorry to interrupt this little feast mister Cullen said but I shall have to trouble you both to come with me for a short time mister Parker carefully clipped the end of his cigar and leaned back in his chair while he lit it My friend Cullen he remonstrated I have no objection to offering myself up as a victim to your super abundant energy and trotting about with you wherever you choose but when it comes to dragging my friends into it I just want to say right here that I think you are carrying things a little too far just a little too far sir If either of you seriously object to my request mister Cullen replied doggedly I can put the matter on a different basis Who is this friend of yours and why should we go anywhere with him I asked mister Parker shook his head mournfully You may well ask he sighed You may not think it to look at his ingenuous and honest expression but the fact nevertheless remains that mister Cullen is a misguided but zealous member of the Sherlock Holmes fraternity in short a detective I rose to my feet with some alacrity Anything in the shape of an adventure I began Not much adventure about this mister Parker interrupted gloomily brushing the ashes from his waistcoat and also rising We are probably going to be searched for spoons However if it must be For the first time in my life I walked side by side with a detective He led us to the far end of the restaurant into an apartment usually used by the manager as a wine tasting office and carefully closed the door behind us Outside I caught the glimmer of a policeman s helmet Every precaution taken you perceive mister Parker remarked In case we should turn out to be desperate characters and appalled by the fear of discovery should be driven to make a personal attack upon mister Cullen a myrmidon of the law is lurking near Under those circumstances I shall eschew violence I shall submit myself peaceably to a second examination I found the affair on the whole interesting I divested myself only of my coat and waistcoat and mister Cullen s fingers did the rest Only a single and momentary frown betrayed his disappointment as ten minutes later he unlocked the door Gentlemen he said I owe you my most profound apologies That s all right Cullen mister Parker observed patting him on the shoulder but let s have this thing straight now Are we to be allowed to finish our dinner in peace or will you be turning up again with a new idea And if I take a box for the Tivoli presently shall we have the pleasure of seeing you bob in upon us So far as my present intentions are concerned mister Cullen remarked grimly you may rely upon remaining undisturbed I am sorry mister Walmsley he added turning to me to have been the cause of any annoyance to you this evening My advice to you is if you wish to escape these inconveniences through life to avoid the society of people whose character is known to the police I shall get you for libel yet Cullen mister Parker declared pulling down his waistcoat What I ve done to annoy that man I can t imagine he went on impersonally Mind he practises on me I m convinced of it mister Cullen left us abruptly and quitted the restaurant I returned to our table with my new friend Really he said I scarcely know how to apologize to you mister Walmsley This sort of thing amuses me as a rule but I must admit that mister Cullen is apt to get on one s nerves A well meaning man mind but unduly persistent I resumed my seat at the table I was feeling a little dazed Opposite talking to two ladies was the smooth faced maitre d hotel into whose keeping I felt sure that packet had gone Seated by my side was the gentleman who had assured me with the utmost self possession that he was an adventurer And standing in the doorway looking at us was the girl who for the last few weeks had monopolized all my thoughts who had played havoc to such a complete extent with the principles of my life that for her sake I was at that moment perfectly willing to range myself even among the outcasts of the world CHAPTER II THE COUP IN THE GAMBLING DEN On seeing us the girl advanced into the room I called mister Parker s attention to her and he rose at once to his feet It was a cold evening in April and she was wearing a long coat trimmed with some dark colored fur and a hat also trimmed with fur but with something blue in it She was rather tall she had masses of dark brown hair a suspicion of a fringe and deep blue eyes She came toward us very deliberately with the same grace of movement I had watched and admired night after night She gave me a glance of the slightest possible curiosity as she approached Then her father introduced us This is mister Paul Walmsley my dear he said my daughter Have you dined Eve She shook hands with me and smiled very charmingly Hours ago she replied I didn t mean to come out this evening but I was so bored that I thought I would try and find you She accepted the chair I was holding and unbuttoned her cloak You will have some coffee I begged Why that would be delightful she agreed I am so glad to find you with my father mister Walmsley she continued I know he hates dining alone but this evening I had an appointment with a dressmaker quite late and I didn t feel a bit like dinner anyhow You come here often don t you I ventured Very often indeed she replied You see it is not in the least entertaining where we are staying and the cooking is abominable Then father adores restaurants Do tell me what you have been talking about you two men all the evening The truth mister Parker remarked lighting another cigar My daughter knows that I speak nothing else It is a weakness of mine mister Walmsley and I were exchanging notes as to our relative professions I told him frankly that I was an adventurer and you an adventuress I think by now he is beginning to believe it She laughed very softly almost under her breath yet I fancied there was a note of mockery in her mirth Confess that you were very much shocked mister Walmsley she said Not in the least I assured her She raised her eyebrows ever so slightly Confess then she went on confess mister Walmsley that in all your well ordered life you have never heard such an admission made by two apparently respectable people before How do you know I asked that my life has been well ordered Look at yourself in the glass she begged Scarcely knowing what I did I turned round in my seat and obeyed her There is perhaps a certain preciseness about my appearance as well as my attire I am tall enough well over six feet but my complexion still retains traces of my years in Africa and of my fondness for outdoor sports My hair is straight and I have never grown beard or mustache I felt somehow that I represented the things which in an Englishman are a little derided by young ladies on the other side of the water I can t help my appearance I said a little crossly I can assure you that I am not a prig Our young friend mister Parker intervened has certainly earned his immunity from any such title To tell you the truth Eve he has already been my accomplice this evening in a certain little matter But for his help who knows that I might not have found myself up against it Between us we have even had a little fun out of Cullen Her expression changed She seemed for some reason none too well pleased What have you been doing she asked me I personally have been doing very little indeed I told her Your father entered the restaurant in a hurry about an hour ago and found it convenient to seat himself at my table and help himself to my dinner He intrusted me also with a packet which I subsequently returned to him It is now mister Parker declared replying to his daughter s anxious glance in perfectly safe hands She sighed and shook her head at him Daddy she murmured plaintively why will you run such risks Even mister Cullen isn t an absolute idiot you know and there might have been some one else watching mister Parker nodded You are quite right my dear he admitted To tell you the truth Cullen was really a little smarter than usual this evening However there s always the luck you know our luck If mister Walmsley had turned out a different sort of man but then I knew he wouldn t She turned her head and looked at me She had a trick of contracting the corners of her eyes just a little which was absolutely bewitching Will you tell me why you helped my father in this way mister Walmsley I returned her regard steadfastly It never occurred to me I said to do anything else after I had recognized him She smiled a little My speech was obviously sincere I think from that moment she began to realize why I had occupied the little table opposite to the one where she so often sat with such unfailing regularity What about a music hall mister Parker suggested I hear there s a good show on right across the street here Have you any engagement for this evening mister Walmsley None at all I hastened to assure him We left the place together a few minutes later and found a vacant box at the Tivoli Arrived there however mister Parker soon became restless He kept on seeing friends in the auditorium We watched him with his hat a little on the back of his head going about shaking hands in various directions How long have you been in England I asked my companion Barely two months she replied Do look at father Wherever he goes it s the same The one recreation of his life is making friends The people he is speaking to to night he has probably come across in a railroad train or an American bar He makes lifelong friendships every time he drinks a cocktail and he never forgets a face Isn t that a little trying for you I asked She laughed outright If you could only see some of the people he brings up and introduces to me We talked for some time upon quite ordinary subjects As the time passed on however and her father did not return it seemed to me she became more silent She told me very little about herself and the few personal things she said were always restrained I was beginning to feel almost discouraged she sat so long with a slight frown upon her forehead and her head turned away from me Miss Parker I ventured at last something seems to have displeased you It has she admitted Will you please tell me what it is I asked humbly If I have said or done anything clumsy give me a chance at any rate to let you see how sorry I am She turned and faced me then It is not your fault she assured me only I am a little annoyed with my father Why I think she went on it is perfectly delightful that he should have made your acquaintance It isn t that at all But I do not think he should have made use of you in the way he did He is utterly reckless sometimes and forgets what he is doing It is all very well for himself but he has no right to expose you to to To what risk did he expose me I demanded Tell me Miss Parker was he absolutely honest when he told me he was an adventurer Absolutely Was I then an accomplice in anything illegal to night Worse than illegal criminal she told me Now my father had been a judge and I had a brother who was a barrister but the madness was upon me and I spoke quickly and convincingly Then all I have to say about it is that I am glad I declared Why she murmured looking at me wonderingly Because he is your father and I have helped him I answered under my breath For a few moments she was silent She looked at me however and as I watched her eyes grow softer I suddenly held out my hand and for a moment she suffered hers to rest in it Then she drew away a little She was still looking at me steadfastly but something that had seemed to me inimical had gone from her expression mister Walmsley she said slowly I want to tell you I think you are making a mistake Please listen to me carefully You do not belong to the order of people from whom the adventurers of the world are drawn What you are is written in your face I am perfectly certain you possess the ordinary conventional ideas as to right and wrong the ideas in which you have been brought up and which have been instilled into you all your life My father and I belong to a different class of society There is nothing to be gained for you by mixing with us and a great deal to be lost May I not judge for myself I asked I fear she answered looking me full in the face and smiling at me delightfully you are just a little prejudiced Supposing I whispered I have discovered something that seems to me better worth living for than anything else I have yet found in the world I know of if that something belongs to a world in which I have not yet lived do you blame me if for the sake of it I would be willing to climb down even into She held out her finger warningly I heard heavy footsteps outside and the rattle of the doorhandle You are very foolish she murmured Please let my father in mister Parker returned in high good humor He had met a host of acquaintances and declared that he had not had a dull moment As for the performance he seemed to have forgotten there was one going on at all I am for supper he suggested I owe our friend here a supper in return for his interrupted dinner Supper by all means I agreed Remember that I am wearing a hat Eve said We must go to one of the smaller places In the end we went back to Stephano s We sat at the table at which I had so often watched Eve and her father sitting alone and by her side I listened to the music I had so often heard while I had watched her from what had seemed to me to be an impossible distance mister Parker talked wonderfully He spoke of gigantic financial deals in Wall Street of operations which had altered the policy of nations of great robberies in New York the details of which he discussed with amazing technical knowledge He played tricks with the knives and forks balanced the glasses in extraordinary fashion and reduced our waiters to a state of numbed and amazed incapacity Every person who entered he seemed to have some slight acquaintance with All the time he was acknowledging and returning greetings and all the time he talked We spoke finally of gambling and he laughed heartily when I made mild fun of the gambling scare that was just then being written up in all the papers and magazines So you don t believe in baccarat tables in London he said Very good We shall see After we have supped we shall see We stayed until long past closing time mister Parker continued in the highest good humor but Eve was subject at times to moods of either indifference or depression The more intimate note which had once or twice crept into our conversation she seemed now inclined to deprecate She avoided meeting my eyes More than once she glanced toward the clock Haven t you an appointment to night father she asked almost in an undertone Sure mister Parker answered readily I have an appointment and I am going to take you and mister Walmsley along I am delighted to hear it I exclaimed quickly I ll teach you to make fun of the newspapers mister Parker went on No gambling hells in London eh Well we shall see To my great relief Eve made no spoken objection to my inclusion in the party When at last we left a large and handsome motor car was drawn up outside waiting for us A taxicab mister Parker explained is of no use to me of no more use than a hansom cab I have to keep a car in order to slip about quietly Now in what part of London shall we look for a gambling hell mister Walmsley I know of eleven Name your own street somewhere in the West End I named one at random The very place mister Parker declared the very place where I have already an appointment Get in Say you Londoners have no idea what goes on in your own city We drove to a quiet street not very far from the Ritz Hotel mister Parker led us across the pavement and we entered a block of flats The entrance hall was dimly lit and there seemed to be no one about mister Parker however rang for a lift which came promptly down You two will stay here he directed for two or three minutes Then the lift will come down for you He ascended and left us there I turned at once to Eve who had scarcely spoken a word during the drive from the restaurant I do wish you would tell me what is troubling you Miss Parker I begged If I am really in the way of course you have only to say the word and I ll be off at once She held my arm for a moment The touch of her fingers gave me unreasonable pleasure Please don t think me rude or unkind she pleaded Don t even think that I don t like your coming along with us because I do It isn t that Only as I told my father before supper you don t belong You ought not to be seen at these places and with us For some absurd reason father seems to have taken a fancy to you It isn t a very good thing for you It very likely won t be a good thing for us Do please change your opinion of me a little I implored her I can t help my appearance but let me assure you I am willing to play the Bohemian to any extent so long as I can be with you There isn t a thing in your life I wouldn t be content to share I ventured to add She sighed a little petulantly She was half convinced but against her will You are very obstinate she declared but of course you re rather nice After that I was ready for anything that might happen The lift had descended and the porter bade us enter We stopped at the third floor In the open doorway of one of the flats mister Parker was standing solid and imposing He beckoned us with a broad smile to follow him To my surprise there were no locked doors or burly doorkeepers We hung up our things in the hall and passed into a long room in which were some fifteen or twenty people Most of them were sitting round a chemin de fer table a few were standing at the sideboard eating sandwiches A dark haired dark eyed sallow faced man a trifle corpulent undeniably Semitic who seemed to be in charge of the place came up and shook hands with mister Parker Glad to see you sir and your daughter he said glancing keenly at them both and then at me This gentleman is a friend of yours Certainly mister Parker replied I won t introduce you but I ll answer for him You would like to play I will play certainly mister Parker answered cheerfully My friend will watch for the present at any rate He waved us away himself taking a seat at the table I led Eve to a divan at the farther corner of the room We sat there and watched the people There were many whose faces I knew a sprinkling of stock brokers one or two actresses and half a dozen or so men about town of a dubious type On the whole the company was scarcely reputable I looked at Eve and sighed Well what is it she asked This is no sort of place for you you know I ventured Here it comes she laughed the real hidebound respectable Englishman I tell you I like it I like the life I like the light and shade of it all I should hate your stiff English country houses your highly moral amusements and your dull day by day life Look at those people s faces as they bend over the table Well I am looking at them I told her I see nothing but greed I see no face that has not already lost a great part of its attractiveness Perhaps she replied indifferently I will grant you that greed is the keynote of this place yet even that has its interesting side Where else do you see it so developed Where else could you see the same emotion actuating a number of very different people in an altogether different manner For an adventuress I remarked you seem to notice things No one in the world except those who live by adventures ever has any inducement to notice things she retorted That is why amateurs are such failures One never does anything so well as when one does it for one s living The question is arguable I submitted She shrugged her shoulders Every question is arguable if it is worth while she agreed carelessly Look at all those people coming in I don t understand it I confessed These places are against the law yet there seems to be no concealment at all Why aren t we raided Raids in this part of London only take place by arrangement she assured me This place will reach its due date sometime but every one will know all about it beforehand They are making a clear profit here of about four hundred pounds a night and it has been running for two months now When the raid comes mister Rubenstein I think that is his name can pay his five hundred pound fine and move on somewhere else It s wicked the money they make here some nights You seem to know a good deal about it I remarked The place interests father she told me He comes here often And you Sometimes I am not always in the humor I looked at her long and thoughtfully Her beauty was entirely the beauty of a young girl There were no signs of late hours or anxiety in her face She puzzled me more than ever I wish I knew I said exactly what you mean when you call yourself an adventuress She laughed It means this she explained To night I have money in my purse jewels on my fingers a motor car to ride home in In a week s time if things went badly with us I might have nothing Then father or I or both of us would go out into the world to replenish and from whomever had most of what we desired we should take as opportunity presented itself Irrespective of the law Absolutely Irrespective of your sense of right and wrong My sense of right and wrong according to your standards does not exist I gave it up She seemed thoroughly in earnest and yet every word she spoke seemed contrary to my instinctive judgment of her She pointed to the table Look she whispered These people don t seem as though they had all that money to gamble with do they Look There must be at least a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds upon the table It was just as she said these words that the thing happened From somewhere among the little crowd of people gathered round the table there came the sound of heavy stamping on the floor and in less than a moment every light in the room went out The place was in somber darkness Then breaking the momentary silence there came from outside a shrill whistle Again there was a silence and then pandemonium In a dozen different keys one heard the same shout The police Eve gripped my arm My matchbox was out in a moment and I struck a match holding it high over my head As it burned a queer little halo of light seemed thrown over the table The door was wide open and blocked with people rushing out The banker was still sitting in his place At first I seemed to have the idea that mister Parker was by his side Then to my astonishment I saw him at the opposite end of the table standing as though he had appeared from nowhere A stentorian voice was heard from outside Ladies and gentlemen if you please Nothing has happened The lights will be on again immediately Almost as he spoke the place was flooded with light The faces of the people were ghastly A babel of voices arose Where are the police Where are they Who said the police The little dark gentleman whose name was Rubenstein stood upon a chair Ladies and gentlemen he called out nothing whatever has happened nothing The electric lights went out owing to an accident which I will investigate It seems to have been a practical joke on the part of the lift man who has disappeared There are no police here Please take your places The game will proceed They came back a little reluctantly as though still afraid Then suddenly the banker s hoarse voice rang out through the room All the time he had been sitting like an automaton Now he was on his feet swaying backward and forward his eyes almost starting from his head Lock the doors The bank has been robbed The notes have gone mister Rubenstein don t let any one go out I tell you there was two thousand pounds upon the table Some one has the notes There was a little murmur of voices and a shriek from one of the women as she clutched her handbag mister Parker bland and benign rose to his feet My own stake has disappeared he declared and the pile of notes I distinctly saw in front of the banker has gone I fear mister Rubenstein there is a thief among us mister Rubenstein white as a sheet was standing at the door He locked it and put the key in his pocket Ladies and gentlemen he said play is over for to night We are without a doubt the victims of an attempted robbery The lights were turned out from the controlling switch by the lift man who has disappeared I will ask you to leave the room one by one and for all our sakes I beg that any unknown to us will submit themselves to be searched There was a little angry murmur mister Rubenstein looked pleadingly round Ladies and gentlemen he begged you will not object I am sure I am a poor man Two thousand pounds of my money has gone from that table all the money I kept in reserve to make a bank for you If any one will return it now nothing shall be said But to lose it all I tell you it would ruin me The perspiration stood out on his forehead He looked anxiously round as though seeking for sympathy mister Parker came over to his side Say mister Rubenstein he declared there isn t any one here who wants you to lose a five pound note that s a sure thing But there is just one difficulty about this searching business How can you identify your notes If I for instance were to insist that I had brought with me two thousand pounds in banknotes in my pocket which let me hasten to assure you I didn t how could you deny it My notes mister Rubenstein replied feverishly all bear the stamp of Lloyd s Bank and to day s date They can all be recognized In that case mister Parker continued I recommend you mister Rubenstein to insist upon searching every person here not thoroughly known to you and I recommend you ladies and gentlemen he added looking round to submit to be searched It will not be a very strenuous affair because no one can have had time to conceal the notes very effectively I think you will all agree with me that we cannot allow our friend who has provided us with amusement for so many nights to run the risk of a loss like this Begin with me mister Rubenstein No I insist upon it You know me better than most of your clients I think but I submit myself voluntarily to be searched I thank you very much indeed sir mister Rubenstein declared quickly It is very good of you to set the example he continued thrusting his hand into mister Parker s pockets Ah I see nothing here nothing Notes in this pocket ten twenty thirty Not mine I see no Lloyd s stamp Gold A pleasant little handful of gold that mister Parker I thank you sir If you will be so good as to pass into the next room I brought Eve up We were recognized as having been sitting upon the divan and mister Rubenstein with a bow and extended hand motioned to us to pass on You will visit us again I trust he said when we are not so disturbed Most certainly mister Parker promised in our names Most certainly mister Rubenstein We will all come again Good night We walked out to the landing and descending the stairs reached the street and stepped into the motor car that was waiting for us It rolled off and turned into Piccadilly How much was it father Eve asked suddenly from her place in the corner I am not sure mister Parker answered There is a matter of eight hundred pounds in my right shoe and a little more than that I think in my left The note down my back was I believe a hundred pound one Quite a pleasant little evening and fairly remunerative The lift man will cost me a hundred but he was worth it I sat quite still I felt that Eve s eyes were watching me I set my teeth for a moment and I turned toward her my cigarette case in my hand You don t mind I murmured as I lit a cigarette She shook her head Her eyes were still fixed upon me Where can we drop you mister Parker inquired If the evening is really over and there are no more excitements to come you might put me down at the Milan Court I told him if that is anywhere on your way mister Parker lifted the speaking tube to his lips and gave an order We glided up to the Milan a few minutes later I have enjoyed my evening immensely I assured Eve impressively every moment of it and I do hope mister Parker I added as I shook hands that you and your daughter will give me the great pleasure of dining with me any night this week If there are any other little adventures about here in which I could take a hand I can assure you I should be delighted I might even be of some assistance They both of them looked at me steadfastly Then Eve at last glanced away with a little shrug of the shoulders and mister Joseph H Parker gripped my hand Say you re all right he pronounced You just ring up three thousand seven hundred seventy oneA Gerrard to morrow morning between ten and eleven CHAPTER III CULLEN GIVES ADVICE At ten o clock the following morning my telephone bell rang and a visitor was announced I did not catch the name given me and it was only when I opened the door to him in response to his ring that I recognized mister Cullen In morning clothes which consisted in his case of a blue serge suit that needed brushing and a bowler hat of extinct shape he seemed to me if possible a little more objectionable than I had found him the previous night He presented himself however in a wholly non aggressive spirit mister Walmsley he said as he took the chair to which I motioned him I have called to see you very largely in your own interests I murmured something to the effect that I was extremely obliged I have made inquiries concerning you he went on and I find that you not only have a blameless record but that you are possessed of considerable means and that you belong to a highly esteemed county family And what of it mister Cullen I asked This he answered that I feel it my duty to warn you against the companions with whom you spent a portion of last evening You mean mister and Miss Parker I mean mister and Miss Parker Are you making any definite charges against this young lady and gentleman I inquired after a moment s pause Very definite charges indeed he replied I warn you mister Walmsley that this man and his daughter are in bad repute with us and to be seen associated with them is to bring yourself under police surveillance We had a special warning when they sailed from New York and since their arrival in London they have already been concerned in two or three very shady transactions If they break the law I inquired why do you not arrest them Because I have had bad luck rotten bad luck mister Cullen declared firmly I am perfectly convinced that this mister Parker as he calls himself has been financing one of the greatest artists in banknote counterfeits ever known to the police I am perfectly convinced that mister Parker left this young man in Adam Street last night with a packet of notes upon his person for which he had just paid two hundred pounds and if I could have arrested him then the game would have been up He dodged me by going into the Cecil leaving by the back way and coming through the Savoy but I picked him up again within two minutes of his reaching Stephano s Obviously with your collusion you ll pardon me sir but there the facts are he was seated at your table as though in the middle of a dinner I had him searched but there wasn t a thing on him I am not going to ask you what he did with the notes he had whether he palmed them off on you or not but I will simply say that between the time of his entering Stephano s and the time of my searching him he got rid of a thousand pounds worth of counterfeit notes Sounds very clever of him I remarked How do you know that he didn t get rid of them to some one in either the Cecil or the Savoy Because mister Cullen explained he was followed by one of my men through both places and not lost sight of for a single second You see I made sure he would come to Stephano s and I was on the other side of the Strand but I had left a man in case he went the other way I tell you he was under the strictest surveillance the whole time except during the few minutes I might almost say seconds when he disappeared in the restaurant Anything else against him I asked I am not inclined mister Cullen continued slowly to mention specifically the various cases that have come under my notice and in which I believe him to be concerned but among other things he is a frequenter of half the gambling houses in London and a tout for their owners Trouble follows wherever he goes But mister Walmsley mark my words I am not a man given to idle speech and I assure you that within a few weeks perhaps within a few days I shall have him aye and the young lady too You don t want to be mixed up in this sort of business sir I am here to give you the advice to sheer off They ll only rob you and bring you too under suspicion I lit a cigarette and stood on the hearthrug with my hands behind me mister Cullen I said it is of course very kind of you to come to me in this disinterested manner You don t seem to have anything to gain by it so I will accept your attitude as being a bona fide one I will if I may be equally frank with you I met both mister Parker and his daughter last night for the first time Then that dinner was a plant mister Cullen interrupted swiftly I knew it I ignored the interruption For the first time I repeated and I find them both most delightful companions As to how far our acquaintance may progress that is entirely a matter for chance to decide You have doubtless come here with very good motives but I see no reason why I should accept your statements concerning mister Parker and his daughter You understand My suggestion is that you are mistaken Until I have proved them to be other than they represent themselves to be I added with infinite subtlety I shall continue to derive pleasure from their society mister Cullen rose at once to his feet My warning has been given sir he said It only remains for me now to wish you good morning and to assure you most regretfully that your name will be added to those whom Scotland Yard thinks it well to watch and that your movements from place to place will be noted I trust that Scotland Yard will benefit I replied politely and showed him out At half past ten I rang up three thousand seven hundred seventy oneA Gerrard The telephone was answered almost immediately by a man apparently a servant I inquired for mister Parker and in a moment or two I heard his voice at the telephone This is Joseph H Parker speaking Who are you I am Paul Walmsley You told me I might ring up between ten and eleven Sure was the prompt reply My dear fellow I am delighted to hear from you None the worse for our little adventure last night I hope Not in the least I assured him On the contrary I am looking forward to another You shall have one was the delighted answer What about What is it Eve Excuse me for one moment mister Walmsley mister Parker was apparently dragged away from the telephone I waited impatiently He returned in a moment or two His voice sounded as though he were a little irritated Sorry he said I was going to make a little suggestion to you for this evening but my daughter here doesn t fall in with it They will have their own way these girls It s very disappointing I said Don t you think you could prevail on her Look here mister Parker continued I ll tell you what Let s meet accidentally at dinner tonight I ll talk Eve round before then You drop into Stephano s for dinner at about seven thirty Then when you see us there you can come over and join us Thank you very much I replied heartily By the by I suppose you couldn t tell me your address I should like to send Miss Parker some flowers mister Parker obviously hesitated Better not he decided regretfully not this morning at any rate Eve is a bit peculiar and if you come into our little scheme and it goes wrong the less you know of us the better See you later I did see mister Parker later but not quite so late as the time appointed He was in the American bar at the Milan when I looked in there just before luncheon and was talking to two of the most ferocious and objectionable looking ruffians I had ever seen in my life He glanced at me blandly but without any sign of recognition save that I fancied I caught the slightest twitch of his left eyebrow I took the hint and did not join him My reward came presently for after leaving the room with his two acquaintances mister Parker strolled back again and coming straight over to me clapped me on the shoulder This is capital he exclaimed We meet tonight Without a doubt I assured him He drew me a little on one side Say he inquired scratching the side of his chin have you any objection to a bit of a scrap Not the slightest I replied so long as Miss Parker is out of it Good boy mister Parker pronounced Yes we ll keep her out of it all right I shall count on you then Just keep yourself in reserve We ll talk it over at dinner time You just stroll in casually and I ll call you over By the by he added lowering his voice did you see those two fellows I was with I saw them I confessed They were just a trifle noticeable mister Parker came a little nearer to me He accentuated his words by beating on the palm of his left hand with two fingers of his right Absolutely my dear Walmsley two of the most unmitigated and desperate ruffians on either continent They looked it I agreed heartily Their record mister Parker continued their police record I mean is one of the most wonderful things ever put on paper The marvelous thing is how even for a few minutes they should be out of prison Did you notice the one with the cast in his eye I did I admitted They used to call him Angel Jake mister Parker proceeded confidentially He was sentenced to death once for shooting a policeman but there was some technicality he was tried in the wrong court so he got off A very interesting acquaintance I remarked with utterly wasted sarcasm They re fairly up to their necks in trouble both of them on the other side mister Parker declared with relish and they re kind o looking for it here I took him by the arm and led him out of the bar into a retired corner of the smoking room We sat upon a divan and had the room almost to ourselves How is Miss Parker this morning I asked Fine her father replied I told her about the flowers and it made her quite homesick Girls miss that sort of thing you know and over here living under a sort of cloud as it were one can t risk making many friends It was a very good opening for me and I took advantage of it Why do you choose to live under a cloud mister Parker I asked My dear fellow he replied earnestly I don t altogether choose I have been frank with you It s my life If it were only a question of money I began tentatively A question of money mister Parker interrupted Isn t everything a question of money Say what do you mean exactly I mean that I admire your daughter sir I admire her immensely I told him If she d have me I d marry her to morrow I am not what you would call a wealthy man but I have enough money for all reasonable purposes mister Parker was clearly staggered He stroked his waistcoat for a moment in an absent sort of way This takes my breath away he exclaimed Let us understand exactly what it means It means I told him bluntly that I ll make a settlement upon your daughter and give you enough to live on He looked first at me and then at the carpet He began to whistle softly And they always told me he murmured under his breath that you Britishers were so cautious Why you know nothing about us at all except what I ve told you and goodness knows that isn t much of a recommendation Besides I may not have told you half I am willing to take my risk I declared I simply don t care Once in a lifetime a man has that feeling for a woman If he is wise he goes nap on it I have never had it before and I am not going to let go I feel that if I do I may regret it all my life I don t want any other woman in this world except your daughter and what I possess in life worth having I am willing to give to make sure of her mister Parker sat for several moments in profound silence I could not make out what his mood was He seemed neither unduly depressed nor elated He was obviously puzzled however puzzled to know precisely what to do or what to say He sat in the middle of the divan with one thumb in his waistcoat pocket and the other hand flat upon the table His round face was innocent of smile or frown Yet I knew he was taking what I had said seriously though for some reason or other it did not seem to give him unqualified pleasure Well well he said at last You ve spoken up like a man anyway and like a man who knows what he wants I can t tell how to answer you I have never lived on any one yet Sponging s never been in my line I have enjoyed living on my wits And Eve she s a little that way too Makes me kind of sorry I ve let her go about with me so much It s a wonderful cloak of respectability you d throw over us but I m wondering whether it s large enough As my wife I began Oh yes you d gather her in all right to start with he interrupted but there are other things he added turning a little toward me and looking me in the face Suppose she didn t turn out just as you thought She s a wild high spirited sort of creature is Eve She loves the music and the rattle of life I can t fancy her in one of those out of the way God forsaken little mudholes you call an English village sitting in an early Victorian drawing room all the afternoon waiting for the vicar s wife to come to tea and taking a walk before dinner for entertainment with an umbrella and mackintosh You ve been reading Jane Austen I told him Never heard of her he replied promptly I once but never mind Just keep this to yourself for a bit my boy If we come to any arrangement there are one or two things we ve got on that we might have to drop We ll think this over So long until this evening He bustled away then evidently anxious to escape any further conversation I went about my business which consisted of a visit to my lawyer s and a couple of rubbers of bridge at my club before dinner At half past seven precisely I strolled into Stephano s I had scarcely taken my table before mister Parker and Eve entered Contrary to his usual custom mister Parker was wearing a dress coat white waistcoat and white tie and Eve looked exquisite in a low necked gown of white silk mister Parker according to his promise at once beckoned me over My dear boy he said I insist upon it that you sit down and dine with us Last night I dined with you To be literal I ate off your plate Tonight I return the compliment I had no idea of refusing but I was watching Eve with some anxiety Her attitude seemed a little negative However she welcomed me pleasantly Well she asked is your conscience beginning to prick yet My conscience I replied is about as imaginary a thing as my early Victorian drawing room I can assure you I have the most profound admiration for your father I think he is one of the cleverest men I ever met She seemed a little taken aback My tone I felt quite sure was convincing Of course she remarked it is possible I have formed a wrong idea of Englishmen I have met only one or two I should say it is highly probable I agreed What scheme of villainy is before us to night I claim a share in it at any rate She shook her head Not to night I am afraid mister Parker with the menu in front of him was busy with the waiter and a maitre d hotel I dropped my voice a little Why not Are you going to the theater To the opera You love music I asked She leaned a little toward me Her hair almost brushed my cheek as she whispered We love jewelry I flatter myself that not a muscle of my face moved No place like the opera I remarked You should do well there with a little luck This time I certainly scored She looked at me fixedly for a moment Then she laughed softly I want a pearl necklace she said What about the one you have on She held it out toward me Imitations unfortunately she sighed They may look very nice but they don t feel like the real thing Why can t I go to the opera with you I suggested Because there are no vacant seats anywhere near ours she replied You see we happen to know whom we are going to sit near Anyhow I think I shall go I decided I may be able to come and talk to you between the acts at any rate mister Parker having finished giving his orders joined in the conversation and we dined together quite cheerily For educated Americans they seemed very ignorant of English life and I was not surprised to hear that it was their first visit to Europe They listened with interest to a great deal that I told them It was only as we were preparing to leave the place that I asked mister Parker a definite question Tell me I whispered have you really any plans for to night He nodded Sure We are in luck just now There s nothing like backing it Are those fellows I saw you with this morning at the Milan in it If so I am going to take Miss Parker away There are limits He patted me on the back That little affair is off for to night at any rate A lady we are very anxious to meet is going to the opera The little girl wants a pearl necklace Well we shall see You ve thought over what I said Have you mentioned it to her Only kind of hinted at it It s no good putting it too straight to her She s got the bit between her teeth and she ll need to be humored Eve had gone to fetch her cloak and we were alone outside the door I looked at him steadfastly he was so very pink and white so very cheerful so utterly optimistic You ve never seen the inside of an English prison have you mister Parker I asked He stared at me blankly I am not thinking about you or myself I went on She s so dainty and sweet She looks like a child who has never known an hour of rough usage in her life They wouldn t leave her much of that you know I had certainly succeeded in making an impression this time mister Parker s smooth forehead was wrinkled his face was clouded You are right mister Walmsley he admitted I wish I wish she would listen to reason We ll have a talk together the three of us soon You ve no idea how difficult it is She doesn t know fear can t realize danger Hush Here she comes It will only set her against you if she thinks you are trying to influence me behind her back mister Parker s car was waiting and we drove together to Covent Garden I left them in the vestibule and went to call on some of my friends My sister had a box in the second tier and I was fortunate enough to find her there and alone with her husband Almost directly underneath us in the stalls mister Parker and Eve were sitting and next mister Parker was a woman wearing a pearl necklace I asked my sister her name She raised her lorgnette and looked over the side of the box Lady Orstline she told me Her husband is a South African millionaire Are those real pearls she is wearing I inquired My dear Paul she laughed why not Her husband is enormously wealthy and they say that her jewels are wonderful Unlike so many of those people she really does select very fine stones independent of size Those pearls she is wearing now for instance are quite small but their luster is exquisite What an extraordinary fat man is sitting next her and what a pretty girl Americans I remarked They look it she agreed Quite the Gibson type of girl isn t she The curtain went up and we turned our attention to the stage As a rule I find music soothing but that night proved an exception perhaps because my moderately well ordered life had crumbled into pieces because I was conscious of a new and overmastering passion the music appealed to me in an altogether different way My enjoyment was no longer impersonal a matter of the brain and the judgment I felt the excitement of it throbbing in my pulses The gloomy half lit auditorium seemed full of strange suggestions I felt in real and actual touch with the great things that throbbed beneath I was no longer an auditor a looker on I had become a participator The hours passed as though in a dream I talked to my sister and her husband and exchanged the usual gossip with their callers I even paid a call or two on my own account but I have no recollection of whom I went to see or what we talked about I had no chance to visit either mister Parker or Eve for neither of them left their places and they were in the middle of a row but I took good care that we were close together in the vestibule toward the end With a little shiver I saw that Lady Orstline was there too next mister Parker I was a few feet behind them both with my sister I found myself watching almost feverishly As usual there was a block outside and the few yards between us and the door seemed interminable I had none of the optimism of those others I was filled with vague fears of some impending disaster Suddenly with a shiver I recognized Cullen scarcely a couple of yards away also watching wedged in among the throng His lips were drawn closely together his opera hat was well over his forehead his eyes never left mister Parker He looked to me there like a lean faced rat preparing for its spring I followed the exact direction of his steadfast gaze and I became cold with apprehension Lady Orstline was just in front of me by her side was Eve and immediately behind her mister Parker I tried to lean over but in the crush it was impossible Some one you want to speak to Paul my sister asked There s a man there if I can only get at him The little crowd in front of us was suddenly thrown into disorder by having to let through two people whose carriage had been called We seemed to lose ground in the confusion for a moment or two later I noticed Lady Orstline standing outside the door and my heart sank as I realized that her neck was bare Almost at the same instant I saw her hand fly up and heard her voice My necklace she called out Policeman don t let any one pass out My necklace has been stolen my pearls The confusion that followed was indescribable The doors were almost barricaded My sister and her husband and I were allowed through easily enough as we were known to be subscribers but almost every one else seemed to be undergoing a sort of cross examination My brother in law was disposed to be irritable Why can t the silly woman look after her jewels he exclaimed Another advertisement I suppose Can we drop you anywhere Paul my sister inquired Or would you like to give us some supper I had been staring out of the window There was not a sign anywhere of Eve or her father nor had I been able to catch a glimpse of mister Cullen I am sorry I replied but I am supping with some friends at Stephano s Could you set me down there My sister raised her eyebrows as she gave the order We were already in the Strand Really Paul she remonstrated at your time of life you are thirty four years old mind I think you might leave Stephano s to the other generation Second childhood I explained as I descended In any case I really have an appointment here Give you supper any other night with pleasure Many thanks My first intention had been not to enter the place at all but to return at once to Covent Garden Some impulse however prompted me to glance round the room first To my amazement Eve and her father were already seated at their usual table Eve drawing off her gloves and her father with the wine list in his hand I made my way toward them I suppose my expression indicated a certain stupefaction for directly I got there Eve began to laugh softly up into my face We aren t ghosts she declared Did you think you were the only person who could leave the opera house in a hurry I saw you in the vestibule I ventured I never saw you get away No more did our friend Cullen mister Parker remarked smiling I really am beginning to feel sorry for that man We were within a yard or two of him and he was watching us good and hard I think he had an idea that Eve had a weakness for pearls Oh don t I exclaimed rather sharply Even in joke it isn t exactly wise is it with people passing all the time Joke mister Parker repeated Precious little joke about it I can assure you I dare say it looked simple enough to you but it was really quite a complicated business Never mind Eve has her pearls and that s the great thing Then he thrust his hand into his trousers pocket and without the least attempt at concealment produced and plumped upon the table in front of him the pearl necklace which only a few minutes before I had seen upon the neck of Lady Orstline Look much better on Eve when they ve been re strung won t they he observed Gee whiz What lovely stones they are Put it away I gasped For Heaven s sake put it away Why should I he asked coolly My heart suddenly seemed to stop beating I felt as though the end of the world had come With the light of triumph ablaze in his narrow black eyes mister Cullen was standing by our table Good evening mister Parker he said in a tone from which he struggled to keep the note of triumph Good evening young lady The hand of mister Parker had suddenly covered the pearl necklace mister Cullen was looking steadily toward it I trust he continued that my arrival was not inopportune I haven t interrupted anything have I any little celebration or anything of that sort On the contrary we are always pleased to see you mister Parker declared warmly Sit right down mister Cullen You ll join us I trust We were just thinking of ordering a little supper mister Cullen shook his head Perhaps he advised it would be better to postpone that order Postpone it mister Parker repeated glancing at the clock Why it s late enough now Good Heavens is that the time mister Cullen and I both glanced at the clock at the other end of the room It was twenty minutes to twelve The detective looked back with a smile You are a past master mister Parker he said in the accomplishment that I believe in your country goes by the name of bluff but there are limits you know I shall have to ask you and your daughter and mister Walmsley here to accompany me at once to Bow Street And he added suddenly leaning across the table move your right hand please Don t make a disturbance for Luigi s sake If you want trouble you can have it mister Parker raised his hand at once Trouble he echoed That s the last thing I m looking for mister Cullen smiled grimly Ah I thank you he said A pearl necklace I see You must allow me to take charge of this please mister Parker s look of surprise was admirably done That is my daughter s necklace he explained The fastening has become loose Exactly mister Cullen sneered I am now going to ask you all three to come with me without any further delay to Bow Street This man is mad mister Parker sighed leaning back in his place stark staring mad His interference with my meals is becoming unwarrantable If you take my advice you will avoid a scene the detective said leaning a little over the table Believe me I am not to be trifled with If you do not come willingly there are other means I am simply trying to avoid a disturbance in a public restaurant mister Parker rose reluctantly to his feet Eve dear he said I suppose we may as well obey this very autocratic person The sooner we go the sooner we shall be back to supper mister Walmsley I owe you my most profound apologies I had no idea when I asked you to join us that you would become involved in anything disagreeable Don t mind me I begged him I am glad to come Perhaps we had better get it over as soon as possible We shall be back mister Parker explained to Luigi who had strolled up to see what was happening in twenty minutes Prepare if you please three oyster cocktails some grilled cutlets and saute potatoes Thank you Luigi In twenty minutes mind We passed out toward the entrance mister Cullen was walking with almost professional proximity to his companion Eve and I were a few steps in the rear Eve I whispered drawing her for a moment close to me remember that whatever comes of this whatever happens there is no word I have ever said to you or to your father about you which I do not mean and shall not always mean She looked at me a little curiously From the first her own demeanor had been singularly unmoved During the last few seconds however she had grown paler She suddenly took my hand and gave it a little squeeze You really are a little more than nice she said We drove to the police station and mister Cullen ushered us at once into a private room where an inspector was seated at a table mister Hennessey sir he began I have a charge of theft against this man and his daughter I watched them at the opera house to night At the entrance they were both of them hustling Lady Orstline As you may have heard she cried out suddenly that her pearl necklace had been stolen I rushed for these two but by some means or other they got away I followed them to Stephano s restaurant and discovered them with the necklace on the table in front of them The man Parker was showing it to the other two He attempted to conceal it but I was just in time The inspector nodded Very good mister Cullen he said Where is the necklace The detective produced it proudly and laid it upon the table before him The inspector dipped his pen in the ink What is your name he asked mister Parker Joseph H Parker was the reply I am an American citizen and this is my daughter mister Cullen appears to be a person of observation It is true we were at the opera It is perfectly true we were within a few yards of Lady Orstline when she called out that her necklace was stolen There s nothing remarkable about that however as we occupied adjacent stalls What I want to point out to you is though if you ll allow me that the necklace I had on the table before me at Stephano s when mister Cullen suddenly popped round the screen the necklace you are now looking at sir is of imitation pearls valued at about ten pounds I bought it in the Burlington Arcade it belongs to my daughter and I was simply examining the clasp which is scarcely safe There was a moment s breathless silence To me mister Parker s statement seemed too good to be true yet he had spoken with the easy confidence of a man who knows what he is about Standing there the personification of respectability a trifle indignant a trifle contemptuous his words could not fail to carry with them a certain amount of conviction The inspector rang a bell by his side What are your daughter s initials he asked quickly E P Eve Parker mister Parker replied Look at the back of the gold clasp There you are he pointed out E P mister Cullen and the inspector both bent over the necklace The inspector gave a brief order to a policeman The initials on the clasp are certainly E P the inspector admitted slowly I do not pretend to be a judge of jewelry myself However I have sent for some one who is A man in plain clothes entered the room The inspector beckoned to him showed him the necklace and whispered a question The man examined the pearls for barely five seconds Then he handed them back Very nice imitation sir he pronounced There s a place in Bond Street where I should imagine these came from and another in the Burlington Arcade Their value is from seven to ten pounds The inspector dismissed him He handed the necklace back to mister Parker and rose to his feet I can only express my most profound regret sir he said on behalf of the force Such a mistake is inexcusable mister Cullen will I am sure join in offering you every apology mister Cullen was standing a few yards back He was biting his lip until it was absolutely colorless There was a look in his face that was quite indescribable If I have made a mistake this time he muttered if I have been premature I apologize but but mister Parker turned to the inspector You know he said I fancy this young man s got what they call on this side a down on me He s got an idea that I m a crook follows me about doesn t give me a moment s peace in fact Say mister Inspector can t I put this thing right somehow take him to my banker s Banker s mister Cullen ejaculated softly The only use you have for a banker is to fleece him mister Cullen the inspector exclaimed frowning I beg your pardon sir I am sorry if I forgot myself He turned abruptly toward the door I offer you my apologies mister Parker he said looking back also the young lady But some day the luck may be on my side The door slammed behind him mister Parker turned toward the inspector That young man mister Inspector he said complainingly puts altogether too much feeling into his work I may have been a bit sarcastic with him once or twice but if it comes to a lifelong vendetta or anything of that sort why he s beginning to look for trouble that s all I m getting sick of the sight of him If ever I lunch or dine out he s there If I go to a theater he s about Whatever harmless amusement I go in for he s there looking on Just give him a word of caution mister Inspector I m a good tempered man but this can t go on forever The inspector himself escorted us to the door I beg mister Parker he said that you will take no more notice of mister Cullen s little fit of temper As regards your complaint I promise you that I will talk to him seriously Allow me to send for a taxicab for you Oh I beg your pardon that is your own car I only regret that we should have wasted a few minutes of your evening Good night gentlemen Good night madam We left Bow Street amid many manifestations of courtesy and good will Where shall I tell him to go to sir the policeman asked as he closed the door Back to Stephano s mister Parker ordered We glided down into the Strand mister Parker glanced at his watch We shall just about make those grilled cutlets he remarked Gives you kind of an appetite this sort of thing Say what s the matter with you mister Walmsley Oh nothing particular I answered Only I was just wondering what in the name of all that s miraculous can have become of Lady Orstline s necklace We descended at Stephano s and were ushered to our table where the oyster cocktails were waiting mister Parker took my arm Perhaps he murmured you may even know that before you go to sleep to night I thought of mister Parker s words an hour or so later when I was preparing to undress I emptied first the things from my trousers pockets The feeling of something unfamiliar in one of them brought a puzzled exclamation to my lips I dragged it out and held it in front of me My heart gave a great leap the perspiration broke out upon my forehead My knees shook and I sat down on the bed Without the slightest doubt in the world it was Lady Orstline s pearl necklace CHAPTER IV THE WOOING OF EVE I spent a very restless and disturbed night I rose at six o clock the following morning and at ten o clock I rang up three thousand seven hundred seventy oneA Gerrard My inquiry was answered almost at once by mister Parker himself Is that you Walmsley It is I replied I have been waiting to ring you up since daylight I want you to understand You come right round here mister Parker interrupted soothingly No good getting fussy over the telephone Where to I asked You forget I don t know your address I should have been round hours ago if I had known where to find you Bless my soul no more you do We are at Number seventeen Banton Street just off Oxford Street you know I am coming straightaway I replied I was there within ten minutes The place seemed to be a sort of private hotel unostentatious and unprepossessing A hall porter whose uniform had seen better days and whose linen had seen cleaner ones conducted me to the first floor mister Parker himself met me on the landing Come right in he invited I saw you drive up Eve is in there He ushered me into a large sitting room of the type one would expect to find in such a place but which by dint of many cushions flowers and feminine knickknacks had been made to look presentable Eve was seated in an easy chair by the fire She turned round at my entrance and laughed Where s my necklace please she demanded The necklace I replied as severely as I could is by this time on its way to Lady Orstline if it is not actually in her hands You mean to say you have sent it back mister Parker exclaimed incredulously Certainly I replied I posted it to her early this morning mister Parker s expression was one of blank bewilderment Say do I understand you rightly he continued coming up and laying his great hand upon my shoulder You mean to say that after all we went through because of that miserable necklace you ve gone and chucked it Do you know it was worth twenty five thousand pounds I don t care whether it was worth twenty five thousand pounds or twenty five thousand pennies retorted I It belonged to Lady Orstline not to you or your daughter or to me I know that you are a skillful conjurer and I won t ask you how it found its way into my pocket I am only glad I have had an opportunity of returning it to its owner mister Parker shook his head ponderously He turned to Eve This he said solemnly is the young man who asked leave to join us What do you think of him Eve Nothing at all she replied flippantly He is absolutely useless If you think mister Parker went on we are in this business for our health I want you to understand right here that you are mistaken I never deceived you I told you the first few seconds we met that I was an adventurer I am I brought off a coup last night with that necklace and you ve gone and queered it It isn t for myself I mind so much he concluded but there s the child there I was going to have the pearls restrung and let her wear them a bit until the time came for selling them Look here I said Let us understand one another It s all very well to live by your wits to make a little out of people not quite so smart as you are to worry through life owing a little here and there borrowing a bit where you can and taking good care to be on the right side when there s a bargain going That I take it is more or less what is meant by being an adventurer But when it comes to downright thieving I protest The penalties are too severe I beg you mister Parker to have nothing more to do with it I went on speaking as earnestly as I could and laying my hand upon his shoulder I ask you now what I asked you yesterday Give me your daughter Or if I can t win her all at once let me at any rate have the opportunity of meeting her and trying to persuade her to be my wife I promise you you shan t have to do any of these things for a living either of you Be sensible Miss Parker Eve I begged turning to her and please be a little kind I am in earnest about this Come on my side and help me persuade your father I am not wealthy perhaps as you people count money but I am not a poor man I ll buy you some pearls Eve threw down the book she had been reading and leaned over the side of her chair looking at me She seemed no longer angry There was indeed a touch of that softness in her face which I had noticed once before and which had encouraged me to hope Her forehead was a little puckered her dear eyes a little wistful She looked at me very earnestly but when I would have moved toward her she held out her hand to keep me back You know she said I think you are quite nice mister Walmsley I rather like this outspoken sort of love making It s quite out of date of course but it reminds me of missus Henry Wood and crinolines and woolwork and all that sort of thing Anyhow I like it and I rather like you too But you see it s how long a matter of thirty six hours since I met you first Now I couldn t make up my mind to settle down for life with a man I d only known thirty six hours even if he is rash enough to offer to pension my father and remove me from a life of crime The circumstances I persisted are exceptional You may laugh at it as much as you like but there are very excellent reasons why you should be taken away from this sort of life She shrugged her shoulders a little dubiously There again she protested I am not so sure that I want to be taken away from it I like adventures I adore excitement in fact I must have it You shall I promised I ll take you to Paris and Monte Carlo We ll go up to Khartum and take a caravan beyond You shall go big game shooting with me in Africa I ll take you where very few women have been before I ll take you where you can gamble with life and death instead of this sordid business of freedom or prison We ll start for Abyssinia in three weeks if you like I ll find you excitement the right sort I ll take you into the big places where one feels and the empty places where one suffers Her eyes flashed sympathetically for a moment It sounds good she admitted and yet am I ungrateful I wonder there s no excitement for me except where men and women are I m afraid I m a daughter of Babylon Doomed from her infancy to a life of crime I fear mister Parker declared pinching a cigar he had just taken out of a box She loves the rapier play the struggle with men and women Takes risks every moment of the time and thrives on it All the same mister Walmsley there s something very attractive about the way you are talking I am not going to let my little girl decide too hastily Our sort of life s all very well when we are number one and mister Cullen s number two We can t have the luck all the time though I haven t dared to mention it in plain words I answered because the thought the mere thought of what might happen to Miss Eve is too horrible But the risk is there all the time One doesn t deal in forged notes or steal pearl necklaces for nothing and you ve an enemy in Cullen if ever any one had He means to get you both and if you give him the least chance he ll have no mercy I looked at them anxiously The whole thing seemed to me so momentous Neither of them showed the slightest signs of fear or apprehension mister Parker with his newly lit cigar in the corner of his mouth was smiling a smile of pleasant contentment Eve leaning back in her chair with her hands clasped round the back of her head was gazing at me with a bewitching little smile on her lips I am not a bit afraid of mister Cullen she declared softly Between you and me her father remarked knocking the ash from his cigar there s only one darned thing in this world we are afraid of and that thank the Lord isn t this side of the Atlantic The smile faded from Eve s lips For a moment she closed her eyes a shiver passed through her frame Don t she begged weakly I guess I ll leave it at that her father agreed Now this little proposition of yours mister Walmsley has just got to lie by for a little time perhaps only for a very short time It s a kind of business for us to make up our minds to part with our liberty or any portion of it Meanwhile if you d like to take Eve for a motor ride round and meet me for luncheon why the car s outside and if Eve s agreeable I can pass the time all right I looked at her eagerly She rose at once to her feet Why it would be charming if you have nothing to do mister Walmsley she assented I ll put my hat on at once I have nothing to do at any time now but to respect your wishes I answered firmly and wait until you are sensible enough to say Yes to my little proposition She looked back at me from the door with a twinkle in her eyes You know she said before I came over I was told that Englishmen were rather slow I shall begin to doubt it You wouldn t describe yourself exactly as shy would you mister Walmsley I don t know about that I replied but we have other traits as well We know what we want very often we get it mister Parker rose to his feet He put his hand on my shoulder He was the very prototype of the self respecting conscientious prospective father in law Young fellow he confessed I shall end by liking you I drove with Eve for about two hours We went out nearly as far as Kingston and wound up in the heart of the West End I tried to persuade her to walk down Bond Street but she shook her head To tell you the truth she confided I am not very fond of being seen upon the streets You know how marvelously clever dad is still we have been talked about once or twice and there are several people whom I shouldn t care about meeting I sighed as I looked out of the window toward the jewelers shops I should very much like I said to buy you an engagement ring She laughed at me You absurd person Why I am not engaged to you yet You are very near it I assured her Anyhow it would be an awfully good opportunity for you to show me the sort of ring you like She shook her head Not to day she decided Somehow or other I feel that if ever I do let you you ll choose just the sort of ring I shall love without my interfering Where did we say we d pick father up Here I answered as the car came to a standstill outside the Cafe Royal I ll go in and fetch him I found mister Parker seated at a table with two of the most villainous specimens of humanity I had ever beheld They were of the same class as the men with whom he had been talking at the Milan but still more disreputable He welcomed me however without embarrassment Just passing the time my dear fellow he remarked airily Met a couple of acquaintances of mine Will you join us Miss Parker is outside in the car I explained If you don t mind I will go out and wait with her You can join us when you are ready Five minutes not a moment longer I promise he called out after me Sorry you won t join us I took my place once more by Eve s side Perhaps my tone was a little annoyed Your father is in there I said with two of the most disreputable looking ruffians I have ever seen crawling upon the face of the earth What in the world induces him to sit at the same table with them I cannot imagine Necessity perhaps she remarked Very likely they are highly useful members of our industry mister Parker came out almost immediately afterward I suggested the Ritz for luncheon They looked at each other dubiously To be perfectly frank with you my dear fellow mister Parker explained as he clambered into the car and took the place I had vacated by his daughter s side it would give us no pleasure to go to the Ritz We have courage both of us my daughter and I as you may have observed for yourself but courage is a different thing from rashness We have been enjoying a very pleasant and not unlucrative time for the last six weeks with the er natural result that there are several ladies and gentlemen in London whom I would just as soon avoid The Ritz is one of those places where one might easily come across them The Carlton Prince s Claridge s Berkeley I suggested Or what do you say to Jules or the Milan grill room mister Parker shook his head slowly If you really mean that you wish me to choose he said I say Stephano s As you will I agreed I only suggested the other places because I thought Miss Parker might like a change We drove to Stephano s It struck me that Luigi s greeting was scarcely so cordial as usual He piloted us however to the table usually occupied by mister Parker On the way he took the opportunity of drawing me a little apart mister Walmsley sir he said can you tell me anything about mister Parker and his daughter Anything about them I repeated That they are Americans I know he continued and that the young lady is beautiful well one has eyes It is not my business to be too particular as to the character of those who frequent my restaurant but twice mister Parker has been followed here by a detective and last night as you know they left practically under arrest It is not good for my restaurant mister Walmsley to have the police so often about and if mister Parker and his daughter are really of the order of those who pass their life under police supervision I would rather they patronized another restaurant I only laughed at him My dear Luigi I protested be careful how you turn away custom mister Parker is I should think no better or any worse than a great many of your clients If one could but keep the police out of it Luigi observed Could you drop a word to the gentleman sir Since I have seen them in your company I have naturally more confidence but it is not good for my restaurant to have it watched by the police all the time I ll see what can be done Luigi I promised him mister Parker was twice called up on the telephone during luncheon time He seemed throughout the meal preoccupied and more than once with a word of apology to me he and Eve exchanged confidential whispers I felt certain that something was in the air some new adventure from which I was excluded and my heart sank as I thought of all the grim possibilities overshadowing it I watched them with their heads close together mister Parker apparently unfolding the details of some scheme and it seemed to me that after all the wisest thing I could do was to bid this strange pair farewell after luncheon and return either to the country or cross over to Paris for a few days And then a chance word a little look from Eve a little touch from her fingers as it occurred to her that I was being neglected made me realize the absolute impossibility of doing anything of the sort For a person of my habits of life and temperament I had certainly fallen into a strange adventure Not only had Eve herself come to mean for me everything that was real and vital in life but I was most curiously attracted by her terrible father I liked him I liked being with him He was a type of person I had never met before in my life and one whom I thoroughly appreciated I sat and watched him during an interval of the conversation Geniality and humor were stamped upon his expression I am enjoying life he seemed to say to everybody Come and enjoy it with me What a man to be walking the tight rope all the time to be risking his character and his freedom day by day If there is anything more on hand I said trying to make my tone as little dejected as possible I should like to be in it mister Parker scratched his chin I am not sure that you really enjoy these little episodes Of course I don t enjoy them I admitted indignantly You know that I hate them I am miserable all the time simply because of what may happen to you and to Miss Eve mister Parker sighed There you are you see he declared That s the one kink in your disposition sir which places you irrevocably outside the class to which Eve and I belong Now let me ask you this young man he went on What is the most dangerous thing you ve ever done I ve played some tough polo I remembered That ll do mister Parker declared Now tell me When you turned out you knew perfectly well that a broken leg or a broken arm perhaps a cracked skull was a distinct possibility Did you think about this when you went into the game Did you think about it while you were playing Of course I didn t I admitted Just so mister Parker concluded triumphantly That s where the sporting instinct comes in You know a thing is going to amuse and excite you Beyond that you do not think But in this case I persisted I think it is your duty to think for your daughter s sake Eve flashed upon me the first angry glance I had seen from her I think she decided coldly it is not worth while discussing this matter with mister Walmsley We are too far apart in our ideas He has been brought up among a different class of people and in a different way Besides he misses the chief point If I weren t an adventuress mister Walmsley I might have to become a typist and daddy might have to serve in a shop Don t you think that we d rather live really live mind even for a week or two of our lives than spend dull years as we have done upon the treadmill I give it up I said There is only one argument left You know quite well that the pecuniary excuse exists no longer She looked at me and her face softened You are a queer person she murmured You are so very English so very set in your views so very respectable and yet you are willing to take us both I am only thinking of marrying you I interrupted Well you were going to make daddy an allowance weren t you With great pleasure I assured her vigorously and I only wish you d take my hand now and we d fix up everything to morrow We could go down and see my house in the country Eve I think you d love it and there are such things even in England you know as special licenses You dear person she laughed I can t be rushed into respectability like this Perhaps that was really my first moment of genuine encouragement for there had been a little break in her voice something in her tone not altogether natural If only we had been alone if even another summons to the telephone had come just then for her father Fortune however was not on my side Instead the waiter appeared with the bill and diverted my attention Eve and her father whispered together The moment had passed Anything particular on this afternoon Walmsley mister Parker asked as he rose to his feet Not a thing I replied I have just got to hurry off he explained a little matter of business Eve has nothing to do for an hour or so I ll look after her if I may I interposed eagerly Don t be later than half past five Eve her father directed as he went off and don t be tired We followed him a few minutes later into the street A threatening shower had passed away The sky overhead was wonderfully soft and blue the air was filled with sunlight fragrant with the perfume of barrows of lilac drawn up in the gutter Eve walked by my side her head a little thrown back her eyes for a moment half closed But London is delicious on days like this she exclaimed What are you going to do with me mister Walmsley Take you down to the Archbishop of Canterbury and marry you I threatened She shook her head I couldn t be married on a Friday Let us go and see some pictures instead We went into the National Gallery and wandered round for an hour She knew a great deal more about the pictures than I did and more than once made me sit down by her side to look at one of her favorite masterpieces I want to go to Bond Street now she said when we left I think it will be quite all right at this time in the afternoon and there are some weird things to be seen there Do you mind We walked again along Pall Mall Passing the Carlton she suddenly clutched at my arm A little stifled cry escaped her the color left her cheeks We increased our speed Presently she breathed a sigh of relief Heavens what an escape she exclaimed Do you think he saw me Do you mean the young man who was getting out of the taxicab She nodded One of our victims she murmured daddy s victim rather I didn t do a thing to him I am quite sure he didn t see you I told her He was struggling to find change She sighed once more The incident seemed to have shaken her The worst of our sort of life is she confided that it must soon come to an end We have victims all over the place One of them is bound to turn up and be disagreeable sooner or later I should say then I remarked that the moment is opportune for a registrar s office and a trip to Abyssinia And leave daddy to face the music alone she objected It couldn t be done We turned into a tea shop and sat in a remote corner of the place I had made up my mind to say no more to her that day but the opportunity was irresistible There was a little desultory music a hum of distant conversation and Eve herself was thoughtful I pleaded with her earnestly Eve I begged if only you would listen to me seriously I simply cannot bear the thought of the danger you are in all the time Give it up dear this moment to day We ll lead any sort of life you like We ll wander all over Europe America if you say the word I am quite well enough off to take you anywhere you choose to go and still see that your father is quite comfortable You ve made such a difference in such a short time She was certainly quieter and her tone was softer She avoided looking at me Perhaps she said very gently this feeling you speak of would pass away just as quickly There isn t any fear of that I assured her As I care for you now Eve I must care for you always and you know it s torture for me to think of you in trouble perhaps in disgrace As my wife you shall be safe You ll have me always there to protect you I should like to take you even farther afield for a time to India or Japan if you like and then come back and start life all over again You re rather a dear she murmured softly I will tell you something at any rate I do care for you a little better than I ve ever cared for any one else but I can t decide quite so quickly Give up this adventure to night I begged I hate to mention it Eve but if money I put my checkbook in my pocket to day If your father would only She stopped me firmly After the things you have told me she said I don t think I could bear to have him take your money to day I can t quite do as you wish but what you have said shall make a difference I promise you I can t say more Please drive me home now CHAPTER V mister SAMUELSON The moment I opened my paper the next morning the very announcement I had dreaded to find was there in large type 
7423-89164-0000	train-other-500	I read the particulars breathlessly DARING BURGLARY IN HAMPSTEAD LADY LOSES TWO THOUSAND POUNDS WORTH OF JEWELRY The burglary had taken place at the house of a mister and missus Samuelson in Wood Grove Hampstead
none	none	 It appeared that a dinner party had been given at the house during the evening 
7423-89164-0001	train-other-500	which had engaged the attention of the whole of the staff of four servants and that for an hour or so
none	none	 the upper premises were untenanted Upon retiring to rest missus Samuelson found that her jewel case and the whole of her jewelry except what she was wearing had been stolen As no arrest had yet been made the references to the affair were naturally guarded 
7423-89164-0002	train-other-500	The paragraph even concluded without the usual formula as to the police having a clew On the whole I put the paper down with a slight feeling of relief I felt that it might have been worse
7423-89164-0003	train-other-500	I breakfasted at nine o clock after having read the announcement through again trying to see whether there was any possible connection between it and my friends Then I lit a pipe
none	none	 and sat down to wait until I could ring up three thousand seven hundred seventy oneA Gerrard About ten o clock however my own telephone bell rang and I was informed that a gentleman who desired to see me was waiting below 
7423-89164-0005	train-other-500	I told the man to send him up and in a moment or two there was a knock at my door In response to my invitation to enter a short dark Jewish looking person with olive complexion
7423-89164-0006	train-other-500	shiny black hair and black mustache presented himself He carried a very immaculate silk hat and was dressed with great neatness He had the air however of a man who is suffering from some agitation
7423-89164-0007	train-other-500	mister Walmsley I believe he asked mister Paul Walmsley That is my name Know you by hearsay quite well sir my visitor assured me with a flash of his white teeth
7423-89164-0008	train-other-500	Very glad to meet you indeed I have done business once or twice with your sister the Countess of Aynesley business in curios You know my place I dare say in saint James Street My name is Samuelson
7423-89164-0009	train-other-500	I could scarcely repress a little start which he was quick to notice Perhaps you ve been reading about that affair at my house last night he asked That is precisely what I have been doing I admitted Please sit down mister Samuelson
7423-89164-0010	train-other-500	I wheeled an easy chair up for him and placed a box of cigarettes at his elbow Quite a mysterious affair I continued
none	none	 It is almost the first burglary I have ever read of in which the police have not been said to possess a clew mister Samuelson who seemed gratified by his reception lit a cigarette and crossed his legs displaying a very nice pair of patent boots with gray suede tops It is a very queer affair indeed he told me confidentially The police have been taking a lot of trouble about it and a very intelligent sort of fellow from Scotland Yard has been in and out of the house ever since 
7423-89164-0011	train-other-500	Any clew at all I asked Rather hard to say mister Samuelson replied You ll be wondering what I ve come to see you about Well I ll just explain Of course there s always the chance that some one may have entered the house while we were all at dinner
7423-89164-0012	train-other-500	crept upstairs quietly and got away with the jewel case but this Johnny I was telling you about from Scotland Yard seems to have got hold of a theory that has rather knocked me of a heap Very delicate matter mister Samuelson continued
none	none	 as you will understand when I tell you that he thinks it may have been one of my guests who was in the show 
7423-89164-0013	train-other-500	Seems a little far fetched to me I remarked but one never knows You see mister Samuelson explained there s no back exit from my house without climbing walls and that sort of thing
7423-89164-0014	train-other-500	and it happened to be a particularly light evening as you may remember There are policemen at both ends of the road who seem unusually confident that no one carrying a parcel of any sort passed at anything like the time when the thing was probably done
7423-89164-0015	train-other-500	This is where the Johnny from Scotland Yard comes in He has got the idea into his head that the jewels might have been taken away in the carriage of one of my guests Well I remarked
none	none	 I should have thought you would have been the best judge as to the probability of that You hadn t any strangers with you I suppose 
7423-89164-0016	train-other-500	Only two mister Samuelson replied We were ten altogether he went on counting upon his fingers and a very nice little party too First of all my wife and myself Then mister and missus Max Solomon
7423-89164-0017	train-other-500	Solomon the great fruiterers in Covent Garden you know man worth a quarter of a million of money and a distant connection of my wife very distant worse luck Then there was mister Sidney Hollingworth a young man in my office
7423-89164-0018	train-other-500	but he doesn t count because he stayed on chatting with me about business after the others had gone and he was with us when the theft was discovered Then there was my wife s widowed sister missus Rosenthal We can leave her out
7423-89164-0019	train-other-500	That s six Then there was Alderman Sir Henry Dabbs and his wife You may know the name
none	none	 large portmanteau manufacturers in Spitalfields 
7423-89164-0020	train-other-500	and certain to be Lord Mayor before long His wife was wearing jewelry herself last night worth I should say from twenty to twenty five thousand pounds so my wife s little bit wouldn t do them much good eh It certainly doesn t seem like it I admitted
7423-89164-0021	train-other-500	So far your list of guests seems to have been entirely reputable The only two left mister Samuelson concluded are an American gentleman and his daughter a mister and Miss Parker whom we met on the train coming up from Brighton
7423-89164-0022	train-other-500	a very delightful gentleman and most popular he was with all of us The young lady too was perfectly charming To hear him talk I should have put him down myself as a man worth all the money he needed and more
none	none	 and the young lady had got that trick of wearing her clothes and talking as though she were born a princess 
7423-89164-0023	train-other-500	Real style I should have said both of them Still
none	none	 the fact remains that they came in a motor car with two men servants 
7423-89164-0024	train-other-500	that it waited for them and that this detective from Scotland Yard mister Cullen I think his name is has fairly got his knife into them And now I remarked smiling you are perhaps coming to the object of your visit to me
7423-89164-0025	train-other-500	Exactly mister Samuelson admitted The fact of it is that in the course of conversation your name was mentioned I forget exactly how it cropped up but it did crop up
none	none	 mister Parker it seems has the privilege of your acquaintance 
7423-89164-0026	train-other-500	at any rate he claims it Now if his claim is a just one and if you can tell me mister Parker is a friend of yours why that ends the matter so far as I am concerned
none	none	 I am not going to have my guests worried and annoyed by detectives for the sake of a handful of jewels 
7423-89164-0027	train-other-500	I thank goodness I can afford to lose them if they must be lost and I can replace them this afternoon without feeling it Now you know where we are mister Walmsley
none	none	 You understand exactly why I have come to see you eh 
7423-89164-0028	train-other-500	I pressed another cigarette upon him and lit one myself I do understand mister Samuelson I told him and I appreciate your visit very much indeed I am exceedingly glad you came
none	none	 mister Parker told you the truth 
7423-89164-0029	train-other-500	He is a gentleman for whom I have the utmost respect and esteem I consider his daughter too one of the most charming young ladies I have ever met I am planning to give a dinner party within the course of the next few evenings
none	none	 purposely to introduce them to some of my friends with whom they are as yet unacquainted 
7423-89164-0030	train-other-500	and I am hoping that almost immediately afterward they will be staying with my sister at her place down in Suffolk With the Countess of Aynesley mister Samuelson said slowly Certainly I agreed
7423-89164-0031	train-other-500	I am quite sure my sister will be as charmed with them as I and many other of my friends are mister Samuelson rose to his feet brushed the cigarette ash from his trousers and took up his hat
7423-89164-0032	train-other-500	mister Walmsley he said holding out his hand I am glad I came
none	none	 You have treated me frankly and in a most gentlemanly manner 
7423-89164-0033	train-other-500	I can assure you I appreciate it Not under any circumstances would I allow friends of yours to be irritated by the indiscriminate inquiries of detectives The jewels can go hang sir
7423-89164-0034	train-other-500	He shook hands with me and permitted me to show him out
none	none	 after which he marched down the corridor humming gayly to himself 
7423-89164-0035	train-other-500	determined to have me understand that a trifling loss of two thousand pounds worth of jewelry was in reality nothing I stood for some time with my back to the fire smoking thoughtfully Then the telephone bell rang
7423-89164-0036	train-other-500	My gloomier reflections were at once forgotten It was Eve who spoke Good morning mister Walmsley Good morning Miss Eve I replied Are you very busy this morning she asked
7423-89164-0037	train-other-500	Nothing in the world to do I answered promptly Then please come round she directed ringing off almost at once I was there in ten minutes The hall porter who had not yet completed his morning toilet
7423-89164-0038	train-other-500	conducted me upstairs In the morning sunlight the whole appearance of the place seemed shabbier and dirtier than ever Inside the sitting room however everything was different My own flowers had apparently been supplemented by many others mister Parker
7423-89164-0039	train-other-500	as pink and white as usual looking the very picture of content and good digestion was smoking a large cigar and reading a newspaper Eve was seated at the writing table
7423-89164-0040	train-other-500	but she swung round at my entrance and held out both her hands The flowers are lovely she murmured
none	none	 Do go and sit down and talk to daddy while I finish this letter 
7423-89164-0041	train-other-500	I shook hands with mister Parker He laid down the newspaper and smiled at me A pleasant dinner last night I trust I inquired His eyes twinkled Most humorous affair he declared
7423-89164-0042	train-other-500	I wouldn t have missed it for worlds From a business point of view I began dryly mister Parker shook his head mister Samuelson s jewels he complained were like his wines all sparkle and outside
7423-89164-0043	train-other-500	no body to them Two thousand pounds indeed Why we shall be lucky if we clear four hundred The man s coolness absolutely took me aback For a moment I simply stared at him
7423-89164-0044	train-other-500	He ll be round to see you this morning sometime about my character mister Parker proceeded He has already paid me a visit I said grimly He was round at ten o clock this morning You don t say mister Parker murmured He looked at me hopefully
none	none	 His expression was like nothing else but the wistful smile of a fat boy expecting good news Oh of course I told him the usual thing I admitted 
7423-89164-0045	train-other-500	I told him you were a close personal friend a sort of amateur millionaire a person of the highest respectability everything you ought to be in fact He went away perfectly satisfied and determined to have nothing to do with the guest theory
7423-89164-0046	train-other-500	mister Parker patted me on the shoulder My boy he said I knew I could rely on you I propose I continued elaborating upon the scheme that had come into my head on the way to do more than this for you
7423-89164-0047	train-other-500	I am asking some friends to dine to night whom I wish you and your daughter to meet You will then be able to refer to other reputable acquaintances in London besides myself Eve turned round in her chair to listen
7423-89164-0048	train-other-500	mister Parker whose first expression had been one of unfeigned delight suddenly paused My boy he expostulated I don t want to take advantage of you
none	none	 Do you think it s quite playing the game on your friends to introduce to them two people like ourselves 
7423-89164-0049	train-other-500	You know what it means I know perfectly well I agreed but as some day or other I m going to marry Eve it seems to me the thing might as well be done They were both perfectly silent for several moments
7423-89164-0050	train-other-500	They looked at each other There were questions in his face other things in hers I strolled across to the window If you d like to talk it over I suggested don t mind me All the same I insist upon the party
7423-89164-0051	train-other-500	It s uncommonly kind of you sure mister Parker said thoughtfully
none	none	 The more I think it over the more I feel impressed by it 
7423-89164-0052	train-other-500	but do you know there s something about the proposition I can t quite cotton to Seems to me you ve some little scheme of your own at the back of your head You haven t got it in your mind have you that you re sort of putting us on our honor
7423-89164-0053	train-other-500	I have no ulterior motive at all I declared mendaciously Eve rose to her feet and came across to me She was wearing a charming morning gown of some light blue material with large buttons tight fitting
7423-89164-0054	train-other-500	alluring and there was a little quiver of her lips a provocative gleam in her eyes which I found perfectly maddening I think we won t come thank you she decided Why not
7423-89164-0055	train-other-500	You see she explained I am rather afraid We might get you into no end of trouble with some of your most particular friends There are one or two people you know in London especially among the Americans
none	none	 who might say the unkindest things about us No one my dear Eve I assured her stolidly shall say anything to me or to any one else about my future wife For a moment her expression was almost hopeless She shook her head 
7423-89164-0056	train-other-500	I don t know what to do with him daddy she exclaimed turning toward her father in despair I m afraid you ll have to marry him if he goes on mister Parker declared gloomily
none	none	 that is he added as though he had suddenly perceived a ray of hope about the matter unless we should by any chance get into trouble first 
7423-89164-0057	train-other-500	Meantime I ventured we will dine at eight o clock at the Milan mister Parker groaned At the Milan he echoed Worse and worse We shall be recognized for certain
7423-89164-0058	train-other-500	There s a man lives there whom I did out of a hundred pounds just a little variation of the confidence trick Nothing he can get hold of you understand but he knows very well that I had him Look here Walmsley be reasonable
7423-89164-0059	train-other-500	Hadn t you better drop this chivalrous scheme of yours young fellow The dinner is a fixture I replied firmly Can I borrow Miss Eve please I want to take her for a motor ride
7423-89164-0060	train-other-500	You cannot sir mister Parker told me Eve has a little business of her own or rather mine to attend to this morning You are not going to let her run any more risks are you mister Parker frowned at me
7423-89164-0061	train-other-500	Look here young man he said she is my daughter remember I am looking after her for the present You leave that to me Eve touched me on the arm Really I am busy to day she assured me I have to do something for daddy this morning
7423-89164-0062	train-other-500	something quite harmless and this afternoon I have to go to my dressmaker s We ll come at eight o clock We ll come on this condition mister Parker suddenly determined My name is getting a little too well known and it isn t my own anyway
none	none	 We ll come as mister and Miss Bundercombe or not at all 
7423-89164-0063	train-other-500	Why on earth Bundercombe I demanded For the reason I have just stated mister Parker said obstinately Parker isn t my name at all and between you and me I think I have made it a bit notorious
7423-89164-0064	train-other-500	Now there is a mister Bundercombe and his daughter who live out in a far western State of America who ve never been out of their own country and who are never likely to set foot on this side She s a pretty little girl just like Eve might be
7423-89164-0065	train-other-500	and he s a big handsome fellow just like me
none	none	 So we ll borrow their names if you don t mind You can come without a name at all so long as you come was my final decision as I took my leave CHAPTER VI THE PARTY AT THE MILAN The dinner party which I arranged for in the Milan restaurant was on the whole a great success My sister played hostess for me 
6902-89165-0001	train-other-500	and confessed herself charmed with Eve as indeed was every one else mister Parker s stories kept his end of the table in continual bursts of merriment One little incident too was in its way exceedingly satisfactory
6902-89165-0002	train-other-500	mister and missus Samuelson were being entertained by some friends close at hand and they appeared very much gratified at the cordiality of our greeting I talked with mister Samuelson during the evening and I felt that so far as he was concerned at any rate
6902-89165-0003	train-other-500	not a shadow of suspicion remained in his mind as to my two guests We sat a long time over dinner Eve was between a cousin of mine who was a member of Parliament a master of foxhounds and in his way quite a distinguished person
6902-89165-0004	train-other-500	and the old Earl of Enterdean my godfather and they were both of them obviously her abject slaves No one seemed in the least inclined to move and it was nearly eleven o clock before we passed into the private room I had engaged
6902-89165-0005	train-other-500	where coffee and some bridge tables awaited us We broke up there into little groups I left Eve talking to my sister and was on my way to try to get near her father
6902-89165-0006	train-other-500	when the Countess of Enterdean a perfectly charming old lady who had known me from boyhood intercepted me My dear Paul she said
none	none	 I cannot thank you enough for having given us the opportunity of meeting these most delightful Americans 
6902-89165-0007	train-other-500	and I really must tell you this I had meant to keep it a secret but from you I cannot I knew all the time that the name of Bundercombe was familiar to me and suddenly it came over me like a flash
6902-89165-0008	train-other-500	Directly I asked mister Bundercombe in what part of America his home was
none	none	 of course it was all clear to me What a 
6902-89165-0009	train-other-500	small world it is
none	none	 Do you know she concluded impressively that it was just these two people 
6902-89165-0010	train-other-500	mister Bundercombe and his daughter who were so amazingly kind to Reggie when he was out in the States on his way to Dicky s ranch I was for a moment absolutely thunderstruck
none	none	 Did you er remind mister Bundercombe of this 
6902-89165-0011	train-other-500	I asked She shook her head
none	none	 She had the pleased smile of a benevolent conspirator I will tell you why I did not Paul she explained 
6902-89165-0012	train-other-500	Reggie is in town just for a few days
none	none	 I have sent him a telephone message and he is wild with delight He has only just arrived from Scotland 
6902-89165-0013	train-other-500	but I told him mister Bundercombe and his daughter were here and he is rushing into his clothes as fast as he can
none	none	 and is coming round It will be so delightful for him to meet them again and I really must try to think myself what I can do to repay all their kindness to Reggie 
6902-89165-0014	train-other-500	I felt completely at my wit s end I saw the whole of my little scheme which up to now had proved so successful threatened with instant destruction Lady Enterdean passed on probably to take some one else into her confidence
6902-89165-0015	train-other-500	I crossed the room to the little group surrounding my friend and as soon as I got near him I touched him on the shoulder Just one word with you mister Bundercombe I begged The little circle of men let him through with reluctance
6902-89165-0016	train-other-500	I passed my arm through his and led him out toward the foyer You seem I declared bitterly to have chosen the most unfortunate personality I wish to goodness you had remained mister Parker
6902-89165-0017	train-other-500	This infernal name of yours Bundercombe has got us into trouble In what way he asked quickly
none	none	 Lady Enterdean has just been to me I told him 
6902-89165-0018	train-other-500	She has a son who has been traveling in the States and who was wonderfully entertained by two people of the name of Bundercombe in the very place you told me to say you came from
6902-89165-0019	train-other-500	Well that goes all right mister Parker remarked complacently We re getting the credit for it Precisely I admitted The only trouble is that Lady Enterdean has just telephoned to her son to come down at once
6902-89165-0020	train-other-500	and renew his acquaintance with you and Eve mister Parker whistled softly His face had become a blank My We do seem to be up against it he confessed uneasily
6902-89165-0021	train-other-500	The young man I continued will be here in ten minutes perhaps sooner prepared to grasp you both by the hand and exchange reminiscences mister Parker shook out a white silk handkerchief from his pocket and mopped his forehead
6902-89165-0022	train-other-500	Kind of warm out here he remarked I ll just have to talk to Eve for a minute or two He had no sooner left me than I found I was absolutely compelled to devote myself to one or two of my guests who wished to play bridge
6902-89165-0023	train-other-500	and others of whom I had seen little at dinner time I kept looking anxiously round and at last the blow fell The door opened and Lord Reginald Sidley was announced
none	none	 He looked eagerly round the room 
6902-89165-0024	train-other-500	Hope you don t mind my butting in old chap he said as he shook hands with me
none	none	 The mater telephoned that old Bundercombe and his daughter were here so I just rushed round as quick as I could Regular bricks they were to me out West I don t see them anywhere 
6902-89165-0025	train-other-500	I glanced round the room Just at that moment a waiter from the restaurant presented himself He brought me a card upon a salver The gentleman asked me to give you this sir he announced I picked it up
6902-89165-0026	train-other-500	On the back of a plain visiting card were a few hasty words scrawled in pencil So sorry but Eve is not feeling quite herself and begged me to take her home at once quietly My respects and apologies to you and all your delightful guests
6902-89165-0027	train-other-500	I read it out and passed it to Reggie His face fell
none	none	 If that isn t a sell he exclaimed 
6902-89165-0028	train-other-500	Fancy your knowing them Isn t Miss Bundercombe a topper
none	none	 She is certainly one of the most charming young women I ever met in my life I admitted I am glad at any rate Lady Enterdean declared that they have found their way to London 
6902-89165-0029	train-other-500	I shall make a point of calling on them myself tomorrow Now Paul you must go and play bridge They are waiting for you Don t bother about me I ll amuse myself quite well strolling round and talking to my friends
6902-89165-0030	train-other-500	I made up a rubber of bridge chiefly with the idea of distracting my thoughts Presently while my partner was playing the hand I rose and crossed the room to the sideboard for some cigarettes
6902-89165-0031	train-other-500	I found Lady Enterdean peering about with her lorgnette fixed to her eyes apparently searching for something Lost anything Lady Enterdean I asked
none	none	 A most extraordinary thing has happened my dear Paul 
6902-89165-0032	train-other-500	she declared resting her hand on the bosom of her gown I am perfectly certain it was there a quarter of an hour ago my cameo brooch you know the one that old Sir Henry brought home from Italy
6902-89165-0033	train-other-500	Too large to lose anyway I remarked cheerfully as I joined in the search We pulled aside a table and I almost collided with one of my most distinguished guests Sir Blaydon Harrison K C B
6902-89165-0034	train-other-500	Sir Blaydon also with an eyeglass in his eye was moving discontentedly backward and forward kicking the carpet Silly thing he observed as he glanced up for a moment
6902-89165-0035	train-other-500	That little diamond charm of mine has slipped off my fob I saw it as we crossed the foyer from the restaurant Why what has happened to us all my sister joined in
none	none	 Look at me I ve lost my pendant 
6902-89165-0036	train-other-500	Paul did you give us too much to drink or what I am not sure that this was not the most awful moment of my life A cold shiver of fear suddenly seized me I looked from one to the other speechless
6902-89165-0037	train-other-500	If appearances had gone for anything at that moment
none	none	 I must indeed have looked guilty Most extraordinary I mumbled Oh the things will turn up all right without a doubt Lady Enterdean declared good humoredly Could we have a couple of waiters in and search properly Paul My knees are a little too old for this stooping If you ll please all wait a few minutes 
6902-89165-0038	train-other-500	I begged earnestly I ll go out and make inquiries Sir Blaydon take my place in that rubber of bridge there s a good fellow I ll have the restaurant searched too Don t mind if I am away a few minutes I hurried out
none	none	 As soon as the door of the private room was closed I made for the entrance of the restaurant as fast as I could sprint 
6902-89165-0039	train-other-500	Without hat or coat I jumped into a taxi and in less than ten minutes I was mounting the stairs of Number seventeen Banton Street with the hall porter blinking at me from his office I scarcely went through the formality of knocking at the door mister Parker and Eve were both standing at the table
6902-89165-0040	train-other-500	their heads close together At the sound of my footsteps and precipitate entrance mister Parker swung round One hand was still behind him Upon the table a white silk handkerchief was lying My dear fellow he exclaimed
6902-89165-0041	train-other-500	My dear Walmsley What has happened I opened my lips and closed them again It really seemed impossible to say anything
6902-89165-0042	train-other-500	mister Parker s expression had never been so boyish so earnest and yet so wistful Eve was quivering with some emotion the nature of which I could not at once divine I felt very certain however
6902-89165-0043	train-other-500	that she had been remonstrating with her father Don t keep us in suspense my dear fellow mister Parker implored What has gone wrong Eve and I were just just talking over
none	none	 your delightful party 
6902-89165-0044	train-other-500	And looking over the spoils I said grimly I went a little farther into the room mister Parker with a sigh abandoned his position
6902-89165-0045	train-other-500	He unclosed the fingers of his hand and removed the silk handkerchief I saw upon the table my aunt s brooch my sister s pendant and Sir Blaydon Harrison s diamond pig
6902-89165-0046	train-other-500	I said not a word I looked at them and I looked at mister Parker He smiled weakly and scratched his chin I didn t do so badly
6902-89165-0047	train-other-500	he essayed apologetically To tell you the truth I really hadn t meant Never mind what you meant I interrupted Please give me those things back again at once
none	none	 Eve dropped them into the handkerchief twisted them up and passed them across to me I told daddy it was rather a mean trick she sighed 
6902-89165-0048	train-other-500	but really you know no people ought to carry about their valuables like that It was trying us a little too high wasn t it And dear Reggie did he arrive For the first time I was really angry with Eve
6902-89165-0049	train-other-500	If you will allow me I said I will pursue this conversation to morrow morning I tore downstairs jumped into the waiting taxi and returned to the Milan I entered the private room with a grave face
6902-89165-0050	train-other-500	Evidently I was only just in time The rubber of bridge had been broken up and my guests were standing about in little groups talking I closed the door behind me and held up my hand Blanche I announced Lady Enterdean
6902-89165-0051	train-other-500	I am delighted to say I have recovered
none	none	 everything My dear boy how wonderfully clever of you 
6902-89165-0052	train-other-500	Lady Enterdean exclaimed How relieved I feel Most satisfactory I am sure She sat down promptly There was a little murmur of voices My guests gathered round me I drew a long breath
6902-89165-0053	train-other-500	and continued on my mendacious career I have been closeted with the manager I explained It was one of the underwaiters the little dark one who brought in the coffee
none	none	 The temptation seems to have been too much for him 
6902-89165-0054	train-other-500	He confessed directly he was questioned He has restored everything and I thought it best to have him simply turned off without any fuss Here is your pig Sir Blaydon your pendant Blanche your brooch Lady Enterdean
6902-89165-0055	train-other-500	I am exceedingly sorry you should have had any anxiety but all s well that ends well I wound up weakly Every one was talking cheerfully The great topic now was one of ethics
6902-89165-0056	train-other-500	Had I acted properly in not charging the waiter
none	none	 Fortunately some one discovered a little later that it was twelve o clock and my little party broke up CHAPTER VII ONE OF US I was not altogether surprised to receive on the following morning before I had finished breakfast a visit from Reggie 
6902-89167-0001	train-other-500	Cheero he said brightly as he seated himself in my easy chair and tapped the end of one of my cigarettes upon the tablecloth I haven t been up so early for months but
none	none	 I had to find you before you went out about these Bundercombes 
6902-89167-0002	train-other-500	What about them I want their address of course Reggie continued
none	none	 The mater wants to call this afternoon and I m 
6902-89167-0003	train-other-500	all for seeing Miss Bundercombe again Ripping girl isn t she Then prepare yourself for a disappointment my friend I advised glancing at the clock They left for Paris by the nine o clock train this morning
6902-89167-0004	train-other-500	Reggie stared at me blankly Gone already I nodded and invented a little difficulty with my coffee pot Theirs was only a flying visit I explained I was lucky to get hold of them for my dinner
6902-89167-0005	train-other-500	I m hanged if I understand this Reggie remarked looking at me suspiciously Why
none	none	 I spent the best part of three weeks with them in that Godforsaken hole out West 
6902-89167-0006	train-other-500	and they were as keen as mustard on my taking them round London How long have they been here Not long I answered Sure you won t have some coffee
none	none	 Reggie ignored the invitation They ve got my address and there are the directories he continued The funny part of it is too that I heard from missus Bundercombe a week or so ago 
6902-89167-0007	train-other-500	and she never said a word about any of them coming over They seem to have made their minds up all of a sudden I explained They spoke of it as quite a flying trip Reggie coughed and stared for a moment at the end of his boot
6902-89167-0008	train-other-500	Can t understand it at all he repeated Devilish queer thing anyway I say Paul you re sure it s all right I suppose All right
none	none	 What do you mean 
6902-89167-0009	train-other-500	Between you and me he went on don t give it away outside this room you know but there have been rumors going about concerning an American and his pretty daughter over here regular wrong uns
none	none	 They ve been up to all sorts of tricks and only kept out of prison by a fluke 
6902-89167-0010	train-other-500	You re not associating these people whoever they may be with mister and Miss Bundercombe I asked sternly Reggie gazed once more at the point of his boot The thing is he remarked
6902-89167-0011	train-other-500	are your friends mister and Miss Bundercombe at all Don t talk rot
none	none	 It may be rot Reggie admitted slowly 
6902-89167-0012	train-other-500	or it may not By the by where did you meet them If you don t mind I answered we won t discuss them any longer At least Reggie insisted will you tell me this
6902-89167-0013	train-other-500	Where have they been staying in London I shall go there and see whether they have left any address for letters to be forwarded I shall tell you nothing I decided As a matter of fact I am finding you rather a nuisance
6902-89167-0014	train-other-500	Reggie picked up his hat There is something more in this he said didactically than meets the eye Machiavellian I scoffed Be off Reggie I had tea with Eve that afternoon
6902-89167-0015	train-other-500	and broached the subject of Reggie s visit as delicately as I could You remember Lord Reggie Sidley I asked Lord Reggie what Eve exclaimed Sidley I repeated firmly
6902-89167-0016	train-other-500	He spent three weeks with you out at your home in Okata His threatened arrival last night was the cause of your father s precipitate retreat and yours Oh that young man
none	none	 Eve remarked airily Well what about him 
6902-89167-0017	train-other-500	He has been round to see me this morning I told her wanted your address She sighed London will be getting too hot for us soon she murmured Am I engaged to him or anything
6902-89167-0018	train-other-500	Eve I said when are you going to let me announce our engagement Our what she demanded Engagement I repeated I have proposed to you two or three times
6902-89167-0019	train-other-500	I will do it again if you like Pray don t she begged You are not going to tell me are you she added looking at me with wide open eyes
none	none	 that I have accepted you You haven t refused me 
6902-89167-0020	train-other-500	I pointed out If I haven t she assured me it has been simply to save your feelings I gulped down a little rising storm of indignation
none	none	 You must marry sometime Eve I said There isn t any one in America is there 
6902-89167-0021	train-other-500	There are a great many she assured me It was to get away from them as much as anything that I came over with father on this business trip Business trip I groaned
6902-89167-0022	train-other-500	Oh I dare say it all seems very disgraceful to any one like you
none	none	 you who were born with plenty of money and have never been obliged to earn any 
6902-89167-0023	train-other-500	and have mixed with respectable people all your life she exclaimed All the same let me tell you there are plenty of charming and delightful people going about the world earning their living by their wits simply because they are forced to
6902-89167-0024	train-other-500	There is more than one code of morals you know I flatter myself that at this point I was tactful My dear Eve I reminded her you forget that I have joined the gang I mean
6902-89167-0025	train-other-500	I corrected myself hastily that I have offered to associate myself with you and your father in any of your enterprises I am perfectly willing to give up anything in life you may consider too respectable At the same time I must say
6902-89167-0026	train-other-500	there are limits so far as you are concerned She pouted a little I hate being out of things she said No need for you to be altogether I continued
6902-89167-0027	train-other-500	Now if I could institute a real big affair in the shape of a bucketshop swindle in which your father and I could play the principal parts and you become merely a subordinate
none	none	 such as a typist or something what about that eh 
6902-89167-0028	train-other-500	It doesn t sound very amusing for me she objected How much should we make Thousands I assured her if it were properly engineered I think she said reflectively
none	none	 that father would be very glad of a few thousands just now 
6902-89167-0029	train-other-500	He says the market over here for such little trifles as we have come across is very restricted I groaned under my breath In imagination I could see mister Parker bartering with some shady individual for Lady Enterdean s cameo brooch
6902-89167-0030	train-other-500	I reverted to our previous subject of conversation Eve I went on I hate to seem tedious but the question of our engagement still hangs fire You persistent person she sighed
6902-89167-0031	train-other-500	Tell me if I married you would all those people we met last night be nice to me Of course they would I assured her They are only waiting for a word from you I think they must have an idea already
none	none	 I am not in the habit of giving dinner parties with a young lady as guest of honor 
6902-89167-0032	train-other-500	She was thoughtful for a few moments and her eyes lit up with reminiscent humor Dear me she murmured If only they knew They hadn t any suspicions I suppose about those those little trifles
6902-89167-0033	train-other-500	None I replied I put it all on to a waiter How clever of you You really do seem to be a most capable person and so masterful I begin to fear that some day you ll have your own way
6902-89167-0034	train-other-500	Her eyes laughed at me There was something softly provocative in them a new and kinder light I bent over her and kissed her She sat quite still mister Walmsley
6902-89167-0035	train-other-500	It s usual among engaged couples I pleaded Is it she remarked coldly Doesn t the man as a rule wait to be quite sure he is engaged Not in this country I declared
6902-89167-0036	train-other-500	I have heard that Americans are rather shy about that sort of thing Englishmen Oh bother Englishmen she exclaimed stamping her foot I don t believe a word I ve ever heard about them I suppose now I shall have to marry you I don t see any way out of it I agreed readily
6902-89167-0037	train-other-500	She held up her finger The door was quietly opened mister Parker entered He was followed by the most utterly objectionable and repulsive looking person I have ever set eyes on in my life a young man thin
none	none	 and of less than medium height 
6902-89167-0038	train-other-500	flashily dressed in cheap clothes with patent boots and brilliant necktie His cheeks were sallow and his eyes deeply inset were closer together than any I have ever seen
6902-89167-0039	train-other-500	My dear mister Parker exclaimed let me present mister Moss my daughter sir mister Walmsley also one of us I have been privileged mister Parker continued dropping his voice a little
6902-89167-0040	train-other-500	to watch mister Moss at work this afternoon and I can assure you that a more consummate artist I have never seen
none	none	 in Wall Street at a racetrack meeting or anywhere else 
6902-89167-0041	train-other-500	mister Moss smiled deprecatingly and jerked his head sideways
none	none	 The old un s pretty fly 
6902-89167-0042	train-other-500	he remarked as he laid his hat on the table I am very glad to know mister Moss of course Eve said but I am not in the least in sympathy with the er branch of our industry he represents
6902-89167-0043	train-other-500	You know daddy it s much too dangerous and not a bit remunerative To a certain extent my dear her father admitted I am with you Not all the way though One needs of course to discriminate
6902-89167-0044	train-other-500	Personally I must admit that the nerve and actual genius required in finger manipulation have always attracted me mister Moss paused with his glass halfway to his lips He jerked his head in the direction of mister Parker
6902-89167-0045	train-other-500	He is one for the gab ain t he he remarked confidentially to me For the life of me at that moment I could not tell whether to leave the room in a fit of angry disgust or to accept the ludicrous side of the situation and laugh
6902-89167-0046	train-other-500	Fortunately for me perhaps I caught Eve s eye in which there was more than the suspicion of a twinkle I chose therefore the latter alternative mister Moss watched us for a moment curiously
none	none	 What might your line be guvnor 
6902-89167-0047	train-other-500	he asked as he set down his glass
none	none	 Oh anything that s going I replied carelessly 
6902-89167-0048	train-other-500	City work is rather my specialty I know mister Moss exclaimed quickly
none	none	 Slap up offices thousands of letters a day full of postal orders shutters up suddenly and bunco 
6902-89167-0049	train-other-500	Fine appearance for the job he added admiringly Eve sat down and began to laugh softly to herself She had a habit of laughing almost altogether with her eyes in a way that expressed more genuine enjoyment
6902-89167-0050	train-other-500	than anything I have ever realized She rocked herself gently backward and forward mister Moss looked at us both a little suspiciously Seem to be missing the joke a bit I do he remarked Eve sat up and was instantly grave
6902-89167-0051	train-other-500	It is your clear sighted way of putting things she explained softly You seem to understand people so thoroughly I don t generally make no mistake about the number of beans in the game mister Moss observed in a self congratulatory tone
none	none	 I can tell a crook from a mug a bit quicker than most 
6902-89167-0052	train-other-500	I have suggested to mister Moss my dear
none	none	 mister Parker intervened turning toward us with beaming face 
6902-89167-0053	train-other-500	just a little early dinner say at Stephano s just as we are you know Will this be agreeable to you Certainly Eve assented promptly mister Moss will tell us some of his little adventures mister Parker continued with satisfaction
6902-89167-0054	train-other-500	Considering that he has had twelve years continual work I think you ll all agree with me that his is a wonderful record He has been compelled to enter into a little involuntary er retirement only once during the whole of that time
6902-89167-0055	train-other-500	mister Moss looked a little puzzled He means lagged don t he he remarked a light breaking in on him
none	none	 Only once in my life 
6902-89167-0056	train-other-500	and that for a trifling beano a lady s bag and a couple of wipes
none	none	 I tell you it s no joke nowadays though They do watch you 
6902-89167-0057	train-other-500	The profession ain t what it was You will come with us won t you mister Walmsley Eve begged turning to me I shall be delighted I answered with strenuous mendacity Did you say Stephano s or what
none	none	 do you think of one of these places closer at hand 
6902-89167-0058	train-other-500	I was told of a little restaurant in Soho the other day where the cooking is remarkable I m all for Stephano s mister Moss declared grinning and the sooner the better
6902-89167-0059	train-other-500	One of the neatest pieces of business I ever did in my life I brought off there in the old bar To tell you the truth I m getting a bit peckish There is no reason mister Parker agreed why we should not dine at once
none	none	 It is very nearly seven o clock What do you say 
6902-89167-0060	train-other-500	Yoicks Tally ho for the Strand mister Moss exclaimed with spirit
none	none	 We started off four in a taxi It was mister Moss who with florid politeness handed Eve to her seat and it was mister Moss who entertained us on the way with light conversation CHAPTER VIII AT THE ALHAMBRA Luigi s face when he met the Parkers and myself at the entrance of the restaurant was a study His polite bow and smile of welcome seemed suddenly frozen on his face as his eyes fell upon mister Moss mister Moss was still wearing his hat which was a black bowler with a small brim set at a jaunty angle a little on one side and affording a liberal view of his black curls underneath His linen failed completely to stand the test of the clear soft light of the restaurant and one might have been excused for entertaining certain doubts with regard to the diamond pin in his mauve tie and the ring that flashed from his not overwhite hand as he tardily removed his headgear Bit of all right this place mister Moss remarked handing his hat to Luigi Who ll have a short one with me before we feed Luigi passed the hat from the tips of his fingers to a subordinate He showed us a table quite silently handed the menu over to a maitre d hotel and promptly departed Looking round a little nervously I could see him gazing at us from his sanctum over the top of the blind mister Moss I see has American tastes mister Parker declared He likes an aperitif before dinner Leave it to me please mister Parker ordered a somewhat extensive dinner Throughout the meal we listened to a series of adventures in which the hero was always mister Moss We heard of wonderful hauls and wonderful escapes detectives outwitted exploits that reminded me more of the motor bandits of Paris than of our own sober capital mister Parker s attention never flagged Halfway through the meal mister Moss suddenly put down his knife and fork He broke off in the middle of a fascinating narration of an episode during which he had ju jutsued one detective knocked another down locked them both in an empty room and strolled away with a cigar abstracted from the case of one of them and his pockets full of uncut emeralds With his mouth open he was gazing fixedly across the room There was a considerable change in his tone Ware tec he said sharply We all looked in the direction he indicated and we all recognized mister Cullen who was apparently returning with interest our observation I saw a grim smile upon his lips as he disappeared for a moment behind the menu card For a man who had in his time treated detectives in such a cavalier way mister Moss change of color and subdued manner was a little extraordinary He cheered up however after a little while Our friend Cullen mister Parker murmured seems to have taken quite a fancy to this restaurant Used to be on my lay mister Moss remarked He s much too big a duke now for the street though They say he gets nearly all the high class forgery and swindling cases We have come into contact with him ourselves mister Parker observed genially Seems to me there s a kind of want of snap about him compared with our American detectives but I dare say he knows his business Is your father really enjoying this I asked Eve He absolutely loves it she replied I sighed And I think she added suddenly you are behaving beautifully I almost love you for it I looked at her quickly and I felt rewarded for all I had gone through Her attitude toward me was subtly different Somehow I felt that I was being permitted a glimpse of the real Eve Her eyes were soft she patted my hand under the table I could almost have shaken hands with mister Moss What about a music hall afterward I proposed in the fullness of my heart Shall I send for stalls at the Alhambra My proposal was received with unanimous approval Our departure from the restaurant a few minutes later evoked almost as much comment as our arrival mister Moss led the way his hands in his trousers pockets and a large cigar pointing toward the ceiling protruding from the corner of his mouth His slight uneasiness with regard to the whereabouts of his hat having been dispelled by its appearance before we finished our meal he placed it on his head at its usual angle before we left the room mister Parker took his arm as they passed out and I saw mister Cullen s eyes follow them from behind his newspaper The two got into a taxi and Eve and I followed them in another an arrangement that mister Moss appeared to regard with disfavor Eve s hand stole into mine as we drove off Do you know she said seriously I think it s perfectly horrid to drag you about in such company It s all very well for us because we belong and we are in a strange city but I saw some of your friends look at you and whisper They must think you are mad So long as you are in it dear I assured her I don t care where I go or with whom You don t look like that a bit you know she sighed As for the rest I went on if you are really sorry for me why then end it Your father could spare us for a little time I could see she was becoming serious again Lights flashed upon her face I felt a sudden wave of pity mingled with my love for her After all there were times when her anxiety must have been almost insupportable Eve dearest I whispered you must let me take you away from this You must You are too good and sweet ever to mix with these people to live this life She half closed her eyes for a moment When she looked at me again she was laughing You re a dear boy she said Now help me out please We have arrived We found four stalls reserved for us near the front at the music hall and after settling a slight preliminary difficulty owing to mister Moss reluctance to parting with his hat we sat down to enjoy the performance mister Moss seemed a little disappointed too that his bright and snappy order for drinks to the powdered official who showed us to our places was not at once executed but otherwise he made himself very much at home We had been there perhaps half an hour when I saw a sudden change in his demeanor which was almost at once reflected in the serious expression that had stolen into mister Parker s benign countenance An old gentleman white haired with rubicund face and a jovial air had taken the seat next to them He had the appearance of having come from the country and of having spent a happy day in town Even from where I sat I could see protruding from his breast pocket a brown leather pocketbook I watched them as though fascinated The change in mister Moss was amazing His reckless air of enjoyment had departed He was still smoking but he was all alert like a cat ready to spring mister Parker too was interested I saw him whisper something in mister Moss ear and I felt a cold foreboding of what was going to happen I m for a drink mister Moss declared in a rather loud tone Come on guv nor They both rose The old gentleman drew in his legs to let them pass Though I watched with fixed eyes I was absolutely unable to follow their movements but when they had passed the old gentleman I could see from where I sat that his pocketbook was gone Did you see that I whispered to Eve She shook her head The old gentleman s pocketbook I groaned they ve got it Eve for a moment sat quite still she too seemed nervous I was looking away again at the retreating figures of mister Parker and mister Moss Suddenly my heart sank I saw the old gentleman spring to his feet and hurry after them and I saw too at the end of the line of stalls mister Cullen and a companion standing waiting I rose quickly to my feet I m afraid there s going to be some trouble I said to Eve Let me go and see if I can help It looks as though the whole thing were a trap I followed quickly It is only fair to mister Cullen to say that he conducted the affair with great discretion and with every consideration for the feelings of the management He stopped mister Parker and mister Moss as they reached the end of the line of stalls Please come with me he said I have something to say to you outside mister Moss showed signs of an attempt to escape He stooped for a minute as though to run but a kick from mister Parker induced him to alter his mind Wotcher want he asked belligerently The old gentleman had now reached them red faced and incoherent He addressed himself to mister Cullen and I no longer had any doubt whatever that the affair was a plant of the detective I ve been robbed of my pocketbook he exclaimed One of these two has got it brushed up against me just now on the way out of the stalls Where s the manager Only a few people in the immediate vicinity were conscious that anything at all unusual was happening The promenade just at that particular spot was almost deserted This gentleman is certainly mistaken mister Parker declared with dignity Neither my friend nor myself knows anything about his pocketbook I am sorry mister Cullen said politely but I shall have to trouble you to come with me to Bow Street at once and you too sir he added addressing the old gentleman I am a police officer and we will go into the matter there You will agree with me that it is well not to make a disturbance here I have two assistants with me He indicated by a little gesture two men who had emerged from somewhere in the background I will go with the utmost pleasure mister Parker consented At the same time this gentleman has obviously been drinking and his charge is absurd It was precisely at this moment that I felt something hard pressed against my hand With a dexterity that was nothing short of miraculous mister Parker who apparently was standing with his hands in his pockets had suddenly forced one of them through some secret opening in his coat In those few seconds it seemed to me I lived a year I had no time to think no time to realize that if I failed nothing could save my appearance at Bow Street on the following morning as a common pickpocket I gripped the pocketbook from his hand and without changing a muscle dropped it into the yawning overcoat pocket of the bucolic gentleman The moment was over and passed mister Parker with a movement forward had covered my proceedings I had been face to face with death years before but I had never felt quite the same thrill This way gentlemen if you please mister Cullen directed softly You will not object to my accompanying you I asked Certainly not mister Cullen replied I in fact am not sure that it would not be my duty to ask you to come One moment I begged mister Cullen paused The gentleman who made this charge I went on seems to me to be in a very uncertain condition Might I suggest that before you commit yourself to taking these people to the police station you just make sure he really has been robbed of his pocketbook Had it here the old gentleman declared right in this pocket Look for yourself gone The old gentleman scarcely seems to me I remarked to be in a fit condition to know which pocket it was in mister Cullen who had been walking carefully between him and the other two smiled in a superior way Please feel in all your pockets he told his accomplice The old gentleman obeyed Suddenly he stopped short A blank expression came into his face What have you got there I asked He brought it out with ill concealed reluctance It was without doubt the pocketbook I shall never forget mister Cullen s face He was bereft of words He stared at it as though he had seen it come up through the floor mister Moss simply stood with his mouth open mister Parker alone appeared unmoved by any emotion of surprise His manner was serious almost dignified I want you to take this from me straight mister Cullen he said I am not a man who loses his temper easily but you re trying us a bit high mister Cullen remained for a moment or two speechless He looked at me and drew a long breath I knew perfectly well what he was thinking He had had a man on either side of mister Parker and mister Moss The only person who could have transferred that pocketbook was myself I could see him readjusting his ideas as to my moral character mister Parker gentlemen he said removing his hat pray accept my apologies You are free to return to your seats whenever you choose This gentleman was evidently mistaken he added speaking with withering sarcasm and turning sharply toward his coadjutor You oughtn t to come to these places in your present condition sir Take my advice and get along home at once The bucolic gentleman who had completely lost his appearance of inebriety mumbled a few incoherent words and departed After his departure mister Parker assumed a more genial attitude Well well I suppose you only did your duty sir he remarked with a resigned sigh We were on our way to the bar Will you join us mister Cullen I did not hear the detective s reply but somehow or other we all drifted there mister Moss at once found an easy chair which he pronounced to be a bit of all right and in which he assumed an easy and elegant attitude mister Parker mister Cullen and I completed the circle which now included a professional gutter thief a disappointed detective mister Parker and myself It was a unique moment in my life The wine affected the spirits of no one except perhaps mister Moss and him when we finally broke up our party we thought it advisable to get rid of in quick order To my surprise mister Parker seemed in a particularly despondent frame of mind He needed pressing even to come to supper You were quick witted Walmsley he admitted as we rolled away in the car quick witted I ll admit that but you were dead clumsy with your fingers I could see what you were doing from the back of my head Really I murmured Well I suppose that sort of thing is a gift I only know that I hope I may never have to do it again mister Parker sighed I fear he said that your troubles with us will soon be over Eve has been telling me about that young idiot of an Englishman who visited the Bundercombes out in Okata If there was one man whose name I thought I was safe to make use of it was Joe Bundercombe It seems I admitted to have been an unfortunate choice What do you think of doing about it mister Parker apparently had no immediate answer ready for me During our brief ride in the motor and in the early stages of supper he was afflicted by a taciturnity that made him almost negligible as a companion And then suddenly a light broke over his face He had the appearance of a shipwrecked mariner who suddenly catches sight of land in the offing His lips were a little parted his boyish face all aglow Walmsley my dear fellow he exclaimed Eve dear The problem is solved Raise your glasses and drink with me Here s farewell to mister Joseph H Parker and Miss Parker And a welcome to mister and Miss Bundercombe of Okata That s all very well I said but Reggie will be on your track mister Parker beamed on Eve and me We shall see he declared didactically CHAPTER IX THE EXPOSURE The next morning at twelve o clock I took a taxi cab round to Banton Street The hall porter who was beginning to know me well seemed a little surprised at my appearance Is the young lady upstairs I asked He was distinctly taken aback mister Parker and his daughter have gone he told me I stopped on my way to the stairs Gone I repeated 
7423-89169-0001	train-other-500	Went off this morning he continued two taxi cabs full of luggage Aren t they coming back No signs of it Did they leave any address None Are you sure I persisted
7423-89169-0002	train-other-500	Please ask at the office The porter left me for a moment but returned shaking his head mister Parker said there would be no messages or letters and accordingly he left no address I turned slowly away
7423-89169-0003	train-other-500	The hall porter followed me He was drawing something from his waistcoat pocket I wouldn t do a thing he declared to get mister Parker into any trouble for a nicer freer handed gentleman never came inside the hotel
7423-89169-0004	train-other-500	but I don t know as there s much harm in showing you this being as you re a friend I picked it up in the sitting room after they d gone He held out a cablegram Before I realized what I was doing I had read it
none	none	 It was handed in at New York Look out H sailed last Saturday Pretty badly scared of H he was the hall porter remarked Ten minutes after that cablegram came they were hard at it packing I gave the man a tip and drove back to my rooms where I spent a restless morning then lunched at my club and returned to the Milan afterward 
7423-89169-0005	train-other-500	only in the hope that I might find there a note or a message There was nothing however Just as I was starting to go out the telephone bell rang I took up the receiver It was Eve s voice Is that mister Walmsley
7423-89169-0006	train-other-500	It is I admitted How are you Eve Quite well thank you Still in London Certainly Would you like to come and have tea with me Rather I replied enthusiastically
7423-89169-0007	train-other-500	Where are you Hiding That s all right I replied I shan t give it away Where shall I find you Well she said we talked it over and decided that the best hiding place was one of the larger hotels
7423-89169-0008	train-other-500	We are at the Ritz I ll come right along if I may Very well she agreed Ask for mister Bundercombe I groaned under my breath but I made no further comment and in a very few minutes I
7423-89169-0009	train-other-500	presented myself at the Ritz Hotel I was escorted upstairs and ushered into a very delightful suite on the second floor Eve rose to meet me from behind a little tea table She was charmingly dressed and looking exceedingly well
none	none	 mister Bundercombe on the other hand 
7423-89169-0010	train-other-500	who was walking up and down the apartment with his hands behind his back was distinctly nervous He nodded at my entrance How are you Walmsley he said How are you I am quite well sir thank you
7423-89169-0011	train-other-500	I replied a little stupefied Say I m afraid we are making a great mistake here he went on anxiously We ve slipped a point too near to the wind this time
7423-89169-0012	train-other-500	If you ll allow me to tell you exactly what I think I ventured frankly I think you have made a mistake There s that matter of Reggie Sidley He was worrying me all yesterday morning to find out where you were
7423-89169-0013	train-other-500	and when I evaded the point he told me straight that he didn t believe you were the Bundercombes at all He is always in and out of this place and if he sees your name on the register or his mother Lady Enterdean sees it
7423-89169-0014	train-other-500	it seems to me it s about all up A piece of bravado I must admit mister Parker muttered a piece of absolute bravado But there s the young woman who s responsible he added shaking his fist at Eve
none	none	 I may have suggested our coming to your party as the Bundercombes 
7423-89169-0015	train-other-500	but it was Eve s idea that we put up this little piece of bluff Now I m all for Paris he went on insinuatingly At that precise moment I felt that there was nothing I wanted so much as to get Eve away from the Ritz
7423-89169-0016	train-other-500	and I fell in with the scheme We ll all go I suggested I haven t had a week in Paris for a long time Eve handed me my tea Don t count me in she begged I never felt less inclined to move from anywhere
7423-89169-0017	train-other-500	If being Eve Bundercombe means living at the Ritz I think I d rather go on The life of an adventuress is after all just a little strenuous and I am tired of living on the thin edge of nothing
7423-89169-0018	train-other-500	Perhaps before you know where you are mister Bundercombe remarked gloomily you ll be living on the thin edge of a little less than nothing There was a knock at the door We all looked at one another
7423-89169-0019	train-other-500	A magnificent person with powdered hair breeches and silk stockings presented himself Lord Reginald Sidley he announced In walked Reggie
none	none	 He was correctly attired for calling and he carried a most immaculate silk hat in his hand I fully expected to see him drop it on the floor but he did nothing of the sort He laid it upon a small table 
7423-89169-0020	train-other-500	paused for one second to shake his fist at me and advanced toward Eve with both hands outstretched At last I have found you then he exclaimed Miss Bundercombe Well I am glad to see you
7423-89169-0021	train-other-500	Hello Reggie she answered sweetly What a time you ve been looking us up He was taken aback Well I like that he gasped And how are you mister Bundercombe
7423-89169-0022	train-other-500	Glad to see you mister Bundercombe replied cheerlessly The meeting had taken place and I seemed to be the only person in the room who was suffering from any sort of shock Reggie was still holding one of Eve s hands and was almost incoherent
7423-89169-0023	train-other-500	Come I like that I like that he exclaimed A long time looking you up indeed Why didn t you let me know you were here There hasn t been a line from you or from your father We couldn t believe it when we heard that you had been at the dinner the other evening
7423-89169-0024	train-other-500	I was never so disappointed in my life I gripped mister Bundercombe by the arm and led him firmly to one side Look here I said is your name Bundercombe It is he admitted gloomily
none	none	 Are you a millionaire I persisted 
7423-89169-0025	train-other-500	Multi he groaned Then what the blazes what the I stopped short Once more the door was opened this time without the formality of a knock
7423-89169-0026	train-other-500	If mister Bundercombe had seemed anxious and depressed before it was obvious now that the worst had happened All the cheerful life seemed to have faded from his good humored face He had literally collapsed in his clothes
7423-89169-0027	train-other-500	Even Eve gave a little shriek Upon the threshold stood mister Cullen and by his side a lady who might have been anywhere between fifty and sixty years old
7423-89169-0028	train-other-500	She was dressed in a particularly unattractive checked traveling suit with a little satchel suspended from a shiny black leather band round her waist
none	none	 She wore a small hat that was much too juvenile for her and from the back of it a blue veil 
7423-89169-0029	train-other-500	which she had pushed on one side hung nearly to the floor Her complexion was very yellow she had a square jaw and through her spectacles her eyes glittered in a most unpleasant fashion Her greeting was scarcely
7423-89169-0030	train-other-500	conciliatory So I ve got you at last have I Say this is a pretty chase you ve led me Do you know I ve had to desert my post as president of the Great Amalgamated Meeting of the Free Women of the West to come and look after you two
7423-89169-0031	train-other-500	Do you know that three thousand women had to listen to a substitute last Thursday and after I d spent two months getting my facts for them Do you know that you re the laughing stock of Okata
7423-89169-0032	train-other-500	No one asked you to come mother Eve remarked with a sigh Asked me to come indeed the newcomer retorted Look at you both I ve heard all about your doings This gentleman by my side has told me a few things
none	none	 I ll talk to you presently young woman 
7423-89169-0033	train-other-500	But say is there anywhere on the face of this earth such a miserable addle headed lunatic as that man whom it s my misfortune to call my husband She shook her fist at mister Bundercombe who seemed to have become still smaller
7423-89169-0034	train-other-500	Then she looked at me and at Reggie who was standing with his mouth wide open She fixed upon us as her audience Look at him she went on stretching out her hands There s a respectable American for you
7423-89169-0035	train-other-500	For thirty years he works as a man should for it s what a man s made for and thanks to his wife s help and advice he prospers Look at him I ask you A baby can see that he hasn t the brains of a chicken Yet there he stands
none	none	 Joseph H Bundercombe of Bundercombe s Reapers 
7423-89169-0036	train-other-500	with eight million dollars worth of stock to his name I saw Reggie s eyes go up to the ceiling and I knew he was dividing eight million dollars by five An expression almost of reverence passed into his face as he achieved the result
7423-89169-0037	train-other-500	We none of us felt the slightest inclination to interrupt
none	none	 missus Bundercombe s long skinny forefinger drew a little nearer to her victim 
7423-89169-0038	train-other-500	Then she coughed the short dry cough of the professional speaker and continued Wouldn t you believe that was success enough for any reasonable mortal Wouldn t you say that with a wife holding an honored and great position in the State
none	none	 and his daughter by his side he d settle down out there and live a respectable decent life 
7423-89169-0039	train-other-500	Not he First of all he wants to travel What does he do then but take up what he calls a hobby He buys and gloats over every silly detective story that was ever written
7423-89169-0040	train-other-500	practises disguises and making himself up as he calls it takes lessons in conjuring haunts the police courts consorts with criminals in short behaves like a great overgrown child in his own native city
none	none	 where the name of Bundercombe 
7423-89169-0041	train-other-500	from the feminine standpoint realizes everything that stands for freedom and greatness The time came when it was necessary for me to put down my foot once and for all I called him to me Joseph Henry Bundercombe I said
none	none	 there must be an end to this 
7423-89169-0042	train-other-500	There shall be he promised The next day he and Eve my misguided stepdaughter were on their way to Europe and I am credibly informed they cheated a commercial traveler at cards on the way to New York That I find him at liberty now
7423-89169-0043	train-other-500	it seems to me is entirely owing to the clemency and kindness of this gentleman who recognized my description at Scotland Yard and brought me here Say all I m prepared to admit about that is that it was somehow fortunate
7423-89169-0044	train-other-500	mister Bundercombe remarked with a sudden revival of his old self that it fell to my lot to have mister Cullen investigate some of my small adventures mister Bundercombe said Cullen severely
7423-89169-0045	train-other-500	I think you will do well to listen to your wife and to take her advice There are one or two of these little affairs you must remember that are not entirely closed yet mister Bundercombe sighed He adopted an attitude of resignation
7423-89169-0046	train-other-500	Well Cullen he replied if my career of crime is really to come to an end I don t want to bear you any ill will We ll just take a stroll downstairs and talk about it missus Bundercombe with a quick movement to the left blocked the way
7423-89169-0047	train-other-500	That means a visit to the bar she declared I know you mister Bundercombe You ll stay right here and listen to a little more of what I ve got to say Who this gentleman may be I don t at present know she went on turning suddenly upon me
7423-89169-0048	train-other-500	but I am agreeable to listen to his name if any one has the manners to mention it Walmsley madam I told her quickly Paul Walmsley I have the honor to be engaged to marry your stepdaughter
7423-89169-0049	train-other-500	missus Bundercombe looked at me in stony silence Twice she opened her lips and I am quite sure that if words had come they would have been unkind ones Twice apparently however her command of language seemed inadequate
none	none	 So you re going to marry an Englishman she said glaring at Eve I am going to marry mister Walmsley mother Eve agreed sweetly He has been such a kind friend to us during the last few days and I rather fancy I shall like living on this side 
7423-89169-0050	train-other-500	Dear me Dear me I hadn t heard of this mister Bundercombe remarked with interest You and I will go downstairs and have a little chat about it mister Walmsley He made another strategic movement toward the door
7423-89169-0051	train-other-500	which was promptly and effectually frustrated by his wife No you don t missus Bundercombe prohibited I ve a good deal more to say yet I haven t been dragged over the ocean three thousand miles to have you all slip away directly I arrive
7423-89169-0052	train-other-500	A nice state of things indeed My husband Joseph H Bundercombe a suspect at Scotland Yard followed everywhere by detectives and my daughter Stepdaughter please Eve interrupted
7423-89169-0053	train-other-500	Stepdaughter then talking about marrying a man she s probably known about twenty four hours and met at a bar or in a thieves kitchen or something of the sort If you must marry an Englishman she continued with rising voice why don t you marry Lord Reginald Sidley there
7423-89169-0054	train-other-500	His father is an earl anyway His uncle s one Reggie put in gloomily jerking his head toward me Old Walmsley s all right Eve patted his hand Good boy she said You know I never encouraged you
7423-89169-0055	train-other-500	did I Reggie Encouraged me he protested I think on the whole you said the rudest things to me I ever heard in my life from a girl anyway
7423-89169-0056	train-other-500	I imagine he added taking up his hat that it s up to me to leave this little domestic gathering I ll see you out mister Bundercombe declared with alacrity missus Bundercombe with her eyes steadily fixed upon her husband
none	none	 stepped back until she blocked the doorway My dear Hannah Your dear nothing she interrupted ruthlessly You just sit down by the side of your daughter there and let me tell you both what I think of you and what I m going to do about it 
7423-89169-0057	train-other-500	I think I suggested a little taxi drive Your mother and father no doubt have a great deal to say to one another and you can receive your little lecture later Eve assented at once
7423-89169-0058	train-other-500	and missus Bundercombe for some reason or other only entered a faint protest against our departure It was about five o clock in the afternoon and the streets were crowded with every description of vehicle The sun was still warm
7423-89169-0059	train-other-500	there was a faint pink light in the sky a perfume of lilac in the air from the window boxes and flower barrows I took Eve s fingers in mine and held them I think she knew that something in the nature of an inquisition was coming
7423-89169-0060	train-other-500	for she sat very demure her eyes fixed on the road ahead Eve I asked how about missus Samuelson s jewels They were returned to her from a repentant criminal Eve murmured
7423-89169-0061	train-other-500	And the forged banknotes made by the young man in the Adelphi They were all destroyed as fast as father could buy them she explained He has found the boy a post now with some printer in America
7423-89169-0062	train-other-500	And the two thousand pounds at the gaming club that first night Daddy made it three and sent it to a hospital He thought it would do them more good You know you re a shocking pair I said severely
7423-89169-0063	train-other-500	Paul she sighed you never can know how dull it was at Okata I m jolly glad it was I told her It gives me a better chance doesn t it And we ll give daddy a good time whenever we can she pleaded
7423-89169-0064	train-other-500	Always I promised He s one of the best He s so clever too Clever without a doubt I admitted only I think perhaps we might get him to use his talents in a more orthodox way
7423-89169-0065	train-other-500	By the by I added putting my head out of the window I think it s getting a little chilly I ordered the taxi closed and we returned to the hotel The hall porter drew me on one side confidentially
none	none	 mister Bundercombe and the other gentleman sir he announced are waiting for you in the bar CHAPTER X A BROKEN PARTNERSHIP By what certainly seemed to be at the time a stroke of evil fortune I invited missus Bundercombe and Eve to lunch with me at Prince s restaurant a few days after our return from the country missus Bundercombe was graciously pleased to accept my invitation but she did not think it necessary to alter in any way her usual style of dress for the occasion We sailed into Prince s therefore Eve charming in a lemon colored foulard dress and a black toque missus Bundercombe in an Okata dressmaker s conception of a tailor made gown in some hard steel ray material and a hat whose imperfections were perhaps mercifully hidden by a veil which instead of providing a really reasonable excuse for its existence by concealing some portion of missus Bundercombe s features streamed down behind her nearly to her feet The maitre d hotel who welcomed me and showed to our table found his little flow of small talk arrested by that first glimpse of our companion He accepted my orders in a chastened manner and I noticed his eyes straying every now and then as though in fearsome fascination to missus Bundercombe who was sitting very upright at the table with her bony fingers stretched out and a good deal of gold showing in her teeth as she talked with Eve in a high nasal voice concerning the absurd food invariably offered in English restaurants Then suddenly her flow of language ceased the bomb shell fell missus Bundercombe s face became unlike anything I have ever seen or dreamed of Even Eve s eyes were round and her expression dubious I turned my head Some three tables away mister Bundercombe was lunching with a young lady a stranger to us all She was not only a stranger to us all but though she was remarkably good looking there were indications that she scarcely belonged to our world All three of us remained silent for a moment Then I coughed and took up the wine list What should you like to drink missus Bundercombe I asked in attempted unconcern missus Bundercombe adjusted her spectacles severely and transferred her regard to me I felt somehow as though I were back at school and had been discovered in some ignominious escapade You are aware Paul she replied that I drink nothing save a glass of hot water after my meal The subject of drink does not interest me I appeal to you now as a future member of the family Fetch mister Bundercombe here I shook my head missus Bundercombe I said leaning over the table your husband during his stay in London plunged freely into the Bohemian life of our city I will answer for it that he did so simply in pursuance of that hobby of which we all know I am convinced Paul missus Bundercombe interrupted her voice if possible a little more nasal even than usual will you fetch mister Bundercombe here or must I rise from my seat in a public place and remove him myself from from that hussy I appealed to Eve Eve I begged please reason with your stepmother There are certain situations in life that can be faced in one way only missus Bundercombe will no doubt have a few words to say to her husband on his return Let her keep them until then Paul is right Eve declared Do take our advice she continued turning to her stepmother Let us eat our luncheon quite calmly I am perfectly certain dad will have some very good reason to give for his presence here with that young lady missus Bundercombe rose to her feet I hastened to follow her example We stood confronting one another It is either you or I Paul she insisted Then it had better be myself I groaned I deposited my napkin on the table and made my way toward mister Bundercombe I smiled pleasantly at him and bowed apologetically toward his companion Sorry I said under my breath but I am afraid missus Bundercombe means to make trouble mister Bundercombe looked at me with a gloriously blank expression His manner was not without dignity I regret to hear he replied that any person by the name of missus Bundercombe is looking for trouble I scarcely see however how I am concerned in the matter You have the advantage of me sir I stared at him and stooped a little lower She s tearing mad I whispered You don t want a scene Couldn t you make an excuse and slip away mister Bundercombe frowned at me He glanced at the young lady as though seeking for some explanation Is this young gentleman known to you Miss Blanche he inquired She set down her glass and shook her head Never saw him before in my life she declared What s worrying him Hitherto mister Bundercombe said my somewhat unusual personal appearance has kept me from an adventure of this sort but I clearly understand that I am now being mistaken for some one else Your references to a missus Bundercombe sir are Greek to me My name is Parker mister Joseph H Parker Do you mean to keep this up I protested mister Bundercombe beckoned to the maitre d hotel who came hastily to his side Do you know this gentleman he asked The maitre d hotel bowed Certainly sir he answered with a questioning glance toward me This is mister Walmsley Then will you take mister Walmsley back to his place mister Bundercombe begged He persists in mistaking me for some one else I am not complaining mind he added affably no complaint whatever I am quite sure the young gentleman is genuinely mistaken and does not mean to be in any way offensive Only my digestion is not what it should be and these little contretemps in the middle of luncheon are disturbing Run away sir please he concluded waving his hand toward me The maitre d hotel looked at me and I looked at the maitre d hotel Then I glanced at mister Bundercombe who remained quite unruffled Finally I bowed slightly toward the young lady and returned to my place Well missus Bundercombe snapped It seems I said that we were mistaken That isn t mister Bundercombe at all missus Bundercombe s face was a study Is this a jest she demanded severely I wish it were I replied Anyhow missus Bundercombe you must really excuse me but there is nothing more I can do The gentleman whom I addressed insisted upon it that his name was mister Joseph H Parker No doubt he was right These likenesses are sometimes very deceptive I added feebly missus Bundercombe rose to her feet I made no effort to stop her in fact her action filled me with pleasurable anticipations She walked across to the table at which mister Bundercombe was seated Eve and I both turned in our places to watch Poor daddy Eve murmured under her breath Why couldn t he have chosen a smaller restaurant He is going to catch it now I think I ll back your father I observed He is quite at his best this morning The exact words that passed between mister Bundercombe and his wife we alas never knew She turned her left shoulder pointedly toward the young woman whom she had designated as a hussy and talked steadily for about a minute and a half at mister Bundercombe The history of what followed was reflected in that gentleman s expressive face He appeared to listen at first in amazement afterward in annoyance and finally in downright anger When at last he spoke we heard the words distinctly Madam he said I don t know who you are and I object to being addressed in a public place by ladies who are strangers to me Be so good as to return to your seat You are mistaking me for some one else My name is Joseph H Parker For a lady who had won renown upon the platform as a debater missus Bundercombe seemed afflicted with considerable difficulty in framing a suitable reply and while she was still a little incoherent mister Bundercombe softly summoned the maitre d hotel It may have been my fancy but I certainly thought I saw a sovereign slipped into the hand of the latter Charles mister Bundercombe confided my luncheon is being spoiled by people who mistake me for a gentleman who I believe does bear a singular resemblance to me My name is Parker This lady insists upon addressing me as mister Bundercombe I do not wish to make a disturbance but I insist upon it that you conduct this lady to her place and see that I am not disturbed any more The maitre d hotel s attitude was unmistakable Within the course of a few seconds missus Bundercombe was restored to us I thought it best to ignore the whole matter and plunged at once into a discussion of gastronomic matters I have ordered I began some Maryland chicken Then you can eat it missus Bundercombe snapped Not a mouthful of food do I take in this place with that painted hussy sitting by Joseph s side a few feet away Oh I ll fix him when I get him home She drew a little breath between her teeth but she was as good as her word She refused all food and sat with her arms folded glaring across at mister Bundercombe s table My admiration for that man of genius was never greater than on that day So far from hurrying over his luncheon he seemed inclined to prolong it There was no lack of conversation between him and his companion They even lingered over their coffee and they were still at the table when Eve and I had finished and missus Bundercombe was sipping the hot water the only thing that passed her lips during the entire meal I paid the bill and rose missus Bundercombe after a moment s hesitation followed us Eve and I thought of going into the Academy for a few minutes I said tentatively as we reached the entrance hall missus Bundercombe plumped herself down on a high backed chair within a yard of the door I she announced shall wait here for Joseph I realized the futility of any attempt to dissuade her so we left her there spent an hour at the Academy and did a little shopping On our way back an idea occurred to me We reentered the restaurant missus Bundercombe was still sitting there in a corner of the hall Thinks he can tire me out perhaps she remarked in an explanatory manner Well he just can t that s all I moved a few steps farther in and glanced down the restaurant Then I returned But my dear missus Bundercombe I said your husband has gone long ago He went out the other way I am not sure but I believe we saw him in Bond Street quite three quarters of an hour ago There is another way out missus Bundercombe asked hastily Certainly there is I told her into Jermyn Street Why was I not told she demanded rising unwillingly to her feet Really I assured her I didn t think of it She followed us out We all walked down Piccadilly Will you please she said direct me to a tea shop I pointed one out to her She left us without a word of farewell Eve and I turned down into the Haymarket Nice example your parents are setting us I remarked Eve sighed I wish I knew what dad was up to she murmured At that moment we met him He came strolling along his silk hat a little on the back of his head a cigar in his mouth his hands grasping his cane behind his back Bundercombe or Parker I inquired as we came to a standstill on the pavement He grinned Nasty business that he remarked cheerfully Why don t you keep to the Ritz or the Berkeley Anyway he added his tone changing I m glad I met you Paul I want your help in a little matter I shook my head Quite out of the question I declared emphatically Don t forget that Paul is an M P dad Eve said severely You mustn t attempt to bring him into any of your little affairs On this occasion mister Bundercombe expostulated I am on the side of the law mister Cullen whom I am probably going to see presently will be my brother in arms What do you need me for then I asked As to absolutely needing you perhaps I don t mister Bundercombe admitted On the other hand it s a very interesting little affair and one in which you could take a hand without compromising yourself What about Eve I inquired Not this time mister Bundercombe replied The only risk there is about the affair he explained is that it is just possible there may be a bit of a scrap What s the program I asked To night at home at ten o clock Can you manage it Rather I answered if Eve doesn t mind This is the night you promised to go with your mother to a lecture somewhere isn t it I reminded her She nodded Very well she consented resignedly so long as you don t let him get hurt dad No fear of that mister Bundercombe declared cheerfully If they go for any one they ll go for me So long young people At ten o clock Paul At precisely the hour agreed upon that evening I presented myself at mister Bundercombe s house in Prince s Gardens I noticed that the manner of the servant who admitted me was subdued and there was a peculiar gloom about the place Very few lights were lit and the farther portion of the house of which one could catch a glimpse from the little circular hall seemed entirely deserted I was shown at once into mister Bundercombe s study upon the ground floor mister Bundercombe was seated at a writing table with his face toward the door He greeted me with a friendly nod and pointed to a little table upon which stood an abundant display of cigars and cigarettes of all brands I helped myself and lit a cigarette May I know something of this evening s program I asked Spoil the whole show mister Bundercombe objected earnestly Just play the part of assistant audience and stick this into your pocket will you He threw toward me a very small revolver that he had produced from a drawer Only the last three chambers are loaded he remarked You ll have to click three times if you do use it I don t think you ll need to though Take a stall and watch the fun I ll tell you only this You remember Bone Stanley as he was called in those days the man who was sent to prison for fifteen years for bank robbery and for shooting the manager Down Hammersmith way it was The fellow was an American I remember it quite well I assented He was tried for murder and convicted of manslaughter mister Bundercombe nodded He was released this afternoon He ll be here in a few minutes Here I exclaimed mister Bundercombe nodded but did not offer any further explanation Coupled with a certain gravity of expression he had the appearance of a schoolboy for whom a feast was being set out Quite a pleasant little evening we are going to have he promised You wait I frowned a little uneasily You are quite sure you re not letting me in for mister Bundercombe plunged into the middle of my little protest You re all right Paul he assured me Cullen s in the house at the present moment and there are two other detectives with him They are letting me run this thing simply because I know more about it than they do and for certain reasons I m not giving my whole hand away Don t you worry Paul You ll be all right this time Listen We heard a very feeble ring at the bell mister Bundercombe nodded That s Stanley he whispered Sit down A man was shown into the room a moment later I leaned forward in my chair so as to see more distinctly the hero of one of the most famous cases that had ever been tried in a criminal court Of his renowned good looks there was little left He stood there still tall with high cheekbones furtive eyes and long mouth He wore good clothes his linen was irreproachable and he kept his gloves on Nevertheless the stamp of the prison was upon him mister Stanley mister Bundercombe said Good I am glad you were prevailed upon to come I am still wholly in the dark as to what this means the newcomer remarked I ll tell you in a very few sentences mister Bundercombe promised Will you sit down I prefer to stand Stanley replied until I know exactly in whose house I am and what your interest in me is Very well mister Bundercombe agreed Here is my history My name is Joseph H Bundercombe I am an American manufacturer I have made a fortune in manufacturing Bundercombe s Reaping Machines You may call it a hobby if you like but I have always been interested in criminals and criminal methods not the lowest type but men who have pitted their brains against others and robbed them As soon as I arrived in this country I found an interest in inquiring into the identities of American criminals imprisoned over here with a view to helping any deserving cases Your name came before me I studied your case I became interested in it I learned that your time was almost up A chance inquiry revealed to me a state of things that I determined to bring before your knowledge You sent me a telegram mister Stanley interrupted as I was stepping on the steamer at Southampton I have returned to London for your explanation You will probably mister Bundercombe remarked genially be thankful all your life that you did Now listen Who is this person mister Stanley asked indicating me He is my prospective son in law mister Paul Walmsley mister Bundercombe explained a member of Parliament I have asked him to be present because I may need a little support and also because it may help to convince you that I am in earnest Twenty years ago mister Stanley you came to the conclusion that honest methods were of little use to any one seeking to make a large fortune You joined with two other men Richard Densmore and Philip Harding in a series of semicriminal conspiracies You pooled all your money you had the most and you determined that if you could not make a living honestly you would rob those with less brains than yourself When half your capital was gone this Hammersmith bank robbery was planned and took place You were the only one caught and you held your tongue like a man but all the same you were used as a cat s paw In what way Stanley asked softly You all three had revolvers you all three arranged that they should be uncharged Cartridges were put into yours without your knowledge You held up your revolver and pressed the trigger believing it to be empty The others knew better You shot the bank manager and in the stupefaction that followed you became an easy captive The others escaped Stanley moved a little on his feet His lips were slightly parted his eyes fixed upon mister Bundercombe What story is this you are telling me he muttered A true one mister Bundercombe continued Now listen The total amount in possession of your two confederates when you went into prison was under a thousand pounds You heard from them periodically as struggling paupers Harding met you out of prison He was almost in rags They were at the end of their resources he told you He gave you a hundred pounds to procure which he assured you with tears in his eyes they had almost beggared themselves It was to enable you to leave the country and make a fresh start You were even grateful You shook him by the hand You left him at the hotel at Southampton only an hour before you got my telegram What of it Stanley asked Nothing except this mister Bundercombe concluded Your two partners were so scared at the result of the Hammersmith affair and at your sentence that they turned over a new leaf They went into business as outside stockbrokers with your capital The agreement as to a third profits was still in force They had what I can describe only as the devil s own luck I should say their total capital to day is at least fifty thousand pounds The time came for you to be released They had no idea of parting with a third of their money and taking you into the business All the time they had deceived you They continued the deception Harding met you as a poor man But for me you would have been on your way to South Africa by this time with a hundred pounds in your pocket Is what you are telling me the truth Stanley demanded Absolutely mister Bundercombe declared I stumbled across the truth in making inquiries concerning you and your probable future I had meant as a matter of fact to put up a little money of my own to give you a fresh start In the course of these inquiries I happened to run across a young woman who had been a typist in Harding s office It was from her I learned the truth As he rose in the world Harding seems to have treated the girl badly A little kindness and a little attention on my part and I learned the truth She placed me in possession of the whole story after we had lunched together to day Stanley at last took the chair he had so long refused He sat with his arms folded And I kept my mouth closed he muttered It was their job I would no more have pulled the trigger of my revolver than I would have shot myself if I had known It was they who put the cartridges there He sat for a moment quite still mister Bundercombe rang the bell The gentlemen I am expecting he said will be here in a moment You can show them in directly they arrive The man bowed and withdrew mister Bundercombe turned to his visitor I have made the acquaintance he continued of these two men your late partners sought them out and made it purposely They are coming here to see me to night They fancy that it is just a friendly call They know that I have money to invest I have even made use of them employed them to buy for me bonds of my own choosing They think it is an affair of a little business chat perhaps and a restaurant supper Pull yourself together Stanley Go into that corner behind the curtain Wait your time Stanley rose slowly to his feet His face was drawn as though with pain It isn t so much the money he muttered only I thought I fancied they would have been there to meet me to shake me by the hand to stay with me And they wanted to push me off out of the country He opened his lips a little wider and swore softly but vindictively Then the bell rang mister Bundercombe hastened to push him out of sight We heard the sound of strange voices in the hall When the door was opened it was obvious that the whole house was lit up From somewhere in the distance came the soft music of a piano mister Harding and mister Densmore were announced I looked at them curiously They were both most correctly dressed in evening clothes They both had somehow the hard expression of worldly men tempered not altogether pleasantly by symptoms of good living They greeted mister Bundercombe with bluff heartiness He gave them each a hand Now my friends he said welcome to my house Paul he added turning to me let me introduce my two friends mister Harding and mister Densmore mister Paul Walmsley mister Walmsley has just been returned for the western division of Bedfordshire They greeted me with more than affability mister Harding assured me he had read my speeches mister Densmore thought no one was more to be envied than a man who had the gifts that secured for him a seat in Parliament It s early yet mister Bundercombe declared genially Let s sit down Tell me a little about English business It interests me You bought those Chilean bonds all right I see They are up an eighth to night A good purchase mister Bundercombe mister Harding assured him a very good purchase After all though there s not much money to be made out of those government things Now we ve a little affair of our own what do you say Densmore he broke off looking toward his partner We could afford to let mister Bundercombe come in a little way with us I think mister Densmore nodded Not more than five he said warningly Remember what you promised the Rothschild people mister Harding nodded and crossed his knees He lit a cigar from the box mister Bundercombe passed round This sounds interesting the latter remarked I dare say mister Walmsley too has a little spare money for investment mister Densmore sighed though his eyes were brightening It s too good a thing he explained confidentially to let the world into Between ourselves there s a fortune in it and we want to keep it among our friends He drew a dummy prospectus from his vest pocket and began a long winded recital of some figures in which I was not particularly interested mister Bundercombe however appeared to be greatly impressed by what he heard Gentlemen he said there s just one little thing American business methods and English are different in one respect In my country we ve got a sort of official guide that tells us exactly whom we are dealing with and what their means are Now I know you are good fellows and it seems to me I ll be glad to go into this little affair with you but we are strangers financially aren t we Now if you were Americans I should say to you What s your rating and you d tell me because you d know that I could look it up in a business guide in ten minutes Perfectly sound mister Harding admitted perfectly Neither my partner nor I have anything to conceal Last Christmas we were worth just over sixty thousand pounds and since then we ve made a bit You ve no other partner mister Bundercombe inquired Certainly not mister Harding replied Then what about our friend Stanley mister Bundercombe asked quietly Almost as he spoke Stanley walked into the middle of the little group I have never in the whole course of my life seen two men so thoroughly and entirely amazed mister Harding dropped his cigar on the carpet where he let it remain They stared at Stanley as though they were looking upon a ghost Both men seemed somehow to have lost their confident bearing seemed to have shrunken into smaller less assertive meaner beings Sixty thousand pounds mister Bundercombe went on one third of which belongs to Stanley here Absurd Harding faltered Nothing nothing of the sort Densmore declared mister Bundercombe very carefully lit another cigar Then he rang the bell Harding rose to his feet He was not looking in the least like the sleek opulent gentleman who had entered the room a few minutes before What s that for he demanded pointing to the bell The door was already opened mister Bundercombe indicated the young lady who stood upon the threshold the lady with whom he had been lunching that day at Prince s I only wished to have the pleasure mister Bundercombe explained of presenting you two gentlemen mister Harding especially to this young lady Blanche mister Harding exclaimed mister Densmore muttered something under his breath My dear Miss Blanche said mister Bundercombe moving toward the door I will not ask you to stay as our interview is scarcely perhaps a pleasant one I simply wished you to show yourself so that mister Harding and his friend might understand how useless certain denials on their part would be My servant will now place you in a taxi and if you will do me the honor of calling here at eleven o clock tomorrow morning I think I can promise you a satisfactory termination to this little affair The girl patted him on the shoulder That s all right Bundy she declared I hope you ll take me out to lunch again As for him she added her eyebrows coming together and looking toward Harding perhaps he ll understand now how well it pays to be a liar She turned round and left the room amid a stricken silence mister Bundercombe came back to his place Gentlemen he said I will be brief with you It has given me the utmost pleasure to arrange this little meeting on behalf of my friend mister Stanley In the room on the other side of the passage is waiting my lawyer who will draw up a renewal of your partnership deed with mister Stanley upon terms that we can discuss amicably In the room behind this is waiting a particular friend of mine mister Cullen a detective Remember mister Bundercombe added his voice suddenly very stern and threatening that through all the years that man your rightful partner has been in prison through all the agony of his trial the humiliation of his sentence the name of neither one of you has passed his lips Is it your wish that the truth shall now be told They shrank back Harding was pale to the lips Densmore was shivering Very well gentlemen mister Bundercombe concluded If I send for the lawyer mister Cullen can go If you choose mister Cullen the lawyer can go mister Harding moistened his lips with his tongue We will make an arrangement he said We have been wrong Now that I see you here Stanley he continued looking up with the first show of courage either of them had exhibited I am ashamed It was a dirty trick Forget it After you were lagged we decided to turn over a new leaf and be honest We ve been honest inside the law at any rate and we ve made money Come and take your share of it and forgive We were brutes Densmore agreed They were both bending over Stanley Somehow or other his hands stole out to them mister Bundercombe and I strolled outside You might tell mister Cullen that we shall not require him this evening mister Bundercombe instructed the butler Bring a bottle of champagne and tell the gentleman from Wymans Wymans and his clerk that we shall be ready for them in ten minutes CHAPTER XI mister BUNDERCOMBE S WINK I scarcely recognized mister Cullen when he first accosted me in the courtyard of the Milan At no time of distinguished appearance a certain carelessness of dress and gait had brought him now almost on a level with the loafer in the street His clothes needed brushing he was unshaved and he looked altogether very much in need of a bath and a new outfit May I have a word with you mister Walmsley he asked standing in the middle of the pavement in front of me and blocking my progress toward the Strand I hesitated for a moment His identity was only just then beginning to dawn upon me mister Cullen I exclaimed At your service sir I turned round and led the way back into the court This is not a professional visit I trust I said as we passed into the smoke room Not entirely sir mister Cullen admitted At the same time He paused and looked out the window steadily for a moment as though in search of inspiration I trust I began hastily that mister Bundercombe has not Precisely about him sir that I came to see you mister Cullen interrupted I am bound to admit that a few weeks ago there was no man in the world I would have laid my hands on so readily That day at the Ritz however changed my views completely I feel he added with a dry smile that I got more than level with mister Bundercombe when I sent for his wife So it was you who sent the cables that brought her over I remarked But please remember sir he begged apologetically that I had never seen the lady I sent the cables confidently anticipating that she would disclaim all knowledge of mister Bundercombe When she arrived and I realized that she was actually his wife I forgave him freely for all the small annoyances he had caused me my visit to you this morning in fact is entirely in his interests What has mister Bundercombe been up to now I asked nervously Nothing serious at any rate that I know of mister Cullen assured me For the last fortnight ever since missus Bundercombe s arrival in fact mister Bundercombe has somehow or other managed to keep away from all his old associates and out of any sort of mischief Last night however I was out on duty I haven t had time to go home and change my clothes yet in a pretty bad part shadowing one of the most dangerous swell mobsmen in Europe a man you may have heard of sir He is commonly known as Dagger Rodwell I hastily disclaimed any acquaintance with the person in question Tell me though I begged what this has to do with mister Bundercombe Just this mister Cullen explained I ran my man to ground in a place where I wouldn t be seen except professionally and with him was mister Bundercombe They were not engaged I asked quickly in any lawbreaking escapade at the time I trust mister Cullen shook his head reassuringly Rodwell only goes in for the very big coups he said Two or three in a lifetime if he brought them off would be enough for him All the same there s something planning now and he s fairly got hold of mister Bundercombe He s a smooth tongued rascal absolutely a gentleman to look at and speak to What I want you to do sir if you re sufficiently interested is to take mister Bundercombe away for a time Interested I groaned He ll be my father in law in a couple of months Then if you want him to attend the ceremony sir mister Cullen advised earnestly you ll get him out of London He s restless You may have noticed that yourself He s spoiling for an adventure and Dagger Rodwell is just the man to make use of him and then leave him high and dry the booby for us to save our bacon with I don t wish any harm to mister Bundercombe sir and that s straight Until the day I met missus Bundercombe at Liverpool I am free to confess that I was feeling sore against him To day that s all wiped out We had a pleasant little time at the Ritz that afternoon and my opinion of the gentleman is that he s the right sort I m here to give you the office sir to get him away from London and get him away quick I may know a trifle more than I ve told you or I may not but you ll take my advice if you want to escape trouble I ll do what I can I assured him a little blankly To tell you the truth I have been fearing something of this sort During the last few days especially his daughter tells me he has been making all sorts of excuses to get away I ll do what I can and many thanks mister Cullen Let me offer you something mister Cullen declined anything except a cigar and went on his way I called a taxi and drove round to the very delightful house the Bundercombes had taken in Prince s Gardens I caught mister Bundercombe on the threshold He would have hurried off but I laid a detaining hand on his arm Come back with me if you please I begged I have some news I need to consult you all mister Bundercombe glanced at his watch His manner was a little furtive He was not dressed as usual in frock coat white waistcoat and silk hat a costume that seemed to render more noticeable his great girth and smooth pink and white face but in a blue serge double breasted suit a bowler hat and a style of neckgear a little reminiscent of the Bowery Something in his very appearance seemed to me a confirmation of mister Cullen s warning He looked at his watch and muttered something about an appointment I promise not to keep you more than a very few minutes I assured him Come along I kept my arm on his and led him back into the house Eve is in the morning room he whispered Let s go in quietly and perhaps we shan t be heard We crossed the hall on tiptoe in the manner of conspirators Before we could enter the room however our progress was arrested by a somewhat metallic cough missus Bundercombe in a gray tweed coat and skirt of homely design a black hat and black gloves with a satchel in her hand from which were protruding various forms of pamphlet literature appeared suddenly on the threshold of the room she had insisted upon having allotted for her private use and which she was pleased to call her study mister Bundercombe she exclaimed portentously taking no notice whatever of me My dear he replied May I ask the meaning of your leaving the house like a truant schoolboy at this hour of the morning and in such garb demanded missus Bundercombe eying him severely through her pince nez Is your memory failing you Joseph Henry Did you or did you not arrange to accompany me this morning to a meeting at the offices of the Women s Social Federation I fear I er I had forgotten the matter mister Bundercombe stammered An affair of business I was rung up on the telephone missus Bundercombe stared at him She said nothing expression was sufficient She turned to me Eve is in the morning room mister Walmsley she said I presume your visit at this hour of the morning was intended for her Precisely I admitted I will go in and see her I opened the door and mister Bundercombe rather precipitately preceded me If he had contemplated escape however he was doomed to disappointment missus Bundercombe followed us in She reminded us of her presence by a hard cough as Eve saluted me in a somewhat light hearted fashion Mind there s mother Eve whispered with a little grimace Tell me why you have come so early Paul Are you going to take me out motoring all day Or are you going to the dressmaker s with me I really ought to have a chaperon of some sort you know and mother is much too busy making friends with the leaders of the Cause over here She made a face at me from behind a vase of flowers missus Bundercombe apparently thought it well to explain her position I find it she said absolutely incumbent upon me while on a visit to this metropolis to cultivate the acquaintance of the women of this country who are in sympathy with the great movement in the States with which I am associated It is expected of me that I should make my presence over here known Naturally I agreed naturally missus Bundercombe I see by the papers that you were speaking at a meeting last night That reminds me I went on that I really did come down this morning on rather an important matter and perhaps it is as well that you are all here as I should like your advice I have received an invitation to stand for the division of the county in which I live They all looked puzzled To stand for Parliament I mean I hastily explained to them It seems really rather a good opportunity as of course I am fairly well known in the district and the majority against us was only seventy or eighty at the last election Say that s interesting mister Bundercombe declared putting down his hat I didn t know you were by way of being a professional man though I m not I replied You wouldn t call politics a profession exactly mister Bundercombe was more puzzled than ever His hand caressed his chin in familiar fashion Well it s one way of making a living isn t it he asked We call it a profession on our side It isn t a way of making a living at all I assured him It costs one a great deal more than can be made out of it mister Bundercombe stopped scratching his chin missus Bundercombe sat down opposite me and I was perfectly certain that she would presently have a few remarks to offer Eve was looking delightfully interested Say I m not quite sure I follow you mister Bundercombe observed I am with you all right when you say that the direct pecuniary payment for being in Parliament doesn t amount to anything but what s your pull worth eh My what I inquired Dash it all mister Bundercombe continued a little testily I only want to get at the common sense of the matter You are thinking of trying for a seat in Parliament and you say the four hundred a year you get for it is nothing Well of course it s nothing What I want to know is just what you get out of it indirectly You get the handling of so much patronage I suppose What is it worth to you and how much is there I spent the next five minutes in an eloquent attempt to explain the difference between English and American politics mister Bundercombe was partly convinced but more than ever sure that he had found his way into a country of half witted people Eve however was much quicker at grasping the situation I think it s perfectly delightful Paul she declared I have read no end of stories of English electioneering and they sound such fun I want to come down and help I have tons of new dresses and I can read up all about politics going down on the train That brings me I went on to the real object of my visit I want you and your father I want you all I added heroically to come down with me to Bedfordshire and help You were coming anyway next week for a little time you know I want to carry you off at once missus Bundercombe who had been only waiting for her opportunity broke in at this juncture Young man she said impressively mister Walmsley before I consent to attend one of your meetings or to associate myself in any way with your cause I must ask you one plain and simple question and insist upon a plain and simple answer What are your views as to Woman Suffrage The views of my party I answered with futile diplomacy Enunciate as briefly as possible but clearly what the views of your party are missus Bundercombe bade me I won t have him heckled Eve protested coming over to my side I coughed We are entirely in sympathy I explained with the enfranchisement of women up to a certain point We think that unmarried women who own property and pay taxes should have the vote Rubbish missus Bundercombe exclaimed firmly We want universal suffrage We want men and women placed on exactly the same footing politically and socially That I said I am afraid no political party would be prepared to grant at present Then save as an opponent I can attend no political meetings in this country missus Bundercombe declared rising to her feet with a fearsome air of finality I sighed In that case I confessed I am afraid it is useless for me to appeal to you for help Perhaps you and your father I added turning to Eve Let them go down to you in the country by all means missus Bundercombe interrupted For my part though my visit to Europe was wholly undesired was forced upon me in fact by dire circumstances she added emphatically glaring at mister Bundercombe since I am here I find so much work ready to my hand so much appalling ignorance so much prejudice that I conceive it to be my duty to take up during my stay the work which presents itself here I accordingly shall not leave London mister Bundercombe cheered up perceptibly at these words I am rather busy myself he said but perhaps a day or two I thrust my arm through his I rely upon you to help me canvass I told him A lot is done by personal persuasion Canvass mister Bundercombe repeated reflectively Say just what do you mean by that It is very simple I assured him You go and talk to the farmers and voters generally and put a few plain issues before them we ll post you up all right as to what to say Then you wind up by asking for their votes and interest on my behalf I do that do I mister Bundercombe murmured Talk to them in a plain straightforward way eh That s it I agreed A man with sound common sense like yourself could do me a lot of good mister Bundercombe was thoughtful I am convinced that at that moment the germs of certain ideas which bore fruit a little later on were born in his mind I saw him blink several times as he gazed up at the ceiling I saw a faint smile gradually expand over his face A premonition of trouble even at that moment forced itself on me You ll have to be careful you know I explained a little apprehensively You ll have to keep friends with the fellows all the time They wouldn t appreciate practical jokes down there and the law as to bribery and corruption is very strict mister Bundercombe nodded solemnly If I take the job on he said you can trust me It seems as though there might be something in it You ll come down with me then I begged both of you Come this afternoon The dressmakers can follow you Eve It isn t far an hour in the train and twenty minutes in the motor We may have to picnic a little just to start with but I know that the most important of the servants are there ready and waiting Pray do not let me stand in your way missus Bundercombe declared rising My time will be fully occupied I wish you good morning mister Walmsley I have an appointment at a quarter to twelve You can let me know your final decision at luncheon time She left the room mister Bundercombe Eve and I exchanged glances How far away did you say your place was Paul mister Bundercombe asked Right in the country I told him takes you about an hour and a half to get there I think we ll come mister Bundercombe decided looking absently out the window and watching his wife eloquently admonish a taxicab driver who had driven up with a cigarette in his mouth Yes I m all for it My little party at Walmsley Hall was in most respects a complete success My sister was able to come and play hostess and Eve was charmed with my house and its surroundings mister Bundercombe however was a source of some little anxiety On the first morning when we were all preparing to go out he drew me on one side Paul he said he had with some difficulty got into the way of calling me by my Christian name occasionally I want to get wise to this thing Where does your political boss hang out We haven t such a person I told him He seemed troubled The more he inquired into our electioneering habits the less he seemed to understand them What s your platform anyway he asked I handed him a copy of my election address which he read carefully through with a large cigar in the corner of his mouth He handed it back to me with a somewhat depressed air Seems to kind of lack grit he remarked a little doubtfully Why don t you go for the other side a bit more Look here I suggested mindful that Eve was waiting for me You run down and have a chat with my agent You ll find him just opposite the town hall in Bildborough There s a car going down now I m on he agreed Anyway I must get to understand this business He departed presently and returned to luncheon with a distinctly crestfallen air He beckoned me mysteriously into the library and laid his hand upon my shoulder in friendly fashion Look here Paul he said is it too late to change your ticket Change my what I asked him Change your platform or whatever you call it You re on the wrong horse Paul my boy Even your own agent admits it though I never mentioned your name at first or told him who I was All the people round here with votes are farmers agricultural laborers and small shopkeepers Your platform s of no use to them Well that s what we ve got to find out I protested Personally I am convinced that it is Now look here mister Bundercombe argued these chaps though they seem stupid enough are all out for themselves They want to vote for what s going to make life easier for them What s the good of sticking it into em about the Empire Between you and me I don t think they care a fig for it Then all this talk about military service Gee They ain t big enough for it Disestablishment too what do they care about that You let me write your address for you Promise em a land bill Promise them the food on their tables at a bit less Stick something in about a reduction in the price of beer I ve seen the other chap s address and it s a corker Mostly lies but thundering good ones You let me touch yours up a bit Where have you been I asked a strange misgiving stealing into my mind Have you been talking to mister Ansell like this Ansell No Who s he mister Bundercombe inquired My agent mister Bundercombe shook his head Chap I palled up with was called Harrison I groaned You ve been to the other fellow s agent I told him the agent for the Radical candidate mister Bundercombe whistled You don t say he murmured Well I ll tell you what it is Paul there are no flies on that chap He s a real nippy little worker that s what he is If you take my advice he went on persuasively you ll swap We ll make it worth his while to come over I ve seen your mister Ansell if that s his name I saw the name on a brass plate and I saw him come out of his office stiff starched sort of chap with a thin face and gray side whiskers That s the man I admitted He and his father before him and his grandfather have been solicitors to my people for I don t know how many years He looked it mister Bundercombe declared A withered old skunk if ever there was one You want a live man to see you through this Paul You let me go down and sound Harrison this afternoon No reason that I can see why we shouldn t use this fellow s address too if we can make terms with him Look here I said Politics over on this side don t admit of such violent changes My address is in the printer s hands and I ve got to stick to it and Ansell will have to be my agent whatever happens It isn t all talk that wins these elections The Walmsleys are well known in the county and we ve done a bit for the country during the last hundred years This other fellow Horrocks his name is has never been near the place before I grant you he s going to promise a lot of very interesting things but that s been going on just a little too long The people have had enough of that sort of thing I think you ll find they ll put more trust in the little we can promise than in that rigmarole of Harrison s mister Bundercombe shook his head doubtfully Well he sighed I m only on the outside edge of this thing yet I must give it another morning We had a pleasant luncheon party at which mister Bundercombe was introduced to some of my supporters with whom as he usually did with every one he soon made himself popular Eve and I then made our first little effort at canvassing Eve s methods differed from her father s I am so sorry she said as she shook hands with a very influential but very doubtful voter of the farmer class but I don t know anything about English politics so I can t talk to you about it as I d like to But you know I am going to marry mister Walmsley and come to live here and it would be so nice to feel that all my friends had voted for him If you have a few minutes to spare mister Brown would you please tell me just where you don t agree with Paul I should so much like to hear because he tells me that if once you were on his side he would feel almost comfortable mister Brown who had always met my advances with a grim taciturnity that made conversation exceedingly difficult proceeded to dissertate upon one or two of the vexed questions of the day I ventured to put in a few words now and then and after a time he invited us in to tea When we left he was more gracious than I had ever known him to be And you must vote for mister Walmsley Eve declared at the end of her little speech of thanks because I want so much to have you come and take tea with me on the Terrace at the House of Commons and I can t unless Paul is a member can I Bribery and corruption mister Brown laughed However we ll see Certainly I have been very much pleased to hear mister Walmsley s views upon several matters When did you say the village meeting was mister Walmsley Thursday night I replied Well I ll come he promised You ll take the chair I begged Nothing could do me more good than that and I feel sure if you look at things I was going to be very eloquent but Eve interrupted me Let me sit next to you please she said looking up at him with her large unusually innocent eyes Oh well if you like mister Brown assented We drove off down the avenue in complete silence When we had turned the corner Eve gave a little sigh Paul she declared I don t think there s anything I ve ever come across in my life that s half so much fun as electioneering Please take me to the next most difficult If Eve was a success however mister Bundercombe was to turn out a great disappointment He came home a little later for dinner looking very gloomy Paul he said as we met for a moment in the smoking room Paul I ve sad news for you I am sorry to hear it I replied I ve looked into this little matter of politics he continued I ve looked into it as thoroughly as I can and I can t support you You re on the wrong side my boy I ve shaken hands with mister Horrocks and that s the man who ll get the votes in this constituency I ve promised to do what I can to help him I was a little taken aback You re not in earnest I exclaimed Dead earnest mister Bundercombe regretted The chap s convinced me I feel it s up to me to lend him a hand But surely I expostulated even if you cannot see your way clear to help me there s no need for you to go over to the enemy like this You re not obliged to interfere in the election at all are you mister Bundercombe sighed Matter of principle with me he explained I must be doing something I can t canvass for you I ll have to look round a bit for the other chap I really don t see I began just a little annoyed why you should feel called upon to interfere in an English election at all unless it is to help a friend mister Bundercombe looked at me and solemnly winked Say that s the dinner gong he announced cheerfully Let s be getting in But I don t quite understand mister Bundercombe repeated the wink upon a smaller scale I followed him into the drawing room still in the dark as to his exact political position The movements of my prospective father in law were for the next few days wrapped in a certain mystery He arrived home one evening however in a state of extreme indignation As usual when anything had happened to upset him he came to look for me in the library My boy he said of all the God forsaken out of the world benighted holes this Bildborough of yours absolutely takes the cake For sheer ignorance for sheer thick headed bumptious arrogant ignorance give me your farmers What s wrong I asked him Wrong Listen he exclaimed almost dramatically In this district in this whole district mind there is not a single farmer who has heard of Bundercombe s Reapers I farm a bit myself I reminded him and I had never heard of them mister Bundercombe went to the sideboard and mixed himself a cocktail with great care Bundercombe s Reapers he said as soon as he had disposed of it are the only reapers used by live farmers in the United States of America Canada Australia or any other country worth a cent That seems to hit us pretty hard I remarked Have you got an agent over here Sure mister Bundercombe replied I don t follow the sales now so I can t tell you what he s doing but we ve an agent here and any country that doesn t buy Bundercombe s Reapers is off the line as regards agriculture What are you going to do about it I asked Do mister Bundercombe toyed with his wine glass for a moment and then set it down What I have done he announced is this I have wired to my agent I have ordered him to ship half a dozen machines if necessary on a special train and I am going to give an exhibition on some land I have hired over by Little Bildborough the day after tomorrow That s the day of the election I exclaimed You couldn t put it off I suppose he suggested That s the day I ve fixed for my exhibition at any rate I am giving the farmers a free lunch slap up affair it s going to be I can tell you I am afraid I answered with a wholly wasted sarcasm that the affair has gone too far now for us to consider an alteration in the date Well well We must try not to clash mister Bundercombe said magnanimously How long does the voting go on From eight until eight I told him mister Bundercombe was thoughtful It s a long time to hold them he murmured To hold whom I demanded mister Bundercombe started slightly Nothing Nothing By the by do you know a chap called Jonas Henry Jonas of Milton Farm I should think I do I groaned He s the backbone of the Opposition the best speaker they ve got and the most popular man mister Bundercombe smiled sweetly Is that so he observed Well well He is a very intelligent man I trust I ll be able to persuade him that any reaper he may be using at the present moment is a jay compared to Bundercombe s this season s model I trust you may I answered a trifle tartly I am glad you re likely to do a little business but you won t mind my reminding you will you that you really came down here to give me a leg up with my election and not to sell your machines or to spend half your time in the enemy s camp mister Bundercombe smiled It was a curious smile which seemed somehow to lose itself in his face Then the dinner gong sounded and he winked at me slowly Again I was conscious of some slight uneasiness It began to dawn upon me that there was a scheme somewhere hatching that mister Bundercombe s activity in the camp of the enemy might perhaps have an unsuspected significance I talked to Eve about this after dinner but she reassured me Father talks of nothing but his reaping machines she declared Besides I am quite sure he would do nothing indiscreet Only yesterday I found him studying a copy of the act referring to bribery and corruption Dad s pretty smart you know I do know that I admitted I wish I knew what he was up to though The next day was the last before the election The little market of Bildborough was in a state of considerable excitement Several open air meetings were held toward evening Eve and I returning from a motor tour of the constituency called at the office of my agent We chatted with mister Ansell for a little while and then he pointed across the square There s an American there he said that the other side seems to have got hold of He s their most popular speaker by a long way but I gather they re a little uneasy about him Didn t I have the pleasure of meeting him at your house mister Bundercombe I sighed He came down here to help me mister Ansell put on his hat and beckoned mysteriously Come out by the back way he invited We shall hear him He is going to speak from the little platform there By crossing a hotel yard a fragment of kitchen garden and a bowling green we were able to come within a few yards of where mister Bundercombe with several other of mister Horrocks supporters was standing upon a small raised platform Two local tradesmen and one helper from London addressed a few remarks of the usual sort to an apathetic audience which was rapidly increasing in size It was only when mister Bundercombe rose to his feet that the slightest sign of enthusiasm manifested itself Eve looked at me with a pleased smile Just look at all of them she whispered how they are hurrying to hear dad speak That s all very well I grumbled but he ought to be doing this for me Her fingers pressed my arm Listen she said mister Bundercombe s style was breezy and his jokes were frequent He stood in an easy attitude and spoke with remarkable fluency His first few remarks which were mainly humorous were cheered to the echo The crowd was increasing all the time Presently he took them into his confidence When I came down here a few days ago we heard him say I came meaning to support my friend mister Walmsley Groans and cheers That s all right boys mister Bundercombe continued there s nothing the matter with mister Walmsley but I come from a country where there s a bit more kick about politics and I pretty soon made up my mind that the kick wasn t on the side my young friend belongs to Now just listen to this As one business man to another I tell you that I asked mister Walmsley the first night I was here What are you getting out of this Why are you going into Parliament He didn t seem to understand He pleaded guilty to a four hundred a year fee but told me at the same time that it cost him a great deal more than that in extra charities I asked him what pull he got through being in Parliament and how many of his friends he could find places for All he could do was to smile and tell me that I didn t understand the way things were done in this country He wanted to make me believe that he was anxious to sit in Parliament there and work day after day just for the honor and glory of it or because he thought it was his duty You know I m an American business man and that didn t cut any ice with me so I dropped in and had a chat with mister Horrocks I soon came to the conclusion that the candidate I m here to support to night is the man who comes a bit nearer to our idea of practical politics over on the other side of the pond mister Horrocks doesn t make any bones about it He wants that four hundred a year in fact he needs it Ironical cheers He wants to call himself M P because when he goes out to lecture on Socialism he ll get a ten guinea fee instead of five on account of those two letters after his name Furthermore his is the party that understands what I call practical politics Every job that s going is given to their friends and if there aren t enough jobs to go round why they get one of their statesmen to frame a bill what you call your Insurance Bill is one of them I believe in which there are several hundred offices that need filling And there you are mister Ansell and I exchanged glances The enthusiasm that had greeted mister Bundercombe s efforts was giving place now to murmurs and more ironical cheers One of his coadjutors on the platform leaned over and whispered in mister Bundercombe s ear mister Bundercombe nodded Gentlemen he concluded I m told that my time is up I have explained my views to you and told you why I think you ought to vote for mister Horrocks I ve nothing to say against the other fellow except that I don t understand his point of view mister Horrocks I do understand He s out to do himself a bit o good and it s up to you to help him A determined tug at mister Bundercombe s coattails by one of the men on the platform brought him to his seat amid loud bursts of laughter and more cheers Eve gripped my arm and we turned slowly away It s a privilege I declared solemnly to have ever known your father If I only had an idea what he meant about those reaping machines You couldn t give me a hint I suppose Eve She shook her head Better wait In the excitement of that final day I think both Eve and I completely forgot all about mister Bundercombe It was not until we were on our way back from a motor tour through the outlying parts of the district that we were forcibly reminded of his existence Quite close to Little Bildborough the only absolutely hostile part of my constituency we came upon what was really an extraordinary sight Our chauffeur of his own accord drew up by the side of the road Eve and I rose in our places In a large field on our left was gathered together apparently the whole population of the district In one corner was a huge marquee through the open flaps of which we could catch a glimpse of a sumptuously arranged cold collation On a long table just outside covered with a white cloth was a vast array of bottles and beside it stood a man in a short linen jacket who struck me as being suspiciously like Fritz the bartender at one of mister Bundercombe s favorite haunts in London Toward the center of the field seated upon a ridiculously inadequate seat on the top of a reaping machine was mister Bundercombe He had divested himself of coat and waistcoat and was hatless The perspiration was streaming down his face as he gripped the steering wheel He was followed by a little crowd of children and sympathizing men who cheered him all the time At a little distance away on the other side of a red flag Henry Jonas the large farmer of the district and the speaker on whom my opponent chiefly relied was seated upon a similar machine in a similar state of undress It was apparent however even to us that mister Bundercombe s progress was at least twice as rapid as his opponent s What on earth is it all about I exclaimed absolutely bewildered Eve who was standing by my side clasped her hands round my arm It seems to me she murmured sweetly as if dad were trying his reaping machine against some one else s I looked at her demure little smile and I looked at the field in which I recognized very many of my staunchest opponents Then I looked at the marquee The table there must have been set for at least a hundred people Suddenly I received a shock Seated underneath the hedge hatless and coatless with his hair in picturesque disorder was mister Jonas cousin also a violent opponent of my politics and a nonconformist He had a huge tumbler by his side which seeing me he raised to his lips Good old Walmsley he shouted out No politics to day Much too hot Come in and see the reaping match He took a long drink and I sat down in the car You know I said to mister Ansell who was standing on the front seat there ll be trouble about this mister Ansell was looking a little grave himself Is mister Bundercombe really the manufacturer of that machine he asked Of course he is Eve replied It s the one hobby of his life or rather it used to be she corrected herself hastily Even now when he begins talking about his reaping machine he forgets everything else mister Ansell hurried away and made a few inquiries Meanwhile we watched the progress of the match Every time mister Bundercombe had to turn he rocked in his seat and retained his balance only with difficulty At every successful effort he was loudly cheered by a little group of following enthusiasts mister Ansell returned looking a little more cheerful Everything is being given by the Bundercombe Reaping Company he announced and mister Bundercombe s city agent is on the spot prepared to book orders for the machine It seems that mister Bundercombe has backed himself at ten to one in ten pound notes to beat mister Jonas by half an hour each taking half the field Who s ahead Eve asked excitedly mister Bundercombe is well ahead mister Ansell replied and they say that he can do better still if he tries It looks rather mister Ansell concluded dropping his voice as though he were trying to make the thing last out Afterward they are all going to sit down to a free meal that is if any of them are able to sit down he added with a glance round the field Hello Here s Harrison mister Harrison recognizing us descended from his car and came across He shook hands with Eve at whom he glanced in a somewhat peculiar fashion mister Walmsley he said a week ago we were rather proud of having inveigled away one of your adherents All I can say at the present moment is that we should have been better satisfied if you had left mister Bundercombe in town Why he s been speaking against me at nearly every one of your meetings I protested That s all very well mister Harrison complained but he s not what I should call a convincing speaker He is a democrat all right and a people s man and all the rest of it but he hasn t got quite the right way of advocating our principles I have been obliged to ask him to discontinue public speaking until after the election The fact of it is I really believe he s cost us a good many more votes than he s gained All he says is very well but when he sits down one feels that our people are all for what they can get out of it and yours are prepared to give their services for nothing What s all this mean I asked waving my hand toward the field mister Harrison looked at me very steadily indeed Then he looked at Eve I can only hope that my own expression was as guileless as Eve s I told you about that hint we were obliged to give mister Bundercombe mister Harrison went on I suppose this is the result of it He seems to have bewitched the whole of Little Bildborough There s Jonas there who was due to speak in four places today he will take no notice of anybody I walked by the side of his machine begging him to get down and come and keep his engagements and he took no more notice of me than if I d been a rabbit There s his cousin who has more hold upon the nonconformists of the district than any man I know sitting under a hedge drinking out of a tumbler There are at least a score of men with their eyes glued on that tent who ought to be hard at work in the district I am beginning to doubt whether they ll even be in in time to vote Well we must be getting on anyway I said See you later mister Harrison mister Harrison nodded a little gloomily and we glided off Eve squeezed my hand under the rug Isn t dad a dear she murmured in my ear Eve was one of the first to congratulate me when late that night the results came in and I found that by a majority of twenty seven votes I had been elected the member for the division Aren t you glad now Paul dear that we brought father down to keep him out of mischief she whispered mister Bundercombe himself held out his hand Paul he said I congratulate you my boy I was on the other side but I can take a licking with the best of them Congratulate you heartily He held out his hand and gripped mine Once more he winked CHAPTER XII THE EMANCIPATION OF LOUIS At about half past ten the following morning I turned into Prince s Gardens to find a four wheel cab drawn up outside the door of mister Bundercombe s house On the roof was a dressing case made of some sort of compressed cane and covered with linen Accompanying it was a black tin box on which was painted in white letters Hannah Bundercombe President W S F Standing by the door was a footman with an article in his hand that I believe is called a grip which in the present instance I imagine took the place of a dressing case I surveyed these preparations with some interest The temporary departure of missus Bundercombe would I felt have an enlivening influence upon the establishment As I turned in at the gate missus Bundercombe herself appeared She was followed by a young woman who looked distinctly bored and whom I was not at first able to place missus Bundercombe was in a state of unusual excitement Say mister Walmsley she began and her voice seemed to come from her forehead it was so shrill and nasal how long will it take me to get to saint Pancras I looked at the four wheeler on the roof of which another servant was now arranging a typewriter in its tin case I should say about thirty five minutes in that I replied A taxi would do it in a quarter of an hour None of your taxis for me missus Bundercombe declared warmly I am not disposed to trust myself to a piece of machinery that can be made to tell any sort of lies I like to pay my fare and no more If thirty five minutes will get me to saint Pancras then I guess I ll make my train You are leaving us for a few days I remarked suddenly catching a glimpse of a face like a round moon beaming at me from the window I have received a dispatch missus Bundercombe announced drawing a letter with pride from an article that I believe she called her reticule signed by the secretary of the Women s League of Freedom asking me to address their members at a meeting to be held at Leeds to night Very gratifying I murmured How the woman knew that I was in England missus Bundercombe continued carefully replacing the missive I cannot imagine but I suppose these things get about In any case I felt it my duty to go Some of us mister Walmsley she added regarding me with a severe air think of little else save the various pleasures we are able to cram into our lives day by day Others are always ready to listen to the call of duty I wish you a pleasant journey missus Bundercombe I said raising my hat I suppose I shall find Eve in No doubt you will she snapped I glanced at the depressed young woman I am taking a temporary secretary with me missus Bundercombe explained Recent reports of my speeches in this country have been so unsatisfactory that I have lost confidence in the Press I am taking an experienced shorthand writer with me who will furnish the various journals with a verbatim report of what I say Much more satisfactory I am sure I agreed edging toward the house I wish you a successful meeting missus Bundercombe You mustn t miss your train And I trust missus Bundercombe concluded as she turned to enter the cab that if you accompany Eve in her shopping expeditions to day or during my absence you will not encourage her in any fresh extravagances I made my way into the house and entered the morning room as the cab drove off mister Bundercombe and Eve were waltzing mister Bundercombe paused at my entrance and wiped his forehead He was very hot A little ebullition of feeling my dear Paul he explained on seeing you You met missus Bundercombe You have heard the news I gathered I remarked that missus Bundercombe s sense of duty is taking her to Leeds mister Bundercombe breathed a resigned sigh We shall be alone he announced with ill concealed jubilation if we have any luck at all for three days One never knows though I propose that we celebrate to night unless he added with a sudden gloom you two want to go off and dine somewhere alone Not likely I assured him quickly Daddy Eve exclaimed reproachfully mister Bundercombe cheered up Then if you re both agreeable he proposed let us go and pay Luigi a visit I have rather a fancy to show him a reestablished mister Bundercombe You know I sometimes think he went on that Luigi was beginning to regard me with suspicion There isn t any doubt about it I observed dryly We will dine there to night mister Bundercombe decided that is if you two are willing I hesitated for a moment Eve was looking at me for my decision I really see no reason why we shouldn t go there I said I have to take Eve to some rather dull relatives for luncheon and I suppose we shall be shopping afterward It will brighten up the day We will give Luigi no intimation of our coming mister Bundercombe suggested with relish We shall be in no hurry so we can order our dinner when we arrive there At eight o clock At eight o clock I agreed More presents Paul Eve informed me taking my arm Come along and help me unpack Isn t it fun Luigi s reception of us that night was most gratifying He escorted us to the best table in the place from which he ruthlessly seized the mystic label that kept it from the onslaughts of less privileged guests He congratulated me upon my parliamentary honors and my engagement in the same breath It was perfectly clear to me that Luigi knew all about us He addressed mister Bundercombe with an air of deep respect in which was visible too an air of relieved apprehension He took our order himself with the aid of an assistant maitre d hotel at whom mister Bundercombe glanced with some surprise Where is Louis he inquired Gone left Luigi answered mister Bundercombe was obviously disappointed Say is that so he exclaimed Why I thought he was a fixture Been here a long time had nt he Nearly twelve years Luigi admitted Has he got a restaurant of his own mister Bundercombe asked Luigi shook his head On the contrary sir he replied I think Louis has gone off his head He has taken a very much inferior post at a very inferior place A restaurant of a different class altogether not at all comme il faut a little place for the multitude Giatron s in Soho The foolishness of it for all his old clients must be useless No one would eat in such a hole It is most mysterious We dined well and gayly mister Bundercombe renewed many restaurant acquaintances and I am quite sure he thoroughly enjoyed himself Every now and then however a shadow rested on his face Watching him I felt quite certain of the reason It was only during the last few weeks that I had begun to realize the immense good nature of the man He was worrying about Louis We sat there until nearly ten o clock When we rose to go mister Bundercombe turned to us Say he asked a little diffidently would you people object to just dropping in at this Giatron s Or will you go off somewhere by yourselves and meet me afterward We will go wherever you go dad Eve declared We are not going to leave you alone when we do have an evening off I should like to find out about Louis myself I interposed I always thought he was the best maitre d hotel in London We drove to Giatron s and found it in a back street a shabby unpretentious looking place with a front that had once been white but that was now grimy in the extreme The windows were hung with little curtains in the French fashion whose freshness had also long departed The restaurant itself was low and teeming with the odor of past dinners At this hour it was almost empty Several untidy looking waiters were rearranging tables In the middle of the room Louis was standing He recognized us with a little start though he made no movement whatever in our direction He was certainly a changed being He stood and looked at us as though we were ghosts mister Bundercombe waved his hand in friendly fashion It was not until then that Louis with marked unwillingness came forward to greet us Come to see your new quarters Louis mister Bundercombe said cheerfully Find us a table and serve us some of your special coffee We will dine here another evening Louis showed us to a table and handed us over to the care of an unwholesome looking German waiter with only a very brief interchange of courtesies And then with a word of excuse he darted away mister Bundercombe looked after him wonderingly The coffee was brought by the waiter and served without Louis reappearance The effect of his absence on mister Bundercombe however was only to make him more determined than ever to get at the bottom of whatever mystery there might be Just tell Louis the maitre d hotel I wish to speak to him he instructed the waiter The man departed Ten minutes passed but there was no sign of Louis mister Bundercombe sent another and more imperative message This time Louis obeyed it As he crossed the room a little hesitatingly toward us it was almost sad to notice the alteration in his appearance At Luigi s he had been so smart so upright so well dressed Here he was a changed being His hair needed cutting his linen was no longer irreproachable his clothes were dusty and out of shape The man seemed to have lost all care of himself and all pride in his work When at last he reached the table mister Bundercombe did not beat about the bush Louis he said we have been to Stephano s tonight for the first time for some weeks I came along here to see you because of what Luigi told me Now you can just take this from me You ve got to tell me the truth There s something wrong with you What is it Louis extended his hands He was making his one effort There is nothing wrong with me he declared I left Stephano s to as they say in this country better myself I am in charge here next to Monsieur Giatron himself If Monsieur Giatron should go back to Italy I should be manager It seemed like a good post Perhaps I was foolish to leave Louis mister Bundercombe protested I guess I didn t come round here to listen to lies You and I had some little dealings together and I feel I ve the right to insist on the truth Now then don t give us any more trouble there s a good fellow If you d rather talk to me alone invite me into the office or behind that desk Louis looked round the room which was almost empty save for the waiters preparing the tables for supper mister Bundercombe he said with a little gesture of resignation it is because of those dealings that I came to trouble mister Bundercombe eyed him steadily Go on he ordered Louis moved closer still to the table It was those banknotes mister Bundercombe he confessed You gave me one packet to be destroyed in the kitchen I obeyed but I looked at them first Never did I see such wonderful work Those notes every one seemed real Every one as I put it into the fire gave my heart a pang And then the other time when you slipped them under the table to me because mister Cullen was about I took them too to the fire I destroyed one two three four five one dozen two dozen and then I came to the last two or three and my fingers they went slow I could not bear it I thought what could be done My wife she was not well I could send her to Italy I owe a little bill The tips they had not been good lately Behold There was one ten pound note left when all the others were destroyed I put him in my waistcoat pocket Go on mister Bundercombe said encouragingly No one is blaming you Upon my word it sounds natural enough Louis voice grew a little bolder For some time I hesitated how to change it Then one day I came here to see my friend Giatron we came together from Italy I hand him the note I ask him please change He give me the change and I stay to have a drink with the head waiter who is a friend of mine Presently Giatron comes out He calls me into the office Then I begin to tremble He looks at me and I tremble more Then he knows that he have got me Giatron s a very cruel man mister Bundercombe He make hard terms He made me give up my good place at Luigi s He made me come here and be his head man He gives me half as much as Luigi and there are no tips besides which the place offends me every moment of the day The service the food the wines everything is cheap and bad I take no pride in my work I go to Giatron and I pray him to let me go But not so I know my work well He thinks that I will bring clients Nowhere else could he get a head man so good as I at the wages of a common waiter So I stay here a slave The man s story was finished In a sense it seemed ordinary enough and yet both Eve and I felt a curious thrill of sympathy as he finished There was something almost dramatic in the man s sad voice his depressed bearing the story of this tragedy that had come so suddenly into his life One looked round and realized the truth of all he had said One realized something even of the bitterness of his daily life mister Bundercombe sipped his coffee thoughtfully Tell me why you did not come to me or write Louis he asked The man stretched out his hands But it was to you sir that I had broken my word he pointed out When you gave me that first little bundle you looked at me so steadfastly when you told me that every scrap was to be destroyed and I promised I promised you faithfully And you asked me afterward about that last batch You said to me Louis you are sure that they are all quite gone Remember that there is trouble in the possession of them And I told you a lie mister Bundercombe coughed and poured himself out a little more of the coffee Louis he declared you are a fool You are a blithering idiot You are a jackass It never occurred to me before I am the guilty one for placing such a temptation in your way Now where s this Monsieur Giatron of yours Louis looked at him wonderingly There was a dawn of hope in his face blended with a startled fear He arrives in ten minutes he announced He comes down for the supper He is here mister Bundercombe glanced round A stout man with a black mustache had entered the room His eyes fell at once on the little group mister Bundercombe turned round So that is Monsieur Giatron Louis bowed mister Bundercombe beckoned the proprietor to approach An old patron of Luigi s mister Bundercombe explained introducing himself come round to see our friend Louis here Delighted I am very sure mister Giatron exclaimed bowing to all of us It will be a great pleasure to us to do the very best possible for any of Louis friends mister Bundercombe rose to his feet He pointed to the little glass framed office at the other side of the room mister Giatron he said I have always been a great patron of Louis You and I must have a chat Will you not invite us into your little office and show us whether there is not something better to be found than this coffee We will take a glass of brandy together and drink success to your restaurant Giatron hastened to lead the way Eve in response to a glance from her father remained at the table but I followed mister Bundercombe We went into the office Giatron himself placed three glasses upon the desk and produced from a cupboard a bottle of what appeared to be very superior brandy mister Bundercombe sipped his with relish Then he glanced at the closed door mister Giatron he began I have been having a chat with Louis He has told me of his troubles told me the reason for his leaving Luigi and accepting this post with you Giatron paused with the bottle suspended in mid air He slowly set it down A frown appeared on his face Mind you mister Bundercombe continued I am not sympathizing with Louis If what he said is true I am inclined to think you have been very merciful Giatron recovered his confidence He tried Louis tried my old friend he complained to take advantage of me to enrich himself at my expense by means of a false note That is the only point mister Bundercombe said Was the note bad Do you know I can scarcely bring myself to believe it The restaurant keeper smiled Very deliberately he produced a great bunch of keys from his pocket and opened the safe which stood in a corner of the office mister Bundercombe whispered a scarcely audible word in my ear and became absorbed once more in the brandy Presently Giatron returned He laid on the desk and smoothed out carefully what was to all appearances a ten pound note If you will examine that carefully sir he begged you will see that it is the truth That note he is very well made but he is not a good Bank of England note mister Bundercombe slowly adjusted his glasses placed the note in front of him and smoothed it carefully with his large hand This is very interesting he murmured Allow me to make a close examination I ve seen some high class printing in my Giatron started as though he were shot and jumped round toward me With unpardonable clumsiness I had upset my glass in leaning over to look at the note I m awfully sorry I exclaimed glancing ruefully at my trousers Would you give me a napkin quickly Giatron hastened to the door of the office and called to a passing waiter The napkin was soon procured and I rubbed myself dry The restaurant keeper returned to the desk at mister Bundercombe s side All I can say mister Bundercombe declared as he drew away from the note which he had been examining is that I do not wonder you were deceived mister Giatron This note is the most perfect imitation I have ever seen in my life A wicked piece of work sir You recognize the fact however that the note is beyond question counterfeit mister Giatron persisted I fear you are right mister Bundercombe admitted There is a slight imperfection Yes yes a very bad business mister Giatron We must come here often and try to see whether we cannot make you a second Luigi Giatron returned to the safe with the note which he carefully locked up Very excellent brandy mister Bundercombe pronounced warmly You will see a great deal more of us my friend I promise you that We shall haunt you mister Giatron bowed to the ground You are always very welcome and the young lady We rejoined Eve paid our bill and made our way to the door Louis looking very pathetic was in the background mister Bundercombe beckoned to him Louis you can give your shark of an employer a week s notice to night I have the note in my pocket he whispered It s cost me a good one but I owed you that On Monday week Louis I shall order my dinner from you at Luigi s The man s face was wonderful He came a little closer He was shaking at the knees his hands were trembling and his mouth was twitching mister Bundercombe he pleaded hoarsely you would not deceive me mister Bundercombe looked at him steadfastly On my honor Louis the note is in my pocket already torn in four pieces when I put my hand into my waistcoat pocket to pay my bill In three minutes it will be in a hundred pieces gone You need have no fear The note mister Giatron is guarding so carefully is a very excellent ten pound note of my own At a quarter to eight on the following Monday week mister Bundercombe and I entered Luigi s restaurant Louis himself advanced to greet us the old Louis whose linen was irreproachable whose bearing and deportment and gracious smile all denoted the Louis of old mister Bundercombe ordered dinner and beckoned Louis to come a little nearer Was there any trouble he inquired For me no Louis replied but Monsieur Giatron never never have I seen a man like it He fetched out the note Now he said I take your notice You take mine Ring up the police Or shall I Then I tell him I say I don t believe the note bad at all He laughed at me He got it from the safe and laid it on the desk Not bad he jeered Not bad Then he stood looking at it mister Bundercombe I see his face change His mouth came wide open his eyes looked as though they would drop out He bend over that note He looked at it and looked at it and then he looked at me I don t believe that note ever was bad I say I told you when you charged me I didn t believe it That is why I have made up my mind to give you notice to go away from here And if that note is bad then you can put me in prison Monsieur Giatron he went back to the safe He rummaged round among a pile of papers and soon he came out again He was looking pasty colored Louis he said some one has been very clever You can go to hell And so mister Bundercombe Louis wound up beaming here I am CHAPTER XIII THE SHORN LAMB I never remembered seeing mister Bundercombe look more cheerful than when at his urgent summons I left Eve in the drawing room and made my way into the study He was standing on the hearthrug with the tails of his morning coat drooping over his arms and an expression on his face that I can only describe as cherubic Seated on chairs a yard or so away from him were two visitors of whom at first glance I formed a most unfavorable opinion One was a flashily dressed middle aged man with fair mustache puffy cheeks and a superfluity of jewelry The other I might at first have taken for an undertaker s mute He had an exceedingly red nose watery eyes and was dressed in deep mourning Paul mister Bundercombe said let me introduce you to Captain Duncan Bannister and mister Cheape his solicitor The two men rose and bowed in turn I found it difficult to maintain a tolerant attitude but I did my best These two gentlemen mister Bundercombe continued cheerfully have come round to blackmail me Sir Captain Bannister exclaimed with a great show of anger mister Bundercombe the person called mister Cheape echoed They made rather a poor show of it however mister Bundercombe wholly unperturbed by their righteous indignation smiled still benignly upon them Come come he expostulated This is a business interview Why mince words Captain Bannister rose to his feet He turned toward me mister Bundercombe he explained either willfully or otherwise misinterprets the object of our coming It is possible that his nationality may have something to do with it I have always understood that the standard among Americans with regard to affairs of honor is scarcely so high as in this country mister Bundercombe has a habit of taking a common sense view of things I remarked I cannot criticize his attitude because I am ignorant of the particulars Since he has sent for me however I presume that I am to be informed Quite so quite so mister Bundercombe murmured You go ahead Captain Bannister You tell your story My story Captain Bannister said is told in a very few words I made the acquaintance of mister Bundercombe in the smoking room at the Milan some months ago We met several times and on one occasion I presented him to a friend of mine the widow of a colonel in the Indian Army missus Delaporte At this stage mister Bundercombe who was quite irrepressible winked at me slowly I took no notice of him whatever On the particular evening to which I refer Captain Bannister continued it was suggested by missus Delaporte I think that we should go round to her rooms and play chemin de fer There were five of us altogether mister Bundercombe missus Delaporte myself a mister Dimsdale and the Honorable Montague Pelham a young gentleman of the best family When we arrived at missus Delaporte s rooms however it transpired that mister Bundercombe was wholly ignorant of chemin de fer and the game was accordingly changed to poker In the course of the game I was shocked to detect mister Bundercombe cheating For missus Delaporte s sake I conceived it best to try and hush up the matter entirely I looked upon mister Bundercombe as a card sharper of the ordinary type and I simply blamed myself for having introduced him to my friends I accordingly made some excuse to terminate the party Did any one else besides yourself I inquired observe this alleged irregularity Both missus Delaporte and mister Dimsdale distinctly saw the very flagrant piece of cheating that first attracted my attention Captain Bannister declared They understood at once the position when I suggested the termination of the game Our party broke up hurriedly Since that day I have not seen mister Bundercombe I turned toward my prospective father in law mister Bundercombe for the first time was looking a little annoyed Do you mean to tell me he said addressing Captain Bannister that both that young jay Dimsdale and missus Delaporte saw me pass up that ace Without a doubt Captain Bannister assented a little taken aback Guess my fingers must be getting a bit clumsy mister Bundercombe sighed Well well There the matter is But mister Bundercombe I asked seriously what have you to say in reply to Captain Bannister s statement Don t seem to me there s much to be said mister Bundercombe replied But he accuses you of cheating I exclaimed Oh I cheated all right mister Bundercombe admitted readily Captain Bannister turned toward me triumphantly After that confession from mister Bundercombe before witnesses he said I do not imagine that our case will require very much more proof I was completely nonplussed mister Bundercombe s confession was so ready his demeanor so unalterably good tempered I went on to ask however what certainly seemed to me the most important question under the circumstances If you were content Captain Bannister I inquired to let the matter drop a few months ago why are you here now Aha mister Bundercombe exclaimed Put his finger on the crux of the whole affair straight off Smart young fellow my son in law that is to be Now then Captain Bannister and mister Cheape speak up like men and let us know the truth You let me walk out of that flat Captain Bannister and were jolly glad to see the back of me Why this visit with a legal adviser and both of you with faces as long as fiddles Captain Bannister ignored mister Bundercombe and addressed me mister Bundercombe he said calling himself by the by mister Parker as an American card sharper was of no interest to us We were simply ashamed and disgusted to think that we should have permitted such a person the entree to our society When we discovered however that instead of being a professional card sharper Captain Bannister continued with emphasis mister Bundercombe enjoys a recognized position in society and that he is reputed to be a man of great wealth the affair assumes an altogether different complexion Worth going for ain t I mister Bundercombe chuckled I feel sure mister Walmsley Captain Bannister continued that some portion of your sympathy at any rate as an English gentleman of social distinction will be with us in this matter The affair we were content to let drop against mister Parker the adventurer we feel it our duty to pursue against mister Bundercombe the millionaire We would save time I remarked coldly if you were to put your demands into plain words What is it you want or expect from mister Bundercombe Not what you appear to think sir Captain Bannister replied stiffly We require from mister Bundercombe a written confession and his resignation from the Sidney Club The what club I asked dubiously The Sidney Club Captain Bannister repeated with dignity The club in question may not be very large but it is quite well known and I had the misfortune to act as mister Bundercombe s sponsor there I glanced toward my prospective father in law He nodded They put me up for some sort of a pothouse he admitted and I handed over a tenner I think it was for my subscription Rotten little hole somewhere near the Haymarket I ve never been in since I ll resign with pleasure And write a confession of your misdemeanor sir Captain Bannister persisted mister Bundercombe scratched his chin I ll write an account of the whole affair he remarked dryly Captain Bannister took up his hat I regret he declared that mister Bundercombe s attitude does not encourage a continuation of this conversation We will not detain you further gentlemen mister Cheape also rose They moved toward the door Much obliged to you for calling mister Bundercombe said hospitably Drop in and have a little game of cards with me any afternoon you like I am a bit out of practice but I fancy I am still in your class Captain Bannister turned round suddenly He replaced his hat upon the table and stood with folded arms Sir he announced I have changed my mind You have insulted me Five minutes ago I was prepared to treat you like a gentleman I would have accepted your resignation from the Sidney Club and your written apology Now I have changed my mind You have slandered me both by imputation and directly How much mister Bundercombe asked cheerfully Five thousand pounds Captain Bannister answered firmly How much more if I call you a lying card sharping swindler mister Bundercombe demanded with unabated good humor Captain Bannister looked dangerous but he ignored the question You have your terms sir he said Unless you are prepared to hand over the sum of five thousand pounds my solicitor mister Cheape here will at once commence proceedings against you with reference to the affair in missus Delaporte s flat Remember we have four witnesses to bring into court as to your having cheated not including your son in law here who heard your confession For any countercharge you might be disposed to make Captain Bannister concluded you have not a single scrap of evidence Got me on toast haven t they Paul mister Bundercombe observed cheerfully Five thousand pounds is a lot of money Captain Bannister he added I ll pay your taxi fare back to wherever you came from That s my best offer Captain Bannister turned toward the door Come along mister Cheape he said You know my address sir Talk this matter over with your with mister Walmsley if you please If we hear nothing from you on Monday morning a writ will be issued Before Monday mister Bundercombe declared in a hollow voice my body will be found in the Thames Kick em out Walmsley and look after the coats in the hall I infused a shade more civility into my leavetaking than mister Bundercombe s words invited As soon as the door was closed behind the two men I returned to the study mister Bundercombe was still standing upon the hearthrug but the smile had faded from his lips He looked at me a little anxiously Rotten lot of thieves he remarked I told you they were here for blackmail It s a beastly affair I pointed out gloomily You see they ve nothing to lose with a lawyer who s standing in with them in taking the case into court and you re just up for a couple of very good clubs What did happen Simple as ABC mister Bundercombe explained You see these two fellows Dimsdale and Pelham really looked like mugs I knew that Bannister was a wrong un from the first and missus Delaporte of course was in the thing When they proposed a game of cards I chipped in thinking to watch the fun When we started playing Dimsdale and Pelham were the losers Then they began to get at me Bannister palmed a king into his hand and I palmed an ace That seemed fair enough eh mister Bundercombe s expression as he looked at me was the expression of an appealing child I bit my lip A minute or two later I tumbled to the whole situation he went on Dimsdale and Pelham weren t jays at all It was a gang of four and they raked me in for the mug After I d tumbled to that I must confess I took some interest in the game If they had given me another quarter of an hour I should have won every chip there was going My boy mister Bundercombe went on a sudden grin transfiguring his expressive countenance it was worth a fortune to see their faces I was a bit out of practice but I guarantee I d make a living with my fingers and a pack of cards anywhere yet and defy detection I had em all guessing before long and Paul you should have seen their faces when they tumbled to it I tell you they bundled me out in double quick time and I laughed all the way home Four sharks to pitch upon me as a victim He began to laugh again but the sight of my grave face checked him He at once assumed the appearance of a penitent Where did you come across them again I asked I met missus Delaporte the other day he said down at Ranelagh We chatted a little while I couldn t feel any ill will against the woman I d enjoyed my evening so thoroughly Then some people stopped and talked to me and she found out who I was Soon afterward she began to throw out hints of a willingness to marry again Perhaps I wasn t very tactful Anyway she seemed a little huffed when she left me and here we are Say do you think those joshers can do anything It rather depends I replied upon their own reputations You d better let me make a few inquiries I ll have to get off now Eve s waiting I ll call round and see my solicitor later in the day Shame to bother you mister Bundercombe regretted So long The affair mister Bundercombe had treated with his customary light heartedness seemed likely to develop most unpleasantly Within forty eight hours he was the recipient of a writ from the firm of solicitors with which mister Cheape was connected and though inquiries went to prove that Captain Bannister missus Delaporte and their associates were certainly not people of the highest respectability there was yet nothing definite against them My solicitor to whom I took mister Bundercombe most regretfully advised him to settle out of court The friends mister Bundercombe is now making and may make in later life the lawyer remarked will certainly not appreciate the adventurous spirit that er induced him to make acquaintances among a certain class of people Therefore in the interests of my client mister Walmsley as well as your own mister Bundercombe he concluded I am afraid I must advise you very much against my own inclinations to settle this matter mister Bundercombe left the lawyer s office thoroughly depressed It isn t the money he declared gloomily It s being bested by this little gang of thieves that irritates me I am sure I told him that mister Wymans advice is sound If the case goes into court and comes up before the committee even of a rotten club like the Sidney I am afraid you would have to withdraw your membership from the other places and you might find the affair continually cropping up and causing you annoyance mister Bundercombe heaved a mighty sigh Well we ve got two days left he said If nothing happens before then I ll pay up mister Bundercombe rang me up on the morning of the last day appointed for his decision We ve got a conference on Paul he announced dejectedly Will you come round here for me at a quarter to eleven I assented and arrived at the house in Prince s Gardens a few minutes before that time Eve met me in the hall Please tell me dear she begged as she drew me into the morning room why daddy is so low spirited It isn t anything serious I assured her It s just a little trouble arising from one of his adventures We shall get out of it all right Poor daddy she exclaimed I am sure he has had no sleep for two nights I heard him walking up and down his room Well it will all be over to day I promised After all it only means a little money Daddy does so hate to get the worst of anything she sighed and I am afraid from the looks of his face that this time he s in a fix I am afraid so too I agreed Never mind we have done the best we can and we are going to settle it up once and for all to day Perhaps he ll tell you about it afterward We heard a door slam and mister Bundercombe s voice He is asking for you Eve whispered Hurry along and come back as soon as you ve got this business over I found mister Bundercombe exceedingly chastened but in all other respects his usual self We are calling for mister Wymans he said in Lincoln s Inn Fields and afterward we are going round to missus Delaporte s flat We are going to meet Bannister there and his lawyer Why do we concern ourselves in the matter at all I asked as we drove off I don t see why we can t leave the lawyers to do this final settlement mister Bundercombe shook his head You leave too much to lawyers in this country he remarked We generally like to see the thing through ourselves over at home even if we take a lawyer along This is an unpleasant business if you like but there s no good in shirking it We called for mister Wymans and drove on to missus Delaporte s flat We were at once admitted into an overheated and overperfumed room and found Captain Bannister missus Delaporte and mister Cheape awaiting us Their demeanor betokened anxiety missus Delaporte alone made a little conversation and the habits of a lifetime asserting themselves she made eyes at mister Bundercombe mister Bundercombe however conducted himself very much like the deacon of a chapel in the presence of his minister His natural good humor seemed to have departed His manners matched the unusual solemnity of his attire Madam he said bowing to missus Delaporte mister Cheape and Captain Bannister I have suggested this conference because I believe in settling these affairs myself and not leaving everything to lawyers no disrespect to present company I have made an idiot of myself and I am ready to pay a certain amount mister Cheape rose to his feet He was sitting in front of a writing desk with a clean sheet of paper in front of him as though prepared to take notes of the proceedings So that there may be no possible misunderstanding he intervened my clients will take not a penny less than the five thousand pounds mentioned And I mister Bundercombe declared sadly but very firmly will not give a penny more than four thousand pounds mister Cheape shrugged his shoulders as though to intimate that the conference was at an end Captain Bannister made a few remarks to the effect that if he had not been a moderate man and willing to conduct the affair in a gentlemanly manner he should have asked for ten thousand missus Delaporte alluded to five thousand pounds as though the amount represented the outcome of a day s shopping It was astonishing how little they seemed to regard the value of money Now mister Bundercombe went on if I ve brought you all together here on false pretenses I am sorry There s nothing to be done in that case but to say good morning and meet in the law court But he added striking the back of a chair with his clenched fist and looking more like Napoleon than I had ever seen him I swear by the word of Joseph H Bundercombe which has never yet been broken that I will not hand over one cent more than four thousand pounds The protests were this time a little weaker mister Bundercombe sat with folded arms with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling and an air of being altogether disinterested in the proceedings while the three who comprised the other party whispered together Presently mister Cheape rose to his feet mister Wymans he began punctiliously addressing the lawyer first and mister Bundercombe my clients are only too anxious to end this unhappy matter They feel that their demands have been most moderate but at my advice they have consented to accept a reduction of five hundred pounds mister Bundercombe rose heavily to his feet mister Wymans he said and Paul come along I do not bargain I wish you all good morning He turned toward the door and we followed him It was already opened when we were called back Captain Bannister and mister Cheape were whispering eagerly together mister Cheape rose once more to his feet In order to prove he announced how entirely devoid my clients are of mercenary considerations they agree mister Bundercombe to accept the sum of four thousand pounds mister Bundercombe put down his hat again Then he drew a sheet of paper from his pocket Condition number one then he observed is now agreed upon We proceed to condition number two missus Delaporte Captain Bannister and mister Cheape he went on earnestly I have been guilty of an indiscretion the proof of which is in your hands Having decided to make London my home for a time I desire once and for all to extinguish all possibility of this affair ever cropping up again in any shape or form mister Cheape rose to his feet Sir he said to mister Bundercombe my clients will give you their written undertaking that the affair shall be consigned to oblivion mister Bundercombe waved him down My reasons for feeling so strongly on the matter he continued will be appreciated by you Captain Bannister as a man of position and in society Captain Bannister bowed when I tell you that my future son in law mister Walmsley M P has proposed me for membership in two of the most exclusive clubs in London This affair therefore must be killed beyond any manner of doubt I am handing over to you four thousand pounds which is a very considerable sum but in return for it I desire that my future immunity be purchased by your signatures to this document mister Cheape rose at once to his feet A document he observed Let me read it mister Bundercombe handed it over mister Cheape read it out aloud We the undersigned desire to apologize most sincerely to mister Joseph H Bundercombe for any allegations we have made against him with regard to a certain episode that took place on March eighteenth or thereabout in the flat of missus Delaporte We admit that we were mistaken in the supposition which we certainly entertained at the time that mister Bundercombe had been guilty of cheating and we withdraw such allegations unreservedly and tender our apologies Ridiculous Captain Bannister exclaimed Absurd missus Delaporte echoed I may add mister Cheape joined in that I could not possibly recommend my clients to sign such a document mister Bundercombe took up his hat When I started out this morning he declared I felt convinced that this conference would come to nothing I told mister Wymans here that I was prepared to settle but on my own terms and my own terms only I don t want any undertaking not to molest me in the future That isn t good enough I want to be able to show a document such as you have there which completely exculpates me from any charge that might at any time be brought And without it he added once more bringing his fist down upon the back of the chair I do not part with one penny of my four thousand pounds mister Cheape read out a document he himself had prepared but mister Bundercombe waved it away Come Paul he said to me with a sigh Come mister Wymans I disclaim all responsibility for the failure of this conference I have done my best It cannot matter a snap of the fingers to our friends here in what form the document is couched that they give me in exchange for my four thousand pounds Since they are so particular about a trifle I have finished with them He led the way toward the door and there was an appearance of finality about his tone and shoulders exceedingly convincing We had reached the threshold and were indeed indulging in a little skirmish as to who should pass through the door first when mister Cheape s resigned voice checked us My clients he announced slowly will sign your document mister Bundercombe They protest they protest vigorously against its wording but they are anxious to show you in how large spirited and gentlemanly a manner they wish this affair to be concluded Once more they yield mister Bundercombe without any signs of exultation returned to his former place put down his hat upon the chair and drew a checkbook from his breast coat pocket If you will give me a seat and a pen he said I will write you a check for the amount Captain Bannister stared at the checkbook He glanced at mister Cheape and mister Cheape very vigorously shook his head I am sorry he objected but my clients cannot think of accepting a check in settlement of this matter mister Bundercombe began to show symptoms of annoyance Bless my soul he exclaimed Isn t the check of Joseph H Bundercombe good enough for you mister Cheape laid his hand soothingly upon mister Bundercombe s shoulder It isn t that we doubt your check sir he pointed out but in a transaction of this sort it is best that no evidences of a lasting nature should exist A check is not as you know legal tender and a check my clients certainly could not accept mister Bundercombe folded up his checkbook and replaced it in his pocket Then what are you going to do about it he asked Where is your bank mister Cheape inquired In Pall Mall mister Bundercombe answered Then I am afraid mister Cheape decided there is nothing for it but to ask you to repair there and cash your own check mister Bundercombe rose to his feet All right he agreed I suppose we had better finish the affair while we are about it One of you had better come with me Captain Bannister promptly volunteered He and I and mister Bundercombe descended the stairs and entered the car We pulled up in a few minutes at the door of mister Bundercombe s bank Will you come in with me mister Bundercombe invited turning to Captain Bannister Captain Bannister excused himself I will wait here with mister Walmsley he said if you will allow me mister Bundercombe departed inside the bank and reappeared in the course of a few moments His breast coat pocket was bulging On our way back he drew out five packets of banknotes which he counted carefully Captain Bannister watched him out of the corner of his eye with a hungry expression We were only absent from the flat altogether about a quarter of an hour and the rest of the affair was promptly settled The notes were counted by mister Cheape the document signed by Captain Bannister and missus Delaporte I am sure Captain Bannister declared holding the notes in his left hand that no one can be more glad than missus Delaporte and myself that this little affair has been concluded so amicably If you will allow me mister Bundercombe to offer you a little refreshment mister Bundercombe sighed Well he said I suppose it s all in the day s work for you people I don t mind admitting though money wasn t so easily earned in my days that I can watch four thousand pounds go without feeling it Thank you that ll do nicely he added accepting the brandy and soda Captain Bannister handed him mister Wymans looked on with stern disapproval and I must say I sympathized with him mister Bundercombe however not only drained the glass with relish but accepted the outstretched hand of Captain Bannister and afterward shook hands also with missus Delaporte If you are passing at any time she whispered in his ear I had had enough of it and I dragged mister Bundercombe away We drove back to Prince s Gardens in somewhat ominous silence mister Wymans would have taken his leave but mister Bundercombe begged him to come into the library One moment he insisted James he said addressing the butler mister Wymans will stay to lunch One moment mister Bundercombe went to the telephone Mechanically he handed me the additional receiver He asked for a number and presently received a reply Say is that Captain Bannister I am speaking to he said I thought I recognized the voice This is mister Bundercombe Yes yes No there s nothing we d forgotten I just rang you up though to give you a word of advice You want to be just a leetle careful where you try to change those notes What do you mean sir I heard Captain Bannister demand in startled accents What do you mean mister Bundercombe Well mister Bundercombe continued those notes are just about the cleverest things I ever came across but after all they aren t exactly the genuine article I got four thousand pounds worth of them from a young fellow I was interested in and I had them put in a safe at my bank so that no one should get into any trouble It just occurred to me since we began our little negotiations that I saw a good way of making use of them I had only four thousand pounds worth so I had to beat you down a bit However that ll be all right captain only as I say use them a bit carefully Jove Ain t he making the telephone sing mister Bundercombe added turning to me I guess I ll ring off He put down the receiver Once more the accustomed smile was creeping over his face mister Wymans was looking dazed The butler had entered the room with the cocktails Say Paul mister Bundercombe expostulated you didn t really think I was parting with four thousand pounds to a sloppy gang like that did you I knew a young chap who was very clever at making those notes he explained to mister Wymans I liked him and converted him and I sent him over to the States where he s got a good situation and is working honestly for his living This was the remainder of his stock I had em lying in the safe deposit of the bank meaning some day to destroy em You ve got that apology all right mister Wymans slowly smiled He raised his glass to his lips You are a very clever man mister Bundercombe he said CHAPTER XIV mister BUNDERCOMBE S LOVE AFFAIR mister Bundercombe who notwithstanding his wife s temporary absence in the country had not been in the best of spirits for several days during the course of our tete a tete dinner at Luigi s became suddenly and unexpectedly animated The change in him was so noticeable that I leaned forward in my place to see what could have produced it Two people had entered the restaurant and were in conversation now with Luigi about a table mister Bundercombe who in the affairs of every day life had no idea of concealing his feelings was regarding them with every appearance of lively interest Paul he whispered you must notice these two people Watch them there s a good fellow They took their places at a table almost opposite ours The girl though she was more quietly and tastefully dressed and seemed to me to be better looking I recognized at once as mister Bundercombe s companion at Prince s Restaurant on one memorable occasion The man I had never seen before He appeared to be of about medium height slim with a sallow skin dark sleepy eyes which suggested the foreigner a mouth that straight and firm though it was turned up a little at the corners as though in contradiction of his somewhat indolent general appearance He was exceedingly well dressed and carried himself with the quiet assurance of a man accustomed to moving in the world Most interesting mister Bundercombe murmured having with an effort withdrawn his eyes from the pair The girl you doubtless recognize She was once a typist in the office of Messrs Harding Densmore She was quite lately as I dare say you remember able to give me some very useful information in fact it is through her that mister Stanley did not leave this country for South Africa with a hundred pounds in his pocket And the man I asked mister Bundercombe was thoroughly enjoying himself He drew his chair a little closer to mine and waited until he was quite sure that no one was within earshot The man he replied is one of the world s most famous criminals He doesn t look it I remarked glancing across the room with some interest mister Bundercombe smiled Great criminals are not all of the same type he reminded me reprovingly That is where you people who don t understand the cult of criminology make your foolish mistakes Our friend opposite is without a doubt of gentle though not of aristocratic birth I know nothing of his bringing up but his instincts do all that is necessary for him The first time I saw him was in one of the criminal courts in New York He was being tried for his life for an attempted robbery in Fifth Avenue and the murder of a policeman He defended himself and did it brilliantly In the end he got off There is scarcely a person however who doubts but that he was guilty I looked across at the subject of our discussion with renewed interest He shot him I suppose I asked On the contrary mister Bundercombe replied he throttled him The man has the sinews of an ox The second time I saw him was at a dancing hall in New York He was there with a very gay party indeed but one of them the wealthiest mysteriously disappeared Rodwell Dagger Rodwell was his nickname came to England I saw him once or twice just before I visited you down in Bedfordshire Cullen warned me off him however wouldn t let me have a word to say to him He doesn t sound the best companion in the world for your little typist friend I remarked mister Bundercombe glanced across the room and at that moment the girl noticed him She bowed and waved her hand mister Bundercombe responded gallantly I fancy he murmured that she can take care of herself Come I really feel that I am in an interesting atmosphere once more mister Bundercombe s deportment was certainly more cheerful For the last week or two he had been depressed He had paid visits with Eve and myself and devoted a reasonable amount of time to his wife The demands on his complete respectability however had been irksome He was too obviously finding no savor in life I really was not altogether sorry at first to notice the improvement in his spirits though my sentiments changed when a little later in the evening the girl opposite left her place and came over to us She greeted mister Bundercombe with the most brilliant of smiles and he held her hand quite as long as was necessary He presented me and I learned that her name was Miss Blanche Spencer I must not stay long she said laughing The gentleman I am with is a sort of cousin of mine and we don t get on very well but I mustn t be rude mister Bundercombe and she seemed to have a good deal to say to each other and presently I noticed that their heads were drawing closer together The girl dropped her voice She was proposing something to which mister Bundercombe was listening with keen interest I heard him sigh If it weren t for certain changes he explained regretfully I guess I wouldn t hesitate a moment But I heard a whispered reference to myself as his daughter s fiance and an allusion to the continued presence of his wife in London She nodded sympathetically Now if there were any other way mister Bundercombe concluded in which I could still further show my gratitude to you personally for a certain little matter why I m all for hearing about it I consider the balance is still on my side She laughed You re really rather a dear she declared Do you know I am thinking of starting in business for myself Where and what as mister Bundercombe inquired I shook open an evening paper and heard no more The girl s leavetaking however a few minutes later was both reluctant and impressive I felt it my duty to allude to the matter as soon as we were alone You know sir I said this helping young women to set up in business is a proceeding that s very likely to be misunderstood over here I am not in the least sure that even Eve would quite approve mister Bundercombe smiled the smile of a man of the world One can t tell one s womenkind everything he declared grandiloquently I was a little puzzled I felt convinced that mister Bundercombe was concealing something from me Furthermore I continued feeling it my duty to speak frankly to my future father in law a man of your position needs to be very careful when he has financial transactions with a good looking young woman like Miss Blanche The young lady herself might take advantage of it mister Bundercombe appeared to be giving my words full consideration Well well he said a little vaguely We shall see I don t mind telling you though Paul that I would have nothing to say to her first suggestion on your account my boy There s a scheme on foot in which her interesting companion is concerned which needs financing I haven t the least doubt that it is something entirely interesting probably a mammoth jewel robbery or something of the sort I looked across at the man who seemed to be reproaching the girl for her long absence Almost at that moment he looked up and our eyes met for a brief instant There seemed to be nothing in his gaze beyond a measure of polite and not too pointed interest Nevertheless when I looked away I begged mister Bundercombe to call for the bill I have had enough of this place I declared a little abruptly Next time Eve goes to bed with a headache I shall take you to the club I was walking down Bond Street with Eve one morning when my suspicions as to mister Bundercombe and a certain matter were first roused As we neared the Piccadilly end I distinctly saw him vanish through a doorway on the lefthand side He was most carefully dressed and carried in his hand a long paper parcel that could contain nothing but flowers Upon some excuse I prevailed upon Eve to cross the road There was one small brass plate only on the side of the entrance through which mister Bundercombe had disappeared It was scarcely larger than my hand and on it was engraved in very elegant characters BLANCHE MANICURE I made no comment at the time but curiously enough that afternoon as we sat out under the trees at Ranelagh Eve referred to the subject of her parent Do you notice Paul she asked how much less we see of dad lately He does seem to have been out a good deal I admitted She glanced at me You haven t any idea I suppose The glance and her tone were quite sufficient for me I hastened to disclaim all responsibility for mister Bundercombe Your father I assured her has never treated me with less confidence Whatever he may be doing at present he is doing let me assure you entirely on his own responsibility Then I think if you don t mind please she begged you must try and get him to take you into his confidence Of course she went on watching idly a polo team canter into the field I do not wish you to feel that he is in any way a responsibility On the other hand it does seem so queer Paul He has taken to dressing most carefully and he leaves the house regularly every morning at ten o clock You ve no clew at all as to what he does with himself I asked None she replied except that I never saw any one with such overmanicured nails as his I never knew him to go to a manicurist in my life but he is obviously going to one nearly every day now or he couldn t keep the polish on If that helps in any way It might I admitted with a sigh There he is Eve exclaimed suddenly Coming toward us too Do please take this opportunity Paul and see if you can find out anything You see a week ago he seemed bored to tears and now he has just that happy contented expression which he wears all the time when he is really engaged in something outrageous I will go and talk to your sister I think she is over there with Captain Green mister Bundercombe greeted me heartily and at once directed my attention to a small tent where cool drinks were being served I suffered him to lead me in that direction and placed myself in his hands as regards the selection of a suitable beverage We found a small table and sat down Haven t seen much of you lately sir I began Huh That s because I don t spend three parts of my time in milliners shops mister Bundercombe replied Where are you spending most of your time I asked determined to take the bull by the horns mister Bundercombe set down his glass I ve been expecting this he remarked pleasantly Eve s been setting you on to pump me eh I nodded That s exactly it I admitted We are due to be married in ten days We are neither of us anxious for anything in the way of an unfortunate incident mister Bundercombe appeared to view with surprise the advent of a second tumbler He reconciled himself to its arrival however and handed money to the attendant I realize the position entirely my dear fellow he assured me I am glad you have opened the subject up I have been bursting to tell you all about it but I have hesitated for fear of being misunderstood I glanced at his nails Of course I observed slowly the position of an elderly gentleman with a marriageable daughter and a wife I went on bravely who finances a young lady interested in manicuring in an establishment in Bond Street is liable to misinterpretation mister Bundercombe was a little taken aback He hid his face for a moment behind the newly arrived tumbler Kind of observant aren t you he remarked I saw you in Bond Street this morning I told him you and a paper parcel You were entering the establishment I believe of Mademoiselle Blanche whoever she is Small place London mister Bundercombe sighed Were you er alone I was with Eve I replied but she did not see you and I did not mention the matter My boy mister Bundercombe decided I shall take you wholly into my confidence I am engaged in a big affair My heart sank I can only pray to Heaven I said fervently that the denouement of this affair will not take place within the next ten days On the contrary mister Bundercombe answered leaning back in his chair and looking at me with the flat of one hand laid on the table and the palm of the other on his left knee on the contrary he repeated the denouement is due to morrow Glad you didn t consider us I observed gloomily mister Bundercombe smiled I find myself in this last affair he remarked airily occupying what I must confess for me is a somewhat peculiar position I am on the side of the established authorities I am in the cast iron position of the man who falls into line with the law of the land In other words you behold in me so far as regards this affair respectability and rectitude personified I may even choose to give our friend mister Cullen a leg up I was relieved to hear it and told him so I presume I said that Mademoiselle Blanche of Bond Street is identical with the young lady who talked to us at Stephano s the other night Say you re becoming perfectly wonderful at the art of deduction my future father in law declared Same person She seems quite attractive I admitted with a taste for pink roses I think mister Bundercombe appeared to regard my remark as frivolous He moved his chair however and brought it closer to mine I dare say you remember he went on how the young lady proposed to me that night that I should finance a little venture in which she and her sleepy eyed friend opposite were interested I nodded Yes I remember that From that mister Bundercombe continued she went on to suggest that I should help her in the ambition of her life which it seems was to take a single room for manicuring a few clients In an ordinary way I should have refused that too and if she had been hard up begged to be allowed to oblige her with a trifling loan and ended the matter in that way The reason I didn t was simply because I felt convinced that her desire to require a single room in the manicure business was somehow associated with the scheme she had at first suggested Therefore I temporized I appeared to be interested I asked her in what locality she wished to commence business She never hesitated There was only one place she wanted and that was the room she s got Just to test her I took her to see really slap up premises in another part of Bond Street She pretended to look at them but never took the slightest interest It was just one room she wanted and one room only I realized that both she and her friend were either too desperately hard up to engage that room or else they were particularly anxious to do it in some one else s name That was quite enough for me I engaged the room I glanced once more at mister Bundercombe s nails You at any rate I remarked have been a faithful customer Paul mister Bundercombe continued I am playing a part I am playing the part of a silly old fool It isn t easy sometimes but I am keeping it up I spend a good part of my time in that beastly little parlor having my nails done over and over again The girl is bored to death and I though I flatter myself I don t show it I guess I m bored to death too I ve kept it up all right until now and the job comes off to morrow Miss Blanche is convinced that my interest in her is sentimental and she has occasionally not been quite so careful as she might have been I have picked up here and there certain small details that enable me to form a very fair idea as to the nature of this venture in which I was invited to participate The last few days I have been hesitating whether I should take you into my confidence or not As it happens you have forced it Have you anything particular to do to morrow I thought for a moment Nothing very much until the late afternoon when I go down to the House I replied Then to morrow you shall see the end of this thing with me mister Bundercombe promised If luck goes our way you will find we shall have quite a pleasant few minutes Eve put her head in at the tent and we hastened to join her She drew me a little on one side I think it s all right I told her I am so glad she replied And Paul hadn t you better drop dad a hint that missus Bundercombe will be home to morrow I think he d better have the shine taken off his nails At twelve o clock the next morning I met mister Bundercombe by appointment in the Burlington Arcade We strolled slowly round into Bond Street mister Bundercombe was for him unusually serious He looked about him all the time with swift careful glances As we turned into Bond Street his pace became slower and slower Within a yard or two of the spot where I had first seen him disappear he paused and under pretense of talking earnestly to me he looked up and down and across the street with keen careful glances At last with a sudden turn he led the way into the passage Together we ascended the stairs On a door almost opposite to us at the end of the landing was another little brass plate on which was engraved the name of Mademoiselle Blanche mister Bundercombe took a latchkey from his pocket and opened the door which he carefully closed after him No one here I remarked Not yet mister Bundercombe said a little grimly From now onward you will be able to understand certain things Miss Blanche informed me that to day she had an invitation to go into the country It was the only way I could discover the day in which they were planning to bring off the coup If I had been an occasional visitor she might have risked my coming and finding her away Since however I presented myself every morning at eleven o clock she was forced to tell me You understand as much as that Perfectly You see where we are then mister Bundercombe continued Has any reason occurred to you for the young lady s unalterable decision that no other spot in the whole of London would do for her manicure parlor I looked out the window We are next door to Tarteran s I observed mister Bundercombe smiled approvingly We are within a few yards he said of the jeweler s shop that contains more valuable gems than any other establishment in the world We are at the present moment within forty yards of a million pounds worth of jewels When you come to reflect upon the character and the past of our friend Dagger Rodwell you will understand the significance of that fact I was beginning to share mister Bundercombe s obvious excitement I too had the feeling that we were on the brink of an adventure He made me stand up against the wall by the side of the window so that I could see down into the street He himself was farther back in the room Follow my lead closely in everything Paul he directed Meantime keep your eye glued on the pavement If things turn out as I expect there will be a gray touring motor car outside Tarteran s shop in the course of a few minutes From that car will descend Dagger Rodwell He will enter Tarteran s Watch then as though your very life depended upon it I squeezed myself against the wall and looked down upon the never ending procession The street was continually blocked with motor cars and taxicabs On the other side of the way streams of people were moving all the time I recognized many acquaintances even in those few minutes And then suddenly I saw the gray motor car I held out my hand to mister Bundercombe Without the slightest attempt at concealment the man mister Bundercombe had called Dagger Rodwell alighted from the motor and stood for a moment looking into the windows of Tarteran s shop before he entered He was faultlessly dressed in morning clothes smoking a cigarette and carrying a silver headed cane After some hesitation he entered the shop mister Bundercombe drew a little breath He had been looking at another part of the street Now things are beginning to move he observed softly Come here Paul He pulled aside a little curtain behind which was a sort of cubicle an easy chair a manicurist s stool and a table Step inside here he whispered quickly I obeyed him and in an instant he had entered a similar one We were scarcely there before I heard the sound of a key in the door Through a chink in the curtain I saw Miss Blanche She pushed back the latch and stood for a moment as though listening her face turned toward the stairs up which she had come If I had had any doubt but that tragedy was afoot that morning it would have been banished by a glance at her face She was terribly pale her hands were shaking Rapidly she withdrew the pins from her hat hung it upon a peg and smoothed her hair in front of the looking glass Then though her hands were trembling all the time she filled a bowl with hot water and arranged a manicure set on a little table Once or twice she stopped to listen Once as though drawn by some fascination she was powerless to resist she moved to the window and looked down into the street mister Bundercombe remained motionless and I followed his example At the back of my cubicle was a window from which I could still gain a view of the pavement The streets were thronged with people and I noticed that the motor car which at first I had missed was standing in a side street almost opposite Suddenly I saw the man for whose reappearance I was so earnestly waiting step casually out on to the pavement He attempted to cross the street and was quickly lost to sight in a tangle of vehicles A second later I could have sworn that I saw him back again at the entrance to the passage below Then I heard a shout from the pavement and I distinctly saw him clamber into the motor car which shot off as though it had started in fourth speed An elderly gentleman who had rushed from the shop was halfway across the street already There was a chorus of shouts traffic was momentarily suspended a policeman started running down the side street Then I turned away from the window There were sounds closer at hand a footstep on the stairs swift and gentle In a moment the door of the little manicure room was opened and closed Dagger Rodwell stood there pale and breathless Not a word passed between him and the girl He dashed into the third of the little cubicles and it seemed to me that in less than thirty seconds he reappeared The change was marvelous He was wearing a tweed suit and a gray Homburg hat His eyeglass had gone Even his collar and tie seemed different He sat down before the girl and held out his hand They listened There was plenty of commotion in the street no sound at all on the stairs We ve done it he muttered They re after the car They ll catch Dolly He ll bluff it out she whispered Sure Don t let your hands tremble like that you little fool We re safe I tell you Get on with your work Now the two were three or four yards away from the cubicle in which I was but almost within a couple of feet of mister Bundercombe s From where I was sitting I saw suddenly a strange thing I saw mister Bundercombe s left arm shoot out from behind the curtain In a moment he had the man by the throat His other hand traveled over his clothes like lightning It was all over almost before I could think Rodwell was on his feet with a livid mark on his throat and mister Bundercombe had stepped back with a little shining revolver in his hand which he was carefully stowing away in his pocket Sorry to be a trifle hasty mister Rodwell he said I saw the shape of this little weapon in your pocket and it didn t seem altogether agreeable to me We are not great at firearms over this side you know Blanche and Rodwell stared at him To complete their stupefaction I stepped out of my cubicle What sort of a game is this Rodwell muttered though he was pale to the lips Blanche He turned toward her with sudden fierceness She sat there wringing her hands mister Bundercombe she exclaimed feebly mister Bundercombe So this is your silly old fool is it Rodwell hissed This is the old fool you could twist round your finger who found the money for your manicure parlor and who was in love with you eh What are you anyway he added turning furiously upon mister Bundercombe A cop Is this why you were trying to put up to me a few weeks ago mister Bundercombe waved aside the accusation Nothing of the sort he declared Then what is it you want Rodwell demanded Is it a share of the swag you re after mister Bundercombe shook his head I am afraid he sighed there will not be any swag Rodwells face was the most vicious thing I had ever looked on yet he kept his head mister Bundercombe and I were an impossible proposition to an unarmed man In the first place mister Bundercombe said I must congratulate you most heartily on your scheme I saw your double bolt across the road and jump into the car Everyone s eyes were upon him They never saw you slip round into the passage Your double is I presume well supplied with an alibi and evidences of respectability Rodwell nodded shortly It s his own car and he s an automobile agent he replied He d been in the next shop The people there will be able to swear to him he gave them plenty of trouble on purpose And you mister Bundercombe murmured have the necklace I have Rodwell snapped What about it I ve got to divide with the girl here How much do you want Only the necklace mister Bundercombe replied mister Rodwell s geographical description of where he would see mister Bundercombe first is too lurid for print mister Bundercombe however only shook his head with a gentle smile upon his lips If you re not a cop and you won t stand in what in the name of glory are you Rodweil spluttered at last I am afraid I must describe myself as a meddler mister Bundercombe confessed an intervener I stand midway between the law and the criminal I sympathize wholly with neither I admire the skill and courage you have shown to day but I also sympathize with the head of that establishment whom you have relieved of possibly many thousand pounds worth of diamonds I could not Rodwell made his effort but mister Bundercombe was more than ready Intervention on my part was quite unnecessary mister Bundercombe s left arm shot out like a piston rod and the unfortunate victim of his blow remained on the carpet with his hand to his cheek Quite in order of course mister Bundercombe remarked but absolutely useless Boxing was my only sport when I was a young man to say nothing of my remarkably athletic young companion It won t do Rodwell You d better hand over the jewels Give them to Miss Blanche and she ll hand them to me They re in a morocco case I think in your trousers pocket Rodwell produced them sullenly It s your fault you miserable little fool he muttered to Blanche I ought to have known better than to have let you into the thing Fancy taking him for a mug mister Bundercombe smiled a pleased smile Come come he said Things are not so bad You might have been caught Aren t you going to give information Rodwell asked quickly Not a thought of it mister Bundercombe assured him catching the case Rodwell threw toward him I want so far as possible to see both sides happy Here Paul put these in your pocket he added turning to me If you take my advice Rodwell he concluded you ll stay where you are until I return I promise you that mister Walmsley and I will return alone and that I will give no intimation of your presence here to any person whatsoever Rodwell was puzzled He rose slowly to his feet however and walked toward the basin at the other end of the apartment All right he agreed sullenly I shall be here mister Bundercombe and I descended into the street I was feeling a little dazed mister Bundercombe led the way into the Tarteran establishment which was still in a state of disorder He asked to speak to the principal who came forward still looking very perturbed Sorry to hear of this robbery mister Bundercombe said Have they caught the fellow They caught the man in the motor car the manager groaned but he had no jewels on him and my people can t swear to him He seems to have a very coherent story Have you communicated with the police mister Bundercombe asked The manager stretched out his hand Four of them are in the place now he answered a little despairingly What s the good The fellow s got away He s got the finest necklace in the shop with him gems worth twenty thousand pounds mister Bundercombe nodded sympathetically Have you offered a reward yet We can t do everything in ten minutes the manager replied a little testily We shall offer one of course What amount are you prepared to go to mister Bundercombe asked The man looked at him eagerly Do you mean sir he began mister Bundercombe stretched out his hands You may search me he interrupted I have nothing in the way of jewels on me My name is Joseph H Bundercombe and I have a house in Prince s Gardens This is my son in law to be mister Walmsley M P for Bedfordshire The manager bowed I know you quite well sir he said and mister Walmsley of course both he and many of his relatives are valued clients of ours But about the jewels What reward do you offer Five hundred pounds was the prompt reply more if necessary mister Bundercombe smiled approvingly Circumstances he explained of a peculiar nature into which I am quite sure it will suit your purpose not to inquire have enabled me to claim the reward and to restore to you the jewels The manager gripped him by the arm Come into the office at once he begged We followed him into a little room at the back of the shop He was trembling all over No questions asked mister Bundercombe insisted Not the shadow of one the manager agreed I don t care if pardon me sir if you stole them yourself The loss of those jewels would do the firm more harm than I can explain to you mister Bundercombe turned toward me and I produced the case The manager seized it eagerly opened it turned on the electric light and closed the case again with a great sigh of relief He held out his hand mister Bundercombe he said I don t care how you got these I have been robbed three times and put the matter into the hands of the police and never recovered a single stone I d shake hands with the man who stole them so long as I got them back How will you have the reward sir Notes if you can manage it mister Bundercombe replied The manager went to his safe and counted over notes and gold to the amount of five hundred pounds which mister Bundercombe buttoned up in his pockets I ask you now sir he said for your word of honor that you will not have us followed or make any further inquiries into this affair It is given freely given the manager promised When you leave this establishment I shall turn my back to you You may hand over the notes to whosoever you like upon the pavement outside and it won t concern me Nor he added shall I tell the police for at least half an hour that I have the necklace They deserve a little extra trouble for letting the fellow get away mister Bundercombe and I left the shop and ascended the stairs leading to the manicure parlor Rodwell who had bathed his face and made a complete change of toilet was pacing up and down the little room Blanche too was there still pale and weeping Now mister Bundercombe began as he carefully closed the door behind him I told you a few minutes ago I was neither on your side nor on the side of the law I am about to prove it I have returned the jewels to Tarteran s no questions to be asked and I ve got the reward There you are young lady he added placing the roll of notes and a handful of gold in her hand You have given me a week or so of intense interest and amusement There is your reward for it If you want to divide it with your friend it s nothing to do with me Take it and run along So far as regards this little establishment the rent is paid for another three months but so far as regards my connection with it I think I needn t explain That you ve been fooling me the girl interrupted a faint smile at the corners of her lips Do you know sometimes I suspected that you weren t in earnest And then one day I saw your wife and I wasn t sure Good morning mister Bundercombe said severely Come along Paul CHAPTER XV LORD PORTHONING S LESSON mister Bundercombe laid his hand compellingly on my arm Who s the wizened up little insect with a snarl on his face he inquired of me earnestly My slight impulse of irritation at such a description applied to one of my wedding guests passed when I looked up and saw the person to whom mister Bundercombe had directed my attention I recognized the adequacy of the wording That I replied is the Earl of Porthoning Kind of connection isn t he mister Bundercombe inquired I nodded His son married my sister mister Bundercombe regarded him with a certain wistfulness which I did not at that moment understand Just then Lord Porthoning made his way toward us As I watched him approach I realized more than ever the justice of mister Bundercombe s description He was undersized bent nearly double and on his wizened face and shining out of his narrow black eyes was an indescribable expression of malevolence Even the smile with which he greeted me had something unpleasant in it Well Paul he exclaimed Well my boy so you re hooked at last are you Considering that I was enjoying a few minutes respite in my task of helping Eve receive our wedding guests the statement though crude was obvious enough Glad to see you Lord Porthoning I said lying miserably Do you know my father in law mister Bundercombe mister Bundercombe extended his ready hand which my connection however appeared not to see Yes yes he admitted Some one pointed him out to me I asked who on earth it could be No offense mind Lord Porthoning continued but I hate all Americans and our connections with them I have been looking at your presents Paul A poorish lot a poorish lot Now I was at Dick Stanley s wedding last week married Colonel Morrison s daughter you know Never saw such jewelry in my life Four necklaces and a tiara from the Duchess of Westshire that must have been worth a cool ten thousand pounds I am sorry my wedding presents do not meet with your approval I remarked Personally I think it is very kind of my friends to send me anything at all Rubbish Paul Rubbish my amiable connection interjected irritably Don t talk like an idiot You know they send you things because they ve got to You ve been through it yourself Must have cost you a pretty penny in your time sending out wedding presents Now you reap the harvest I suppose I observed dryly that yours is the reasonable point of view Absolutely my dear fellow absolutely Lord Porthoning declared Of course you couldn t expect quite the same enthusiasm on the part of your friends when you marry a young lady who is a stranger to all of them and who comes from the backwoods of America Can t think how it is you young Englishmen can marry nothing nowadays unless it shows its legs upon the stage or has a transatlantic drawl I am going in to see if the champagne they re opening now is any better The first glass I had was horrid My father in law watched him disappear through the crowd and stood patiently by my side while I exchanged greetings with a few newly arrived friends Say he observed presently as soon as an opportunity rose for private conversation He s a pleasant old gentleman that connection of yours Glad you think so I answered I don t call myself a bad natured fellow and to day I feel inclined to be friends with every one but I tell you frankly I can t bear the sight of Lord Porthoning He has to be asked but he s like a wet blanket wherever he goes mister Bundercombe glanced round a moment Then he leaned toward me His manner was earnest almost pleading Paul he said dropping his voice to a whisper don t you think it s up to us to give a disagreeable little worm like that a bit of a lesson eh His lordship has his own way too much Now if you ll leave it to me I ll give him just a kind of a scare a shake up you know no real harm just teach him perhaps not to open his mouth so much What do you say Paul I turned and looked at my father in law His expression was that of a schoolboy begging for a holiday His head was a little on one side his lips were parted in an insinuating smile It was a weak moment with me So far as such a term can be applied to such an event the wedding ceremony which was just over had been a great success Eve had looked simply as beautiful as a beautiful girl can look on the one morning of her life My father in law had been dignified and correct in his behavior and a merciful misadventure of missus Bundercombe with a policeman three days previously which had led to her being arrested with a hammer in her satchel had finally resulted in her being forced to partake of the hospitality of Holloway for the period of fourteen days in fact everything just then with me was couleur de rose The presents my crabbed connection spoke of so lightly had been supplemented only an hour before by surely the most magnificent wedding offering from my father in law that any man could have the house in which we were and the whole of the furniture It was hard to refuse mister Bundercombe anything Before I knew exactly what had happened my smile had answered his Well I said I rely upon your discretion mister Bundercombe A little lesson would certainly do Porthoning no harm Whereupon mister Bundercombe fearing apparently that I might change my mind vanished among the crowd and the matter to tell the truth disappeared from my mind for a short time I was surrounded by friends and the occasion joyful though it was possessed a certain unique sentimentality that I found sufficiently absorbing Eve brought me the latest telegram from missus Bundercombe which we read together Insist upon ceremony being postponed Am commencing hunger strike Shall be with you in three days Your stepmother s intentions I remarked to Eve may be excellent but I don t think they ll bring her so far as the Austrian Tyrol Eve s eyes were lit with laughter A moment later however she sighed Poor dad she murmured I m afraid he ll have a terrible time when she does come out He d have a worse if she knew I rejoined half to myself Eve looked at me suspiciously She drew a little nearer Paul she whispered in my ear is it true that the inspector who had her followed all that morning was a friend of dad s I shook my head I am giving nobody away I replied firmly Of course there were certain troubles to be got over in connection with your mother s presence to day You remember her saying for instance that she would break every bottle of wine she found being served Eve nodded Perhaps she murmured with a half smile it is for the best Where is dad I glanced round the room and at that moment I saw mister Bundercombe making signs to me from the doorway I hurried toward him and he drew me out into the hall Things are in train Paul he announced cheerfully Now all I want from you is just the smallest amount of help in this little affair I looked at him blankly I had forgotten all about Lord Porthoning It s a very small share indeed mister Bundercombe continued pleadingly but such as it is it s up to you to take it on at this moment There the little insect goes into the cloakroom He has gone for his hat and coat All you ve got to do is just to follow him and ask him to come back for one moment That little room on the left across the hall is empty Bring him into that Leave the rest to me You re not going too far are you I asked You see after all the old blackguard is a sort of connection mister Bundercombe laid his hand on my shoulder My boy he said there will be nothing but just a little incident that you can tell to Eve and laugh about on your way to the station That I promise you I nodded and crossed the hall Lord Porthoning was preparing to leave Have my car called up he ordered the footman from the doorstep Mind I m not going to hang about on the pavement in this sun for any one If that s the motor waiting for the young people it ll have to get out of the way Lord Porthoning s car at once young fellow Hello Paul he added Come to see me off eh Could I have just one word with you Lord Porthoning I begged as casually as possible Be quick then If I haven t wished you happiness it s because I can t see what chance you have of getting it But I suppose you re like all other young fools on their wedding day you think the sun s shining only for you I am afraid I retorted a little nettled that I had not noticed the absence of your good wishes I wish to speak to you on another matter Lord Porthoning turned quickly and looked at me There was a change in his expression that puzzled me Well out with it he snapped I pointed to the door across the hall I want you to step this way I said firmly I expected an irritable outburst but to my surprise he turned and preceded me toward the door We entered the room and found mister Bundercombe there alone Lord Porthoning looked from one to the other of us His heavy gray eyebrows were drawn together his face was the embodiment of a snarl Now what in the name of all that s reasonable he began in his hard rasping voice made you bring me in here I don t want to better my acquaintance with that old man your father in law I d a good deal rather he d stayed in his own country I don t like the looks of him I hate fat men Don t keep me waiting here Paul If you want my advice I ll give it to you If you want anything else you won t get it mister Bundercombe had moved softly round until he was standing with his back to the door His manner was the one he had assumed so successfully in church dignified almost solemn Paul he said I asked you to invite this person in here because now that you are Eve s husband I felt that the interests of your family must be considered before my own inclinations In my country we treat all men alike and I am bound to say that if you d been married to Eve out in Okata and I d seen any old skunk whether he d been an earl or what he looks like a secondhand clothes dealer sneaking Eve s presents I d have had him in prison before you d reached the station mister Bundercombe I exclaimed horrified it seemed to me that my father in law was carrying this affair too far Lord Porthoning from whom I had expected a torrent of fierce abuse stood looking at us both with an expression no written words could portray His cheeks were ashen His hands which were crossed upon the knob of his cane were shaking mister Bundercombe extended his right hand Sir he concluded sternly for the sake of the conventions of the country in which I find myself and bearing in mind your connection with my son in law I have kept the police out of this interview Be so good as to hand over to Paul the emerald brooch you have secreted in your coat pocket The pall of silence seemed suddenly removed Lord Porthoning leaned forward Then he began to talk Any sympathy I might have felt for him any feeling I may have had that my father in law s retributive scheme was of too drastic a nature vanished before he had finished the first three sentences mister Bundercombe upon whom he heaped abuse of the most virulent character remained unmoved When at last Lord Porthoning paused for breath I turned toward my father in law What does this mean I asked It means mister Bundercombe explained that this gentleman who finds my daughter s presents so inadequate was actually leaving your house with an emerald brooch belonging to Eve in the righthand pocket of his coat Lord Porthoning was once more incoherent This time however I stopped him I was already heartily sick of the affair but at this stage I could not back out Lord Porthoning I said there is no necessity for such vigorous denials The matter is easily arranged You had better permit me to examine the pocket in question I ll see you and your common bully of a father in law in hell before I allow either of you to touch me or my clothing my pleasant connection declared fiercely Get out of my way both of you And be thankful if you don t have to answer for this outrage in a police court He swaggered toward the door mister Bundercombe who had appeared to stand on one side suddenly caught him by the shoulders Feel in his right hand pocket Paul he bade me I did so and promptly produced the brooch Lord Porthoning s eyes seemed almost to start from his head I could see that he suddenly became limp in mister Bundercombe s grasp His eyes were fixed on the jewels and his amazement was undeniable mister Bundercombe winked at me over his head What is the meaning of this Lord Porthoning I demanded as sternly as I could My courage was failing me I felt that the joke after all had been a severe one Lord Porthoning seemed almost on the point of collapse His eyes never once left the brooch which I was holding I didn t take it he gasped I swear I didn t take it I was anxious now to finish the affair Lord Porthoning I said I will take your word You say you never took the brooch Very well we will assume for the sake of the family that it found its way into your pocket by accident Lord Porthoning felt his forehead There were big drops of sweat standing out there There was something in his extreme agitation that was in a way incomprehensible He edged toward the door I didn t take it he muttered Let me go Let me get away mister Bundercombe stood on one side My hand was on the handle of the door I looked at my father in law questioningly My sympathies were now almost with the enemy but I felt bound to see the affair through It was you who discovered this little accident I remarked I think you will agree with me that it is best to say nothing more about it mister Bundercombe once more winked at me solemnly over the head of my stricken connection I quite agree with you Paul he said Under the circumstances we will let nothing happen to disturb the festivities and harmony of the day Lord Porthoning certainly will not object if we just satisfy ourselves that the brooch was the only instance of momentary aberration shall we call it If Lord Porthoning s attitude had been a little mysterious before it was absolutely incomprehensible now He stood suddenly upright and brandished his cane over his head If either of you touch me he shouted fiercely I ll break your skulls This is blackmail I ll send for the police Let me go His sudden fit of anger justifiable though it certainly seemed on the face of it nevertheless took both mister Bundercombe and myself by surprise The former indeed was in the act of opening the door when he paused Once more he caught my connection by the collar and thrust his hand into the other coat pocket When he withdrew it it was filled with rings a bracelet and a pendant He threw them silently a glittering heap on the table Without a word he thrust his hand in once more and brought out a little black ivory carving of a Japanese monk which was perhaps one of the most valuable of my offerings There was a blankness in mister Bundercombe s expression that I could not understand I frowned It seemed to me the affair had now gone much too far Lord Porthoning had staggered to a chair and was sitting there with his face buried in his hands He was a stricken man I turned to my father in law This is too much of a good thing sir I whispered angrily The brooch was all right enough so far as it went and he deserved a lesson but these other things A look in mister Bundercombe s face suddenly froze the words upon my lips He leaned over toward me Paul he declared earnestly on my honor I put nothing into his pocket except the brooch I knew no more of those things he added pointing to the table than you did I was speechless Lord Porthoning looked up I had never seen a face quite like his in my life One side of it seemed drawn with pain He checked a sob His fingers gripped at the air as he spoke Paul he begged hysterically don t give me away I give you my word of honor I give you my word as a Porthoning I can t help it You know what they call the damned thing when women have it kleptomania isn t it I tell you I can t see these things without that same horrible fascinating cruel instinct My hands are on them before I know it But he broke off It s sending me mad Paul for as I live I never put hands on that brooch How long has this been going on I asked almost mechanically Perhaps you are the reason that it has become the fashion to send detectives to guard wedding presents I am the reason Lord Porthoning confessed his voice shaking Paul somehow I believe I believe this has stopped it You ll kill the instinct Listen You are off directly Let this gentleman your father in law come round to my house I will restore to him I swear every article I have ever taken in this fashion He can find out the owners by degrees and I promise that I will never again attend a wedding reception so long as I live Outside I could hear them calling for me I glanced at the clock It was within a few minutes of the time fixed for our departure mister Bundercombe nodded to me Very well I agreed It shall be as you say I ll wait here Lord Porthoning said in a trembling tone mister Bundercombe can come back for me after he has seen you off He can go home with me in the motor Take take care of those things mister Bundercombe covered them over with an antimacassar We left Lord Porthoning sitting there and went out into the hall where Eve was already waiting mister Bundercombe was a little unnerved but he pulled himself together Word of honor Paul he declared I never saw the old rat take a thing I simply landed him with the brooch It was not until he was going out that I caught a glimpse of those other things in his pocket We drove off ten minutes later I looked out of the motor as we swung round into the main thoroughfare Behind the window of the little sitting room I saw the pale almost ghastly face of Lord Porthoning He caught my eye and waved his hand weakly On the pavement in front of the striped awning stood mister Bundercombe large beaming both hands outstretched Eve waved her handkerchief As we finally disappeared she glanced toward me Has dad been up to anything Paul she asked He has just that kind of satisfied expression that always used to terrify me Like a cat licking its whiskers after a stolen saucer of milk I suggested She laughed You mustn t make fun of dad she begged He s such a dear I shall never attempt to make fun of your father I assured her fervently I think he is quite the most remarkable man I ever met And now End of Project Gutenberg s An Amiable Charlatan by E Phillips
