eighteen ninety nine TO THE RIGHT honorable THE COUNTESS OF GIFFORD AS A TOKEN OF RESPECT SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION This Tale IS INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR A PRELIMINARY WORD The writer of this Tale ventures in his own person to address a very few words chiefly of explanation to his readers A leading situation in this Story of Bartram Haugh is repeated with a slight variation from a short magazine tale of some fifteen pages written by him and published long ago in a periodical under the title of A Passage in the Secret History of an Irish Countess and afterwards still anonymously in a small volume under an altered title It is very unlikely that any of his readers should have encountered and still more so that they should remember this trifle The bare possibility however he has ventured to anticipate by this brief explanation lest he should be charged with plagiarism always a disrespect to a reader May he be permitted a few words also of remonstrance against the promiscuous application of the term sensation to that large school of fiction which transgresses no one of those canons of construction and morality which in producing the unapproachable Waverley Novels their great author imposed upon himself No one it is assumed would describe Sir Walter Scott s romances as sensation novels yet in that marvellous series there is not a single tale in which death crime and in some form mystery have not a place Passing by those grand romances of Ivanhoe Old Mortality and Kenilworth with their terrible intricacies of crime and bloodshed constructed with so fine a mastery of the art of exciting suspense and horror let the reader pick out those two exceptional novels in the series which profess to paint contemporary manners and the scenes of common life and remembering in the Antiquary the vision in the tapestried chamber the duel the horrible secret and the death of old Elspeth the drowned fisherman and above all the tremendous situation of the tide bound party under the cliffs and in saint Ronan s Well the long drawn mystery the suspicion of insanity and the catastrophe of suicide determine whether an epithet which it would be a profanation to apply to the structure of any even the most exciting of Sir Walter Scott s stories is fairly applicable to tales which though illimitably inferior in execution yet observe the same limitations of incident and the same moral aims The author trusts that the Press to whose masterly criticism and generous encouragement he and other humble labourers in the art owe so much will insist upon the limitation of that degrading term to the peculiar type of fiction which it was originally intended to indicate and prevent as they may its being made to include the legitimate school of tragic English romance which has been ennobled and in great measure founded by the genius of Sir Walter Scott CONTENTS CHAPTER I AUSTIN RUTHYN OF KNOWL AND HIS DAUGHTER II UNCLE SILAS III A NEW FACE IV MADAME DE LA ROUGIERRE V SIGHTS

Haugh CHAPTER I AUSTIN RUTHYN OF KNOWL AND HIS DAUGHTER It was winter that is about the second week in November and great gusts were rattling at the windows and wailing and thundering among our tall trees and ivied chimneys a very dark night and a very cheerful fire blazing a pleasant mixture of good round coal and spluttering dry wood in a genuine old fireplace in a sombre old room Black wainscoting glimmered up to the ceiling in small ebony panels a cheerful clump of wax candles on the tea table many old portraits some grim and pale others pretty and some very graceful and charming hanging from the walls Few pictures except portraits long and short were there On the whole I think you would have taken the room for our parlour It was not like our modern notion of a drawing room It was a long room too and every way capacious but irregularly shaped A girl of a little more than seventeen looking I believe younger still slight and rather tall with a great deal of golden hair dark grey eyed and with a countenance rather sensitive and melancholy was sitting at the tea table in a reverie I was that girl The only other person in the room the only person in the house related to me was my father He was mister Ruthyn of Knowl so called in his county but he had many other places was of a very ancient lineage who had refused a baronetage often and it was said even a viscounty being of a proud and defiant spirit and thinking themselves higher in station and purer of blood than two thirds of the nobility into whose ranks it was said they had been invited to enter Of all this family lore I knew but little and vaguely only what is to be gathered from the fireside talk of old retainers in the nursery I am sure my father loved me and I know I loved him With the sure instinct of childhood I apprehended his tenderness although it was never expressed in common ways But my father was an oddity He had been early disappointed in Parliament where it was his ambition to succeed Though a clever man he failed there where very inferior men did extremely well Then he went abroad and became a connoisseur and a collector took a part on his return in literary and scientific institutions and also in the foundation and direction of some charities But he tired of this mimic government and gave himself up to a country life not that of a sportsman but rather of a student staying sometimes at one of his places and sometimes at another and living a secluded life Rather late in life he married and his beautiful young wife died leaving me their only child to his care This bereavement I have been told changed him made him more odd and taciturn than ever and his temper also except to me more severe There was also some disgrace about his younger brother my uncle Silas which he felt bitterly He was now walking up and down this spacious old room which extending round an angle at the far end was very dark in that quarter It was his wont to walk up and down thus without speaking an exercise which used to remind me of Chateaubriand s father in the great chamber of the Chateau de Combourg At the far end he nearly disappeared in the gloom and then returning emerged for a few minutes like a portrait with a background of shadow and then again in silence faded nearly out of view This monotony and silence would have been terrifying to a person less accustomed to it than I As it was it had its effect I have known my father a whole day without once speaking to me Though I loved him very much I was also much in awe of him While my father paced the floor my thoughts were employed about the events of a month before So few things happened at Knowl out of the accustomed routine that a very trifling occurrence was enough to set people wondering and conjecturing in that serene household My father lived in remarkable seclusion except for a ride he hardly ever left the grounds of Knowl and I don t think it happened twice in the year that a visitor sojourned among us There was not even that mild religious bustle which sometimes besets the wealthy and moral recluse My father had left the Church of England for some odd sect I forget its name and ultimately became I was told a Swedenborgian But he did not care to trouble me upon the subject So the old carriage brought my governess when I had one the old housekeeper missus Rusk and myself to the parish church every Sunday And my father in the view of the honest rector who shook his head over him a cloud without water carried about of winds and a wandering star to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness corresponded with the minister of his church and was provokingly contented with his own fertility and illumination and missus Rusk who was a sound and bitter churchwoman said he fancied he saw visions and talked with angels like the rest of that rubbitch I don t know that she had any better foundation than analogy and conjecture for charging my father with supernatural pretensions and in all points when her orthodoxy was not concerned she loved her master and was a loyal housekeeper I found her one morning superintending preparations for the reception of a visitor in the hunting room it was called from the pieces of tapestry that covered its walls representing scenes a la Wouvermans of falconry and the chase dogs hawks ladies gallants and pages In the midst of whom missus Rusk in black silk was rummaging drawers counting linen and issuing orders Who is coming missus Rusk Well she only knew his name It was a mister Bryerly My papa expected him to dinner and to stay for some days I guess he s one of those creatures dear for I mentioned his name just to doctor Clay the rector and he says there is a Doctor Bryerly a great conjurer among the Swedenborg sect and that s him I do suppose In my hazy notions of these sectaries there was mingled a suspicion of necromancy and a weird freemasonry that inspired something of awe and antipathy mister Bryerly arrived time enough to dress at his leisure before dinner He entered the drawing room a tall lean man all in ungainly black with a white choker with either a black wig or black hair dressed in imitation of one a pair of spectacles and a dark sharp short visage rubbing his large hands together and with a short brisk nod to me whom he plainly regarded merely as a child he sat down before the fire crossed his legs and took up a magazine This treatment was mortifying and I remember very well the resentment of which he was quite unconscious His stay was not very long not one of us divined the object of his visit and he did not prepossess us favourably He seemed restless as men of busy habits do in country houses and took walks and a drive and read in the library and wrote half a dozen letters His bed room and dressing room were at the side of the gallery directly opposite to my father s which had a sort of ante room en suite in which were some of his theological books The day after mister Bryerly s arrival I was about to see whether my father s water caraffe and glass had been duly laid on the table in this ante room and in doubt whether he was there I knocked at the door I suppose they were too intent on other matters to hear but receiving no answer I entered the room My father was sitting in his chair with his coat and waistcoat off mister Bryerly kneeling on a stool beside him rather facing him his black scratch wig leaning close to my father s grizzled hair There was a large tome of their divinity lore I suppose open on the table close by The lank black figure of mister Bryerly stood up and he concealed something quickly in the breast of his coat My father stood up also looking paler I think than I ever saw him till then and he pointed grimly to the door and said Go mister Bryerly pushed me gently back with his hands to my shoulders and smiled down from his dark features with an expression quite unintelligible to me I had recovered myself in a second and withdrew without a word The last thing I saw at the door was the tall slim figure in black and the dark significant smile following me and then the door was shut and locked and the two Swedenborgians were left to their mysteries I remember so well the kind of shock and disgust I felt in the certainty that I had surprised them at some perhaps debasing incantation a suspicion of this mister Bryerly of the ill fitting black coat and white choker and a sort of fear came upon me and I fancied he was asserting some kind of mastery over my father which very much alarmed me I fancied all sorts of dangers in the enigmatical smile of the lank high priest The image of my father as I had seen him it might be confessing to this man in black who was I knew not what haunted me with the disagreeable uncertainties of a mind very uninstructed as to the limits of the marvellous I mentioned it to no one But I was immensely relieved when the sinister visitor took his departure the morning after and it was upon this occurrence that my mind was now employed Some one said that doctor Johnson resembled a ghost who must be spoken to before it will speak But my father in whatever else he may have resembled a ghost did not in that particular for no one but I in his household and I very seldom dared to address him until first addressed by him I had no notion how singular this was until I began to go out a little among friends and relations and found no such rule in force anywhere else As I leaned back in my chair thinking this phantasm of my father came and turned and vanished with a solemn regularity It was a peculiar figure strongly made thick set with a face large and very stern he wore a loose black velvet coat and waistcoat It was however the figure of an elderly rather than an old man though he was then past seventy but firm and with no sign of feebleness I remember the start with which not suspecting that he was close by me I lifted my eyes and saw that large rugged countenance looking fixedly on me from less than a yard away After I saw him he continued to regard me for a second or two and then taking one of the heavy candlesticks in his gnarled hand he beckoned me to follow him which in silence and wondering I accordingly did He led me across the hall where there were lights burning and into a lobby by the foot of the back stairs and so into his library It is a long narrow room with two tall slim windows at the far end now draped in dark curtains Dusky it was with but one candle and he paused near the door at the left hand side of which stood in those days an old fashioned press or cabinet of carved oak In front of this he stopped He had odd absent ways and talked more to himself I believe than to all the rest of the world put together She won t understand he whispered looking at me enquiringly No she won t Will she Then there was a pause during which he brought forth from his breast pocket a small bunch of some half dozen keys on one of which he looked frowningly every now and then balancing it a little before his eyes between his finger and thumb as he deliberated I knew him too well of course to interpose a word They are easily frightened ay they are I d better do it another way And pausing he looked in my face as he might upon a picture They are yes I had better do it another way another way yes and she ll not suspect she ll not suppose Then he looked steadfastly upon the key and from it to me suddenly lifting it up and said abruptly See child and after a second or two Remember this key It was oddly shaped and unlike others Yes sir I always called him sir It opens that and he tapped it sharply on the door of the cabinet In the daytime it is always here at which word he dropped it into his pocket again You see and at night under my pillow you hear me Yes sir You won t forget this cabinet oak next the door on your left you won t forget No sir Pity she s a girl and so young ay a girl and so young no sense giddy You say you ll remember Yes sir It behoves you He turned round and looked full upon me like a man who has taken a sudden resolution and I think for a moment he had made up his mind to tell me a great deal more But if so he changed it again and after another pause he said slowly and sternly You will tell nobody what I have said under pain of my displeasure Oh no sir Good child Except he resumed under one contingency that is in case I should be absent and doctor Bryerly you recollect the thin gentleman in spectacles and a black wig who spent three days here last month should come and enquire for the key you understand in my absence Yes sir So he kissed me on the forehead and said Let us return Which accordingly we did in silence the storm outside like a dirge on a great organ accompanying our flitting CHAPTER II UNCLE SILAS When we reached the drawing room I resumed my chair and my father his slow and regular walk to and fro in the great room Perhaps it was the uproar of the wind that disturbed the ordinary tenor of his thoughts but whatever was the cause certainly he was unusually talkative that night After an interval of nearly half an hour he drew near again and sat down in a high backed arm chair beside the fire and nearly opposite to me and looked at me steadfastly for some time as was his wont before speaking and said he This won t do you must have a governess In cases of this kind I merely set down my book or work as it might be and adjusted myself to listen without speaking Your French is pretty well and your Italian but you have no German Your music may be pretty good I m no judge but your drawing might be better yes yes I believe there are accomplished ladies finishing governesses they call them who undertake more than any one teacher would have professed in my time and do very well She can prepare you and next winter then you shall visit France and Italy where you may be accomplished as highly as you please Thank you sir You shall It is nearly six months since Miss Ellerton left you too long without a teacher Then followed an interval doctor Bryerly will ask you about that key and what it opens you show all that to him and no one else But I said for I had a great terror of disobeying him in ever so minute a matter you will then be absent sir how am I to find the key He smiled on me suddenly a bright but wintry smile it seldom came and was very transitory and kindly though mysterious True child I m glad you are so wise that you will find I have provided for and you shall know exactly where to look You have remarked how solitarily I live You fancy perhaps I have not got a friend and you are nearly right nearly but not altogether I have a very sure friend one a friend whom I once misunderstood but now appreciate I wondered silently whether it could be Uncle Silas He ll make me a call some day soon I m not quite sure when I won t tell you his name you ll hear that soon enough and I don t want it talked of and I must make a little journey with him You ll not be afraid of being left alone for a time And have you promised sir I answered with another question my curiosity and anxiety overcoming my awe He took my questioning very good humouredly Well promise no child but I m under condition he s not to be denied I must make the excursion with him the moment he calls I have no choice but on the whole I rather like it remember I say I rather like it And he smiled again with the same meaning that was at once stern and sad The exact purport of these sentences remained fixed in my mind so that even at this distance of time I am quite sure of them A person quite unacquainted with my father s habitually abrupt and odd way of talking would have fancied that he was possibly a little disordered in his mind But no such suspicion for a moment troubled me I was quite sure that he spoke of a real person who was coming and that his journey was something momentous and when the visitor of whom he spoke did come and he departed with him upon that mysterious excursion I perfectly understood his language and his reasons for saying so much and yet so little You are not to suppose that all my hours were passed in the sort of conference and isolation of which I have just given you a specimen and singular and even awful as were sometimes my tete a tetes with my father I had grown so accustomed to his strange ways and had so unbounded a confidence in his affection that they never depressed or agitated me in the manner you might have supposed I had a great deal of quite a different sort of chat with good old missus Rusk and very pleasant talks with Mary Quince my somewhat ancient maid and besides all this I had now and then a visit of a week or so at the house of some one of our country neighbours and occasionally a visitor but this I must own very rarely at Knowl There had come now a little pause in my father s revelations and my fancy wandered away upon a flight of discovery Who I again thought could this intending visitor be who was to come armed with the prerogative to make my stay at home father forthwith leave his household goods his books and his child to whom he clung and set forth on an unknown knight errantry Who but Uncle Silas I thought that mysterious relative whom I had never seen who was it had in old times been very darkly hinted to me unspeakably unfortunate or unspeakably vicious whom I had seldom heard my father mention and then in a hurried way and with a pained thoughtful look Once only he had said anything from which I could gather my father s opinion of him and then it was so slight and enigmatical that I might have filled in the character very nearly as I pleased It happened thus One day missus Rusk was in the oak room I being then about fourteen She was removing a stain from a tapestry chair and I watched the process with a childish interest She sat down to rest herself she had been stooping over her work and threw her head back for her neck was weary and in this position she fixed her eyes on a portrait that hung before her It was a full length and represented a singularly handsome young man dark slender elegant in a costume then quite obsolete though I believe it was seen at the beginning of this century white leather pantaloons and top boots a buff waistcoat and a chocolate coloured coat and the hair long and brushed back There was a remarkable elegance and a delicacy in the features but also a character of resolution and ability that quite took the portrait out of the category of mere fops or fine men When people looked at it for the first time I have so often heard the exclamation What a wonderfully handsome man and then What a clever face An Italian greyhound stood by him and some slender columns and a rich drapery in the background But though the accessories were of the luxurious sort and the beauty as I have said refined there was a masculine force in that slender oval face and a fire in the large shadowy eyes which were very peculiar and quite redeemed it from the suspicion of effeminacy Is not that Uncle Silas said I Yes dear answered missus Rusk looking with her resolute little face quietly on the portrait He must be a very handsome man missus Rusk Don t you think so I continued He was my dear yes but it is forty years since that was painted the date is there in the corner in the shadow that comes from his foot and forty years I can tell you makes a change in most of us and missus Rusk laughed in cynical good humour There was a little pause both still looking on the handsome man in top boots and I said And why missus Rusk is papa always so sad about Uncle Silas What s that child said my father s voice very near I looked round with a start and flushed and faltered receding a step from him No harm dear You have said nothing wrong he said gently observing my alarm You said I was always sad I think about Uncle Silas Well I don t know how you gather that but if I were I will now tell you it would not be unnatural Your uncle is a man of great talents great faults and great wrongs His talents have not availed him his faults are long ago repented of and his wrongs I believe he feels less than I do but they are deep Did she say any more madam he demanded abruptly of missus Rusk Nothing sir with a stiff little courtesy answered missus Rusk who stood in awe of him And there is no need child he continued addressing himself to me that you should think more of him at present Clear your head of Uncle Silas One day perhaps you will know him yes very well and understand how villains have injured him Then my father retired and at the door he said missus Rusk a word if you please beckoning to that lady who trotted after him to the library I think he then laid some injunction upon the housekeeper which was transmitted by her to Mary Quince for from that time forth I could never lead either to talk with me about Uncle Silas They let me talk on but were reserved and silent themselves and seemed embarrassed and missus Rusk sometimes pettish and angry when I pressed for information Thus curiosity was piqued and round the slender portrait in the leather pantaloons and top boots gathered many coloured circles of mystery and the handsome features seemed to smile down upon my baffled curiosity with a provoking significance Why is it that this form of ambition curiosity which entered into the temptation of our first parent is so specially hard to resist Knowledge is power and power of one sort or another is the secret lust of human souls and here is beside the sense of exploration the undefinable interest of a story and above all something forbidden to stimulate the contumacious appetite

none	none	 A NEW FACE 
2136_5140_000003_000000	train-clean-100	I think it was about a fortnight after that conversation in which my father had expressed his opinion and given me the mysterious charge about the old oak cabinet in his library as already detailed that I was one night sitting at the great drawing room window lost in the melancholy reveries of night and in admiration of the moonlighted scene 
none	none	I was the only occupant of the room and the lights near the fire at its farther end hardly reached to the window at which I sat The shorn grass sloped gently downward from the windows till it met the broad level on which stood in clumps or solitarily scattered some of the noblest timber in England Hoar in the moonbeams stood those graceful trees casting their moveless shadows upon the grass and in the background crowning the undulations of the distance in masses were piled those woods among which lay the solitary tomb where the remains of my beloved mother rested 
2136_5140_000005_000000	train-clean-100	The air was still 
2136_5140_000005_000001	train-clean-100	The silvery vapour hung serenely on the far horizon and the frosty stars blinked brightly 
none	none	Everyone knows the effect of such a scene on a mind already saddened 
2136_5140_000005_000003	train-clean-100	Fancies and regrets float mistily in the dream and the scene affects us with a strange mixture of memory and anticipation like some sweet old air heard in the distance 
2136_5140_000005_000004	train-clean-100	As my eyes rested on those to me funereal but glorious woods which formed the background of the picture my thoughts recurred to my father s mysterious intimations and the image of the approaching visitor and the thought of the unknown journey saddened me 
none	none	In all that concerned his religion from very early association there was to me something of the unearthly and spectral 
2136_5140_000007_000000	train-clean-100	When my dear mamma died I was not nine years old and I remember two days before the funeral there came to Knowl where she died a thin little man with large black eyes and a very grave dark face 
2136_5140_000008_000000	train-clean-100	He was shut up a good deal with my dear father who was in deep affliction and missus Rusk used to say It is rather odd to see him praying with that little scarecrow from London and good mister Clay ready at call in the village much good that little black whipper snapper will do him 
none	none	With that little black man on the day after the funeral I was sent out for some reason for a walk my governess was ill I know and there was confusion in the house and I dare say the maids made as much of a holiday as they could 
2136_5140_000010_000000	train-clean-100	I remember feeling a sort of awe of this little dark man but I was not afraid of him for he was gentle though sad and seemed kind 
2136_5140_000010_000001	train-clean-100	He led me into the garden the Dutch garden we used to call it with a balustrade and statues at the farther front laid out in a carpet pattern of brilliantly coloured flowers 
none	none	We came down the broad flight of Caen stone steps into this and we walked in silence to the balustrade The base was too high at the spot where we reached it for me to see over but holding my hand he said Look through that my child Well you can t but I can see beyond it shall I tell you what 
2136_5140_000010_000005	train-clean-100	I see ever so much 
none	none	I see a cottage with a steep roof that looks like gold in the sunlight there are tall trees throwing soft shadows round it and flowering shrubs I can t say what only the colours are beautiful growing by the walls and windows and two little children are playing among the stems of the trees and we are on our way there and in a few minutes shall be under those trees ourselves and talking to those little children Yet now to me it is but a picture in my brain and to you but a story told by me which you believe 
2136_5140_000010_000008	train-clean-100	Come dear let us be going 
none	none	So we descended the steps at the right and side by side walked along the grass lane between tall trim walls of evergreens 
2136_5140_000011_000001	train-clean-100	The way was in deep shadow for the sun was near the horizon but suddenly we turned to the left and there we stood in rich sunlight among the many objects he had described 
none	none	Is this your house my little men he asked of the children pretty little rosy boys who assented and he leaned with his open hand against the stem of one of the trees and with a grave smile he nodded down to me saying You see now and hear and feel for yourself that both the vision and the story were quite true but come on my dear we have further to go And relapsing into silence we had a long ramble through the wood the same on which I was now looking in the distance Every now and then he made me sit down to rest and he in a musing solemn sort of way would relate some little story reflecting even to my childish mind a strange suspicion of a spiritual meaning but different from what honest missus Rusk used to expound to me from the Parables and somehow startling in its very vagueness 
2136_5140_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Thus entertained though a little awfully I accompanied the dark mysterious little whipper snapper through the woodland glades 
none	none	We came to me quite unexpectedly in the deep sylvan shadows upon the grey pillared temple four fronted with a slanting pedestal of lichen stained steps the lonely sepulchre in which I had the morning before seen poor mamma laid 
2136_5140_000015_000002	train-clean-100	At the sight the fountains of my grief reopened and I cried bitterly repeating Oh mamma mamma little mamma and so went on weeping and calling wildly on the deaf and the silent 
2136_5140_000015_000003	train-clean-100	There was a stone bench some ten steps away from the tomb 
2136_5140_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Sit down beside me my child said the grave man with the black eyes very kindly and gently 
2136_5140_000016_000001	train-clean-100	 Now what do you see there he asked pointing horizontally with his stick towards the centre of the opposite structure 
none	none	Oh that that place where poor mamma is
2136_5140_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes a stone wall with pillars too high for either you or me to see over But 
none	none	Here he mentioned a name which I think must have been Swedenborg from what I afterwards learnt of his tenets and revelations I only know that it sounded to me like the name of a magician in a fairy tale I fancied he lived in the wood which surrounded us and I began to grow frightened as he proceeded But Swedenborg sees beyond it over and through it and has told me all that concerns us to know 
2136_5140_000020_000001	train-clean-100	He says your mamma is not there 
2136_5140_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 She is taken away I cried starting up and with streaming eyes gazing on the building which though I stamped my feet in my distraction I was afraid to approach 
none	none	Oh is mamma taken away 
2136_5140_000021_000002	train-clean-100	Where is she 
2136_5140_000021_000003	train-clean-100	Where have they brought her to 
none	none	I was uttering unconsciously very nearly the question with which Mary in the grey of that wondrous morning on which she stood by the empty sepulchre accosted the figure standing near Your mamma is alive but too far away to see or hear us Swedenborg standing here can see and hear her and tells me all he sees just as I told you in the garden about the little boys and the cottage and the trees and flowers which you could not see You believed in when I told you 
2136_5140_000023_000003	train-clean-100	So I can tell you now as I did then and as we are both I hope walking on to the same place just as we did to the trees and cottage 
none	none	You will surely see with your own eyes how true the description is which I give you I was very frightened for I feared that when he had done his narrative we were to walk on through the wood into that place of wonders and of shadows where the dead were visible 
2136_5140_000025_000000	train-clean-100	He leaned his elbow on his knee and his forehead on his hand which shaded his downcast eyes 
2136_5140_000025_000001	train-clean-100	In that attitude he described to me a beautiful landscape radiant with a wondrous light in which rejoicing my mother moved along an airy path ascending among mountains of fantastic height and peaks melting in celestial colouring into the air and peopled with human beings translated into the same image beauty and splendour 
none	none	And when he had ended his relation he rose took my hand and smiling gently down on my pale wondering face he said the same words he had spoken before
2136_5140_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 Come dear let us go 
none	none	Oh no no no not now I said resisting and very much frightened
2136_5140_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Home I mean dear 
2136_5140_000028_000001	train-clean-100	We cannot walk to the place I have described 
2136_5140_000028_000002	train-clean-100	We can only reach it through the gate of death to which we are all tending young and old with sure steps 
2136_5140_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 And where is the gate of death I asked in a sort of whisper as we walked together holding his hand and looking stealthily 
2136_5140_000029_000001	train-clean-100	He smiled sadly and said 
none	none	When sooner or later the time comes as Hagar s eyes were opened in the wilderness and she beheld the fountain of water so shall each of us see the door open before us and enter in and be refreshed For a long time following this walk I was very nervous more so for the awful manner in which missus Rusk received my statement with stern lips and upturned hands and eyes and an angry expostulation I do wonder at you Mary Quince letting the child walk into the wood with that limb of darkness It is a mercy he did not show her the devil or frighten her out of her senses in that lonely place 
2136_5140_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Of these Swedenborgians indeed I know no more than I might learn from good missus Rusk s very inaccurate talk 
2136_5140_000032_000001	train-clean-100	Two or three of them crossed in the course of my early life like magic lantern figures the disk of my very circumscribed observation 
2136_5140_000032_000002	train-clean-100	All outside was and is darkness 
none	none	I once tried to read one of their books upon the future state heaven and hell but I grew after a day or two so nervous that I laid it aside 
2136_5140_000032_000004	train-clean-100	It is enough for me to know that their founder either saw or fancied he saw amazing visions which so far from superseding confirmed and interpreted the language of the Bible and as dear papa accepted their ideas I am happy in thinking that they did not conflict with the supreme authority of holy writ 
none	none	Leaning on my hand I was now looking upon that solemn wood white and shadowy in the moonlight where for a long time after that ramble with the visionary I fancied the gate of death hidden only by a strange glamour and the dazzling land of ghosts were situate and I suppose these earlier associations gave to my reverie about my father s coming visitor a wilder and a sadder tinge CHAPTER IV MADAME DE LA ROUGIERRE On a sudden on the grass before me stood an odd figure a very tall woman in grey draperies nearly white under the moon courtesying extraordinarily low and rather fantastically I stared in something like a horror upon the large and rather hollow features which I did not know smiling very unpleasantly on me and the moment it was plain that I saw her the grey woman began gobbling and cackling shrilly I could not distinctly hear what through the window and gesticulating oddly with her long hands and arms As she drew near the window I flew to the fireplace and rang the bell frantically and seeing her still there and fearing that she might break into the room I flew out of the door very much frightened and met Branston the butler in the lobby There s a woman at the window I gasped turn her away please If I had said a man I suppose fat Branston would have summoned and sent forward a detachment of footmen As it was he bowed gravely with a Yes m shall m And with an air of authority approached the window I don t think that he was pleasantly impressed himself by the first sight of our visitor for he stopped short some steps of the window and demanded rather sternly What ye doin there woman To this summons her answer which occupied a little time was inaudible to me But Branston replied I wasn t aware ma am I heerd nothin if you ll go round that way you ll see the hall door steps and I ll speak to the master and do as he shall order The figure said something and pointed Yes that s it and ye can t miss the door And mister Branston returned slowly down the long room and halted with out turned pumps and a grave inclination before me and the faintest amount of interrogation in the announcement Please m she says she s the governess The governess What governess Branston was too well bred to smile and he said thoughtfully P raps m I d best ask the master To which 
2136_5143_000020_000000	train-clean-100	I assented 
none	none	and away strode the flat pumps of the butler to the library I stood breathless in the hall Every girl at my age knows how much is involved in such an advent I also heard missus Rusk in a minute or two more emerge I suppose from the study She walked quickly and muttered sharply to herself an evil trick in which she indulged when much put about I should have been glad of a word with her but I fancied she was vexed and would not have talked satisfactorily She did not however come my way merely crossing the hall with her quick energetic step Was it really the arrival of a governess Was that apparition which had impressed me so unpleasantly to take the command of me to sit alone with me and haunt me perpetually with her sinister looks and shrilly gabble I was just making up my mind to go to Mary Quince and learn something definite when I heard my father s step approaching from the library so I quietly re entered the drawingroom but with an anxious and throbbing heart When he came in as usual he patted me on the head gently with a kind of smile and then began his silent walk up and down the room I was yearning to question him on the point that just then engrossed me so disagreeably but the awe in which I stood of him forbade After a time he stopped at the window the curtain of which I had drawn and the shutter partly opened and he looked out perhaps with associations of his own on the scene I had been contemplating It was not for nearly an hour after that my father suddenly after his wont in a few words apprised me of the arrival of Madame de la Rougierre to be my governess highly recommended and perfectly qualified My heart sank with a sure presage of ill I already disliked distrusted and feared her I had more than an apprehension of her temper and fear of possibly abused authority The large featured smirking phantom saluting me so oddly in the moonlight retained ever after its peculiar and unpleasant hold upon my nerves Well Miss Maud dear I hope you ll like your new governess for it s more than I do just at present at least said missus Rusk sharply she was awaiting me in my room I hate them French women they re not natural I think I gave her her supper in my room She eats like a wolf she does the great raw boned hannimal I wish you saw her in bed as I did I put her next the clock room she ll hear the hours betimes I m thinking You never saw such a sight The great long nose and hollow cheeks of her and oogh such a mouth I felt a most like little Red Riding Hood I did Miss Here honest Mary Quince who enjoyed missus Rusk s satire a weapon in which she was not herself strong laughed outright Turn down the bed Mary She s very agreeable she is just now all new comers is but she did not get many compliments from me Miss no I rayther think not I wonder why honest English girls won t answer the gentry for governesses instead of them gaping scheming wicked furriners Lord forgi me I think they re all alike Next morning I made acquaintance with Madame de la Rougierre She was tall masculine a little ghastly perhaps and draped in purple silk with a lace cap and great bands of black hair too thick and black perhaps to correspond quite naturally with her bleached and sallow skin her hollow jaws and the fine but grim wrinkles traced about her brows and eyelids She smiled she nodded and then for a good while she scanned me in silence with a steady cunning eye and a stern smile And how is she named what is Mademoiselle s name said the tall stranger Maud Madame Maud what pretty name Eh bien I am very sure my dear Maud she will be very good little girl is not so and I am sure I shall love you vary moche And what av you been learning Maud my dear cheaile music French German eh Yes a little and I had just begun the use of the globes when my governess went away I nodded towards the globes which stood near her as I said this Oh yes the globes and she spun one of them with her great hand Je vous expliquerai tout cela a fond Madame de la Rougierre I found was always quite ready to explain everything a fond but somehow her explications as she termed them were not very intelligible and when pressed her temper woke up so that I preferred after a while accepting the expositions just as they came Madame was on an unusually large scale a circumstance which made some of her traits more startling and altogether rendered her in her strange way more awful in the eyes of a nervous child I may say such as I was She used to look at me for a long time sometimes with the peculiar smile I have mentioned and a great finger upon her lip like the Eleusinian priestess on the vase She would sit too sometimes for an hour together looking into the fire or out of the window plainly seeing nothing and with an odd fixed look of something like triumph very nearly a smile on her cunning face She was by no means a pleasant gouvernante for a nervous girl of my years Sometimes she had accesses of a sort of hilarity which frightened me still more than her graver moods and I will describe these by and by CHAPTER V SIGHTS AND NOISES There is not an old house in England of which the servants and young people who live in it do not cherish some traditions of the ghostly Knowl has its shadows noises and marvellous records Rachel Ruthyn the beauty of Queen Anne s time who died of grief for the handsome Colonel Norbrooke who was killed in the Low Countries walks the house by night in crisp and sounding silks She is not seen only heard The tapping of her high heeled shoes the sweep and rustle of her brocades her sighs as she pauses in the galleries near the bed room doors and sometimes on stormy nights her sobs There is beside the link man a lank dark faced black haired man in a sable suit with a link or torch in his hand It usually only smoulders with a deep red glow as he visits his beat The library is one of the rooms he sees to Unlike Lady Rachel as the maids called her he is seen only never heard His steps fall noiseless as shadows on floor and carpet The lurid glow of his smouldering torch imperfectly lights his figure and face and except when much perturbed his link never blazes On those occasions however as he goes his rounds he ever and anon whirls it around his head and it bursts into a dismal flame This is a fearful omen and always portends some direful crisis or calamity It occurs only once or twice in a century I don t know whether Madame had heard anything of these phenomena but she did report which very much frightened me and Mary Quince She asked us who walked in the gallery on which her bed room opened making a rustling with her dress and going down the stairs and breathing long breaths here and there Twice she said she had stood at her door in the dark listening to these sounds and once she called to know who it was There was no answer but the person plainly turned back and hurried towards her with an unnatural speed which made her jump within her door and shut it When first such tales are told they excite the nerves of the young and the ignorant intensely But the special effect I have found soon wears out The tale simply takes it s place with the rest It was with Madame s narrative About a week after its relation I had my experience of a similar sort Mary Quince went down stairs for a night light leaving me in bed a candle burning in the room and being tired I fell asleep before her return When I awoke the candle had been extinguished But I heard a step softly approaching I jumped up quite forgetting the ghost and thinking only of Mary Quince and opened the door expecting to see the light of her candle Instead all was dark and near me I heard the fall of a bare foot on the oak floor It was as if some one had stumbled I said Mary but no answer came only a rustling of clothes and a breathing at the other side of the gallery which passed off towards the upper staircase I turned into my room freezing with horror and clapt my door The noise wakened Mary Quince who had returned and gone to her bed half an hour before About a fortnight after this Mary Quince a very veracious spinster reported to me that having got up to fix the window which was rattling at about four o clock in the morning she saw a light shining from the library window She could swear to its being a strong light streaming through the chinks of the shutter and moving No doubt the link was waved about his head by the angry link man These strange occurrences helped I think just then to make me nervous and prepared the way for the odd sort of ascendency which through my sense of the mysterious and super natural that repulsive Frenchwoman was gradually and it seemed without effort establishing over me Some dark points of her character speedily emerged from the prismatic mist with which she had enveloped it missus Rusk s observation about the agreeability of new comers I found to be true for as Madame began to lose that character her good humour abated very perceptibly and she began to show gleams of another sort of temper that was lurid and dangerous Notwithstanding this she was in the habit of always having her Bible open by her and was austerely attentive at morning and evening services and asked my father with great humility to lend her some translations of Swedenborg s books which she laid much to heart When we went out for our walk if the weather were bad we generally made our promenade up and down the broad terrace in front of the windows Sullen and malign at times she used to look and as suddenly she would pat me on the shoulder caressingly and smile with a grotesque benignity asking tenderly Are you fatigue ma chere or Are you cold a dear Maud At first these abrupt transitions puzzled me sometimes half frightened me savouring I fancied of insanity The key however was accidentally supplied and I found that these accesses of demonstrative affection were sure to supervene whenever my father s face was visible through the library windows I did not know well what to make of this woman whom I feared with a vein of superstitious dread I hated being alone with her after dusk in the school room She would sometimes sit for half an hour at a time with her wide mouth drawn down at the corners and a scowl looking into the fire If she saw me looking at her she would change all this on the instant affect a sort of languor and lean her head upon her hand and ultimately have recourse to her Bible But I fancied she did not read but pursued her own dark ruminations for I observed that the open book might often lie for half an hour or more under her eyes and yet the leaf never turned I should have been glad to be assured that she prayed when on her knees or read when that book was before her I should have felt that she was more canny and human As it was those external pieties made a suspicion of a hollow contrast with realities that helped to scare me yet it was but a suspicion I could not be certain Our rector and the curate with whom she was very gracious and anxious about my collects and catechism had an exalted opinion of her In public places her affection for me was always demonstrative In like manner she contrived conferences with my father She was always making excuses to consult him about my reading and to confide in him her sufferings as I learned from my contumacy and temper The fact is I was altogether quiet and submissive But I think she had a wish to reduce me to a state of the most abject bondage She had designs of domination and subversion regarding the entire household I now believe worthy of the evil spirit I sometimes fancied her My father beckoned me into the study one day and said he You ought not to give poor Madame so much pain She is one of the few persons who take an interest in you why should she have so often to complain of your ill temper and disobedience why should she be compelled to ask my permission to punish you Don t be afraid I won t concede that But in so kind a person it argues much Affection I can t command respect and obedience I may and I insist on your rendering both to Madame But sir I said roused into courage by the gross injustice of the charge I have always done exactly as she bid me and never said one disrespectful word to Madame I don t think child you are the best judge of that Go and amend And with a displeased look he pointed to the door My heart swelled with the sense of wrong and as I reached the door I turned to say another word but I could not and only burst into tears There don t cry little Maud only let us do better for the future There there there has been enough And he kissed my forehead and gently put me out and closed the door In the school room I took courage and with some warmth upbraided Madame Wat wicked cheaile moaned Madame demurely Read aloud those three yes those three chapters of the Bible my dear Maud There was no special fitness in those particular chapters and when they were ended she said in a sad tone Now dear you must commit to memory this pretty priaire for umility of art It was a long one and in a state of profound irritation I got through the task missus Rusk hated her She said she stole wine and brandy whenever the opportunity offered that she was always asking her for such stimulants and pretending pains in her stomach Here perhaps there was exaggeration but I knew it was true that I had been at different times despatched on that errand and pretext for brandy to missus Rusk who at last came to her bedside with pills and a mustard blister only and was hated irrevocably ever after I felt all this was done to torture me But a day is a long time to a child and they forgive quickly It was always with a sense of danger that I heard Madame say she must go and see Monsieur Ruthyn in the library and I think a jealousy of her growing influence was an ingredient in the detestation in which honest missus Rusk held her CHAPTER VI A WALK IN THE WOOD 
2136_5143_000002_000000	train-clean-100	Two little pieces of by play in which I detected her confirmed my unpleasant suspicion 
none	none	From the corner of the gallery I one day saw her when she thought I was out and all quiet with her ear at the keyhole of papa s study as we used to call the sitting room next his bed room 
2136_5143_000002_000002	train-clean-100	Her eyes were turned in the direction of the stairs from which only she apprehended surprise 
none	none	Her great mouth was open and her eyes absolutely goggled with eagerness 
2136_5143_000002_000004	train-clean-100	She was devouring all that was passing there I drew back into the shadow with a kind of disgust and horror 
2136_5143_000002_000005	train-clean-100	She was transformed into a great gaping reptile 
2136_5143_000002_000006	train-clean-100	I felt that I could have thrown something at her but a kind of fear made me recede again toward my room Indignation however quickly returned and I came back treading briskly as I did so 
none	none	When I reached the angle of the gallery again 
2136_5143_000002_000008	train-clean-100	Madame I suppose had heard me for she was half way down the stairs 
none	none	Ah my dear Cheaile I am so glad to find you and you are dress to come out 
2136_5143_000003_000001	train-clean-100	We shall have so pleasant walk 
2136_5143_000004_000000	train-clean-100	At that moment the door of my father s study opened and missus Rusk with her dark energetic face very much flushed stepped out in high excitement 
none	none	The Master says you may have the brandy bottle Madame and I m glad to be rid of it I am 
2136_5143_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Madame courtesied with a great smirk that was full of intangible hate and insult 
2136_5143_000007_000000	train-clean-100	 Better your own brandy if drink you must exclaimed missus Rusk 
2136_5143_000007_000001	train-clean-100	 You may come to the store room now or the butler can take it 
2136_5143_000008_000000	train-clean-100	And off whisked missus Rusk for the back staircase 
2136_5143_000009_000000	train-clean-100	There had been no common skirmish on this occasion but a pitched battle 
2136_5143_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Madame had made a sort of pet of Anne Wixted an underchambermaid and attached her to her interest economically by persuading me to make her presents of some old dresses and other things 
none	none	Anne was such an angel But missus Rusk whose eyes were about her detected Anne with a brandy bottle under her apron stealing up stairs Anne in a panic declared the truth Madame had commissioned her to buy it in the town and convey it to her bed room 
2136_5143_000011_000003	train-clean-100	Upon this missus Rusk impounded the flask and with Anne beside her rather precipitately appeared before the Master He heard and summoned Madame 
2136_5143_000011_000004	train-clean-100	Madame was cool frank and fluent 
2136_5143_000011_000005	train-clean-100	The brandy was purely medicinal 
2136_5143_000011_000006	train-clean-100	She produced a document in the form of a note 
2136_5143_000011_000007	train-clean-100	Doctor Somebody presented his compliments to Madame de la Rougierre and ordered her a table spoonful of brandy and some drops of laudanum whenever the pain of stomach returned 
none	none	The flask would last a whole year perhaps two She claimed her medicine Man s estimate of woman is higher than woman s own 
2136_5143_000012_000001	train-clean-100	Perhaps in their relations to men they are generally more trustworthy perhaps woman s is the juster and the other an appointed illusion 
none	none	I don t know but so it is ordained missus Rusk was recalled and I saw as you are aware Madame s procedure during the interview It was a great battle a great victory 
2136_5143_000014_000001	train-clean-100	Madame was in high spirits 
2136_5143_000014_000002	train-clean-100	The air was sweet the landscape charming I so good everything so beautiful Where should we go 
none	none	this way 
2136_5143_000015_000000	train-clean-100	I had made a resolution to speak as little as possible to Madame I was so incensed at the treachery I had witnessed but such resolutions do not last long with very young people and by the time we had reached the skirts of the wood we were talking pretty much as usual 
none	none	I don t wish to go into the wood Madame
2136_5143_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 And for what 
2136_5143_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Poor mamma is buried there 
none	none	Is there the vault demanded Madame eagerly I assented
2136_5143_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 My faith curious reason you say because poor mamma is buried there you will not approach 
none	none	Why cheaile what would good Monsieur Ruthyn say if he heard such thing You are surely not so unkain and I am with you Allons 
2136_5143_000021_000003	train-clean-100	Let us come even a little part of the way 
2136_5143_000022_000000	train-clean-100	And so I yielded though still reluctant 
2136_5143_000023_000000	train-clean-100	There was a grass grown road which we easily reached leading to the sombre building and we soon arrived before it 
none	none	Madame de la Rougierre seemed rather curious 
2136_5143_000024_000001	train-clean-100	She sat down on the little bank opposite in her most languid pose her head leaned upon the tips of her fingers 
none	none	How very sad how solemn murmured Madame What noble tomb How triste my dear cheaile your visit ere must it be remembering a so sweet maman There is new inscription is it not new And so indeed it seemed
2136_5143_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 I am fatigue maybe you will read it aloud to me slowly and solemnly my dearest Maud 
none	none	As I approached I happened to look I can t tell why suddenly over my shoulder I was startled for Madame was grimacing after me with a vile derisive distortion She pretended to be seized with a fit of coughing 
2136_5143_000027_000002	train-clean-100	But it would not do she saw that I had detected her and she laughed aloud 
none	none	Come here dear cheaile I was just reflecting how foolish is all this thing the tomb the epitaph I think I would av none no no epitaph 
2136_5143_000028_000003	train-clean-100	We regard them first for the oracle of the dead and find them after only the folly of the living 
2136_5143_000028_000004	train-clean-100	So I despise 
none	none	Do you think your house of Knowl down there is what you call haunt my dear
2136_5143_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Why said I flushing and growing pale again 
2136_5143_000029_000001	train-clean-100	I felt quite afraid of Madame and confounded at the suddenness of all this 
none	none	Because Anne Wixted she says there is ghost 
2136_5143_000030_000001	train-clean-100	How dark is this place 
none	none	and so many of the Ruthyn family they are buried here is not so 
2136_5143_000030_000003	train-clean-100	How high and thick are the trees all round and nobody comes near 
2136_5143_000031_000000	train-clean-100	And Madame rolled her eyes awfully as if she expected to see something unearthly and indeed looked very like it herself 
2136_5143_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 Come away Madame I said growing frightened and feeling that if I were once by any accident to give way to the panic that was gathering round me I should instantaneously lose all control of myself 
none	none	Oh come away do Madame I m frightened
2136_5143_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 No on the contrary sit here by me 
none	none	It is very odd you will think ma chere un gout bizarre vraiment but I love very much to be near to the dead people in solitary place like this 
2136_5143_000033_000002	train-clean-100	I am not afraid of the dead people nor of the ghosts 
none	none	Av you ever see a ghost my dear Do Madame pray speak of something else Wat little fool 
2136_5143_000035_000001	train-clean-100	But no you are not afraid 
none	none	I av seen the ghosts myself I saw one for example last night shape like a monkey sitting in the corner with his arms round his knees very wicked old old man his face was like and white eyes so large
2136_5143_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Come away Madame you are trying to frighten me I said in the childish anger which accompanies fear 
2136_5143_000036_000001	train-clean-100	Madame laughed an ugly laugh and said 
none	none	Eh bien little fool I will not tell the rest if you are really frightened let us change to something else Yes yes oh 
2136_5143_000043_000002	train-clean-100	do pray 
none	none	do Wat good man is your father
2136_5143_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Very the kindest darling 
none	none	I don t know why it is Madame I am so afraid of him and never could tell him how much I love him 
2136_5143_000041_000000	train-clean-100	This confidential talking with Madame strange to say implied no confidence it resulted from fear it was deprecatory 
2136_5143_000041_000001	train-clean-100	I treated her as if she had human sympathies in the hope that they might be generated somehow 
none	none	Was there not a doctor from London with him a few months ago doctor Bryerly I think they call him
2136_5143_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes a Doctor Bryerly who remained a few days 
none	none	Shall we begin to walk towards home Madame Do pray Immediately cheaile and does your father suffer much
2136_5143_000045_000000	train-clean-100	 No I think not 
2136_5143_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 And what then is his disease 
none	none	Disease he has no disease Have you heard anything about his health Madame I said anxiously Oh no ma foi I have heard nothing but if the doctor came it was not because he was quite well
2136_5143_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 But that doctor is a doctor in theology I fancy 
none	none	I know he is a Swedenborgian and papa is so well he could not have come as a physician I am very glad ma chere to hear but still you know your father is old man to have so young cheaile as you 
2136_5143_000050_000001	train-clean-100	Oh yes he is old man and so uncertain life is

2136_5143_000069_000000	train-clean-100	This did not last very long however and she soon resumed her wonted ways And she returned to the question of the will but not so directly and with more art

none	none	CHAPTER VII CHURCH SCARSDALE I think all the females of our household except missus Rusk who was at open feud with her and had only room for the fiercer emotions were more or less afraid of this inauspicious foreigner missus Rusk would say in her confidences in my room Where does she come from is she a French or a Swiss one or is she a Canada woman I remember one of them when I was a girl and a nice limb she was too And who did she live with Where was her last family Not one of us knows nothing about her no more than a child except of course the Master I do suppose he made enquiry She s always at hugger mugger with Anne Wixted I ll pack that one about her business if she doesn t mind Tattling and whispering eternally It s not about her own business she s a talking Madame de la Rougepot I call her She does know how to paint up to the ninety nines she does the old cat I beg your pardon Miss but that she is a devil and no mistake I found her out first by her thieving the Master s gin that the doctor ordered him and filling the decanter up with water the old villain but she ll be found out yet she will and all the maids is afraid on her She s not right they think a witch or a ghost I should not wonder Catherine Jones found her in her bed asleep in the morning after she sulked with you you know Miss with all her clothes on what ever was the meaning and I think she has frightened you Miss and has you as nervous as anythink I do and so forth It was true I was nervous and growing rather more so and I think this cynical woman perceived and intended it and was pleased I was always afraid of her concealing herself in my room and emerging at night to scare me She began sometimes to mingle in my dreams too always awfully and this nourished of course the kind of ambiguous fear in which in waking hours I held her I dreamed one night that she led me all the time whispering something so very fast that I could not understand her into the library holding a candle in her other hand above her head We walked on tiptoe like criminals at the dead of night and stopped before that old oak cabinet which my father had indicated in so odd a way to me I felt that we were about some contraband practice There was a key in the door which I experienced a guilty horror at turning she whispering in the same unintelligible way all the time at my ear I did turn it the door opened quite softly and within stood my father his face white and malignant and glaring close in mine He cried in a terrible voice Death Out went Madame s candle and at the same moment with a scream I waked in the dark still fancying myself in the library and for an hour after I continued in a hysterical state Every little incident about Madame furnished a topic of eager discussion among the maids More or less covertly they nearly all hated and feared her They fancied that she was making good her footing with the Master and that she would then oust missus Rusk perhaps usurp her place and so make a clean sweep of them all I fancy the honest little housekeeper did not discourage that suspicion About this time I recollect a pedlar an odd gipsified looking man called in at Knowl I and Catherine Jones were in the court when he came and set down his pack on the low balustrade beside the door All sorts of commodities he had ribbons cottons silks stockings lace and even some bad jewellry and just as he began his display an interesting matter in a quiet country house Madame came upon the ground He grinned a recognition and hoped Madamasel was well and did not look to see her here Madamasel thanked him Yes vary well and looked for the first time decidedly put out Wat a pretty things she said Catherine run and tell missus Rusk She wants scissars and lace too I heard her say So Catherine with a lingering look departed and Madame said Will you dear cheaile be so kind to bring here my purse I forgot on the table in my room also I advise you bring your Catherine returned with missus Rusk Here was a man who could tell them something of the old Frenchwoman at last Slyly they dawdled over his wares until Madame had made her market and departed with me But when the coveted opportunity came the pedlar was quite impenetrable He forgot everything he did not believe as he ever saw the lady before He called a Frenchwoman all the world over Madamasel that wor the name on em all He never seed her in partiklar afore as he could bring to mind He liked to see em always cause they makes the young uns buy This reserve and oblivion were very provoking and neither missus Rusk nor Catherine Jones spent sixpence with him he was a stupid fellow or worse Of course Madame had tampered with him But truth like murder will out some day Tom Williams the groom had seen her when alone with him and pretending to look at his stock with her face almost buried in his silks and Welsh linseys talking as fast as she could all the time and slipping money he did suppose under a piece of stuff in his box In the mean time I and Madame were walking over the wide peaty sheep walks that lie between Knowl and Church Scarsdale Since our visit to the mausoleum in the wood she had not worried me so much as before She had been indeed more than usually thoughtful very little talkative and troubled me hardly at all about French and other accomplishments A walk was a part of our daily routine I now carried a tiny basket in my hand with a few sandwiches which were to furnish our luncheon when we reached the pretty scene about two miles away whither we were tending We had started a little too late Madame grew unwontedly fatigued and sat down to rest on a stile before we had got half way and there she intoned with a dismal nasal cadence a quaint old Bretagne ballad about a lady with a pig s head This lady was neither pig nor maid And so she was not of human mould Not of the living nor the dead Her left hand and foot were warm to touch Her right as cold as a corpse s flesh And she would sing like a funeral bell with a ding dong tune The pigs were afraid and viewed her aloof And women feared her and stood afar She could do without sleep for a year and a day She could sleep like a corpse for a month and more No one knew how this lady fed On acorns or on flesh Some say that she s one of the swine possessed That swam over the sea of Gennesaret A mongrel body and demon soul Some say she s the wife of the Wandering Jew And broke the law for the sake of pork And a swinish face for a token doth bear That her shame is now and her punishment coming And so it went on in a gingling rigmarole The more anxious I seemed to go on our way the more likely was she to loiter I therefore showed no signs of impatience and I saw her consult her watch in the course of her ugly minstrelsy and slyly glance as if expecting something in the direction of our destination When she had sung to her heart s content up rose Madame and began to walk onward silently I saw her glance once or twice as before toward the village of Trillsworth which lay in front a little to our left and the smoke of which hung in a film over the brow of the hill I think she observed me for she enquired Wat is that a smoke there That is Trillsworth Madame there is a railway station there Oh le chemin de fer so near I did not think Where it goes I told her and silence returned Church Scarsdale is a very pretty and odd scene The slightly undulating sheep walk dips suddenly into a wide glen in the lap of which by a bright winding rill rise from the sward the ruins of a small abbey with a few solemn trees scattered round The crows nests hung untenanted in the trees the birds were foraging far away from their roosts The very cattle had forsaken the place It was solitude itself Madame drew a long breath and smiled Come down come down cheaile come down to the churchyard As we descended the slope which shut out the surrounding world and the scene grew more sad and lonely Madame s spirits seemed to rise See ow many grave stones one two hundred Don t you love the dead cheaile I will teach you to love them You shall see me die here to day for half an hour and be among them That is what I love We were by this time at the little brook s side and the low churchyard wall with a stile reached by a couple of stepping stones across the stream immediately at the other side Come now cried Madame raising her face as if to sniff the air we are close to them You will like them soon as I You shall see five of them Ah ca ira ca ira ca ira Come cross quickily I am Madame la Morgue missus Deadhouse I will present you my friends Monsieur Cadavre and Monsieur Squelette Come come leetle mortal let us play Ouaah And she uttered a horrid yell from her enormous mouth and pushing her wig and bonnet back so as to show her great bald head She was laughing and really looked quite mad No Madame I will not go with you I said disengaging my hand with a violent effort receding two or three steps Not enter the churchyard Ma foi wat mauvais gout But see we are already in shade The sun he is setting soon where well you remain cheaile I will not stay long I ll stay here I said a little angrily for I was angry as well as nervous and through my fear was that indignation at her extravagances which mimicked lunacy so unpleasantly and were I knew designed to frighten me Over the stepping stones pulling up her dress she skipped with her long lank legs like a witch joining a Walpurgis Over the stile she strode and I saw her head wagging and heard her sing some of her ill omened rhymes as she capered solemnly with many a grin and courtesy among the graves and headstones towards the ruin CHAPTER VIII THE SMOKER Three years later I learned in a way she probably little expected and then did not much care about what really occurred there I learned even phrases and looks for the story was related by one who had heard it told and therefore I venture to narrate what at the moment I neither saw nor suspected While I sat flushed and nervous upon a flat stone by the bank of the little stream Madame looked over her shoulder and perceiving that I was out of sight she abated her pace and turned sharply towards the ruin which lay at her left It was her first visit and she was merely exploring but now with a perfectly shrewd and businesslike air turning the corner of the building she saw seated upon the edge of a grave stone a rather fat and flashily equipped young man with large light whiskers a jerry hat green cutaway coat with gilt buttons and waistcoat and trousers rather striking than elegant in pattern He was smoking a short pipe and made a nod to Madame without either removing it from his lips or rising but with his brown and rather good looking face turned up he eyed her with something of the impudent and sulky expression that was habitual to it Ha Deedle you are there an look so well I am here too quite a lon but my friend she wait outside the churchyard by side the leetle river for she must not think I know you so I am come a lon You re a quarter late and I lost a fight by you old girl this morning said the gay man and spat on the ground and I wish you would not call me Diddle I ll call you Granny if you do Eh bien Dud then She is vary nice wat you like Slim waist wite teeth vary nice eyes dark wat you say is best and nice leetle foot and ankle Madame smiled leeringly Dud smoked on Go on said Dud with a nod of command I am teach her to sing and play she has such sweet voice There was another interval here Well that isn t much good I hate women s screechin about fairies and flowers Hang her there s a scarecrow as sings at Curl s Divan Such a caterwauling upon a stage I d like to put my two barrels into her By this time Dud s pipe was out and he could afford to converse You shall see her and decide You will walk down the river and pass her by That s as may be howsoever it would not do nohow to buy a pig in a poke you know And s pose I shouldn t like her arter all Madame sneered with a patois ejaculation of derision Vary good Then some one else will not be so ard to please as you will soon find Some one s bin a lookin arter her you mean said the young man with a shrewd uneasy glance on the cunning face of the French lady I mean precisely that which I mean replied the lady with a teazing pause at the break I have marked Come old un none of your d old chaff if you want me to stay here listening to you Speak out can t you There s any chap as has bin a lookin arter her is there Eh bien I suppose some Well you suppose and I suppose we may all suppose I guess but that does not make a thing be as wasn t before and you tell me as how the lass is kep private up there and will be till you re done educating her a precious good un that is And he laughed a little lazily with the ivory handle of his cane on his lip and eyeing Madame with indolent derision Madame laughed but looked rather dangerous I m only chaffin you know old girl You ve bin chaffin w y shouldn t I But I don t see why she can t wait a bit and what s all the d d hurry for I m in no hurry I don t want a wife on my back for a while There s no fellow marries till he s took his bit o fun and seen life is there And why should I be driving with her to fairs or to church or to meeting by jingo for they say she s a Quaker with a babby on each knee only to please them as will be dead and rotten when I m only beginning Ah you are such charming fellow always the same always sensible So I and my friend we will walk home again and you go see Maggie Hawkes Good a by Dud good a by Quiet you fool can t ye said the young gentleman with the sort of grin that made his face vicious when a horse vexed him Who ever said I wouldn t go look at the girl Why you know that s just what I come here for don t you Only when I think a bit and a notion comes across me why shouldn t I speak out I m not one o them shilly shallies If I like the girl I ll not be mug in and mug out about it Only mind ye I ll judge for myself Is that her a coming No it was a distant sound Madame peeped round the corner No one was approaching Well you go round that a way and you only look at her you know for she is such fool so nairvous Oh is that the way with her said Dud knocking out the ashes of his pipe on a tombstone and replacing the Turkish utensil in his pocket Well then old lass good bye and he shook her hand And do ye see don t ye come up till I pass for I m no hand at play acting an if you called me sir or was coming it dignified and distant you know I d be sure to laugh a most and let all out So good bye d ye see and if you want me again be sharp to time mind From habit he looked about for his dogs but he had not brought one He had come unostentatiously by rail travelling in a third class carriage for the advantage of Jack Briderly s company and getting a world of useful wrinkles about the steeplechase that was coming off next week So he strode away cutting off the heads of the nettles with his cane as he went and Madame walked forth into the open space among the graves where I might have seen her had I stood up looking with the absorbed gaze of an artist on the ruin In a little while along the path I heard the clank of a step and the gentleman in the green cutaway coat sucking his cane and eyeing me with an offensive familiar sort of stare the while passed me by rather hesitating as he did so I was glad when he turned the corner in the little hollow close by and disappeared I stood up at once and was reassured by a sight of Madame not very many yards away looking at the ruin and apparently restored to her right mind The last beams of the sun were by this time touching the uplands and I was longing to recommence our walk home I was hesitating about calling to Madame because that lady had a certain spirit of opposition within her and to disclose a small wish of any sort was generally if it lay in her power to prevent its accomplishment At this moment the gentleman in the green coat returned approaching me with a slow sort of swagger I say Miss I dropped a glove close by here May you have seen it No sir I said drawing back a little and looking I dare say both frightened and offended I do think I must a dropped it close by your foot Miss No sir I repeated No offence Miss but you re sure you didn t hide it I was beginning to grow seriously uncomfortable Don t be frightened Miss it s only a bit o chaff I m not going to search I called aloud Madame Madame and he whistled through his fingers and shouted Madame Madame and added She s as deaf as a tombstone or she ll hear that Gi e her my compliments and say I said you re a beauty Miss and with a laugh and a leer he strode off Altogether this had not been a very pleasant excursion Madame gobbled up our sandwiches commending them every now and then to me But I had been too much excited to have any appetite left and very tired I was when we reached home So there is lady coming to morrow said Madame who knew everything Wat is her name I forget Lady Knollys I answered Lady Knollys wat odd name She is very young is she not Past fifty I think Helas She s vary old then Is she rich I don t know She has a place in Derbyshire Derbyshire that is one of your English counties is it not Oh yes Madame I answered laughing I have said it to you twice since you came and I gabbled through the chief towns and rivers as catalogued in my geography Bah to be sure of course cheaile And is she your relation Papa s first cousin Won t you present a me pray I would so like Madame had fallen into the English way of liking people with titles as perhaps foreigners would if titles implied the sort of power they do generally with us Certainly Madame You will not forget Oh no Madame reminded me twice in the course of the evening of my promise She was very eager on this point But it is a world of disappointment influenza and rheumatics and next morning Madame was prostrate in her bed and careless of all things but flannel and James s powder Madame was desolee but she could not raise her head She only murmured a question For ow long time dear will Lady Knollys remain A very few days I believe Helas ow onlucky maybe to morrow I shall be better Ouah my ear The laudanum dear cheaile And so our conversation for that time ended and Madame buried her head in her old red cashmere shawl CHAPTER IX MONICA KNOLLYS Punctually Lady Knollys arrived She was accompanied by her nephew Captain Oakley They arrived a little before dinner just in time to get to their rooms and dress But Mary Quince enlivened my toilet with eloquent descriptions of the youthful Captain whom she had met in the gallery on his way to his room with the servant and told me how he stopped to let her pass and how he smiled so ansom I was very young then you know and more childish even than my years but this talk of Mary Quince s interested me I must confess considerably I was painting all sort of portraits of this heroic soldier while affecting I am afraid a hypocritical indifference to her narration and I know I was very nervous and painstaking about my toilet that evening When I went down to the drawing room Lady Knollys was there talking volubly to my father as I entered a woman not really old but such as very young people fancy aged energetic bright saucy dressed handsomely in purple satin with a good deal of lace and a rich point I know not how to call it not a cap a sort of head dress light and simple but grand withal over her greyish silken hair Rather tall by no means stout on the whole a good firm figure with something kindly in her look She got up quite like a young person and coming quickly to meet me with a smile My young cousin she cried and kissed me on both cheeks You know who I am Your cousin Monica Monica Knollys and very glad dear to see you though she has not set eyes on you since you were no longer than that paper knife Now come here to the lamp for I must look at you Who is she like Let me see Like your poor mother I think my dear but you ve the Aylmer nose yes not a bad nose either and come I very good eyes upon my life yes certainly something of her poor mother not a bit like you Austin My father gave her a look as near a smile as I had seen there for a long time shrewd cynical but kindly too and said he So much the better Monica eh It was not for me to say but you know Austin you always were an ugly creature How shocked and indignant the little girl looks 
2136_5147_000052_000002	train-clean-100	You must not 
none	none	be vexed you loyal little woman with Cousin Monica for telling the truth Papa was and will be ugly all his days Come Austin dear tell her is not it so What depose against myself That s not English law Monica Well maybe not but if the child won t believe her own eyes how is she to believe me She has long pretty hands you have and very nice feet too How old is she How old child said my father to me transferring the question She recurred again to my eyes That is the true grey large deep soft very peculiar Yes dear very pretty long lashes and such bright tints You ll be in the Book of Beauty my dear when you come out and have all the poet people writing verses to the tip of your nose and a very pretty little nose it is I must mention here how striking was the change in my father s spirit while talking and listening to his odd and voluble old Cousin Monica Reflected from bygone associations there had come a glimmer of something not gaiety indeed but like an appreciation of gaiety The gloom and inflexibility were gone and there was an evident encouragement and enjoyment of the incessant sallies of his bustling visitor How morbid must have been the tendencies of his habitual solitude I think appeared from the evident thawing and brightening that accompanied even this transient gleam of human society I was not a companion more childish than most girls of my age and trained in all his whimsical ways never to interrupt a silence or force his thoughts by unexpected question or remark out of their monotonous or painful channel I was as much surprised at the good humour with which he submitted to his cousin s saucy talk and indeed just then those black panelled and pictured walls and that quaint misshapen room seemed to have exchanged their stern and awful character for something wonderfully pleasanter to me notwithstanding the unpleasantness of the personal criticism to which the plain spoken lady chose to subject me Just at that moment Captain Oakley joined us He was my first actual vision of that awful and distant world of fashion of whose splendours I had already read something in the three volumed gospel of the circulating library Handsome elegant with features almost feminine and soft wavy black hair whiskers and moustache he was altogether such a knight as I had never beheld or even fancied at Knowl a hero of another species and from the region of the demigods I did not then perceive that coldness of the eye and cruel curl of the voluptuous lip only a suspicion yet enough to indicate the profligate man and savouring of death unto death But I was young and had not yet the direful knowledge of good and evil that comes with years and he was so very handsome and talked in a way that was so new to me and was so much more charming than the well bred converse of the humdrum county families with whom I had occasionally sojourned for a week at a time It came out incidentally that his leave of absence was to expire the day after to morrow A Lilliputian pang of disappointment followed this announcement Already I was sorry to lose him So soon we begin to make a property of what pleases us I was shy but not awkward I was flattered by the attention of this amusing perhaps rather fascinating young man of the world and he plainly addressed himself with diligence to amuse and please me I dare say there was more effort than I fancied in bringing his talk down to my humble level and interesting me and making me laugh about people whom I had never heard of before than I then suspected Cousin Knollys meanwhile was talking to papa It was just the conversation that suited a man so silent as habit had made him for her frolic fluency left him little to supply It was totally impossible indeed even in our taciturn household that conversation should ever flag while she was among us Cousin Knollys and I went into the drawing room together leaving the gentlemen rather ill assorted I fear to entertain one another for a time Come here my dear and sit near me said Lady Knollys dropping into an easy chair with an energetic little plump and tell me how you and your papa get on I can remember him quite a cheerful man once and rather amusing yes indeed and now you see what a bore he is all by shutting himself up and nursing his whims and fancies Are those your drawings dear Yes very bad I m afraid but there are a few better I think in the portfolio in the cabinet in the hall They are by no means bad my dear and you play of course Yes that is a little pretty well I hope I dare say I must hear you by and by And how does your papa amuse you You look bewildered dear Well I dare say amusement is not a frequent word in this house But you must not turn into a nun or worse into a puritan What is he A Fifth Monarchy man or something I forget tell me the name my dear Papa is a Swedenborgian I believe Yes yes I forgot the horrid name a Swedenborgian that is it I don t know exactly what they think but everyone knows they are a sort of pagans my dear He s not making one of you dear is he I go to church every Sunday Well that s a mercy Swedenborgian is such an ugly name and besides they are all likely to be damned my dear and that s a serious consideration I really wish poor Austin had hit on something else I d much rather have no religion and enjoy life while I m in it than choose one to worry me here and bedevil me hereafter But some people my dear have a taste for being miserable and provide like poor Austin for its gratification in the next world as well as here Ha ha ha how grave the little woman looks Don t you think me very wicked You know you do and very likely you are right Who makes your dresses my dear You are such a figure of fun missus Rusk I think ordered this dress I and Mary Quince planned it I thought it very nice We all like it very well There was something I dare say very whimsical about it probably very absurd judged at least by the canons of fashion and old Cousin Monica Knollys in whose eye the London fashions were always fresh was palpably struck by it as if it had been some enormity against anatomy for she certainly laughed very heartily indeed there were tears on her cheeks when she had done and I am sure my aspect of wonder and dignity as her hilarity proceeded helped to revive her merriment again and again as it was subsiding There you mustn t be vexed with old Cousin Monica she cried jumping up and giving me a little hug and bestowing a hearty kiss on my forehead and a jolly little slap on my cheek Always remember your cousin Monica is an outspoken wicked old fool who likes you and never be offended by her nonsense A council of three you all sat upon it missus Rusk you said and Mary Quince and your wise self the weird sisters and Austin stepped in as Macbeth and said What is t ye do you all made answer together A something or other without a name Now seriously my dear it is quite unpardonable in Austin your papa I mean to hand you over to be robed and bedizened according to the whimsies of these wild old women aren t they old If they know better it s positively fiendish I ll blow him up I will indeed my dear You know you re an heiress and ought not to appear like a jack pudding Papa intends sending me to London with Madame and Mary Quince and going with me himself if Doctor Bryerly says he may make the journey and then I am to have dresses and everything Well that is better And who is Doctor Bryerly is your papa ill Ill oh no he always seems just the same You don t think him ill looking ill I mean I asked eagerly and frightened No my dear he looks very well for his time of life but why is Doctor What s his name here Is he a physician or a divine or a horse doctor and why is his leave asked I I really don t understand Is he a what d ye call em a Swedenborgian I believe so Oh I see ha ha ha And so poor Austin must ask leave to go up to town Well go he shall whether his doctor likes it or not for it would not do to send you there in charge of your Frenchwoman my dear What s her name Madame de la Rougierre

2136_5147_000013_000002	train-clean-100	In fact curiosity has nothing on earth to do with it 
none	none	A governess may be a very useful or a very useless person but she may also be about the most pernicious inmate imaginable She may teach you a bad accent and worse manners and heaven knows what beside Send the housekeeper my dear to tell her that I am going to see her I had better go myself perhaps I said fearing a collision between missus Rusk and the bitter Frenchwoman
2136_5147_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 Very well dear 
none	none	And away I ran not sorry somehow to escape before Captain Oakley returned 
2136_5147_000017_000000	train-clean-100	As I went along the passage I was thinking whether my dress could be so very ridiculous as my old cousin thought it and trying in vain to recollect any evidence of a similar contemptuous estimate on the part of that beautiful and garrulous dandy 
2136_5147_000017_000001	train-clean-100	I could not quite the reverse indeed Still I was uncomfortable and feverish girls of my then age will easily conceive how miserable under similar circumstances such a misgiving would make them 
2136_5147_000018_000000	train-clean-100	It was a long way to Madame s room 
2136_5147_000018_000001	train-clean-100	I met missus Rusk bustling along the passage with a housemaid 
none	none	How is Madame I asked
2136_5147_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 Quite well I believe answered the housekeeper drily 
none	none	Nothing the matter that I know of 
2136_5147_000020_000002	train-clean-100	She eat enough for two to day 
none	none	I wish I could sit in my room doing nothing 
2136_5147_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Madame was sitting or rather reclining in a low arm chair when I entered the room close to the fire as was her wont her feet extended near to the bars and a little coffee equipage beside her 
2136_5147_000021_000001	train-clean-100	She stuffed a book hastily between her dress and the chair and received me in a state of langour which had it not been for missus Rusk s comfortable assurances would have frightened me 
2136_5147_000022_000000	train-clean-100	 I hope you are better Madame I said approaching 
none	none	Better than I deserve my dear cheaile sufficiently well The people are all so good trying me with every little thing like a bird here is cafe missus Rusk a poor woman I try to swallow a little to please her
2136_5147_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 And your cold is it better 
2136_5147_000025_000000	train-clean-100	She shook her head languidly her elbow resting on the chair and three finger tips supporting her forehead and then she made a little sigh looking down from the corners of her eyes in an interesting dejection 
none	none	Je sens des lassitudes in all the members but I am quaite appy and though I suffer I am console and oblige des bontes ma chere que vous avez tous pour moi and with these words she turned a languid glance of gratitude on me which dropped on the ground Lady Knollys wishes very much to see you only for a few minutes if you could admit her Vous savez les malades see never visitors she replied with a startled sort of tartness and a momentary energy Besides I cannot converse je sens de temps en temps des douleurs de tete of head and of the ear the right ear it is parfois agony absolutely and now it is here 
2136_5147_000029_000000	train-clean-100	And she winced and moaned with her eyes closed and her hand pressed to the organ affected 
none	none	Simple as I was I felt instinctively that Madame was shamming 
2136_5147_000030_000001	train-clean-100	She was over acting her transitions were too violent and beside she forgot that I knew how well she could speak English and must perceive that she was heightening the interest of her helplessness by that pretty tessellation of foreign idiom 
2136_5147_000030_000002	train-clean-100	I there fore said with a kind of courage which sometimes helped me suddenly 
none	none	Oh Madame don t you really think you might without much inconvenience see Lady Knollys for a very few minutes Cruel cheaile you know I have a pain of the ear which makes me orribly suffer at this moment and you demand me whether I will not converse with strangers I did not think you would be so unkain Maud but it is impossible you must see quite impossible I never you know refuse to take trouble when I am able never never 
2136_5147_000033_000000	train-clean-100	And Madame shed some tears which always came at call and with her hand pressed to her ear said very faintly 
none	none	Be so good to tell your friend how you see me and how I suffer and leave me Maud for I wish to lie down for a little since the pain will not allow me to remain longer So with a few words of comfort which could not well be refused but I dare say betraying my suspicion that more was made of her sufferings than need be I returned to the drawing room Captain Oakley has been here my dear and fancying I suppose that you had left us for the evening has gone to the billiard room I think said Lady Knollys as I entered 
2136_5147_000037_000000	train-clean-100	That then accounted for the rumble and smack of balls which I had heard as I passed the door 
none	none	I have been telling Maud how detestably she is got up
2136_5147_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 Very thoughtful of you Monica said my father 
2136_5147_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes and really Austin it is quite clear you ought to marry you want some one to take this girl out and look after her and who s to do it She s a dowdy don t you see 
none	none	Such a dust And it is really such a pity for she s a very pretty creature and a clever woman could make her quite charming My father took Cousin Monica s sallies with the most wonderful good humour She had always I fancy been a privileged person and my father whom we all feared received her jolly attacks as I fancy the grim Front de Boeufs of old accepted the humours and personalities of their jesters Am I to accept this as an overture said my father to his voluble cousin
2136_5147_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes you may but not for myself Austin I m not worthy 
2136_5147_000043_000001	train-clean-100	Do you remember little Kitty Weadon that I wanted you to marry eight and twenty years ago or more with a hundred and twenty thousand pounds 
none	none	Well you know she has got ever so much now and she is really a most amiable old thing and though you would not have her then she has had her second husband since I can tell you
2136_5147_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 I m glad I was not the first said my father 
none	none	Well they really say her wealth is absolutely immense 
2136_5147_000045_000001	train-clean-100	Her last husband the Russian merchant left her everything 
2136_5147_000045_000002	train-clean-100	She has not a human relation and she is in the best set 
2136_5147_000046_000000	train-clean-100	 You were always a match maker Monica said my father stopping and putting his hand kindly on hers 
2136_5147_000046_000001	train-clean-100	 But it won t do 
none	none	No no Monica we must take care of little Maud some other way I was relieved We women have all an instinctive dread of second marriages and think that no widower is quite above or below that danger and I remember whenever my father which indeed was but seldom made a visit to town or anywhere else it was a saying of missus Rusk I shan t wonder neither need you my dear if he brings home a young wife with him 
2136_5147_000049_000000	train-clean-100	So my father with a kind look at her and a very tender one on me went silently to the library as he often did about that hour 
none	none	I could not help resenting my Cousin Knollys officious recommendation of matrimony 
2136_5147_000050_000001	train-clean-100	Nothing I dreaded more than a step mother 
2136_5147_000050_000002	train-clean-100	Good missus Rusk and Mary Quince in their several ways used to enhance by occasional anecdotes and frequent reflections the terrors of such an intrusion 
2136_5147_000050_000003	train-clean-100	I suppose they did not wish a revolution and all its consequences at Knowl and thought it no harm to excite my vigilance 
2136_5147_000051_000000	train-clean-100	But it was impossible long to be vexed with Cousin Monica 
2136_5147_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 You know my dear your father is an oddity she said 
none	none	I don t mind him I never did You must not 
2136_5147_000052_000003	train-clean-100	Cracky my dear cracky decidedly cracky 
2136_5147_000053_000000	train-clean-100	And she tapped the corner of her forehead with a look so sly and comical that I think I should have laughed if the sentiment had not been so awfully irreverent 
none	none	Well dear how is our friend the milliner Madame is suffering so much from pain in her ear that she says it would be quite impossible to have the honour Honour fiddle I want to see what the woman s like Pain in her ear you say 
2136_5147_000056_000003	train-clean-100	Poor thing 
2136_5147_000056_000004	train-clean-100	Well dear I think I can cure that in five minutes 
none	none	I have it myself now and then Come to my room and we ll get the bottles 
2136_5147_000057_000000	train-clean-100	So she lighted her candle in the lobby and with a light and agile step she scaled the stairs I following and having found the remedies we approached Madame s room together 
2136_5147_000058_000000	train-clean-100	I think while we were still at the end of the gallery Madame heard and divined our approach for her door suddenly shut and there was a fumbling at the handle 
2136_5147_000058_000001	train-clean-100	But the bolt was out of order 
2136_5147_000059_000000	train-clean-100	Lady Knollys tapped at the door saying we ll come in please and see you 
none	none	I ve some remedies which I m sure will do you good 
2136_5147_000060_000000	train-clean-100	There was no answer so she opened the door and we both entered 
none	none	Madame had rolled herself in the blue coverlet and was lying on the bed with her face buried in the pillow and enveloped in the covering Perhaps she s asleep said Lady Knollys getting round to the side of the bed and stooping over her Madame lay still as a mouse 
2136_5147_000062_000001	train-clean-100	Cousin Monica set down her two little vials on the table and stooping again over the bed began very gently with her fingers to lift the coverlet that covered her face 
2136_5147_000062_000002	train-clean-100	Madame uttered a slumbering moan and turned more upon her face clasping the coverlet faster about her 
none	none	Madame it is Maud and Lady Knollys 
2136_5147_000063_000001	train-clean-100	We have come to relieve your ear Pray let me see it 
none	none	She can t be asleep she s holding the clothes so fast Do pray allow me to see it CHAPTER XI LADY KNOLLYS SEES THE FEATURES Perhaps if Madame had murmured It is quite well pray permit me to sleep she would have escaped an awkwardness But having adopted the role of the exhausted slumberer she could not consistently speak at the moment neither would it do by main force to hold the coverlet about her face and so her presence of mind forsook her Cousin Monica drew it back and hardly beheld the profile of the sufferer when her good humoured face was lined and shadowed with a dark curiosity and a surprise by no means pleasant She stood erect beside the bed with her mouth firmly shut and drawn down at the corners in a sort of recoil and perturbation looking down upon the patient So that s Madame de la Rougierre at length exclaimed Lady Knollys with a very stately disdain I think I never saw anyone look more shocked Madame sat up very flushed No wonder for she had been wrapped so close in the coverlet She did not look quite at Lady Knollys but straight before her rather downward and very luridly I was very much frightened and amazed and felt on the point of bursting into tears So Mademoiselle you have married it seems since I had last the honour of seeing you I did not recognise Mademoiselle under her new name Yes I am married Lady Knollys I thought everyone who knew me had heard of that Very respectably married for a person of my rank I shall not need long the life of a governess There is no harm I hope I hope not said Lady Knollys drily a little pale and still looking with a dark sort of wonder upon the flushed face and forehead of the governess who was looking downward straight before her very sulkily and disconcerted I suppose you have explained everything satisfactorily to mister Ruthyn in whose house I find you said Cousin Monica Yes certainly everything he requires in effect there is nothing to explain I am ready to answer to any question Let him demand me Very good Mademoiselle Madame if you please I forgot Madame yes I shall apprise him of everything Madame turned upon her a peaked and malign look smiling askance with a stealthy scorn For myself I have nothing to conceal I have always done my duty What fine scene about nothing absolutely what charming remedies for a sick person Ma foi how much oblige I am for these so amiable attentions So far as I can see Mademoiselle Madame I mean you don t stand very much in need of remedies Your ear and head don t seem to trouble you just now I fancy these pains may now be dismissed Lady Knollys was now speaking French Mi ladi has diverted my attention for a moment but that does not prevent that I suffer frightfully I am of course only poor governess and such people perhaps ought not to have pain at least to show when they suffer It is permitted us to die but not to be sick Come Maud my dear let us leave the invalid to her repose and to nature I don t think she needs my chloroform and opium at present Mi ladi is herself a physic which chases many things and powerfully affects the ear I would wish to sleep notwithstanding and can but gain that in silence if it pleases mi ladi Come my dear said Lady Knollys without again glancing at the scowling smiling swarthy face in the bed let us leave your instructress to her concforto The room smells all over of brandy my dear does she drink said Lady Knollys as she closed the door a little sharply I am sure I looked as much amazed as I felt at an imputation which then seemed to me so entirely incredible Good little simpleton said Cousin Monica smiling in my face and bestowing a little kiss on my cheek such a thing as a tipsy lady has never been dreamt of in your philosophy Well we live and learn Let us have our tea in my room the gentlemen I dare say have retired I assented of course and we had tea very cosily by her bedroom fire How long have you had that woman she asked suddenly after for her a very long rumination She came in the beginning of February nearly ten months ago is not it And who sent her I really don t know papa tells me so little he arranged it all himself I think Cousin Monica made a sound of acquiescence her lips closed and a nod frowning hard at the bars It is very odd she said how people can be such fools Here there came a little pause And what sort of person is she do you like her Very well that is pretty well You won t tell but she rather frightens me I m sure she does not intend it but somehow I am very much afraid of her She does not beat you said Cousin Monica with an incipient frenzy in her face that made me love her Oh no Nor ill use you in any way No Upon your honour and word Maud No upon my honour You know I won t tell her anything you say to me and I only want to know that I may put an end to it my poor little cousin Thank you Cousin Monica very much but really and truly she does not ill use me Nor threaten you child Well no no she does not threaten And how the plague does she frighten you child Well I really I m half ashamed to tell you you ll laugh at me and I don t know that she wishes to frighten me But there is something is not there ghosty you know about her Ghosty is there well I m sure I don t know but I suspect there s something devilish I mean she seems roguish does not she And I really think she has had neither cold nor pain but has just been shamming sickness to keep out of my way I perceived plainly enough that Cousin Monica s damnatory epithet referred to some retrospective knowledge which she was not going to disclose to me You knew Madame before I said Who is she She assures me she is Madame de la Rougierre and I suppose in French phrase she so calls herself answered Lady Knollys with a laugh but uncomfortably I thought Oh dear Cousin Monica do tell me is she is she very wicked I am so afraid of her How should I know dear Maud But I do remember her face and I don t very much like her and you may depend on it I will speak to your father in the morning about her and don t darling ask me any more about her for I really have not very much to tell that you would care to hear and the fact is I won t say any more about her there And Cousin Monica laughed and gave me a little slap on the cheek and then a kiss Well just tell me this Well I won t tell you this nor anything not a word curious little woman The fact is I have little to tell and I mean to speak to your father and he I am sure will do what is right so don t ask me any more and let us talk of something pleasanter There was something indescribably winning it seemed to me in Cousin Monica Old as she was she seemed to me so girlish compared with those slow unexceptionable young ladies whom I had met in my few visits at the county houses By this time my shyness was quite gone and I was on the most intimate terms with her You know a great deal about her Cousin Monica but you won t tell me Nothing I should like better if I were at liberty little rogue but you know after all I don t really say whether I do know anything about her or not or what sort of knowledge it is But tell me what you mean by ghosty and all about it So I recounted my experiences to which so far from laughing at me she listened with very special gravity Does she write and receive many letters I had seen her write letters and supposed though I could only recollect one or two that she received in proportion Are you Mary Quince asked my lady cousin Mary was arranging the window curtains and turned dropping a courtesy affirmatively toward her You wait on my little cousin Miss Ruthyn don t you Yes m said Mary in her genteelest way Does anyone sleep in her room Yes m I please my lady And no one else No m please my lady Not even the governess sometimes No please my lady Never you are quite sure my dear said Lady Knollys transferring the question to me Oh no never I answered Cousin Monica mused gravely I fancied even anxiously into the grate then stirred her tea and sipped it still looking into the same point of our cheery fire I like your face Mary Quince I m sure you are a good creature she said suddenly turning toward her with a pleasant countenance I m very glad you have got her dear I wonder whether Austin has gone to his bed yet I think not I am certain he is either in the library or in his private room papa often reads or prays alone at night and and he does not like to be interrupted No no of course not it will do very well in the morning Lady Knollys was thinking deeply as it seemed to me And so you are afraid of goblins my dear she said at last with a faded sort of smile turning toward me well if I were I know what I should do so soon as I and good Mary Quince here had got into my bed chamber for the night I should stir the fire into a good blaze and bolt the door do you see Mary Quince bolt the door and keep a candle lighted all night You ll be very attentive to her Mary Quince for I I don t think she is very strong and she must not grow nervous so get to bed early and don t leave her alone do you see and and remember to bolt the door Mary Quince and I shall be sending a little Christmas box to my cousin and I shan t forget you Good night And with a pleasant courtesy Mary fluttered out of the room CHAPTER XII A CURIOUS CONVERSATION We each had another cup of tea and were silent for awhile We must not talk of ghosts now You are a superstitious little woman you know and you shan t be frightened And now Cousin Monica grew silent again and looking briskly around the room like a lady in search of a subject her eye rested on a small oval portrait graceful brightly tinted in the French style representing a pretty little boy with rich golden hair large soft eyes delicate features and a shy peculiar expression It is odd I think I remember that pretty little sketch very long ago I think I was then myself a child but that is a much older style of dress and of wearing the hair too than I ever saw I am just forty nine now Oh dear yes that is a good while before I was born What a strange pretty little boy a mysterious little fellow Is he quite sincere I wonder What rich golden hair It is very clever a French artist I dare say and who is that little boy I never heard Some one a hundred years ago I dare say But there is a picture down stairs I am so anxious to ask you about Oh murmured Lady Knollys still gazing dreamily on the crayon It is the full length picture of Uncle Silas I want to ask you about him At mention of his name my cousin gave me a look so sudden and odd as to amount almost to a start Your uncle Silas dear It is very odd I was just thinking of him and she laughed a little Wondering whether that little boy could be he And up jumped active Cousin Monica with a candle in her hand upon a chair and scrutinised the border of the sketch for a name or a date Maybe on the back said she And so she unhung it and there true enough not on the back of the drawing but of the frame which was just as good in pen and ink round Italian letters hardly distinguishable now from the discoloured wood we traced Silas Aylmer Ruthyn AEtate viii fifteen May seventeen seventy nine It is very odd I should not have been told or remembered who it was I think if I had ever been told I should have remembered it I do recollect this picture though I am nearly certain What a singular child s face And my cousin leaned over it with a candle on each side and her hand shading her eyes as if seeking by aid of these fair and half formed lineaments to read an enigma The childish features defied her I suppose their secret was unfathomable for after a good while she raised her head still looking at the portrait and sighed A very singular face she said softly as a person might who was looking into a coffin Had not we better replace it So the pretty oval containing the fair golden hair and large eyes the pale unfathomable sphinx remounted to its nail and the funeste and beautiful child seemed to smile down oracularly on our conjectures So is the face in the large portrait very singular more I think than that handsomer too This is a sickly child I think but the full length is so manly though so slender and so handsome too I always think him a hero and a mystery and they won t tell me about him and I can only dream and wonder He has made more people than you dream and wonder my dear Maud I don t know what to make of him He is a sort of idol you know of your father s and yet I don t think he helps him much His abilities were singular so has been his misfortune for the rest my dear he is neither a hero nor a wonder So far as I know there are very few sublime men going about the world You really must tell me all you know about him Cousin Monica Now don t refuse But why should you care to hear There is really nothing pleasant to tell That is just the reason I wish it If it were at all pleasant it would be quite commonplace I like to hear of adventures dangers and misfortunes and above all I love a mystery You know papa will never tell me and I dare not ask him not that he is ever unkind but somehow I am afraid and neither missus Rusk nor Mary Quince will tell me anything although I suspect they know a good deal I don t see any good in telling you dear nor to say the truth any great harm either No now that s quite true no harm There can t be for I must know it all some day you know and better now and from you than perhaps from a stranger and in a less favourable way Upon my word it is a wise little woman and really that s not such bad sense after all So we poured out another cup of tea each and sipped it very comfortably by the fire while Lady Knollys talked on and her animated face helped the strange story It is not very much after all Your uncle Silas you know is living Oh yes in Derbyshire So I see you do know something of him sly girl but no matter You know how very rich your father is but Silas was the younger brother and had little more than a thousand a year If he had not played and did not care to marry it would have been quite enough ever so much more than younger sons of dukes often have but he was well a mauvais sujet you know what that is I don t want to say any ill of him more than I really know but he was fond of his pleasures I suppose like other young men and he played and was always losing and your father for a long time paid great sums for him I believe he was really a most expensive and vicious young man and I fancy he does not deny that now for they say he would change the past if he could I was looking at the pensive little boy in the oval frame aged eight years who was a few springs later a most expensive and vicious young man and was now a suffering and outcast old one and wondering from what a small seed the hemlock or the wallflower grows and how microscopic are the beginnings of the kingdom of God or of the mystery of iniquity in a human being s heart Austin your papa was very kind to him very but then you know he s an oddity dear he is an oddity though no one may have told you before and he never forgave him for his marriage Your father I suppose knew more about the lady than I did I was young then but there were various reports none of them pleasant and she was not visited and for some time there was a complete estrangement between your father and your uncle Silas and it was made up rather oddly on the very occasion which some people said ought to have totally separated them Did you ever hear anything anything very remarkable about your uncle No never they would not tell me though I am sure they know Pray go on Well Maud as I have begun I ll complete the story though perhaps it might have been better untold It was something rather shocking indeed very shocking in fact they insisted on suspecting him of having committed a murder I stared at my cousin for some time and then at the little boy so refined so beautiful so funeste in the oval frame Yes dear said she her eyes following mine who d have supposed he could ever have have fallen under so horrible a suspicion The wretches Of course Uncle Silas of course he s innocent I said at last Of course my dear said Cousin Monica with an odd look but you know there are some things as bad almost to be suspected of as to have done and the country gentlemen chose to suspect him They did not like him you see His politics vexed them and he resented their treatment of his wife though I really think poor Silas he did not care a pin about her and he annoyed them whenever he could Your papa you know is very proud of his family he never had the slightest suspicion of your uncle Oh no I cried vehemently That s right Maud Ruthyn said Cousin Monica with a sad little smile and a nod And your papa was you may suppose very angry Of course he was I exclaimed You have no idea my dear how angry He directed his attorney to prosecute by wholesale all who had said a word affecting your uncle s character But the lawyers were against it and then your uncle tried to fight his way through it but the men would not meet him He was quite slurred Your father went up and saw the Minister He wanted to have him a Deputy Lieutenant or something in his county Your papa you know had a very great influence with the Government Beside his county influence he had two boroughs then But the Minister was afraid the feeling was so very strong They offered him something in the Colonies but your father would not hear of it that would have been a banishment you know They would have given your father a peerage to make it up but he would not accept it and broke with the party Except in that way which you know was connected with the reputation of the family I don t think considering his great wealth he has done very much for Silas To say truth however he was very liberal before his marriage Old missus Aylmer says he made a vow then that Silas should never have more than five hundred a year which he still allows him I believe and he permits him to live in the place But they say it is in a very wild neglected state You live in the same county have you seen it lately Cousin Monica No not very lately said Cousin Monica and began to hum an air abstractedly CHAPTER XIII BEFORE AND AFTER BREAKFAST Next morning early I visited my favourite full length portrait in the chocolate coat and top boots Scanty as had been my cousin Monica s notes upon this dark and eccentric biography they were everything to me A soul had entered that enchanted form Truth had passed by with her torch and a sad light shone for a moment on that enigmatic face There stood the roue the duellist and with all his faults the hero too In that dark large eye lurked the profound and fiery enthusiasm of his ill starred passion In the thin but exquisite lip I read the courage of the paladin who would have fought his way though single handed against all the magnates of his county and by ordeal of battle have purged the honour of the Ruthyns There in that delicate half sarcastic tracery of the nostril I detected the intellectual defiance which had politically isolated Silas Ruthyn and opposed him to the landed oligarchy of his county whose retaliation had been a hideous slander There too and on his brows and lip I traced the patience of a cold disdain I could now see him as he was the prodigal the hero and the martyr I stood gazing on him with a girlish interest and admiration There was indignation there was pity there was hope Some day it might come to pass that I girl as I was might contribute by word or deed towards the vindication of that long suffering gallant and romantic prodigal It was a flicker of the Joan of Arc inspiration common I fancy to many girls I little then imagined how profoundly and strangely involved my uncle s fate would one day become with mine I was interrupted by Captain Oakley s voice at the window He was leaning on the window sill and looking in with a smile the window being open the morning sunny and his cap lifted in his hand Good morning Miss Ruthyn What a charming old place quite the setting for a romance such timber and this really beautiful house I do so like these white and black houses wonderful old things By the by you treated us very badly last night you did indeed upon my word now it really was too bad running away and drinking tea with Lady Knollys so she says I really I should not like to tell you how very savage I felt particularly considering how very short my time is I was a shy but not a giggling country miss I knew I was an heiress I knew I was somebody I was not the least bit in the world conceited but I think this knowledge helped to give me a certain sense of security and self possession which might have been mistaken for dignity or simplicity I am sure I looked at him with a fearless enquiry for he answered my thoughts I do really assure you Miss Ruthyn I am quite serious you have no idea how very much we have missed you There was a little pause and like a fool I lowered my eyes and blushed I I was thinking of leaving today I am so unfortunate my leave is just out it is so unlucky but I don t quite know whether my aunt Knollys will allow me to go I certainly my dear Charlie I don t want you at all exclaimed a voice Lady Knollys s briskly from an open window close by what could put that in your head dear And in went my cousin s head and the window shut down She is such an oddity poor dear Aunt Knollys murmured the young man ever so little put out and he laughed I never know quite what she wishes or how to please her but she s so good natured and when she goes to town for the season she does not always you know her house is really very gay you can t think Here again he was interrupted for the door opened and Lady Knollys entered And you know Charles she continued it would not do to forget your visit to Snodhurst you wrote you know and you have only to night and to morrow You are thinking of nothing but that moor I heard you talking to the gamekeeper I know he is is not he Maud the brown man with great whiskers and leggings I m very sorry you know but I really must spoil your shooting for they do expect you at Snodhurst Charlie and do not you think this window a little too much for Miss Ruthyn Maud my dear the air is very sharp shut it down Charles and you d better tell them to get a fly for you from the town after luncheon Come dear she said to me Was not that the breakfast bell Why does not your papa get a gong it is so hard to know one bell from another I saw that Captain Oakley lingered for a last look but I did not give it and went out smiling with Cousin Knollys and wondering why old ladies are so uniformly disagreeable In the lobby she said with an odd goodnatured look Don t allow any of his love making my dear Charles Oakley has not a guinea and an heiress would be very convenient Of course he has his eyes about him Charles is not by any means foolish and I should not be at all sorry to see him well married for I don t think he will do much good any other way but there are degrees and his ideas are sometimes very impertinent I was an admiring reader of the Albums the Souvenirs the Keepsakes and all that flood of Christmas present lore which yearly irrigated England with pretty covers and engravings and floods of elegant twaddle the milk not destitute of water on which the babes of literature were then fed On this my genius throve I had a little album enriched with many gems of original thought and observation which I jotted down in suitable language Lately turning over these faded leaves of rhyme and prose I lighted under this day s date upon the following sage reflection with my name appended Is there not in the female heart an ineradicable jealousy which if it sways the passions of the young rules also the advice of the aged Do they not grudge to youth the sentiments though Heaven knows how shadowed with sorrow which they can no longer inspire perhaps even experience and does not youth in turn sigh over the envy which has power to blight MAUD AYLMER RUTHYN He has not been making love to me I said rather tartly and he does not seem to me at all impertinent and I really don t care the least whether he goes or stays Cousin Monica looked in my face with her old waggish smile and laughed You ll understand those London dandies better some day dear Maud they are very well but they like money not to keep of course but still they like it and know its value At breakfast my father told Captain Oakley where he might have shooting or if he preferred going to Dilsford only half an hour s ride he might have his choice of hunters and find the dogs there that morning The Captain smiled archly at me and looked at his aunt There was a suspense I hope I did not show how much I was interested but it would not do Cousin Monica was inexorable Hunting hawking fishing fiddle de dee You know Charlie my dear it is quite out of the question He is going to Snodhurst this afternoon and without quite a rudeness in which I should be involved too he really can t you know you can t Charles and and he must go and keep his engagement So papa acquiesced with a polite regret and hoped another time Oh leave all that to me When you want him only write me a note and I ll send him or bring him if you let me I always know where to find him don t I Charlie and we shall be only too happy Aunt Monica s influence with her nephew was special for she tipped him handsomely every now and then and he had formed for himself agreeable expectations besides respecting her will I felt rather angry at his submitting to this sort of tutelage knowing nothing of its motive I was also disgusted by Cousin Monica s tyranny So soon as he had left the room Lady Knollys not minding me said briskly to papa Never let that young man into your house again I found him making speeches this morning to little Maud here and he really has not two pence in the world it is amazing impudence and you know such absurd things do happen Come Maud what compliments did he pay you asked my father I was vexed and therefore spoke courageously His compliments were not to me they were all to the house I said drily Quite as it should be the house of course it is that he s in love with said Cousin Knollys Twas on a widow s jointure land The archer Cupid took his stand Hey I don t quite understand said my father slily Tut Austin you forget Charlie is my nephew So I did said my father Therefore the literal widow in this case can have no interest in view but one and that is yours and Maud s I wish him well but he shan t put my little cousin and her expectations into his empty pocket not a bit of it And there s another reason Austin why you should marry you have no eye for these things whereas a clever woman would see at a glance and prevent mischief So she would acquiesced my father in his gloomy amused way Maud you must try to be a clever woman So she will in her time but that is not come yet and I tell you Austin Ruthyn if you won t look about and marry somebody somebody may possibly marry you You were always an oracle Monica but here I am lost in total perplexity said my father Yes sharks sailing round you with keen eyes and large throats and you have come to the age precisely when men are swallowed up alive like Jonah Thank you for the parallel but you know that was not a happy union even for the fish and there was a separation in a few days not that I mean to trust to that but there s no one to throw me into the jaws of the monster and I ve no notion of jumping there and the fact is Monica there s no monster at all I m not so sure But I m quite sure said my father a little drily You forget how old I am and how long I ve lived alone I and little Maud and he smiled and smoothed my hair and I thought sighed No one is ever too old to do a foolish thing began Lady Knollys Nor to say a foolish thing Monica This has gone on too long Don t you see that little Maud here is silly enough to be frightened at your fun So I was but I could not divine how he guessed it And well or ill wisely or madly I ll never marry so put that out of your head This was addressed rather to me I think than to Lady Knollys who smiled a little waggishly on me and said To be sure Maud maybe you are right a stepdame is a risk and I ought to have asked you first what you thought of it and upon my honour she continued merrily but kindly observing that my eyes I know not exactly from what feeling filled with tears I ll never again advise your papa to marry unless you first tell me you wish it This was a great deal from Lady Knollys who had a taste for advising her friends and managing their affairs I ve a great respect for instinct I believe Austin it is truer than reason and yours and Maud s are both against me though I know I have reason on my side My father s brief wintry smile answered and Cousin Monica kissed me and said I ve been so long my own mistress that I sometimes forget there are such things as fear and jealousy and are you going to your governess Maud CHAPTER XIV ANGRY WORDS I was going to my governess as Lady Knollys said and so I went The undefinable sense of danger that smote me whenever I beheld that woman had deepened since last night s occurrence and was taken out of the region of instinct or prepossession by the strange though slight indications of recognition and abhorrence which I had witnessed in Lady Knollys on that occasion The tone in which Cousin Monica had asked are you going to your governess and the curious grave and anxious look that accompanied the question disturbed me and there was something odd and cold in the tone as if a remembrance had suddenly chilled her The accent remained in my ear and the sharp brooding look was fixed before me as I glided up the broad dark stairs to Madame de la Rougierre s chamber She had not come down to the school room as the scene of my studies was called She had decided on having a relapse and accordingly had not made her appearance down stairs that morning The gallery leading to her room was dark and lonely and I grew more nervous as I approached I paused at the door making up my mind to knock But the door opened suddenly and like a magic lantern figure presented with a snap appeared close before my eyes the great muffled face with the forbidding smirk of Madame de la Rougierre Wat you mean my dear cheaile she inquired with a malevolent shrewdness in her eyes and her hollow smile all the time disconcerting me more even than the suddenness of her appearance wat for you approach so softly I do not sleep you see but you feared perhaps to have the misfortune of wakening me and so you came is it not so to leesten and looke in very gentily you want to know how I was Vous etes bien aimable d avoir pense a moi Bah she cried suddenly bursting through her irony Wy could not Lady Knollys come herself and leesten to the keyhole to make her report Fi donc wat is there to conceal Nothing Enter if you please Every one they are welcome and she flung the door wide turned her back upon me and with an ejaculation which I did not understand strode into the room I did not come with any intention Madame to pry or to intrude you don t think so you can t think so you can t possibly mean to insinuate anything so insulting I was very angry and my tremors had all vanished now No not for you dear cheaile I was thinking to miladi Knollys who without cause is my enemy Every one has enemy you will learn all that so soon as you are little older and without cause she is mine Come Maud speak a the truth was it not miladi Knollys who sent you here doucement doucement so quaite to my door is it not so little rogue Madame had confronted me again and we were now standing in the middle of her floor I indignantly repelled the charge and searching me for a moment with her oddly shaped cunning eyes she said That is good cheaile you speak a so direct I like that and am glad to hear but my dear Maud that woman Lady Knollys is papa s cousin I interposed a little gravely She does hate a me so you av no idea She as tryed to injure me several times and would employ the most innocent person unconsciously you know my dear to assist her malice Here Madame wept a little I had already discovered that she could shed tears whenever she pleased I have heard of such persons but I never met another before or since Madame was unusually frank no one ever knew better when to be candid At present I suppose she concluded that Lady Knollys would certainly relate whatever she knew concerning her before she left Knowl and so Madame s reserves whatever they might be were dissolving and she growing childlike and confiding Et comment va monsieur votre pere aujourd hui Very well I thanked her And how long miladi Knollys her visit is likely to be I could not say exactly but for some days Eh bien my dear cheaile I find myself better this morning and we must return to our lessons Je veux m habiller ma chere Maud you will wait me in the school room By this time Madame who though lazy could make an effort and was capable of getting into a sudden hurry had placed herself before her dressing table and was ogling her discoloured and bony countenance in the glass Wat horror I am so pale Quel ennui wat bore Ow weak av I grow in two three days And she practised some plaintive invalid glances into the mirror But on a sudden there came a little sharp inquisitive frown as she looked over the frame of the glass upon the terrace beneath It was only a glance and she sat down languidly in her arm chair to prepare I suppose for the fatigues of the toilet My curiosity was sufficiently aroused to induce me to ask But why Madame do you fancy that Lady Knollys dislikes you Tis not fancy my dear Maud Ah ha no Mais c est toute une histoire too tedious to tell now some time maybe and you will learn when you are little older the most violent hatreds often they are the most without cause But my dear cheaile the hours they are running from us and I must dress Vite vite so you run away to the school room and I will come after Madame had her dressing case and her mysteries and palpably stood in need of repairs so away I went to my studies The room which we called the school room was partly beneath the floor of Madame s bed chamber and commanded the same view so remembering my governess s peering glance from her windows I looked out and saw Cousin Monica making a brisk promenade up and down the terrace walk Well that was quite enough to account for it I had grown very curious and I resolved when our lessons were over to join her and make another attempt to discover the mystery As I sat over my books I fancied I heard a movement outside the door I suspected that Madame was listening I waited for a time expecting to see the door open but she did not come so I opened it suddenly myself but Madame was not on the threshold nor on the lobby I heard a rustling however and on the staircase over the banister I saw the folds of her silk dress as she descended She is going I thought to seek an interview with Lady Knollys She intends to propitiate that dangerous lady so I amused some eight or ten minutes in watching Cousin Monica s quick march and right about face upon the parade ground of the terrace But no one joined her She is certainly talking to papa was my next and more probable conjecture Having the profoundest distrust of Madame I was naturally extremely jealous of the confidential interviews in which deceit and malice might make their representations plausibly and without answer Yes I ll run down and see see papa she shan t tell lies behind my back horrid woman At the study door I knocked and forthwith entered My father was sitting near the window his open book before him Madame standing at the other side of the table her cunning eyes bathed in tears and her pocket handkerchief pressed to her mouth Her eyes glittered stealthily on me for an instant she was sobbing desolee in fact that grim grenadier lady and her attitude was exquisitely dejected and timid But she was notwithstanding reading closely and craftily my father s face He was not looking at her but rather upward toward the ceiling reflectively leaning on his hand with an expression not angry but rather surly and annoyed I ought to have heard of this before Madame my father was saying as I came in not that it would have made any difference not the least mind that But it was the kind of thing that I ought to have heard and the omission was not strictly right Madame in a shrill and lamentable key opened her voluble reply but was arrested by a nod from my father who asked me if I wanted anything Only only that I was waiting in the school room for Madame and did not know where she was Well she is here you see and will join you up stairs in a few minutes So back I went again huffed angry and curious and sat back in my chair with a clouded countenance thinking very little about lessons When Madame entered I did not lift my head or eyes Good cheaile reading said she as she approached briskly and reassured No I answered tartly not good nor a child either I m not reading I ve been thinking Tres bien she said with an insufferable smile thinking is very good also but you look unhappy very poor cheaile Take care you are not grow jealous for poor Madame talking sometime to your papa you must not little fool It is only for a your good my dear Maud and I had no objection you should stay You Madame I said loftily I was very angry and showed it through my dignity to Madame s evident satisfaction No it was your papa mister Ruthyn who weesh to speak alone for me I do not care there was something I weesh to tell him I don t care who know but mister Ruthyn he is deeferent I made no remark Come leetle Maud you are not to be so cross it will be much better you and I to be good friends together Why should a we quarrel wat nonsense Do you imagine I would anywhere undertake a the education of a young person unless I could speak with her parent wat folly I would like to be your friend however my poor Maud if you would allow you and I together wat you say People grow to be friends by liking Madame and liking comes of itself not by bargain I like every one who is kind to me And so I You are like me in so many things my dear Maud Are you quaite well to day I think you look fateague so I feel too vary tire I think we weel put off the lessons to to morrow Eh and we will come to play la grace in the garden Madame was plainly in a high state of exultation Her audience had evidently been satisfactory and like other people when things went well her soul lighted up into a sulphureous good humour not very genuine nor pleasant but still it was better than other moods I was glad when our calisthenics were ended and Madame had returned to her apartment so that I had a pleasant little walk with Cousin Monica We women are persevering when once our curiosity is roused but she gaily foiled mine and I think had a mischievous pleasure in doing so As we were going in to dress for dinner however she said quite gravely I am sorry Maud I allowed you to see that I have any unpleasant impressions about that governess lady I shall be at liberty some day to explain all about it and indeed it will be enough to tell your father whom I have not been able to find all day but really we are perhaps making too much of the matter and I cannot say that I know anything against Madame that is conclusive or or indeed at all but that there are reasons and you must not ask any more no you must not That evening while I was playing the overture to Cenerentola for the entertainment of my cousin there arose from the tea table where she and my father were sitting a spirited and rather angry harangue from Lady Knollys lips I turned my eyes from the music towards the speakers the overture swooned away with a little hesitating babble into silence and I listened Their conversation had begun under cover of the music which I was making and now they were too much engrossed to perceive its discontinuance The first sentence I heard seized my attention my father had closed the book he was reading upon his finger and was leaning back in his chair as he used to do when at all angry his face was a little flushed and I knew the fierce and glassy stare which expressed pride surprise and wrath Yes Lady Knollys there s an animus I know the spirit you speak in it does you no honour said my father And I know the spirit you speak in the spirit of madness retorted Cousin Monica just as much in earnest I can t conceive how you can be so demented Austin What has perverted you are you blind You are Monica your own unnatural prejudice unnatural prejudice blinds you What is it all nothing Were I to act as you say I should be a coward and a traitor I see I do see all that s real I m no Quixote to draw my sword on illusions There should be no halting here How can you do you ever think I wonder if you can breathe I feel as if the evil one were in the house A stern momentary frown was my father s only answer as he looked fixedly at her People need not nail up horseshoes and mark their door stones with charms to keep the evil spirit out ran on Lady Knollys who looked pale and angry in her way but you open your door in the dark and invoke unknown danger How can you look at that child that s she s not playing said Knollys abruptly stopping My father rose muttering to himself and cast a lurid glance at me as he went in high displeasure to the door Cousin Monica now flushed a little glanced also silently at me biting the tip of her slender gold cross and doubtful how much I had heard My father opened the door suddenly which he had just closed and looking in said in a calmer tone Perhaps Monica you would come for a moment to the study I m sure you have none but kindly feelings towards me and little Maud there and I thank you for your good will but you must see other things more reasonably and I think you will Cousin Monica got up silently and followed him only throwing up her eyes and hands as she did so and I was left alone wondering and curious more than ever CHAPTER XV A WARNING I sat still listening and wondering and wondering and listening but I ought to have known that no sound could reach me where I was from my father s study Five minutes passed and they did not return Ten fifteen I drew near the fire and made myself comfortable in a great arm chair looking on the embers but not seeing all the scenery and dramatis personae of my past life or future fortunes in their shifting glow as people in romances usually do but fanciful castles and caverns in blood red and golden glare suggestive of dreamy fairy land salamanders sunsets and palaces of fire kings and all this partly shaping and partly shaped by my fancy and leading my closing eyes and drowsy senses off into dream land So I nodded and dozed and sank into a deep slumber from which I was roused by the voice of my cousin Monica On opening my eyes I saw nothing but Lady Knollys face looking steadily into mine and expanding into a good natured laugh as she watched the vacant and lack lustre stare with which I returned her gaze Come dear Maud it is late you ought to have been in your bed an hour ago Up I stood and so soon as I had begun to hear and see aright it struck me that Cousin Monica was more grave and subdued than I had seen her Come let us light our candles and go together Holding hands we ascended I sleepy she silent and not a word was spoken until we reached my room Mary Quince was in waiting and tea made Tell her to come back in a few minutes I wish to say a word to you said Lady Knollys The maid accordingly withdrew Lady Knollys eyes followed her till she closed the door behind her I m going in the morning So soon Yes dear I could not stay in fact I should have gone tonight but it was too late and I leave instead in the morning I am so sorry so very sorry I exclaimed in honest disappointment and the walls seemed to darken round me and the monotony of the old routine loomed more terrible in prospect So am I dear Maud But can t you stay a little longer won t you No Maud I m vexed with Austin very much vexed with your father in short I can t conceive anything so entirely preposterous and dangerous and insane as his conduct now that his eyes are quite opened and I must say a word to you before I go and it is just this you must cease to be a mere child you must try and be a woman Maud now don t be frightened or foolish but hear me out That woman what does she call herself Rougierre I have reason to believe is in fact from circumstances must be your enemy you will find her very deep daring and unscrupulous I venture to say and you can t be too much on your guard Do you quite understand me Maud I do said I with a gasp and my eyes fixed on her with a terrified interest as if on a warning ghost You must bridle your tongue mind and govern your conduct and command even your features It is hard to practise reserve but you must you must be secret and vigilant Try and be in appearance just as usual don t quarrel tell her nothing if you do happen to know anything of your father s business be always on your guard when with her and keep your eye upon her everywhere Observe everything disclose nothing do you see Yes again I whispered You have good honest servants about you and thank God they don t like her But you must not repeat to them one word I am now saying to you Servants are fond of dropping hints and letting things ooze out in that way and in their quarrels with her would compromise you you understand me I do I sighed with a wild stare And and Maud don t let her meddle with your food Cousin Monica gave me a pale little nod and looked away I could only stare at her and under my breath I uttered an ejaculation of terror Don t be so frightened you must not be foolish I only wish you to be upon your guard I have my suspicions but I may be quite wrong your father thinks I am a fool perhaps I am perhaps not maybe he may come to think as I do But you must not speak to him on the subject he s an odd man and never did and never will act wisely when his passions and prejudices are engaged Has she ever committed any great crime I asked feeling as if I were on the point of fainting No dear Maud I never said anything of the kind don t be so frightened I only said I have formed from something I know an ill opinion of her and an unprincipled person under temptation is capable of a great deal But no matter how wicked she may be you may defy her simply by assuming her to be so and acting with caution she is cunning and selfish and she ll do nothing desperate But I would give her no opportunity Oh dear Oh Cousin Monica don t leave me My dear I can t stay your papa and I we ve had a quarrel I know I m right and he s wrong and he ll come to see it soon if he s left to himself and then all will be right But just now he misunderstands me and we ve not been civil to one another I could not think of staying and he would not allow you to come away with me for a short visit which I wished It won t last though and I do assure you my dear Maud I am quite happy about you now that you are quite on your guard Just act respecting that person as if she were capable of any treachery without showing distrust or dislike in your manner and nothing will remain in her power and write to me whenever you wish to hear from me and if I can be of any real use I don t care I ll come so there s a wise little woman do as I ve said and depend upon it everything will go well and I ll contrive before long to get that nasty creature away Except a kiss and a few hurried words in the morning when she was leaving and a pencilled farewell for papa there was nothing more from Cousin Monica for some time Knowl was dark again darker than ever My father gentle always to me was now perhaps it was contrast with his fitful return to something like the world s ways during Lady Knollys stay more silent sad and isolated than before Of Madame de la Rougierre I had nothing at first particular to remark Only reader if you happen to be a rather nervous and very young girl I ask you to conceive my fears and imaginings and the kind of misery which I was suffering Its intensity I cannot now even myself recall But it overshadowed me perpetually a care an alarm It lay down with me at night and got up with me in the morning tinting and disturbing my dreams and making my daily life terrible I wonder now that I lived through the ordeal The torment was secret and incessant and kept my mind in unintermitting activity Externally things went on at Knowl for some weeks in the usual routine Madame was so far as her unpleasant ways were concerned less tormenting than before and constantly reminded me of our leetle vow of friendship you remember dearest Maud and she would stand beside me and looked from the window with her bony arm round my waist and my reluctant hand drawn round in hers and thus she would smile and talk affectionately and even playfully for at times she would grow quite girlish and smile with her great carious teeth and begin to quiz and babble about the young faylows and tell bragging tales of her lovers all of which were dreadful to me She was perpetually recurring too to the charming walk we had had together to Church Scarsdale and proposing a repetition of that delightful excursion which you may be sure I evaded having by no means so agreeable a recollection of our visit One day as I was dressing to go out for a walk in came good missus Rusk the housekeeper to my room Miss Maud dear is not that too far for you It is a long walk to Church Scarsdale and you are not looking very well To Church Scarsdale I repeated I m not going to Church Scarsdale who said I was going to Church Scarsdale There is nothing I should so much dislike Well I never exclaimed she Why there s old Madame s been down stairs with me for fruit and sandwiches telling me you were longing to go to Church Scarsdale It s quite untrue I interrupted She knows I hate it She does said missus Rusk quietly and you did not tell her nothing about the basket Well if there isn t a story Now what may she be after what is it what is she driving at I can t tell but I won t go No of course dear you won t go But you may be sure there s some scheme in her old head Tom Fowkes says she s bin two or three times to drink tea at Farmer Gray s now could it be she s thinking to marry him And missus Rusk sat down and laughed heartily ending with a crow of derision To think of a young fellow like that and his wife poor thing not dead a year maybe she s got money I don t know I don t care perhaps missus Rusk you mistook Madame I will go down I am going out Madame had a basket in her hand She held it quietly by her capacious skirt at the far side and made no allusion to the preparation neither to the direction in which she proposed walking and prattling artlessly and affectionately she marched by my side Thus we reached the stile at the sheep walk and then I paused Now Madame have not we gone far enough in this direction suppose we visit the pigeon house in the park Wat folly my dear a Maud you cannot walk so far Well towards home then And wy not a this way We ave not walk enough and mister Ruthyn he will not be pleased if you do not take proper exercise Let us walk on by the path and stop when you like Where do you wish to go Madame Nowhere particular come along don t be fool Maud This leads to Church Scarsdale A yes indeed wat sweet place bote we need not a walk all the way to there I d rather not walk outside the grounds to day Madame Come Maud you shall not be fool wat you mean Mademoiselle said the stalworth lady growing yellow and greenish with an angry mottling and accosting me very gruffly I don t care to cross the stile thank you Madame I shall remain at this side You shall do wat I tell you exclaimed she Let go my arm Madame you hurt me I cried She had griped my arm very firmly in her great bony hand and seemed preparing to drag me over by main force Let me go I repeated shrilly for the pain increased La she cried with a smile of rage and a laugh letting me go and shoving me backward at the same time so that I had a rather dangerous tumble I stood up a good deal hurt and very angry notwithstanding my fear of her I ll ask papa if I am to be so ill used Wat av I done cried Madame laughing grimly from her hollow jaws I did all I could to help you over ow could I prevent you to pull back and tumble if you would do so That is the way wen you petites Mademoiselles are naughty and hurt yourself they always try to make blame other people Tell a wat you like you think I care Very well Madame Are a you coming No She looked steadily in my face and very wickedly I gazed at her as with dazzled eyes I suppose as the feathered prey do at the owl that glares on them by night I neither moved back nor forward but stared at her quite helplessly You are nice pupil charming young person So polite so obedient so amiable I will walk towards Church Scarsdale she continued suddenly breaking through the conventionalism of her irony and accosting me in savage accents You weel stay behind if you dare I tell you to accompany do you hear More than ever resolved against following her I remained where I was watching her as she marched fiercely away swinging her basket as though in imagination knocking my head off with it She soon cooled however and looking over her shoulder and seeing me still at the other side of the stile she paused and beckoned me grimly to follow her Seeing me resolutely maintain my position she faced about tossed her head like an angry beast and seemed uncertain for a while what course to take with me She stamped and beckoned furiously again I stood firm I was very much frightened and could not tell to what violence she might resort in her exasperation She walked towards me with an inflamed countenance and a slight angry wagging of the head my heart fluttered and I awaited the crisis in extreme trepidation She came close the stile only separating us and stopped short glaring and grinning at me like a French grenadier who has crossed bayonets but hesitates to close CHAPTER XVI DOCTOR BRYERLY LOOKS IN What had I done to excite this ungovernable fury We had often before had such small differences and she had contented herself with being sarcastic teasing and impertinent So for future you are gouvernante and I the cheaile for you to command is not so and you must direct where we shall walk Tres bien we shall see Monsieur Ruthyn he shall know everything For me I do not care not at all I shall be rather pleased on the contrary Let him decide If I shall be responsible for the conduct and the health of Mademoiselle his daughter it must be that I shall have authority to direct her wat she must do it must be that she or I shall obey I ask only witch shall command for the future voila tout I was frightened but resolute I dare say I looked sullen and uncomfortable At all events she seemed to think she might possibly succeed by wheedling so she tried coaxing and cajoling and patted my cheek and predicted that I would be a good cheaile and not vex poor Madame but do for the future wat she tell a me She smiled her wide wet grin smoothed my hand and patted my cheek and would in the excess of her conciliatory paroxysm have kissed me but I withdrew and she commented only with a little laugh and a Foolish little thing but you will be quite amiable just now Why Madame I asked suddenly raising my head and looking her straight in the face do you wish me to walk to Church Scarsdale so particularly to day She answered my steady look with a contracted gaze and an unpleasant frown Wy do I I do not understand a you there is no particular day wat folly Wy I like Church Scarsdale Well it is such pretty place There is all Wat leetle fool I suppose you think I want to keel a you and bury you in the churchyard And she laughed and it would not have been a bad laugh for a ghoul Come my dearest Maud you are not a such fool to say if you tell me me go thees a way I weel go that and if you say go that a way I weel go thees you are rasonable leetle girl come along alons donc we shall av soche agreeable walk weel a you But I was immovable It was neither obstinacy nor caprice but a profound fear that governed me I was then afraid yes afraid Afraid of what Well of going with Madame de la Rougierre to Church Scarsdale that day That was all And I believe that instinct was true She turned a bitter glance toward Church Scarsdale and bit her lip She saw that she must give it up A shadow hung upon her drab features A little scowl a little sneer wide lips compressed with a false smile and a leaden shadow mottling all Such was the countenance of the lady who only a minute or two before had been smiling and murmuring over the stile so amiably with her idiomatic blarney as the Irish call that kind of blandishment There was no mistaking the malignant disappointment that hooked and warped her features my heart sank a tremendous fear overpowered me Had she intended poisoning me What was in that basket I looked in her dreadful face I felt for a minute quite frantic A feeling of rage with my father with my Cousin Monica for abandoning me to this dreadful rogue took possession of me and I cried helplessly wringing my hands Oh it is a shame it is a shame it is a shame The countenance of the gouvernante relaxed I think she in turn was frightened at my extreme agitation It might have worked unfavourably with my father Come Maud it is time you should try to control your temper You shall not walk to Church Scarsdale if you do not like I only invite There It is quite as you please where we shall walk then Here to the peegeon house I think you say Tout bien Remember I concede you everything Let us go We went therefore towards the pigeon house through the forest trees I not speaking as the children in the wood did with their sinister conductor but utterly silent and scared she silent also meditating and sometimes with a sharp side glance gauging my progress towards equanimity Her own was rapid for Madame was a philosopher and speedily accommodated herself to circumstances We had not walked a quarter of an hour when every trace of gloom had left her face which had assumed its customary brightness and she began to sing with a spiteful hilarity as we walked forward and indeed seemed to be approaching one of her waggish frolicsome moods But her fun in these moods was solitary The joke whatever it was remained in her own keeping When we approached the ruined brick tower in old times a pigeon house she grew quite frisky and twirled her basket in the air and capered to her own singing Under the shadow of the broken wall and its ivy she sat down with a frolicsome plump and opened her basket inviting me to partake which I declined I must do her justice however upon the suspicion of poison which she quite disposed of by gobbling up to her own share everything which the basket contained The reader is not to suppose that Madame s cheerful demeanour indicated that I was forgiven Nothing of the kind One syllable more on our walk home she addressed not to me And when we reached the terrace she said You will please Maud remain for two three minutes in the Dutch garden while I speak with mister Ruthyn in the study This was spoken with a high head and an insufferable smile and I more haughtily but quite gravely turned without disputing and descended the steps to the quaint little garden she had indicated I was surprised and very glad to see my father there I ran to him and began Oh papa and then stopped short adding only may I speak to you now He smiled kindly and gravely on me Well Maud say your say Oh sir it is only this I entreat that our walks mine and Madame s may be confined to the grounds And why I I m afraid to go with her Afraid he repeated looking hard at me Have you lately had a letter from Lady Knollys No papa not for two months or more There was a pause And why afraid Maud She brought me one day to Church Scarsdale you know what a solitary place it is sir and she frightened me so that I was afraid to go with her into the churchyard But she went and left me alone at the other side of the stream and an impudent man passing by stopped and spoke to me and seemed inclined to laugh at me and altogether frightened me very much and he did not go till Madame happened to return What kind of man young or old A young man he looked like a farmer s son but very impudent and stood there talking to me whether I would or not and Madame did not care at all and laughed at me for being frightened and indeed I am very uncomfortable with her He gave me another shrewd look and then looked down cloudily and thought You say you are uncomfortable and frightened How is this what causes these feelings I don t know sir she likes frightening me I am afraid of her we are all afraid of her I think The servants I mean as well as I My father nodded his head contemptuously twice or thrice and muttered A pack of fools And she was so very angry to day with me because I would not walk again with her to Church Scarsdale I am very much afraid of her I and quite unpremeditatedly I burst into tears There there little Maud you must not cry She is here only for your good If you are afraid even foolishly afraid it is enough Be it as you say your walks are henceforward confined to the grounds I ll tell her so I thanked him through my tears very earnestly But Maud beware of prejudice women are unjust and violent in their judgments Your family has suffered in some of its members by such injustice It behoves us to be careful not to practise it That evening in the drawing room my father said in his usual abrupt way About my departure Maud I ve had a letter from London this morning and I think I shall be called away sooner than I at first supposed and for a little time we must manage apart from one another Do not be alarmed You shall not be in Madame de la Rougierre s charge but under the care of a relation but even so little Maud will miss her old father I think His tone was very tender so were his looks he was looking down on me with a smile and tears were in his eyes This softening was new to me I felt a strange thrill of surprise delight and love and springing up I threw my arms about his neck and wept in silence He I think shed tears also You said a visitor was coming some one you mean to go away with Ah yes you love him better than me No dear no but I fear him and I am sorry to leave you little Maud It won t be very long I pleaded No dear he answered with a sigh I was tempted almost to question him more closely on the subject but he seemed to divine what was in my mind for he said Let us speak no more of it but only bear in mind Maud what I told you about the oak cabinet the key of which is here and he held it up as formerly you remember what you are to do in case Doctor Bryerly should come while I am away Yes sir His manner had changed and I had returned to my accustomed formalities It was only a few days later that doctor Bryerly actually did arrive at Knowl quite unexpectedly except I suppose by my father He was to stay only one night He was twice closeted in the little study up stairs with my father who seemed to me even for him unusually dejected and missus Rusk inveighing against them rubbitch as she always termed the Swedenborgians told me they were making him quite shaky like and he would not last no time if that lanky lean ghost of a fellow in black was to keep prowling in and out of his room like a tame cat I lay awake that night wondering what the mystery might be that connected my father and doctor Bryerly There was something more than the convictions of their strange religion could account for There was something that profoundly agitated my father It may not be reasonable but so it is The person whose presence though we know nothing of the cause of that effect is palpably attended with pain to anyone who is dear to us grows odious and I began to detest Doctor Bryerly It was a grey dark morning and in a dark pass in the gallery near the staircase I came full upon the ungainly Doctor in his glossy black suit I think if my mind had been less anxiously excited on the subject of his visit or if I had not disliked him so much I should not have found courage to accost him as I did There was something sly I thought in his dark lean face and he looked so low so like a Scotch artisan in his Sunday clothes that I felt a sudden pang of indignation at the thought that a great gentleman like my father should have suffered under his influence and I stopped suddenly instead of passing him by with a mere salutation as he expected May I ask a question Doctor Bryerly Certainly Are you the friend whom my father expects I don t quite see The friend I mean with whom he is to make an expedition to some distance I think and for some little time No said the Doctor with a shake of his head And who is he I really have not a notion Miss Why he said that you knew I replied The Doctor looked honestly puzzled Will he stay long away pray tell me The Doctor looked into my troubled face with inquiring and darkened eyes like one who half reads another s meaning and then he said a little briskly but not sharply Well I don t know I m sure Miss no indeed you must have mistaken there s nothing that I know There was a little pause and he added No He never mentioned any friend to me I fancied that he was made uncomfortable by my question and wanted to hide the truth Perhaps I was partly right Oh Doctor Bryerly pray pray who is the friend and where is he going I do assure you he said with a strange sort of impatience I don t know it is all nonsense And he turned to go looking I think annoyed and disconcerted A terrific suspicion crossed my brain like lightning Doctor one word I said I believe quite wildly Do you do you think his mind is at all affected Insane he said looking at me with a sudden sharp inquisitiveness that brightened into a smile Pooh pooh Heaven forbid not a saner man in England Then with a little nod he walked on carrying as I believed notwithstanding his disclaimer the secret with him In the afternoon Doctor Bryerly went away CHAPTER XVII AN ADVENTURE For many days after our quarrel Madame hardly spoke to me As for lessons I was not much troubled with them It was plain too that my father had spoken to her for she never after that day proposed our extending our walks beyond the precincts of Knowl Knowl however was a very considerable territory and it was possible for a much better pedestrian than I to tire herself effectually without passing its limits So we took occasionally long walks After some weeks of sullenness during which for days at a time she hardly spoke to me and seemed lost in dark and evil abstraction she once more and somewhat suddenly recovered her spirits and grew quite friendly Her gaieties and friendliness were not reassuring and in my mind presaged approaching mischief and treachery The days were shortening to the wintry span The edge of the red sun had already touched the horizon as Madame and I overtaken at the warren by his last beams were hastening homeward A narrow carriage road traverses this wild region of the park to which a distant gate gives entrance On descending into this unfrequented road I was surprised to see a carriage standing there A thin sly postilion with that pert turned up nose which the old caricaturist Woodward used to attribute to the gentlemen of Tewkesbury was leaning on his horses and looked hard at me as I passed A lady who sat within looked out with an extra fashionable bonnet on and also treated us to a stare Very pink and white cheeks she had very black glossy hair and bright eyes fat bold and rather cross she looked and in her bold way she examined us curiously as we passed I mistook the situation It had once happened before that an intending visitor at Knowl had entered the place by that park road and lost several hours in a vain search for the house Ask him Madame whether they want to go to the house I dare say they have missed their way whispered I Eh bien they will find again I do not choose to talk to post boys allons But I asked the man as we passed Do you want to reach the house By this time he was at the horses heads buckling the harness Noa he said in a surly tone smiling oddly on the winkers but recollecting his politeness he added Noa thankee misses it s what they calls a picnic we ll be takin the road now He was smiling now on a little buckle with which he was engaged Come nonsense whispered Madame sharply in my ear and she whisked me by the arm so we crossed the little stile at the other side Our path lay across the warren which undulates in little hillocks The sun was down by this time blue shadows were stretching round us colder in the splendid contrast of the burnished sunset sky Descending over these hillocks we saw three figures a little in advance of us not far from the path we were tracing Two were standing smoking and chatting at intervals one tall and slim with a high chimney pot worn a little on one side and a white great coat buttoned up to the chin the other shorter and stouter with a dark coloured wrapper These gentlemen were facing rather our way as we came over the edge of the eminence but turned their backs on perceiving our approach As they did so I remember so well each lowered his cigar suddenly with the simultaneousness of a drill The third figure sustained the picnic character of the group for he was repacking a hamper He stood suddenly erect as we drew near and a very ill looking person he was low browed square chinned and with a broad broken nose He wore gaiters and was a little bandy very broad and had a closely cropped bullet head and deep set little eyes The moment I saw him I beheld the living type of the burglars and bruisers whom I had so often beheld with a kind of scepticism in Punch He stood over his hamper and scowled sharply at us for a moment then with the point of his foot he jerked a little fur cap that lay on the ground into his hand drew it tight over his lowering brows and called to his companions just as we passed him Hallo mister How s this All right said the tall person in the white great coat who as he answered shook his shorter companion by the arm I thought angrily This shorter companion turned about He had a muffler loose about his neck and chin I thought he seemed shy and irresolute and the tall man gave him a great jolt with his elbow which made him stagger and I fancied a little angry for he said as it seemed a sulky word or two The gentleman in the white surtout however standing direct in our way raised his hat with a mock salutation placing his hand on his breast and forthwith began to advance with an insolent grin and an air of tipsy frolic Jist in time ladies five minutes more and we d a bin off Thankee missus Mouser ma am for the honour of the meetin and more particular for the pleasure of making your young lady s acquaintance niece ma am daughter ma am granddaughter by Jove is it Hallo there mild n I say stop packin This was to the ill favoured person with the broken nose Bring us a couple o glasses and a bottle o curacoa what are you fear d on my dear this is Lord Lollipop here a reg lar charmer wouldn t hurt a fly hey

like a sugarstick ain t I Lolly boy I m Miss Ruthyn tell them Madame I said stamping on the ground and very much frightened Be quaite Maud If you are angry they will hurt us leave me to speak whispered the gouvernante All this time they were approaching from separate points I glanced back and saw the ruffianly looking man within a yard or two with his arm raised and one finger up telegraphing as it seemed to the gentlemen in front Be quaite Maud whispered Madame with an awful adjuration which I do not care to set down They are teepsy don t seem fraid I was afraid terrified The circle had now so narrowed that they might have placed their hands on my shoulders Pray gentlemen wat you want weel a you av the goodness to permit us to go on I now observed for the first time with a kind of shock that the shorter of the two men who prevented our advance was the person who had accosted me so offensively at Church Scarsdale I pulled Madame by the arm whispering Let us run Be quaite my dear Maud was her only reply I tell you what said the tall man who had replaced his high hat more jauntily than before on the side of his head We ve caught you now fair game and we ll let you off on conditions You must not be frightened Miss Upon my honour and soul I mean no mischief do I Lollipop I call him Lord Lollipop it s only chaff though his name s Smith Now Lolly I vote we let the prisoners go when we just introduce them to missus Smith she s sitting in the carriage and keeps mister S here in precious good order I promise you There s easy terms for you eh and we ll have a glass o curacoa round and so part friends Is it a bargain Come Yes Maud we must go wat matter whispered Madame vehemently You shan t I said instinctively terrified You ll go with Ma am young un won t you said mister Smith as his companion called him Madame was holding my arm but I snatched it from her and would have run the tall man however placed his arms round me and held me fast with an affectation of playfulness but his grip was hard enough to hurt me a good deal Being now thoroughly frightened after an ineffectual struggle during which I heard Madame say You fool Maud weel you come with me see wat you are doing I began to scream shriek after shriek which the man attempted to drown with loud hooting peals of laughter forcing his handkerchief against my mouth while Madame continued to bawl her exhortations to be quaite in my ear I ll lift her I say said a gruff voice behind me But at this instant wild with terror I distinctly heard other voices shouting The men who surrounded me were instantly silent and all looked in the direction of the sound now very near and I screamed with redoubled energy The ruffian behind me thrust his great hand over my mouth It is the gamekeeper cried Madame Two gamekeepers we are safe thank Heaven and she began to call on Dykes by name I only remember feeling myself at liberty running a few steps seeing Dykes white furious face clinging to his arm with which he was bringing his gun to a level and saying Don t fire they ll murder us if you do Madame screaming lustily ran up at the same moment Run on to the gate and lock it I ll be wi ye in a minute cried he to the other gamekeeper who started instantly on this mission for the three ruffians were already in full retreat for the carriage Giddy wild fainting still terror carried me on Now Madame Rogers s pose you take young Misses on I must run and len Bill a hand No no you moste not cried Madame I am fainting myself and more villains they may be near to us But at this moment we heard a shot and muttering to himself and grasping his gun Dykes ran at his utmost speed in the direction of the sound With many exhortations to speed and ejaculations of alarm Madame hurried me on toward the house which at length we reached without further adventure As it happened my father met us in the hall He was perfectly transported with fury on hearing from Madame what had happened and set out at once with some of the servants in the hope of intercepting the party at the park gate Here was a new agitation for my father did not return for nearly three hours and I could not conjecture what might be occurring during the period of his absence My alarm was greatly increased by the arrival in the interval of poor Bill the under gamekeeper very much injured Seeing that he was determined to intercept their retreat the three men had set upon him wrested his gun which exploded in the struggle from him and beat him savagely I mention these particulars because they convinced everybody that there was something specially determined and ferocious in the spirit of the party and that the fracas was no mere frolic but the result of a predetermined plan My father had not succeeded in overtaking them He traced them to the Lugton Station where they had taken the railway and no one could tell him in what direction the carriage and posthorses had driven Madame was or affected to be very much shattered by what had occurred Her recollection and mine when my father questioned us closely differed very materially respecting many details of the personnel of the villanous party She was obstinate and clear and although the gamekeeper corroborated my description of them still my father was puzzled Perhaps he was not sorry that some hesitation was forced upon him because although at first he would have gone almost any length to detect the persons on reflection he was pleased that there was not evidence to bring them into a court of justice the publicity and annoyance of which would have been inconceivably distressing to me Madame was in a strange state tempestuous in temper talking incessantly every now and then in floods of tears and perpetually on her knees pouring forth torrents of thanksgiving to Heaven for our joint deliverance from the hands of those villains Notwithstanding our community of danger and her thankfulness on my behalf however she broke forth into wrath and railing whenever we were alone together Wat fool you were so disobedient and obstinate if you ad done wat I say then we should av been quaite safe those persons they were tipsy and there is nothing so dangerous as to quarrel with tipsy persons I would av brought you quaite safe the lady she seem so nice and quaite and we should av been safe with her there would av been nothing absolutely but instead you would scream and pooshe and so they grow quite wild and all the impertinence and violence follow of course and that a poor Bill all his beating and danger to his life it is cause entairely by you And she spoke with more real virulence than that kind of upbraiding generally exhibits The beast exclaimed missus Rusk when she I and Mary Quince were in my room together with all her crying and praying I d like to know as much as she does maybe about them rascals There never was sich like about the place long as I remember it till she came to Knowl old witch with them unmerciful big bones of hers and her great bald head grinning here and crying there and her nose everywhere The old French hypocrite Mary Quince threw in an observation and I believe missus Rusk rejoined but I heard neither For whether the housekeeper spoke with reflection or not what she said affected me strangely Through the smallest aperture for a moment I had had a peep into Pandemonium Were not peculiarities of Madame s demeanour and advice during the adventure partly accounted for by the suggestion Could the proposed excursion to Church Scarsdale have had any purpose of the same sort What was proposed How was Madame interested in it Were such immeasurable treason and hypocrisy possible I could not explain nor quite believe in the shapeless suspicion that with these light and bitter words of the old housekeeper had stolen so horribly into my mind After missus Rusk was gone I awoke from my dismal abstraction with something like a moan and a shudder with a dreadful sense of danger Oh Mary Quince I cried do you think she really knew Who Miss Maud Do you think Madame knew of those dreadful people Oh no say you don t you don t believe it tell me she did not I m distracted Mary Quince I m frightened out of my life There now Miss Maud dear there now don t take on so why should she no sich a thing missus Rusk law bless you she s no more meaning in what she says than the child unborn But I was really frightened I was in a horrible state of uncertainty as to Madame de la Rougierre s complicity with the party who had beset us at the warren and afterwards so murderously beat our poor gamekeeper How was I ever to get rid of that horrible woman How long was she to enjoy her continual opportunities of affrighting and injuring me She hates me she hates me Mary Quince and she will never stop until she has done me some dreadful injury Oh will no one relieve me will no one take her away Oh papa papa papa you will be sorry when it is too late I was crying and wringing my hands and turning from side to side at my wits ends and honest Mary Quince in vain endevoured to quiet and comfort me CHAPTER XVIII A MIDNIGHT VISITOR The frightful warnings of Lady Knollys haunted me too Was there no escape from the dreadful companion whom fate had assigned me I made up my mind again and again to speak to my father and urge her removal In other things he indulged me here however he met me drily and sternly and it was plain that he fancied I was under my cousin Monica s influence and also that he had secret reasons for persisting in an opposite course Just then I had a gay odd letter from Lady Knollys from some country house in Shropshire Not a word about Captain Oakley My eye skimmed its pages in search of that charmed name With a peevish feeling I tossed the sheet upon the table Inwardly I thought how ill natured and unwomanly it was After a time however I read it and found the letter very good natured She had received a note from papa He had had the impudence to forgive her for his impertinence But for my sake she meant notwithstanding this aggravation really to pardon him and whenever she had a disengaged week to accept his invitation to Knowl from whence she was resolved to whisk me off to London where though I was too young to be presented at Court and come out I might yet besides having the best masters and a good excuse for getting rid of Medusa see a great deal that would amuse and surprise me Great news I suppose from Lady Knollys said Madame who always knew who in the house received letters by the post and by an intuition from whom they came Two letters you and your papa She is quite well I hope Quite well thank you Madame Some fishing questions dropped from time to time fared no better And as usual when she was foiled even in a trifle she became sullen and malignant That night when my father and I were alone he suddenly closed the book he had been reading and said I heard from Monica Knollys to day I always liked poor Monnie and though she s no witch and very wrong headed at times yet now and then she does say a thing that s worth weighing Did she ever talk to you of a time Maud when you are to be your own mistress No I answered a little puzzled and looking straight in his rugged kindly face Well I thought she might she s a rattle you know always was a rattle and that sort of people say whatever comes uppermost But that s a subject for me and more than once Maud it has puzzled me He sighed Come with me to the study little Maud So he carrying a candle we crossed the lobby and marched together through the passage which at night always seemed a little awesome darkly wainscoted uncheered by the cross light from the hall which was lost at the turn leading us away from the frequented parts of the house to that misshapen and lonely room about which the traditions of the nursery and the servants hall had had so many fearful stories to recount I think my father had intended making some disclosure to me on reaching this room If so he changed his mind or at least postponed his intention He had paused before the cabinet respecting the key of which he had given me so strict a charge and I think he was going to explain himself more fully than he had done But he went on instead to the table where his desk always jealously locked was placed and having lighted the candles which stood by it he glanced at me and said You must wait a little Maud I shall have something to say to you Take this candle and amuse yourself with a book meanwhile I was accustomed to obey in silence I chose a volume of engravings and ensconced myself in a favourite nook in which I had often passed a half hour similarly This was a deep recess by the fireplace fenced on the other side by a great old escritoir Into this I drew a stool and with candle and book I placed myself snugly in the narrow chamber Every now and then I raised my eyes and saw my father either writing or ruminating as it seemed to me very anxiously at his desk Time wore on a longer time than he had intended and still he continued absorbed at his desk Gradually I grew sleepy and as I nodded the book and room faded away and pleasant little dreams began to gather round me and so I went off into a deep slumber It must have lasted long for when I wakened my candle had burnt out my father having quite forgotten me was gone and the room was dark and deserted I felt cold and a little stiff and for some seconds did not know where I was I had been wakened I suppose by a sound which I now distinctly heard to my great terror approaching There was a rustling there was a breathing I heard a creaking upon the plank that always creaked when walked upon in the passage I held my breath and listened and coiled myself up in the innermost recess of my little chamber Sudden and sharp a light shone in from the nearly closed study door It shone angularly on the ceiling like a letter L reversed There was a pause Then some one knocked softly at the door which after another pause was slowly pushed open I expected I think to see the dreaded figure of the linkman I was scarcely less frightened to see that of Madame de la Rougierre She was dressed in a sort of grey silk which she called her Chinese silk precisely as she had been in the daytime In fact I do not think she had undressed She had no shoes on Otherwise her toilet was deficient in nothing Her wide mouth was grimly closed and she stood scowling into the room with a searching and pallid scrutiny the candle held high above her head at the full stretch of her arm Placed as I was in a deep recess and in a seat hardly raised above the level of the floor I escaped her although it seemed to me for some seconds as I gazed on this spectre that our eyes actually met I sat without breathing or winking staring upon the formidable image which with upstretched arm and the sharp lights and hard shadows thrown upon her corrugated features looked like a sorceress watching for the effect of a spell She was plainly listening intensely Unconsciously she had drawn her lower lip altogether between her teeth and I well remember what a deathlike and idiotic look the contortion gave her My terror lest she should discover me amounted to positive agony She rolled her eyes stealthily from corner to corner of the room and listened with her neck awry at the door Then to my father s desk she went To my great relief her back was towards me She stooped over it with the candle close by I saw her try a key it could be nothing else and I heard her blow through the wards to clear them Then again she listened at the door candle in hand and then with long tiptoe steps came back and papa s desk in another moment was open and Madame cautiously turning over the papers it contained Twice or thrice she paused glided to the door and listened again intently with her head near the ground and then returned and continued her search peeping into papers one after another tolerably methodically and reading some quite through While this felonious business was going on I was freezing with fear lest she should accidentally look round and her eyes light on me for I could not say what she might not do rather than have her crime discovered Sometimes she would read a paper twice over sometimes a whisper no louder than the ticking of a watch sometimes a brief chuckle under her breath bespoke the interest with which here and there a letter or a memorandum was read For about half an hour I think this went on but at the time it seemed to me all but interminable On a sudden she raised her head and listened for a moment replaced the papers deftly closed the desk without noise except for the tiny click of the lock extinguished the candle and rustled stealthily out of the room leaving in the darkness the malign and hag like face on which the candle had just shone still floating filmy in the dark Why did I remain silent and motionless while such an outrage was being committed If instead of being a very nervous girl preoccupied with an undefinable terror of that wicked woman I had possessed courage and presence of mind I dare say I might have given an alarm and escaped from the room without the slightest risk But so it was I could no more stir than the bird who cowering under its ivy sees the white owl sailing back and forward under its predatory cruise Not only during her presence but for more than an hour after I remained cowering in my hiding place and afraid to stir lest she might either be lurking in the neighborhood or return and surprise me You will not be astonished that after a night so passed I was ill and feverish in the morning To my horror Madame de la Rougierre came to visit me at my bedside Not a trace of guilty consciousness of what had passed during the night was legible in her face She had no sign of late watching and her toilet was exemplary As she sat smiling by me full of anxious and affectionate enquiry and smoothed the coverlet with her great felonious hand I could quite comprehend the dreadful feeling with which the deceived husband in the Arabian Nights met his ghoul wife after his nocturnal discovery Ill as I was I got up and found my father in that room which adjoined his bedchamber He perceived I am sure by my looks that something unusual had happened I shut the door and came close beside his chair Oh papa I have such a thing to tell you I forgot to call him Sir A secret and you won t say who told you Will you come down to the study He looked hard at me got up and kissing my forehead said Don t be frightened Maud I venture to say it is a mare s nest at all events my child we will take care that no danger reaches you come child And by the hand he led me to the study When the door was shut and we had reached the far end of the room next the window I said but in a low tone and holding his arm fast Oh sir you don t know what a dreadful person we have living with us Madame de la Rougierre I mean Don t let her in if she comes she would guess what I am telling you and one way or another I am sure she would kill me Tut tut child You must know that s nonsense he said looking pale and stern Oh no papa I am horribly frightened and Lady Knollys thinks so too Ha I dare say one fool makes many We all know what Monica thinks But I saw it papa She stole your key last night and opened your desk and read all your papers Stole my key said my father staring at me perplexed but at the same instant producing it Stole it Why here it is She unlocked your desk she read your papers for ever so long Open it now and see whether they have not been stirred He looked at me this time in silence with a puzzled air but he did unlock the desk and lifted the papers curiously and suspiciously As he did so he uttered a few of those inarticulate interjections which are made with closed lips and not always intelligible but he made no remark Then he placed me on a chair beside him and sitting down himself told me to recollect myself and tell him distinctly all I had seen This accordingly I did he listening with deep attention Did she remove any paper asked my father at the same time making a little search I suppose for that which he fancied might have been stolen No I did not see her take anything Well you are a good girl Maud Act discreetly Say nothing to anyone not even to your cousin Monica Directions which coming from another person would have had no great weight were spoken by my father with an earnest look and a weight of emphasis that made them irresistibly impressive and I went away with the seal of silence upon my lips Sit down Maud there You have not been very happy with Madame de la Rougierre It is time you were relieved This occurrence decides it He rang the bell Tell Madame de la Rougierre that I request the honour of seeing her for a few minutes here My father s communications to her were always equally ceremonious In a few minutes there was a knock at the door and the same figure smiling courtesying that had scared me on the threshold last night like the spirit of evil presented itself My father rose and Madame having at his request taken a chair opposite looking as usual in his presence all amiability he proceeded at once to the point Madame de la Rougierre I have to request you that you will give me the key now in your possession which unlocks this desk of mine With which termination he tapped his gold pencil case suddenly on it Madame who had expected something very different became instantly so pale with a dull purplish hue upon her forehead that especially when she had twice essayed with her white lips in vain to answer I expected to see her fall in a fit She was not looking in his face her eyes were fixed lower and her mouth and cheek sucked in with a strange distortion at one side She stood up suddenly and staring straight in his face she succeeded in saying after twice clearing her throat I cannot comprehend Monsieur Ruthyn unless you intend to insult me It won t do Madame I must have that false key I give you the opportunity of surrendering it quietly here and now But who dares to say I possess such thing demanded Madame who having rallied from her momentary paralysis was now fierce and voluble as I had often seen her before You know Madame that you can rely on what I say and I tell you that you were seen last night visiting this room and with a key in your possession opening this desk and reading my letters and papers contained in it Unless you forthwith give me that key and any other false keys in your possession in which case I shall rest content with dismissing you summarily I will take a different course You know I am a magistrate and I shall have you your boxes and places up stairs searched forthwith and I will prosecute you criminally The thing is clear you aggravate by denying you must give me that key if you please instantly otherwise I ring this bell and you shall see that I mean what I say There was a little pause He rose and extended his hand towards the bell rope Madame glided round the table extended her hand to arrest his I will do everything Monsieur Ruthyn whatever you wish And with these words Madame de la Rougierre broke down altogether She sobbed she wept she gabbled piteously all manner of incomprehensible roulades of lamentation and entreaty coyly penitently in a most interesting agitation she produced the very key from her breast with a string tied to it My father was little moved by this piteous tempest He coolly took the key and tried it in the desk which it locked and unlocked quite freely though the wards were complicated He shook his head and looked her in the face Pray who made this key It is a new one and made expressly to pick this lock But Madame was not going to tell any more than she had expressly bargained for so she only fell once more into her old paroxysm of sorrow self reproach extenuation and entreaty Well said my father I promised that on surrendering the key you should go It is enough I keep my word You shall have an hour and a half to prepare in You must then be ready to depart I will send your money to you by missus Rusk and if you look for another situation you had better not refer to me Now be so good as to leave me Madame seemed to be in a strange perplexity She bridled up dried her eyes fiercely and dropped a great courtesy and then sailed away towards the door Before reaching it she stopped on the way turning half round with a peaked pallid glance at my father and she bit her lip viciously as she eyed him At the door the same repulsive pantomime was repeated as she stood for a moment with her hand upon the handle But she changed her bearing again with a sniff and with a look of scorn almost heightened to a sneer she made another very low courtesy and a disdainful toss of her head and so disappeared shutting the door rather sharply behind her CHAPTER XIX AU REVOIR missus Rusk was fond of assuring me that Madame did not like a bone in my skin Instinctively I knew that she bore me no good will although I really believe it was her wish to make me think quite the reverse At all events I had no desire to see Madame again before her departure especially as she had thrown upon me one momentary glance in the study which seemed to me charged with very peculiar feelings You may be very sure therefore that I had no desire for a formal leave taking at her departure I took my hat and cloak therefore and stole out quietly My ramble was a sequestered one and well screened even at this late season with foliage the pathway devious among the stems of old trees and its flooring interlaced and groined with their knotted roots Though near the house it was a sylvan solitude a little brook ran darkling and glimmering through it wild strawberries and other woodland plants strewed the ground and the sweet notes and flutter of small birds made the shadow of the boughs cheery I had been fully an hour in this picturesque solitude when I heard in the distance the ring of carriage wheels announcing to me that Madame de la Rougierre had fairly set out upon her travels I thanked heaven I could have danced and sung with delight I heaved a great sigh and looked up through the branches to the clear blue sky But things are oddly timed Just at this moment I heard Madame s voice close at my ear and her large bony hand was laid on my shoulder We were instantly face to face I recoiling and for a moment speechless with fright In very early youth we do not appreciate the restraints which act upon malignity or know how effectually fear protects us where conscience is wanting Quite alone in this solitary spot detected and overtaken with an awful instinct by my enemy what might not be about to happen to me at that moment Frightened as usual Maud she said quietly and eyeing me with a sinister smile and with cause you think no doubt Wat av you done to injure poor Madame Well I think I know little girl and have quite discover the cleverness of my sweet little Maud Eh is not so Petite carogne ah ha ha I was too much confounded to answer You see my dear cheaile she said shaking her uplifted finger with a hideous archness at me you could not hide what you av done from poor Madame You cannot look so innocent but I can see your pretty little villany quite plain you dear little diablesse Wat I av done I av no reproach of myself for it If I could explain your papa would say I av done right and you should thank me on your knees but I cannot explain yet She was speaking as it were in little paragraphs with a momentary pause between each to allow its meaning to impress itself If I were to choose to explain your papa he would implore me to remain But no I would not notwithstanding your so cheerful house your charming servants your papa s amusing society and your affectionate and sincere heart my sweet little maraude I am to go to London first where I av oh so good friends next I will go abroad for some time but be sure my sweetest Maud wherever I may appen to be I will remember you ah ha Yes most certainly I will remember you And although I shall not be always near yet I shall know everything about my charming little Maud you will not know how but I shall indeed everything And be sure my dearest cheaile I will some time be able to give you the sensible proofs of my gratitude and affection you understand The carriage is waiting at the yew tree stile and I must go on You did not expect to see me here I will appear perhaps as suddenly another time It is great pleasure to us both this opportunity to make our adieux Farewell my dearest little Maud I will never cease to think of you and of some way to recompense the kindness you av shown for poor Madame My hand hung by my side and she took not it but my thumb and shook it folded in her broad palm and looking on me as she held it as if meditating mischief Then suddenly she said You will always remember Madame I think and I will remind you of me beside and for the present farewell and I hope you may be as appy as you deserve The large sinister face looked on me for a second with its latent sneer and then with a sharp nod and a spasmodic shake of my imprisoned thumb she turned and holding her dress together and showing her great bony ankles she strode rapidly away over the gnarled roots into the perspective of the trees and I did not awake as it were until she had quite disappeared in the distance Events of this kind made no difference with my father but every other face in Knowl was gladdened by the removal My energies had returned my spirits were come again The sunlight was happy the flowers innocent the songs and flutter of the birds once more gay and all nature delightful and rejoicing After the first elation of relief now and then a filmy shadow of Madame de la Rougierre would glide across the sunlight and the remembrance of her menace return with an unexpected pang of fear Well if there isn t impittens cried missus Rusk But never you trouble your head about it Miss Them sort s all alike you never saw a rogue yet that was found out and didn t threaten the honest folk as he was leaving behind with all sorts there was Martin the gamekeeper and Jervis the footman I mind well how hard they swore all they would not do when they was a going and who ever heard of them since They always threatens that way them sort always does and none ever the worse not but she would if she could mind ye but there it is she can t do nothing but bite her nails and cuss us not she ha ha ha So I was comforted But Madame s evil smile nevertheless from time to time would sail across my vision with a silent menace and my spirits sank and a Fate draped in black whose face I could not see took me by the hand and led me away in the spirit silently on an awful exploration from which I would rouse myself with a start and Madame was gone for a while She had however judged her little parting well She contrived to leave her glamour over me and in my dreams she troubled me I was however indescribably relieved I wrote in high spirits to Cousin Monica and wondered what plans my father might have formed about me and whether we were to stay at home or go to London or go abroad Of the last the pleasantest arrangement in some respects I had nevertheless an occult horror A secret conviction haunted me that were we to go abroad we should there meet Madame which to me was like meeting my evil genius I have said more than once that my father was an odd man and the reader will by this time have seen that there was much about him not easily understood I often wonder whether if he had been franker I should have found him less odd than I supposed or more odd still Things that moved me profoundly did not apparently affect him at all The departure of Madame under the circumstances which attended it appeared to my childish mind an event of the vastest importance No one was indifferent to the occurrence in the house but its master He never alluded again to Madame de la Rougierre But whether connected with her exposure and dismissal I could not say there did appear to be some new care or trouble now at work in my father s mind I have been thinking a great deal about you Maud I am anxious I have not been so troubled for years Why has not Monica Knollys a little more sense This oracular sentence he spoke having stopped me in the hall and then saying We shall see he left me as abruptly as he appeared Did he apprehend any danger to me from the vindictiveness of Madame A day or two afterwards as I was in the Dutch garden I saw him on the terrace steps He beckoned to me and came to meet me as I approached You must be very solitary little Maud it is not good I have written to Monica in a matter of detail she is competent to advise perhaps she will come here for a short visit I was very glad to hear this You are more interested than for my time I can be in vindicating his character Whose character sir I ventured to enquire during the pause that followed One trick which my father had acquired from his habits of solitude and silence was this of assuming that the context of his thoughts was legible to others forgetting that they had not been spoken Whose your uncle Silas s In the course of nature he must survive me He will then represent the family name Would you make some sacrifice to clear that name Maud I answered briefly but my face I believe showed my enthusiasm He turned on me such an approving smile as you might fancy lighting up the rugged features of a pale old Rembrandt I can tell you Maud if my life could have done it it should not have been undone ubi lapsus quid feci But I had almost made up my mind to change my plan and leave all to time edax rerum to illuminate or to consume But I think little Maud would like to contribute to the restitution of her family name It may cost you something are you willing to buy it at a sacrifice Is there I don t speak of fortune that is not involved but is there any other honourable sacrifice you would shrink from to dispel the disgrace under which our most ancient and honourable name must otherwise continue to languish Oh none none indeed sir I am delighted Again I saw the Rembrandt smile Well Maud I am sure there is no risk but you are to suppose there is Are you still willing to accept it Again I assented You are worthy of your blood Maud Ruthyn It will come soon and it won t last long But you must not let people like Monica Knollys frighten you I was lost in wonder If you allow them to possess you with their follies you had better recede in time they may make the ordeal as terrible as hell itself You have zeal have you nerve I thought in such a cause I had nerve for anything Well Maud in the course of a few months and it may be sooner there must be a change I have had a letter from London this morning that assures me of that I must then leave you for a time in my absence be faithful to the duties that will arise To whom much is committed of him will much be required You shall promise me not to mention this conversation to Monica Knollys If you are a talking girl and cannot trust yourself say so and we will not ask her to come Also don t invite her to talk about your uncle Silas I have reasons Do you quite understand my conditions Yes sir Your uncle Silas he said speaking suddenly in loud and fierce tones that sounded from so old a man almost terrible lies under an intolerable slander I don t correspond with him I don t sympathise with him I never quite did He has grown religious and that s well but there are things in which even religion should not bring a man to acquiesce and from what I can learn he the person primarily affected the cause though the innocent cause of this great calamity bears it with an easy apathy which is mistaken and liable easily to be mistaken and such as no Ruthyn under the circumstances ought to exhibit I told him what he ought to do and offered to open my purse for the purpose but he would not or did not indeed he never took my advice he followed his own and a foul and dismal shoal he has drifted on It is not for his sake why should I that I have longed and laboured to remove the disgraceful slur under which his ill fortune has thrown us He troubles himself little about it I believe he s meek meeker than I He cares less about his children than I about you Maud he is selfishly sunk in futurity a feeble visionary I am not so I believe it to be a duty to take care of others beside myself The character and influence of an ancient family is a peculiar heritage sacred but destructible and woe to him who either destroys or suffers it to perish This was the longest speech I ever heard my father speak before or after He abruptly resumed Yes we will Maud you and I we ll leave one proof on record which fairly read will go far to convince the world He looked round but we were alone The garden was nearly always solitary and few visitors ever approached the house from that side I have talked too long I believe we are children to the last Leave me Maud I think I know you better than I did and I am pleased with you Go child I ll sit here If he had acquired new ideas of me so had I of him from that interview I had no idea till then how much passion still burned in that aged frame nor how full of energy and fire that face generally so stern and ashen could appear As I left him seated on the rustic chair by the steps the traces of that storm were still discernible on his features His gathered brows glowing eyes and strangely hectic face and the grim compression of his mouth still showed the agitation which somehow in grey old age shocks and alarms the young CHAPTER XX AUSTIN RUTHYN SETS OUT ON HIS JOURNEY The reverend William Fairfield Doctor Clay s somewhat bald curate a mild thin man with a high and thin nose who was preparing me for confirmation came next day and when our catechetical conference was ended and before lunch was announced my father sent for him to the study where he remained until the bell rang out its summons We have had some interesting I may say very interesting conversation your papa and I Miss Ruthyn said my reverend vis a vis so soon as nature was refreshed smiling and shining as he leaned back in his chair his hand upon the table and his finger curled gently upon the stem of his wine glass It never was your privilege I believe to see your uncle mister Silas Ruthyn of Bartram Haugh No never he leads so retired so very retired a life Oh no of course no but I was going to remark a likeness I mean of course a family likeness only that sort of thing you understand between him and the profile of Lady Margaret in the drawing room is not it Lady Margaret which you were so good as to show me on Wednesday last There certainly is a likeness I think you would agree with me if you had the pleasure of seeing your uncle You know him then I have never seen him Oh dear yes I am happy to say I know him very well I have that privilege I was for three years curate of Feltram and I had the honour of being a pretty constant visitor at Bartram Haugh during that I may say protracted period and I think it really never has been my privilege and happiness I may say to enjoy the acquaintance and society of so very experienced a Christian as my admirable friend I may call him mister Ruthyn of Bartram Haugh I look upon him I do assure you quite in the light of a saint not of course in the Popish sense but in the very highest you will understand me which our Church allows a man built up in faith full of faith faith and grace altogether exemplary and I often ventured to regret Miss Ruthyn that Providence in its mysterious dispensations should have placed him so far apart from his brother your respected father His influence and opportunities would no doubt we may venture to hope at least have been blessed and perhaps we my valued rector and I might possibly have seen more of him at church than I deeply regret we have done He shook his head a little as he smiled with a sad complacency on me through his blue steel spectacles and then sipped a little meditative sherry And you saw a good deal of my uncle Well a good deal Miss Ruthyn I may say a good deal principally at his own house His health is wretched miserable health a sadly afflicted man he has been as no doubt you are aware But afflictions my dear Miss Ruthyn as you remember Doctor Clay so well remarked on Sunday last though birds of ill omen yet spiritually resemble the ravens who supplied the prophet and when they visit the faithful come charged with nourishment for the soul He is a good deal embarrassed pecuniarily I should say continued the curate who was rather a good man than a very well bred one He found a difficulty in fact it was not in his power to subscribe generally to our little funds and and objects and I used to say to him and I really felt it that it was more gratifying such were his feeling and his power of expression to be refused by him than assisted by others Did papa wish you to speak to me about my uncle I enquired as a sudden thought struck me and then I felt half ashamed of my question He looked surprised No Miss Ruthyn certainly not Oh dear no It was merely a conversation between mister Ruthyn and me He never suggested my opening that or indeed any other point in my interview with you Miss Ruthyn not the least I was not aware before that Uncle Silas was so religious He smiled tranquilly not quite up to the ceiling but gently upward and shook his head in pity for my previous ignorance as he lowered his eyes I don t say that there may not be some little matters in a few points of doctrine which we could perhaps wish otherwise But these you know are speculative and in all essentials he is Church not in the perverted modern sense far from it unexceptionably Church strictly so Would there were more among us of the same mind that is in him Ay Miss Ruthyn even in the highest places of the Church herself The reverend William Fairfield while fighting against the Dissenters with his right hand was with his left hotly engaged with the Tractarians A good man I am sure he was and I dare say sound in doctrine though naturally I think not very wise This conversation with him gave me new ideas about my uncle Silas It quite agreed with what my father had said These principles and his increasing years would necessarily quiet the turbulence of his resistance to injustice and teach him to acquiesce in his fate You would have fancied that one so young as I born to wealth so vast and living a life of such entire seclusion would have been exempt from care But you have seen how troubled my life was with fear and anxiety during the residence of Madame de la Rougierre and now there rested upon my mind a vague and awful anticipation of the trial which my father had announced without defining it An ordeal he called it requiring not only zeal but nerve which might possibly were my courage to fail become frightful and even intolerable What and of what nature could it be Not designed to vindicate the fair fame of the meek and submissive old man who it seemed had ceased to care for his bygone wrongs and was looking to futurity but the reputation of our ancient family Sometimes I repented my temerity in having undertaken it I distrusted my courage Had I not better retreat while it was yet time But there was shame and even difficulty in the thought How should I appear before my father Was it not important had I not deliberately undertaken it and was I not bound in conscience Perhaps he had already taken steps in the matter which committed him Besides was I sure that even were I free again I would not once more devote myself to the trial be it what it might You perceive I had more spirit than courage I think I had the mental attributes of courage but then I was but a hysterical girl and in so far neither more nor less than a coward No wonder I distrusted myself no wonder also my will stood out against my timidity It was a struggle then a proud wild resolve against constitutional cowardice Those who have ever had cast upon them more than their strength seemed framed to bear the weak the aspiring the adventurous and self sacrificing in will and the faltering in nerve will understand the kind of agony which I sometimes endured But again consolation would come and it seemed to me that I must be exaggerating my risk in the coming crisis and certain at least if my father believed it attended with real peril he would never have wished to see me involved in it But the silence under which I was bound was terrifying double so when the danger was so shapeless and undivulged I was soon to understand it all soon too to know all about my father s impending journey whither with what visitor and why guarded from me with so awful a mystery That day there came a lively and goodnatured letter from Lady Knollys She was to arrive at Knowl in two or three days time I thought my father would have been pleased but he seemed apathetic and dejected One does not always feel quite equal to Monica But for you yes thank God I wish she could only stay Maud for a month or two I may be going then and would be glad provided she talks about suitable things very glad Maud to leave her with you for a week or so There was something I thought agitating my father secretly that day He had the strange hectic flush I had observed when he grew excited in our interview in the garden about Uncle Silas There was something painful perhaps even terrible in the circumstances of the journey he was about to make and from my heart I wished the suspense were over the annoyance past and he returned That night my father bid me good night early and went upstairs After I had been in bed some little time I heard his hand bell ring This was not usual Shortly after I heard his man Ridley talking with missus Rusk in the gallery I could not be mistaken in their voices I knew not why I was startled and excited and had raised myself to listen on my elbow But they were talking quietly like persons giving or taking an ordinary direction and not in the haste of an unusual emergency Then I heard the man bid missus Rusk good night and walk down the gallery to the stairs so that I concluded he was wanted no more and all must therefore be well So I laid myself down again though with a throbbing at my heart and an ominous feeling of expectation listening and fancying footsteps I was going to sleep when I heard the bell ring again and in a few minutes missus Rusk s energetic step passed along the gallery and listening intently I heard or fancied my father s voice and hers in dialogue All this was very unusual and again I was with a beating heart leaning with my elbow on my pillow missus Rusk came along the gallery in a minute or so after and stopping at my door began to open it gently I was startled and challenged my visitor with Who s there It s only Rusk Miss Dearie me and are you awake still Is papa ill Ill not a bit ill thank God Only there s a little black book as I took for your prayer book and brought in here ay here it is sure enough and he wants it And then I must go down to the study and look out this one C fifteen but I can t read the name noways and I was afraid to ask him again if you be so kind to read it Miss I suspeck my eyes is a going I read the name and missus Rusk was tolerably expert at finding out books as she had often been employed in that way before So she departed I suppose that this particular volume was hard to find for she must have been a long time away and I had actually fallen into a doze when I was roused in an instant by a dreadful crash and a piercing scream from missus Rusk Scream followed scream wilder and more terror stricken I shrieked to Mary Quince who was sleeping in the room with me Mary do you hear what is it It is something dreadful The crash was so tremendous that the solid flooring even of my room trembled under it and to me it seemed as if some heavy man had burst through the top of the window and shook the whole house with his descent I found myself standing at my own door crying Help help murder murder and Mary Quince frightened half out of her wits by my side I could not think what was going on It was plainly something most horrible for missus Rusk s screams pealed one after the other unabated though with a muffled sound as if the door was shut upon her and by this time the bells of my father s room were ringing madly They are trying to murder him I cried and I ran along the gallery to his door followed by Mary Quince whose white face I shall never forget though her entreaties only sounded like unmeaning noises in my ears Here help help help I cried trying to force open the door Shove it shove it for God s sake he s across it cried missus Rusk s voice from within drive it in I can t move him I strained all I could at the door but ineffectually We heard steps approaching The men were running to the spot and shouting as they did so Never mind hold on a bit here we are all right and the like We drew back as they came up We were in no condition to be seen We listened however at my open door Then came the straining and bumping at the door missus Rusk s voice subsided to a sort of wailing the men were talking all together and I suppose the door opened for I heard some of the voices on a sudden as if in the room and then came a strange lull and talking in very low tones and not much even of that What is it Mary what can it be I ejaculated not knowing what horror to suppose And now with a counterpane about my shoulders I called loudly and imploringly in my horror to know what had happened But I heard only the subdued and eager talk of men engaged in some absorbing task and the dull sounds of some heavy body being moved missus Rusk came towards us looking half wild and pale as a spectre and putting her thin hands to my shoulders she said Now Miss Maud darling you must go back again tisn t no place for you you ll see all my darling time enough you will There now there like a dear do get into your room What was that dreadful sound Who had entered my father s chamber It was the visitor whom we had so long expected with whom he was to make the unknown journey leaving me alone The intruder was Death CHAPTER XXI ARRIVALS My father was dead as suddenly as if he had been murdered One of those fearful aneurisms that lie close to the heart showing no outward sign of giving way in a moment had been detected a good time since by doctor Bryerly My father knew what must happen and that it could not be long deferred He feared to tell me that he was soon to die He hinted it only in the allegory of his journey and left in that sad enigma some words of true consolation that remained with me ever after Under his rugged ways was hidden a wonderful tenderness I could not believe that he was actually dead Most people for a minute or two in the wild tumult of such a shock have experienced the same skepticism I insisted that the doctor should be instantly sent for from the village Well Miss Maud dear I will send to please you but it is all to no use If only you saw him yourself you d know that Mary Quince run you down and tell Thomas Miss Maud desires he ll go down this minute to the village for doctor Elweys Every minute of the interval seemed to me like an hour I don t know what I said but I fancied that if he were not already dead he would lose his life by the delay I suppose I was speaking very wildly for missus Rusk said My dear child you ought to come in and see him indeed but you should Miss Maud He s quite dead an hour ago You d wonder all the blood that s come from him you would indeed it s soaked through the bed already Oh don t don t don t missus Rusk Will you come in and see him just Oh no no no no Well then my dear don t of course if you don t like there s no need Would not you like to lie down Miss Maud Mary Quince attend to her I must go into the room for a minute or two I was walking up and down the room in distraction It was a cool night but I did not feel it I could only cry Oh Mary Mary what shall I do Oh Mary Quince what shall I do It seemed to me it must be near daylight by the time the Doctor arrived I had dressed myself I dared not go into the room where my beloved father lay I had gone out of my room to the gallery where I awaited doctor Elweys when I saw him walking briskly after the servant his coat buttoned up to his chin his hat in his hand and his bald head shining I felt myself grow cold as ice and colder and colder and with a sudden sten my heart seemed to stand still I heard him ask the maid who stood at the door in that low decisive mysterious tone which doctors cultivate In here And then with a nod I saw him enter Would not you like to see the Doctor Miss Maud asked Mary Quince The question roused me a little Thank you Mary yes I must see him And so in a few minutes I did He was very respectful very sad semi undertakerlike in air and countenance but quite explicit I heard that my dear father had died palpably from the rupture of some great vessel near the heart The disease had no doubt been long established and is in its nature incurable It is consolatory in these cases that in the act of dissolution which is instantaneous there can be no suffering These and a few more remarks were all he had to offer and having had his fee from missus Rusk he with a respectful melancholy vanished I returned to my room and broke into paroxysms of grief and after an hour or more grew more tranquil From missus Rusk I learned that he had seemed very well better than usual indeed that night and that on her return from the study with the book he required he was noting down after his wont some passages which illustrated the text on which he was employing himself He took the book detaining her in the room and then mounting on a chair to take down another book from a shelf he had fallen with the dreadful crash I had heard dead upon the floor He fell across the door which caused the difficulty in opening it missus Rusk found she had not strength to force it open No wonder she had given way to terror I think I should have almost lost my reason Everyone knows the reserved aspect and the taciturn mood of the house one of whose rooms is tenanted by that mysterious guest I do not know how those awful days and more awful nights passed over The remembrance is repulsive I hate to think of them I was soon draped in the conventional black with its heavy folds of crape Lady Knollys came and was very kind She undertook the direction of all those details which were to me so inexpressibly dreadful She wrote letters for me beside and was really most kind and useful and her society supported me indescribably She was odd but her eccentricity was leavened with strong common sense and I have often thought since with admiration and gratitude of the tact with which she managed my grief There is no dealing with great sorrow as if it were under the control of our wills It is a terrible phenomenon whose laws we must study and to whose conditions we must submit if we would mitigate it Cousin Monica talked a great deal of my father This was easy to her for her early recollections were full of him One of the terrible dislocations of our habits of mind respecting the dead is that our earthly future is robbed of them and we thrown exclusively upon retrospect From the long look forward they are removed and every plan imagination and hope henceforth a silent and empty perspective But in the past they are all they ever were Now let me advise all who would comfort people in a new bereavement to talk to them very freely all they can in this way of the dead They will engage in it with interest they will talk of their own recollections of the dead and listen to yours though they become sometimes pleasant sometimes even laughable I found it so It robbed the calamity of something of its supernatural and horrible abruptness it prevented that monotony of object which is to the mind what it is to the eye and prepared the faculty for those mesmeric illusions that derange its sense Cousin Monica I am sure cheered me wonderfully I grow to love her more and more as I think of all her trouble care and kindness I had not forgotten my promise to dear papa about the key concerning which he had evinced so great an anxiety It was found in the pocket where he had desired me to remember he always kept it except when it was placed while he slept under his pillow And so my dear that wicked woman was actually found picking the lock of your poor papa s desk I wonder he did not punish her you know that is burglary Well Lady Knollys you know she is gone and so I care no more about her that is I mean I need not fear her No my dear but you must call me Monica do you mind I m your cousin and you call me Monica unless you wish to vex me No of course you need not be afraid of her And she s gone But I m an old thing you know and not so tender hearted as you and I confess I should have been very glad to hear that the wicked old witch had been sent to prison and hard labour I should And what do you suppose she was looking for what did she want to steal I think I can guess what do you think To read the papers maybe to take bank notes I m not sure I answered Well I think most likely she wanted to get at your poor papa s will that s my idea There is nothing surprising in the supposition dear she resumed Did not you read the curious trial at York the other day There is nothing so valuable to steal as a will when a great deal of property is to be disposed of by it Why you would have given her ever so much money to get it back again Suppose you go down dear I ll go with you and open the cabinet in the study I don t think I can for I promised to give the key to doctor Bryerly and the meaning was that he only should open it Cousin Monica uttered an inarticulate H m of surprise or disapprobation Has he been written to No I do not know his address Not know his address come that is curious said Knollys a little testily I could not no one now living in the house could furnish even a conjecture There was even a dispute as to which train he had gone by north or south they crossed the station at an interval of five minutes If doctor Bryerly had been an evil spirit evoked by a secret incantation there could not have been more complete darkness as to the immediate process of his approach And how long do you mean to wait my dear No matter at all events you may open the desk you may find papers to direct you you may find doctor Bryerly s address you may find heaven knows what So down we went I assenting and we opened the desk How dreadful the desecration seems all privacy abrogated the shocking compensation for the silence of death Henceforward all is circumstantial evidence all conjectural except the litera scripta and to this evidence every note book and every scrap of paper and private letter must contribute ransacked bare in the light of day what it can At the top of the desk lay two notes sealed one to Cousin Monica the other to me Mine was a gentle and loving little farewell nothing more which opened afresh the fountains of my sorrow and I cried and sobbed over it bitterly and long The other was for Lady Knollys I did not see how she received it for I was already absorbed in mine But in awhile she came and kissed me in her girlish goodnatured way Her eyes used to fill with tears at sight of my paroxysms of grief Then she would begin I remember it was a saying of his and so she would repeat it something maybe wise maybe playful at all events consolatory and the circumstances in which she had heard him say it and then would follow the recollections suggested by these and so I was stolen away half by him and half by Cousin Monica from my despair and lamentation Along with these lay a large envelope inscribed with the words Directions to be complied with immediately on my death One of which was Let the event be forthwith published in the county and principal London papers This step had been already taken We found no record of doctor Bryerly s address We made search everywhere except in the cabinet which I would on no account permit to be opened except according to his direction by doctor Bryerly s hand But nowhere was a will or any document resembling one to be found I had now therefore no doubt that his will was placed in the cabinet In the search among my dear father s papers we found two sheafs of letters neatly tied up and labelled these were from my uncle Silas My cousin Monica looked down upon these papers with a strange smile was it satire was it that indescribable smile with which a mystery which covers a long reach of years is sometimes approached These were odd letters If here and there occurred passages that were querulous and even abject there were also long passages of manly and altogether noble sentiment and the strangest rodomontade and maunderings about religion Here and there a letter would gradually transform itself into a prayer and end with a doxology and no signature and some of them expressed such wild and disordered views respecting religion as I imagine he can never have disclosed to good mister Fairfield and which approached more nearly to the Swedenborg visions than to anything in the Church of England I read these with a solemn interest but my cousin Monica was not similarly moved She read them with the same smile faint serenely contemptuous I thought with which she had first looked down upon them It was the countenance of a person who amusedly traces the working of a character that is well understood Uncle Silas is very religious I said not quite liking Lady Knollys looks Very she said without raising her eyes or abating her old bitter smile as she glanced over a passage in one of his letters You don t think he is Cousin Monica said I She raised her head and looked straight at me Why do you say that Maud Because you smile incredulously I think over his letters Do I said she I was not thinking it was quite an accident The fact is Maud your poor papa quite mistook me I had no prejudice respecting him no theory I never knew what to think about him I do not think Silas a product of nature but a child of the Sphinx and I never could understand him that s all I always felt so too but that was because I was left to speculation and to glean conjectures as I might from his portrait or anywhere Except what you told me I never heard more than a few sentences poor papa did not like me to ask questions about him and I think he ordered the servants to be silent And much the same injunction this little note lays upon me not quite but something like it and I don t know the meaning of it And she looked enquiringly at me You are not to be alarmed about your uncle Silas because your being afraid would unfit you for an important service which you have undertaken for your family the nature of which I shall soon understand and which although it is quite passive would be made very sad if illusory fears were allowed to steal into your mind She was looking into the letter in poor papa s handwriting which she had found addressed to her in his desk and emphasised the words I suppose which she quoted from it Have you any idea Maud darling what this service may be she enquired with a grave and anxious curiosity in her countenance None Cousin Monica but I have thought long over my undertaking to do it or submit to it be it what it may and I will keep the promise I voluntarily made although I know what a coward I am and often distrust my courage Well I am not to frighten you How could you Why should I be afraid Is there anything frightful to be disclosed Do tell me you must tell me No darling I did not mean that I don t mean that I could if I would I I don t know exactly what I meant But your poor papa knew him better than I in fact I did not know him at all that is ever quite understood him which your poor papa I see had ample opportunities of doing And after a little pause she added So you do not know what you are expected to do or to undergo Oh Cousin Monica I know you think he committed that murder I cried starting up I don t know why and I felt that I grew deadly pale I don t believe any such thing you little fool you must not say such horrible things Maud she said rising also and looking both pale and angry Shall we go out for a little walk Come lock up these papers dear and get your things on and if that doctor Bryerly does not turn up to morrow you must send for the Rector good Doctor Clay and let him make search for the will there may be directions about many things you know and my dear Maud you are to remember that Silas is my cousin as well as your uncle Come dear put on your hat So we went out together for a little cloistered walk CHAPTER XXII SOMEBODY IN THE ROOM WITH THE COFFIN When we returned a young gentleman had arrived We saw him in the parlour as we passed the window It was simply a glance but such a one as suffices to make a photograph which we can study afterwards at our leisure I remember him at this moment a man of six and thirty dressed in a grey travelling suit not over well made light haired fat faced and clumsy and he looked both dull and cunning and not at all like a gentleman Branston met us announced the arrival and handed me the stranger s credentials My cousin and I stopped in the passage to read them That s your uncle Silas s said Lady Knollys touching one of the two letters with the tip of her finger Shall we have lunch Miss Certainly So Branston departed Read it with me Cousin Monica I said And a very curious letter it was It spoke as follows How can I thank my beloved niece for remembering her aged and forlorn kinsman at such a moment of anguish I had written a note of a few I dare say incoherent words by the next post after my dear father s death It is however in the hour of bereavement that we most value the ties that are broken and yearn for the sympathy of kindred Here came a little distich of French verse of which I could only read ciel and l amour Our quiet household here is clouded with a new sorrow How inscrutable are the ways of Providence I though a few years younger how much the more infirm how shattered in energy and in mind how mere a burden how entirely de trop am spared to my sad place in a world where I can be no longer useful where I have but one business prayer but one hope the tomb and he apparently so robust the centre of so much good so necessary to you so necessary alas to me is taken He is gone to his rest for us what remains but to bow our heads and murmur His will be done I trace these lines with a trembling hand while tears dim my old eyes I did not think that any earthly event could have moved me so profoundly From the world I have long stood aloof I once led a life of pleasure alas of wickedness as I now do one of austerity but as I never was rich so my worst enemy will allow I never was avaricious My sins I thank my Maker have been of a more reducible kind and have succumbed to the discipline which Heaven has provided To earth and its interests as well as to its pleasures I have long been dead For the few remaining years of my life I ask but quiet an exemption from the agitations and distractions of struggle and care and I trust to the Giver of all Good for my deliverance well knowing at the same time that whatever befalls will under His direction prove best Happy shall I be my dearest niece if in your most interesting and in some respects forlorn situation I can be of any use to you My present religious adviser of whom I ventured to ask counsel on your behalf states that I ought to send some one to represent me at the melancholy ceremony of reading the will which my beloved and now happy brother has no doubt left behind and the idea that the experience and professional knowledge possessed by the gentleman whom I have selected may possibly be of use to you my dearest niece determines me to place him at your disposal He is the junior partner in the firm of Archer and Sleigh who conduct any little business which I may have from time to time may I entreat your hospitality for him during a brief stay at Knowl I write even for a moment upon these small matters of business with an effort a painful one but necessary Alas my brother The cup of bitterness is now full Few and evil must the remainder of my old days be Yet while they last I remain always for my beloved niece that which all her wealth and splendour cannot purchase a loving and faithful kinsman and friend SILAS RUTHYN Is not it a kind letter I said while tears stood in my eyes Yes answered Lady Knollys drily But don t you think it so really Oh kind very kind she answered in the same tone and perhaps a little cunning Cunning how Well you know I m a peevish old Tabby and of course I scratch now and then and see in the dark I dare say Silas is sorry but I don t think he is in sackcloth and ashes He has reason to be sorry and anxious and I say I think he is both and you know he pities you very much and also himself a good deal and he wants money and you his beloved niece have a great deal and altogether it is an affectionate and prudent letter and he has sent his attorney here to make a note of the will and you are to give the gentleman his meals and lodging and Silas very thoughtfully invites you to confide your difficulties and troubles to his solicitor It is very kind but not imprudent Oh Cousin Monica don t you think at such a moment it is hardly natural that he should form such petty schemes even were he capable at other times of practising so low Is it not judging him hardly and you you know so little acquainted with him I told you dear I m a cross old thing and there s an end and I really don t care two pence about him and of the two I d much rather he were no relation of ours Now was not this prejudice I dare say in part it was So too was my vehement predisposition in his favour I am afraid we women are factionists we always take a side and nature has formed us for advocates rather than judges and I think the function if less dignified is more amiable I sat alone at the drawing room window at nightfall awaiting my cousin Monica s entrance Feverish and frightened I felt that night It was a sympathy I fancy with the weather The sun had set stormily Though the air was still the sky looked wild and storm swept The crowding clouds slanting in the attitude of flight reflected their own sacred aspect upon my spirits My grief darkened with a wild presaging of danger and a sense of the supernatural fell upon me It was the saddest and most awful evening that had come since my beloved father s death All kinds of shapeless fears environed me in silence For the first time dire misgivings about the form of faith affrighted me Who were these Swedenborgians who had got about him no one could tell how and held him so fast to the close of his life Who was this bilious bewigged black eyed Doctor Bryerly whom none of us quite liked and all a little feared who seemed to rise out of the ground and came and went no one knew whence or whither exercising as I imagined a mysterious authority over him Was it all good and true or a heresy and a witchcraft Oh my beloved father was it all well with you When Lady Knollys entered she found me in floods of tears walking distractedly up and down the room She kissed me in silence she walked back and forward with me and did her best to console me I think Cousin Monica I would wish to see him once more Shall we go up Unless you really wish it very much I think darling you had better not mind it It is happier to recollect them as they were there s a change you know darling and there is seldom any comfort in the sight But I do wish it very much Oh won t you come with me And so I persuaded her and up we went hand in hand in the deepening twilight and we halted at the end of the dark gallery and I called missus Rusk growing frightened Tell her to let us in Cousin Monica I whispered She wishes to see him my lady does she enquired missus Rusk in an under tone and with a mysterious glance at me as she softly fitted the key to the lock Are you quite sure Maud dear Yes yes But when missus Rusk entered bearing the candle whose beam mixed dismally with the expiring twilight disclosing a great black coffin standing upon trestles near the foot of which she took her stand gazing sternly into it I lost heart again altogether and drew back No missus Rusk she won t and I am very glad dear she added to me Come missus Rusk come away Yes darling she continued to me it is much better for you and she hurried me away and down stairs again But the awful outlines of that large black coffin remained upon my imagination with a new and terrible sense of death I had no more any wish to see him I felt a horror even of the room and for more than an hour after a kind of despair and terror such as I have never experienced before or since at the idea of death Cousin Monica had had her bed placed in my room and Mary Quince s moved to the dressing room adjoining it For the first time the superstitious awe that follows death but not immediately visited me The idea of seeing my father enter the room or open the door and look in haunted me After Lady Knollys and I were in bed I could not sleep The wind sounded mournfully outside and the small sounds the rattlings and strainings that responded from within constantly startled me and simulated the sounds of steps of doors opening of knockings and so forth rousing me with a palpitating heart as often as I fell into a doze At length the wind subsided and these ambiguous noises abated and I fatigued dropped into a quiet sleep I was awakened by a sound in the gallery which I could not define A considerable time had passed for the wind was now quite lulled I sat up in my bed a good deal scared listening breathlessly for I knew not what I heard a step moving stealthily along the gallery I called my cousin Monica softly and we both heard the door of the room in which my father s body lay unlocked some one furtively enter and the door shut What can it be Good Heavens Cousin Monica do you hear it Yes dear and it is two o clock Everyone at Knowl was in bed at eleven We knew very well that missus Rusk was rather nervous and would not for worlds go alone and at such an hour to the room We called Mary Quince We all three listened but we heard no other sound I set these things down here because they made so terrible an impression upon me at the time It ended by our peeping out all three in a body upon the gallery Through each window in the perspective came its blue sheet of moonshine but the door on which our attention was fixed was in the shade and we thought we could discern the glare of a candle through the key hole While in whispers we were debating this point together the door opened the dusky light of a candle emerged the shadow of a figure crossed it within and in another moment the mysterious Doctor Bryerly angular ungainly in the black cloth coat that fitted little better than a coffin issued from the chamber candle in hand murmuring I suppose a prayer it sounded like a farewell as much frightened as if I had just seen a sorcerer stealing stepped cautiously upon the gallery floor shutting and locking the door upon the dead and then having listened for a second the saturnine figure casting a gigantic and distorted shadow upon the ceiling and side wall from the lowered candle strode lightly down the long dark passage away from us I can only speak for myself and I can honestly say that I felt as much frightened as if I had just seen a sorcerer stealing from his unhallowed business I think Cousin Monica was also affected in the same way for she turned the key on the inside of the door when we entered I do not think one of us believed at the moment that what we had seen was a Doctor Bryerly of flesh and blood and yet the first thing we spoke of in the morning was Doctor Bryerly s arrival The mind is a different organ by night and by day CHAPTER XXIII I TALK WITH DOCTOR BRYERLY Doctor Bryerly had indeed arrived at half past twelve o clock at night His summons at the hall door was little heard at our remote side of the old house of Knowl and when the sleepy half dressed servant opened the door the lank Doctor in glossy black clothing was standing alone his portmanteau on its end upon the steps and his vehicle disappearing in the shadows of the old trees In he came sterner and sharper of aspect than usual I ve been expected I m Doctor Bryerly Haven t I So let whoever is in charge of the body be called I must visit it forthwith So the Doctor sat in the back drawing room with a solitary candle and missus Rusk was called up and grumbling much and very peevish dressed and went down her ill temper subsiding in a sort of fear as she approached the visitor How do you do Madam A sad visit this Is anyone watching in the room where the remains of your late master are laid No So much the better it is a foolish custom Will you please conduct me to the room I must pray where he lies no longer he And be good enough to show me my bedroom and so no one need wait up and I shall find my way Accompanied by the man who carried his valise missus Rusk showed him to his apartment but he only looked in and then glanced rapidly about to take the bearings of the door Thank you yes Now we ll proceed here along here Let me see A turn to the right and another to the left yes He has been dead some days Is he yet in his coffin Yes sir since yesterday afternoon missus Rusk was growing more and more afraid of this lean figure sheathed in shining black cloth whose eyes glittered with a horrible sort of cunning and whose long brown fingers groped before him as if indicating the way by guess But of course the lid s not on you ve not screwed him down hey No sir That s well I must look on the face as I pray He is in his place I here on earth He in the spirit I in the flesh The neutral ground lies there So are carried the vibrations and so the light of earth and heaven reflected back and forward apaugasma a wonderful though helpless engine the ladder of Jacob and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it Thanks I ll take the key Mysteries to those who will live altogether in houses of clay no mystery to such as will use their eyes and read what is revealed This candle it is the longer please no no need of a pair thanks just this to hold in my hand And remember all depends upon the willing mind Why do you look frightened Where is your faith Don t you know that spirits are about us at all times Why should you fear to be near the body The spirit is everything the flesh profiteth nothing Yes sir said missus Rusk making him a great courtesy in the threshold She was frightened by his eerie talk which grew she fancied more voluble and energetic as they approached the corpse Remember then that when you fancy yourself alone and wrapt in darkness you stand in fact in the centre of a theatre as wide as the starry floor of heaven with an audience whom no man can number beholding you under a flood of light Therefore though your body be in solitude and your mortal sense in darkness remember to walk as being in the light surrounded with a cloud of witnesses Thus walk and when the hour comes and you pass forth unprisoned from the tabernacle of the flesh although it still has its relations and its rights and saying this as he held the solitary candle aloft in the doorway he nodded towards the coffin whose large black form was faintly traceable against the shadows beyond you will rejoice and being clothed upon with your house from on high you will not be found naked On the other hand he that loveth corruption shall have enough thereof Think upon these things Good night And the Swedenborgian Doctor stepped into the room taking the candle with him and closed the door upon the shadowy still life there and on his own sharp and swarthy visage leaving missus Rusk in a sort of panic in the dark alone to find her way to her room the best way she could Early in the morning missus Rusk came to my room to tell me that Doctor Bryerly was in the parlour and begged to know whether I had not a message for him I was already dressed so though it was dreadful seeing a stranger in my then mood taking the key of the cabinet in my hand I followed missus Rusk downstairs Opening the parlour door she stepped in and with a little courtesy said Please sir the young mistress Miss Ruthyn Draped in black and very pale tall and slight the young mistress was and as I entered I heard a newspaper rustle and the sound of steps approaching to meet me Face to face we met near the door and without speaking I made him a deep courtesy He took my hand without the least indication on my part in his hard lean grasp and shook it kindly but familiarly peering with a stern sort of curiosity into my face as he continued to hold it His ill fitting glossy black cloth ungainly presence and sharp dark vulpine features had in them as I said before the vulgarity of a Glasgow artisan in his Sabbath suit I made an instantaneous motion to withdraw my hand but he held it firmly Though there was a grim sort of familiarity there was also decision shrewdness and above all kindness in his dark face a gleam on the whole of the masterly and the honest that along with a certain paleness betraying I thought restrained emotion indicated sympathy and invited confidence I hope Miss you are pretty well He pronounced pretty as it is spelt I have come in consequence of a solemn promise exacted more than a year since by your deceased father the late mister Austin Ruthyn of Knowl for whom I cherished a warm esteem being knit besides with him in spiritual bonds It has been a shock to you Miss It has indeed sir I ve a doctor s degree I have Doctor of Medicine Miss Like saint Luke preacher and doctor I was in business once but this is better As one footing fails the Lord provides another The stream of life is black and angry how so many of us get across without drowning I often wonder The best way is not to look too far before just from one stepping stone to another and though you may wet your feet He won t let you drown He has not allowed me And Doctor Bryerly held up his head and wagged it resolutely You are born to this world s wealth in its way a great blessing though a great trial Miss and a great trust but don t suppose you are destined to exemption from trouble on that account any more than poor Emmanuel Bryerly As the sparks fly upwards Miss Ruthyn Your cushioned carriage may overturn on the highroad as I may stumble and fall upon the footpath There are other troubles than debt and privation Who can tell how long health may last or when an accident may happen the brain what mortifications may await you in your own high sphere what unknown enemies may rise up in your path or what slanders may asperse your name ha ha It is a wonderful equilibrium a marvellous dispensation ha ha and he laughed with a shake of his head I thought a little sarcastically as if he was not sorry my money could not avail to buy immunity from the general curse But what money can t do prayer can bear that in mind Miss Ruthyn We can all pray and though thorns and snares and stones of fire lie strewn in our way we need not fear them He will give His angels charge over us and in their hands they will bear us up for He hears and sees everywhere and His angels are innumerable He was now speaking gently and solemnly and paused But another vein of thought he had unconsciously opened in my mind and I said And had my dear papa no other medical adviser He looked at me sharply and flushed a little under his dark tint His medical skill was perhaps the point on which his human vanity vaunted itself and I dare say there was something very disparaging in my tone And if he had no other he might have done worse I ve had many critical cases in my hands Miss Ruthyn I can t charge myself with any miscarriage through ignorance My diagnosis in mister Ruthyn s case has been verified by the result But I was not alone Sir Clayton Barrow saw him and took my view a note will reach him in London But this excuse me is not to the present purpose The late mister Ruthyn told me I was to receive a key from you which would open a cabinet where he had placed his will ha thanks in his study And I think as there may be directions about the funeral it had better be read forthwith Is there any gentleman a relative or man of business near here whom you would wish sent for No none thank you I have confidence in you sir I think I spoke and looked frankly for he smiled very kindly though with closed lips And you may be sure Miss Ruthyn your confidence shall not be disappointed Here was a long pause But you are very young and you must have some one by in your interest who has some experience in business Let me see Is not the Rector doctor Clay at hand In the town very good and mister Danvers who manages the estate he must come And get Grimston you see I know all the names Grimston the attorney for though he was not employed about this will he has been mister Ruthyn s solicitor a great many years we must have Grimston for as I suppose you know though it is a short will it is a very strange one I expostulated but you know he was very decided when he took a view He read it to you eh No sir Oh but he told you so much as relates to you and your uncle mister Silas Ruthyn of Bartram Haugh No indeed sir Ha I wish he had And with these words Doctor Bryerly s countenance darkened mister Silas Ruthyn is a religious man Oh very said I You ve seen a good deal of him No I never saw him I answered H m Odder and odder But he s a good man isn t he Very good indeed sir a very religious man Doctor Bryerly was watching my countenance as I spoke with a sharp and anxious eye and then he looked down and read the pattern of the carpet like bad news for a while and looking again in my face askance he said He was very near joining us on the point He got into correspondence with Henry Voerst one of our best men They call us Swedenborgians you know but I dare say that won t go much further now I suppose Miss Ruthyn one o clock would be a good hour and I am sure under the circumstances the gentlemen will make a point of attending Yes doctor Bryerly the notes shall be sent and my cousin Lady Knollys would I am sure attend with me while the will is being read there would be no objection to her presence None in the world I can t be quite sure who are joined with me as executors I m almost sorry I did not decline but it is too late regretting One thing you must believe Miss Ruthyn in framing the provisions of the will I was never consulted although I expostulated against the only very unusual one it contains when I heard it I did so strenuously but in vain There was one other against which I protested having a right to do so with better effect In no other way does the will in any respect owe anything to my advice or dissuasion You will please believe this also that I am your friend Yes indeed it is my duty The latter words he spoke looking down again as it were in soliloquy and thanking him I withdrew When I reached the hall I regretted that I had not asked him to state distinctly what arrangements the will made so nearly affecting as it seemed my relations with my uncle Silas and for a moment I thought of returning and requesting an explanation But then I bethought me it was not very long to wait till one o clock so he at least would think I went up stairs therefore to the school room which we used at present as a sitting room and there I found Cousin Monica awaiting me Are you quite well dear asked Lady Knollys as she came to meet and kiss me Quite well Cousin Monica No nonsense Maud you re as white as that handkerchief what s the matter Are you ill are you frightened Yes you re trembling you re terrified child I believe I am afraid There is something in poor papa s will about Uncle Silas about me I don t know Doctor Bryerly says and he seems so uncomfortable and frightened himself I am sure it is something very bad I am very much frightened I am I am Oh Cousin Monica you won t leave me So I threw my arms about her neck clasping her very close and we kissed one another I crying like a frightened child and indeed in experience of the world I was no more CHAPTER XXIV THE OPENING OF THE WILL Perhaps the terror with which I anticipated the hour of one and the disclosure of the unknown undertaking to which I had bound myself was irrational and morbid But honestly I doubt it my tendency has always been that of many other weak characters to act impetuously and afterwards to reproach myself for consequences which I have perhaps in reality had little or no share in producing It was Doctor Bryerly s countenance and manner in alluding to a particular provision in my father s will that instinctively awed me I have seen faces in a nightmare that haunted me with an indescribable horror and yet I could not say wherein lay the fascination And so it was with his an omen a menace lurked in its sallow and dismal glance You must not be so frightened darling said Cousin Monica It is foolish it is really they can t cut off your head you know they can t really harm you in any essential way If it involved a risk of a little money you would not mind it but men are such odd creatures they measure all sacrifices by money Doctor Bryerly would look just as you describe if you were doomed to lose five hundred l and yet it would not kill you A companion like Lady Knollys is reassuring but I could not take her comfort altogether to heart for I felt that she had no great confidence in it herself There was a little French clock over the mantelpiece in the school room which I consulted nearly every minute It wanted now but ten minutes of one Shall we go down to the drawing room dear said Cousin Knollys who was growing restless like me So down stairs we went pausing by mutual consent at the great window at the stair head which looks out on the avenue mister Danvers was riding his tall grey horse at a walk under the wide branches toward the house and we waited to see him get off at the door In his turn he loitered there for the good Rector s gig driven by the Curate was approaching at a smart ecclesiastical trot Doctor Clay got down and shook hands with mister Danvers and after a word or two away drove the Curate with that upward glance at the windows from which so few can refrain I watched the Rector and mister Danvers loitering on the steps as a patient might the gathering of surgeons who are to perform some unknown operation They too glanced up at the window as they turned to enter the house and I drew back Cousin Monica looked at her watch Four minutes only Shall we go to the drawing room Waiting for a moment to let the gentlemen get by on the way to the study we accordingly went down and I heard the Rector talk of the dangerous state of Grindleston bridge and wondered how he could think of such things at a time of sorrow Everything about those few minutes of suspense remains fresh in my recollection I remember how they loitered and came to a halt at the corner of the oak passage leading to the study and how the Rector patted the marble head and smoothed the inflexible tresses of William Pitt as he listened to mister Danvers details about the presentment and then as they went on I recollect the boisterous nose blowing that suddenly resounded from the passage and which I then referred and still refer intuitively to the Rector We had not been five minutes in the drawing room when Branston entered to say that the gentlemen I had mentioned were all assembled in the study Come dear said Cousin Monica and leaning on her arm I reached the study door I entered followed by her The gentlemen arrested their talk and stood up those who were sitting and the Rector came forward very gravely and in low tones and very kindly greeted me There was nothing emotional in this salutation for though my father never quarrelled yet an immense distance separated him from all his neighbours and I do not think there lived a human being who knew him at more than perhaps a point or two of his character Considering how entirely he secluded himself my father was as many people living remember wonderfully popular in his county He was neighbourly in everything except in seeing company and mixing in society He had magnificent shooting of which he was extremely liberal He kept a pack of hounds at Dollerton with which all his side of the county hunted through the season He never refused any claim upon his purse which had the slightest show of reason He subscribed to every fund social charitable sporting agricultural no matter what provided the honest people of his county took an interest in it and always with a princely hand and although he shut himself up no one could say that he was inaccessible for he devoted hours daily to answering letters and his checque book contributed largely in those replies He had taken his turn long ago as High Sheriff so there was an end of that claim before his oddity and shyness had quite secluded him He refused the Lord Lieutenancy of his county he declined every post of personal distinction connected with it He could write an able as well as a genial letter when he pleased and his appearances at public meetings dinners and so forth were made in this epistolary fashion and when occasion presented by magnificent contributions from his purse If my father had been less goodnatured in the sporting relations of his vast estates or less magnificent in dealing with his fortune or even if he had failed to exhibit the intellectual force which always characterised his letters on public matters I dare say that his oddities would have condemned him to ridicule and possibly to dislike But every one of the principal gentlemen of his county whose judgment was valuable has told me that he was a remarkably able man and that his failure in public life was due to his eccentricities and in no respect to deficiency in those peculiar mental qualities which make men feared and useful in Parliament I could not forbear placing on record this testimony to the high mental and the kindly qualities of my beloved father who might have passed for a misanthrope or a fool He was a man of generous nature and powerful intellect but given up to the oddities of a shyness which grew with years and indulgence and became inflexible with his disappointments and affliction There was something even in the Rector s kind and ceremonious greeting which oddly enough reflected the mixed feelings in which awe was not without a place with which his neighbours had regarded my dear father Having done the honours I am sure looking woefully pale I had time to glance quietly at the only figure there with which I was not tolerably familiar This was the junior partner in the firm of Archer and Sleigh who represented my uncle Silas a fat and pallid man of six and thirty with a sly and evil countenance and it has always seemed to me that ill dispositions show more repulsively in a pale fat face than in any other Doctor Bryerly standing near the window was talking in a low tone to mister Grimston our attorney I heard good doctor Clay whisper to mister Danvers Is not that Doctor Bryerly the person with the black the black it s a wig I think in the window talking to Abel Grimston Yes that s he Odd looking person one of the Swedenborg people is not he continued the Rector So I am told Yes said the Rector quietly and he crossed one gaitered leg over the other and with fingers interlaced twiddled his thumbs as he eyed the monstrous sectary under his orthodox old brows with a stern inquisitiveness I thought he was meditating theologic battle But doctor Bryerly and mister Grimston still talking together began to walk slowly from the window and the former said in his peculiar grim tones I beg pardon Miss Ruthyn perhaps you would be so good as to show us which of the cabinets in this room your late lamented father pointed out as that to which this key belongs I indicated the oak cabinet Very good ma am very good said Doctor Bryerly as he fumbled the key into the lock Cousin Monica could not forbear murmuring Dear what a brute The junior partner with his dumpy hands in his pocket poked his fat face over mister Grimston s shoulder and peered into the cabinet as the door opened The search was not long A handsome white paper enclosure neatly tied up in pink tape and sealed with large red seals was inscribed in my dear father s hand Will of Austin R Ruthyn of Knowl Then in smaller characters the date and in the corner a note This will was drawn from my instructions by Gaunt Hogg and Hatchett Solicitors Great Woburn Street London A R R Let me have a squint at that indorsement please gentlemen half whispered the unpleasant person who represented my uncle Silas Tisn t an indorsement There look a memorandum on an envelope said Abel Grimston gruffly Thanks all right that will do he responded himself making a pencil note of it in a long clasp book which he drew from his coat pocket The tape was carefully cut and the envelope removed without tearing the writing and forth came the will at sight of which my heart swelled and fluttered up to my lips and then dropped down dead as it seemed into its place mister Grimston you will please to read it said Doctor Bryerly who took the direction of the process I will sit beside you and as we go along you will be good enough to help us to understand technicalities and give us a lift where we want it It s a short will said mister Grimston turning over the sheets very considering Here s a codicil I did not see that said Doctor Bryerly Dated only a month ago Oh said Doctor Bryerly putting on his spectacles Uncle Silas s ambassador sitting close behind had insinuated his face between Doctor Bryerly s and the reader s of the will On behalf of the surviving brother of the testator interposed the delegate just as Abel Grimston had cleared his voice to begin I take leave to apply for a copy of this instrument It will save a deal of trouble if the young lady as represents the testator here has no objection You can have as many copies as you like when the will is proved said mister Grimston I know that but supposing as all s right where s the objection Just the objection there always is to acting irregular replied mister Grimston You don t object to act disobliging it seems You can do as I told you replied mister Grimston Thank you for nothing murmured mister Sleigh And the reading of the will proceeded while he made elaborate notes of its contents in his capacious pocket book I Austin Alymer Ruthyn Ruthyn being I thank God of sound mind and perfect recollection c c and then came a bequest of all his estates real chattels real copyrights leases chattels money rights interests reversions powers plate pictures and estates and possessions whatsoever to four persons Lord Ilbury mister Penrose Creswell of Creswell Sir William Aylmer Bart and Hans Emmanuel Bryerly Doctor of Medicine to have and to hold c c Whereupon my Cousin Monica ejaculated Eh and Doctor Bryerly interposed Four trustees ma am We take little but trouble you ll see go on Then it came out that all this multifarious splendour was bequeathed in trust for me subject to a bequest of fifteen thousand l to his only brother Silas Aylmer Ruthyn and three thousand five hundred l each to the two children of his said brother and lest any doubt should arise by reason of his the testator s decease as to the continuance of the arrangement by way of lease under which he enjoyed his present habitation and farm he left him the use of the mansion house and lands of Bartram Haugh in the county of Derbyshire and of the lands of so and so and so and so adjoining thereto in the said county for the term of his natural life on payment of a rent of five s per annum and subject to the like conditions as to waste c as are expressed in the said lease By your leave may I ask is them dispositions all the devises to my client which is his only brother as it seems to me you ve seen the will before enquired mister Sleigh Nothing more unless there is something in the codicil answered doctor Bryerly But there was no mention of him in the codicil mister Sleigh threw himself back in his chair and sneered with the end of his pencil between his teeth I hope his disappointment was altogether for his client mister Danvers fancied he afterwards said that he had probably expected legacies which might have involved litigation or at all events law costs and perhaps a stewardship but this was very barren and mister Danvers also remarked that the man was a very low practitioner and wondered how my uncle Silas could have commissioned such a person to represent him So far the will contained nothing of which my most partial friend could have complained The codicil too devised only legacies to servants and a sum of one thousand l with a few kind words to Monica Lady Knollys and a further sum of three thousand l to doctor Bryerly stating that the legatee had prevailed upon him to erase from the draft of his will a bequest to him to that amount but that in consideration of all the trouble devolving upon him as trustee he made that bequest by his codicil and with these arrangements the permanent disposition of his property was completed But that direction to which he and Doctor Bryerly had darkly alluded was now to come and certainly it was a strange one It appointed my uncle Silas my sole guardian with full parental authority over me until I should have reached the age of twenty one up to which time I was to reside under his care at Bartram Haugh and it directed the trustees to pay over to him yearly a sum of two thousand l during the continuance of the guardianship for my suitable maintenance education and expenses You have now a sufficient outline of my father s will The only thing I painfully felt in this arrangement was the break up the dismay that accompanies the disappearance of home Otherwise there was something rather pleasurable in the idea As long as I could remember I had always cherished the same mysterious curiosity about my uncle and the same longing to behold him This was about to be gratified Then there was my cousin Milicent about my own age My life had been so lonely that I had acquired none of those artificial habits that induce the fine lady nature a second and not always a very amiable one She had lived a solitary life like me What rambles and readings we should have together what confidences and castle buildings and then there was a new country and a fine old place and the sense of interest and adventure that always accompanies change in our early youth There were four letters all alike with large red seals addressed respectively to each of the trustees named in the will There was also one addressed to Silas Alymer Ruthyn esquire Bartram Haugh Manor c c which mister Sleigh offered to deliver But Doctor Bryerly thought the post office was the more regular channel Uncle Silas s representative was questioning Doctor Bryerly in an under tone I turned my eyes on my cousin Monica I felt so inexpressibly relieved expecting to see a corresponding expression in her countenance But I was startled She looked ghastly and angry I stared in her face not knowing what to think Could the will have personally disappointed her Such doubts though we fancy in after life they belong to maturity and experience only do sometimes cross our minds in youth But the suggestion wronged Lady Knollys who neither expected nor wanted anything being rich childless generous and frank It was the unexpected character of her countenance that scared me and for a moment the shock called up corresponding moral images Lady Knollys starting up raised her head so as to see over mister Sleigh s shoulder and biting her pale lip she cleared her voice and demanded Doctor Bryerly pray sir is the reading concluded Concluded Quite Yes nothing more he answered with a nod and continued his talk with mister Danvers and Abel Grimston And to whom said Lady Knollys with an effort will the property belong in case in case my little cousin here should die before she comes of age Eh Well wouldn t it go to the heir at law and next of kin said Doctor Bryerly turning to Abel Grimston Ay to be sure said the attorney thoughtfully And who is that pursued my cousin Well her uncle mister Silas Ruthyn He s both heir at law and next of kin pursued Abel Grimston Thank you said Lady Knollys Doctor Clay came forward bowing very low in his standing collar and single breasted coat and graciously folded my hand in his soft wrinkled grasp Allow me my dear Miss Ruthyn while expressing my regret that we are to lose you from among our little flock though I trust but for a short a very short time to say how I rejoice at the particular arrangement indicated by the will we have just heard read My curate William Fairfield resided for some years in the same spiritual capacity in the neighbourhood of your I will say admirable uncle with occasional intercourse with whom he was favoured may I not say blessed a true Christian Churchman a Christian gentleman Can I say more A most happy happy choice A very low bow here with eyes nearly closed and a shake of the head missus Clay will do herself the honour of waiting upon you to pay her respects before you leave Knowl for your temporary sojourn in another sphere So with another deep bow for I had become a great personage all at once he let go my hand cautiously and delicately as if he were setting down a curious china tea cup And I courtesied low to him not knowing what to say and then to the assembly generally who all bowed And Cousin Monica whispered briskly Come away and took my hand with a very cold and rather damp one and led me from the room CHAPTER XXV I HEAR FROM UNCLE SILAS Without saying a word Cousin Monica accompanied me to the school room and on entering she shut the door not with a spirited clang but quietly and determinedly Well dear she said with the same pale excited countenance that certainly is a sensible and charitable arrangement I could not have believed it possible had I not heard it with my ears About my going to Bartram Haugh Yes exactly so under Silas Ruthyn s guardianship to spend two three of the most important years of your education and your life under that roof Is that my dear what was in your mind when you were so alarmed about what you were to be called upon to do or undergo No no indeed I had no notion what it might be I was afraid of something serious I answered And my dear Maud did not your poor father speak to you as if it was something serious said she And so it is I can tell you something serious and very serious and I think it ought to be prevented and I certainly will prevent it if I possibly can I was puzzled utterly by the intensity of Lady Knollys protest I looked at her expecting an explanation of her meaning but she was silent looking steadfastly on the jewels on her right hand fingers with which she was drumming a staccato march on the table very pale with gleaming eyes evidently thinking deeply I began to think she had a prejudice against my uncle Silas He is not very rich I commenced Who said Lady Knollys Uncle Silas I replied No certainly he s in debt she answered But then how very highly Doctor Clay spoke of him I pursued Don t talk of Doctor Clay I do think that man is the greatest goose I ever heard talk I have no patience with such men she replied I tried to remember what particular nonsense Doctor Clay had uttered and I could recollect nothing unless his eulogy upon my uncle were to be classed with that sort of declamation Danvers is a very proper man and a good accountant I dare say but he is either a very deep person or a fool I believe a fool As for your attorney I suppose he knows his business and also his interest and I have no doubt he will consult it I begin to think he best man among them the shrewdest and the most reliable is that vulgar visionary in the black wig I saw him look at you Maud and I liked his face though it is abominably ugly and vulgar and cunning too but I think he s a just man and I dare say with right feelings I m sure he has I was quite at a loss to divine the gist of my cousin s criticism I ll have some talk with doctor Bryerly I feel convinced he takes my view and we must really think what had best be done Is there anything in the will Cousin Monica that does not appear I asked for I was growing very uneasy I wish you would tell me What view do you mean No view in particular the view that a desolate old park and the house of a neglected old man who is very poor and has been desperately foolish is not the right place for you particularly at your years It is quite shocking and I will speak to Doctor Bryerly May I ring the bell dear Certainly and I rang it When does he leave Knowl I could not tell missus Rusk however was sent for and she could tell us that he had announced his intention of taking the night train from Drackleton and was to leave Knowl for that station at half past six o clock May Rusk give or send him a message from me dear asked Lady Knollys Of course she might Then please let him know that I request he will be so good as to allow me a very few minutes just to say a word before he goes You kind cousin I said placing my two hands on her shoulders and looking earnestly in her face you are anxious about me more than you say Won t you tell me why I am much more unhappy really in ignorance than if I understood the cause Well dear haven t I told you The two or three years of your life which are to form you are destined to be passed in utter loneliness and I am sure neglect You can t estimate the disadvantage of such an arrangement It is full of disadvantages How it could have entered the head of poor Austin although I should not say that for I am sure I do understand it but how he could for any purpose have directed such a measure is quite inconceivable I never heard of anything so foolish and abominable and I will prevent it if I can At that moment missus Rusk announced that Doctor Bryerly would see Lady Knollys at any time she pleased before his departure It shall be this moment then said the energetic lady and up she stood and made that hasty general adjustment before the glass which no matter under what circumstances and before what sort of creature one s appearance is to be made is a duty that every woman owes to herself And I heard her a moment after at the stair head directing Branston to let doctor Bryerly know that she awaited him in the drawing room And now she was gone and I began to wonder and speculate Why should my cousin Monica make all this fuss about after all a very natural arrangement My uncle whatever he might have been was now a good man a religious man perhaps a little severe and with this thought a dark streak fell across my sky A cruel disciplinarian had I not read of such characters lock and key bread and water and solitude To sit locked up all night in a dark out of the way room in a great ghosty old fashioned house with no one nearer than the other wing What years of horror in one such night Would not this explain my poor father s hesitation and my cousin Monica s apparently disproportioned opposition When an idea of terror presents itself to a young person s mind it transfixes and fills the vision without respect of probabilities or reason My uncle was now a terrible old martinet with long Bible lessons lectures pages of catechism sermons to be conned by rote and an awful catalogue of punishments for idleness and what would seem to him impiety I was going then to a frightful isolated reformatory where for the first time in my life I should be subjected to a rigorous and perhaps barbarous discipline All this was an exhalation of fancy but it quite overcame me I threw myself in my solitude on the floor upon my knees and prayed for deliverance prayed that Cousin Monica might prevail with Doctor Bryerly and both on my behalf with the Lord Chancellor or the High Sheriff or whoever else my proper deliverer might be and when my cousin returned she found me quite in an agony Why you little fool what fancy has taken possession of you now she cried And when my new terror came to light she actually laughed a little to reassure me and she said My dear child your uncle Silas will never put you through your duty to your neighbour all the time you are under his roof you ll have idleness and liberty enough and too much I fear It is neglect my dear not discipline that I m afraid of I think dear Cousin Monica you are afraid of something more than neglect I said relieved however I am afraid of more than neglect she replied promptly but I hope my fears may turn out illusory and that possibly they may be avoided And now for a few hours at least let us think of something else I rather like that Doctor Bryerly I could not get him to say what I wanted I don t think he s Scotch but he is very cautious and I am sure though he would not say so that he thinks of the matter exactly as I do He says that those fine people who are named as his company trustees won t take any trouble and will leave everything to him and I am sure he is right So we must not quarrel with him Maud nor call him hard names although he certainly is intolerably vulgar and ugly and at times very nearly impertinent I suppose without knowing or indeed very much caring We had a good deal to think of and talked incessantly There were bursts and interruptions of grief and my kind cousin s consolations I have often since been so lectured for giving way to grief that I wonder at the patience exercised by her during this irksome visit Then there was some reading of that book whose claims are always felt in the terrible days of affliction After that we had a walk in the yew garden that quaint little cloistered quadrangle the most solemn sad and antiquated of gardens And now my dear I must really leave you for two or three hours I have ever so many letters to write and my people must think I m dead by this time So till tea time I had poor Mary Quince with her gushes of simple prattle and her long fits of vacant silence for my companion And such a one who can con over by rote the old friendly gossip about the dead talk about their ways and looks and likings without much psychologic refinement but with a simple admiration and liking that never measured them critically but always with faith and love is in general about as comfortable a companion as one can find for the common moods of grief It is not easy to recall in calm and happy hours the sensations of an acute sorrow that is past Nothing by the merciful ordinance of God is more difficult to remember than pain One or two great agonies of that time I do remember and they remain to testify of the rest and convince me though I can see it no more how terrible all that period was Next day was the funeral that appalling necessity smuggled away in whispers by black familiars unresisting the beloved one leaves home without a farewell to darken those doors no more henceforward to lie outside far away and forsaken through the drowsy heats of summer through days of snow and nights of tempest without light or warmth without a voice near Oh Death king of terrors The body quakes and the spirit faints before thee It is vain with hands clasped over our eyes to scream our reclamation the horrible image will not be excluded We have just the word spoken eighteen hundred years ago and our trembling faith And through the broken vault the gleam of the Star of Bethlehem I was glad in a sort of agony when it was over So long as it remained to be done something of the catastrophe was still suspended Now it was all over The house so strangely empty No owner no master I with my strange momentary liberty bereft of that irreplaceable love never quite prized until it is lost Most people have experienced the dismay that underlies sorrow under such circumstances The apartment of the poor outcast from life is now dismantled Beds and curtains taken down and furniture displaced carpets removed windows open and doors locked the bedroom and anteroom were henceforward for many a day uninhabited Every shocking change smote my heart like a reproach I saw that day that Cousin Monica had been crying for the first time I think since her arrival at Knowl and I loved her more for it and felt consoled My tears have often been arrested by the sight of another person weeping and I never could explain why But I believe that many persons experience the same odd reaction The funeral was conducted in obedience to his brief but peremptory direction very privately and with little expense But of course there was an attendance and the tenants of the Knowl estate also followed the hearse to the mausoleum as it is called in the park where he was laid beside my dear mother And so the repulsive ceremonial of that dreadful day was over The grief remained but there was rest from the fatigue of agitation and a comparative calm supervened It was now the stormy equinoctial weather that sounds the wild dirge of autumn and marches the winter in I love and always did that grand undefinable music threatening and bewailing with its strange soul of liberty and desolation By this night s mail as we sat listening to the storm in the drawing room at Knowl there reached me a large letter with a great black seal and a wonderfully deep black border like a widow s crape I did not recognise the handwriting but on opening the funereal missive it proved to be from my uncle Silas and was thus expressed MY DEAREST NIECE This letter will reach you probably on the day which consigns the mortal remains of my beloved brother Austin your dear father to the earth Sad ceremony from taking my mournful part in which I am excluded by years distance and broken health It will I trust at this season of desolation be not unwelcome to remember that a substitute imperfect unworthy but most affectionately zealous for the honoured parent whom you have just lost has been appointed in me your uncle by his will I am aware that you were present during the reading of it but I think it will be for our mutual satisfaction that our new and more affectionate relations should be forthwith entered upon My conscience and your safety and I trust convenience will thereby be consulted You will my dear niece remain at Knowl until a few simple arrangements shall have been completed for your reception at this place I will then settle the details of your little journey to us which shall be performed as comfortably and easily as possible I humbly pray that this affliction may be sanctified to us all and that in our new duties we may be supported comforted and directed I need not remind you that I now stand to you in loco parentis which means in the relation of father and you will not forget that you are to remain at Knowl until you hear further from me I remain my dear niece your most affectionate uncle and guardian SILAS RUTHYN P S Pray present my respects to Lady Knollys who I understand is sojourning at Knowl I would observe that a lady who cherishes I have reason to fear unfriendly feelings against your uncle is not the most desirable companion for his ward But upon the express condition that I am not made the subject of your discussions a distinction which could not conduce to your forming a just and respectful estimate of me I do not interpose my authority to bring your intercourse to an immediate close As I read this postscript my cheek tingled as if I had received a box on the ear Uncle Silas was as yet a stranger The menace of authority was new and sudden and I felt with a pang of mortification the full force of the position in which my dear father s will had placed me I was silent and handed the letter to my cousin who read it with a kind of smile until she came as I supposed to the postscript when her countenance on which my eyes were fixed changed and with flushed cheeks she knocked the hand that held the letter on the table before her and exclaimed Did I ever hear Well if this isn t impertinence What an old man that is There was a pause during which Lady Knollys held her head high with a frown and sniffed a little I did not intend to talk about him but now I will I ll talk away just whatever I like and I ll stay here just as long as you let me Maud and you need not be one atom afraid of him Our intercourse to an immediate close indeed I only wish he were here He should hear something And Cousin Monica drank off her entire cup of tea at one draught and then she said more in her own way I m better and drew a long breath and then she laughed a little in a waggish defiance I wish we had him here Maud and would not we give him a bit of our minds And this before the poor will is so much as proved I am almost glad he wrote that postscript for although I don t think he has any authority in that matter while I am under my own roof I said extemporising a legal opinion and therefore shan t obey him it has somehow opened my eyes to my real situation I sighed I believe very desolately for Lady Knollys came over and kissed me very gently and affectionately It really seems Maud as if he had a supernatural sense and heard things through the air over fifty miles of heath and hill You remember how just as he was probably writing that very postscript yesterday I was urging you to come and stay with me and planning to move doctor Bryerly in our favour And so I will Maud and to me you shall come my guest mind I should be so delighted and really if Silas is under a cloud it has been his own doing and I don t see that it is your business to fight his battle He can t live very long The suspicion whatever it is dies with him and what could poor dear Austin prove by his will but what everybody knew quite well before his own strong belief in Silas s innocence What an awful storm The room trembles Don t you like the sound What they used to call wolving in the old organ at Dorminster CHAPTER XXVI THE STORY OF UNCLE SILAS And so it was like the yelling of phantom hounds and hunters and the thunder of their coursers in the air a furious grand and supernatural music which in my fancy made a suitable accompaniment to the discussion of that enigmatical person martyr angel demon Uncle Silas with whom my fate was now so strangely linked and whom I had begun to fear The storm blows from that point I said indicating it with my hand and eye although the window shutters and curtains were closed I saw all the trees bend that way this evening That way stands the great lonely wood where my darling father and mother lie Oh how dreadful on nights like this to think of them a vault damp and dark and solitary under the storm Cousin Monica looked wistfully in the same direction and with a short sigh she said We think too much of the poor remains and too little of the spirit which lives for ever I am sure they are happy And she sighed again I wish I dare hope as confidently for myself Yes Maud it is sad We are such materialists we can t help feeling so We forget how well it is for us that our present bodies are not to last always They are constructed for a time and place of trouble plainly mere temporary machines that wear out constantly exhibiting failure and decay and with such tremendous capacity for pain The body lies alone and so it ought for it is plainly its good Creator s will it is only the tabernacle not the person who is clothed upon after death Saint Paul says with a house which is from heaven So Maud darling although the thought will trouble us again and again there is nothing in it and the poor mortal body is only the cold ruin of a habitation which they have forsaken before we do So this great wind you say is blowing toward us from the wood there If so Maud it is blowing from Bartram Haugh too over the trees and chimneys of that old place and the mysterious old man who is quite right in thinking I don t like him and I can fancy him an old enchanter in his castle waving his familiar spirits on the wind to fetch and carry tidings of our occupations here I lifted my head and listened to the storm dying away in the distance sometimes sometimes swelling and pealing around and above us and through the dark and solitude my thoughts sped away to Bartram Haugh and Uncle Silas This letter I said at last makes me feel differently I think he is a stern old man is he It is twenty years now since I saw him answered Lady Knollys I did not choose to visit at his house Was that before the dreadful occurrence at Bartram Haugh Yes before dear He was not a reformed rake but only a ruined one then Austin was very good to him mister Danvers says it is quite unaccountable how Silas can have made away with the immense sums he got from his brother from time to time without benefiting himself in the least But my dear he played and trying to help a man who plays and is unlucky and some men are I believe habitually unlucky is like trying to fill a vessel that has no bottom I think by the by my hopeful nephew Charles Oakley plays Then Silas went most unjustifiably into all manner of speculations and your poor father had to pay everything He lost something quite astounding in that bank that ruined so many country gentlemen poor Sir Harry Shackleton in Yorkshire had to sell half his estate But your kind father went on helping him up to his marriage I mean in that extravagant way which was really totally useless Has my aunt been long dead Twelve or fifteen years more indeed she died before your poor mamma She was very unhappy and I am sure would have given her right hand she had never married Silas Did you like her No dear she was a coarse vulgar woman Coarse and vulgar and Uncle Silas s wife I echoed in extreme surprise for Uncle Silas was a man of fashion a beau in his day and might have married women of good birth and fortune I had no doubt and so I expressed myself Yes dear so he might and poor dear Austin was very anxious he should and would have helped him with a handsome settlement I dare say but he chose to marry the daughter of a Denbigh innkeeper How utterly incredible I exclaimed Not the least incredible dear a kind of thing not at all so uncommon as you fancy What a gentleman of fashion and refinement marry a person A barmaid just so said Lady Knollys I think I could count half a dozen men of fashion who to my knowledge have ruined themselves just in a similar way Well at all events it must be allowed that in this he proved himself altogether unworldly Not a bit unworldly but very vicious replied Cousin Monica with a careless little laugh She was very beautiful curiously beautiful for a person in her station She was very like that Lady Hamilton who was Nelson s sorceress elegantly beautiful but perfectly low and stupid I believe to do him justice he only intended to ruin her but she was cunning enough to insist upon marriage Men who have never in all their lives denied themselves the indulgence of a single fancy cost what it may will not be baulked even by that condition if the penchant be only violent enough I did not half understand this piece of worldly psychology at which Lady Knollys seemed to laugh Poor Silas certainly he struggled honestly against the consequences for he tried after the honeymoon to prove the marriage bad But the Welsh parson and the innkeeper papa were too strong for him and the young lady was able to hold her struggling swain fast in that respectable noose and a pretty prize he proved And she died poor thing broken hearted I heard She died at all events about ten years after her marriage but I really can t say about her heart She certainly had enough ill usage I believe to kill her but I don t know that she had feeling enough to die of it if it had not been that she drank I am told that Welsh women often do There was jealousy of course and brutal quarrelling and all sorts of horrid stories I visited at Bartram Haugh for a year or two though no one else would But when that sort of thing began of course I gave it up it was out of the question I don t think poor Austin ever knew how bad it was And then came that odious business about wretched mister Charke You know he he committed suicide at Bartram I never heard about that I said and we both paused and she looked sternly at the fire and the storm roared and ha ha ed till the old house shook again But Uncle Silas could not help that I said at last No he could not help it she acquiesced unpleasantly And Uncle Silas was I paused in a sort of fear He was suspected by some people of having killed him she completed the sentence There was another long pause here during which the storm outside bellowed and hooted like an angry mob roaring at the windows for a victim An intolerable and sickening sensation overpowered me But you did not suspect him Cousin Knollys I said trembling very much No she answered very sharply I told you so before Of course I did not There was another silence I wish Cousin Monica I said drawing close to her you had not said that about Uncle Silas being like a wizard and sending his spirits on the wind to listen But I m very glad you never suspected him I insinuated my cold hand into hers and looked into her face I know not with what expression She looked down into mine with a hard haughty stare I thought Of course I never suspected him and never ask me that question again Maud Ruthyn Was it family pride or what was it that gleamed so fiercely from her eyes as she said this I was frightened I was wounded I burst into tears What is my darling crying for I did not mean to be cross Was I cross said this momentary phantom of a grim Lady Knollys in an instant translated again into kind pleasant Cousin Monica with her arms about my neck No no indeed only I thought I had vexed you and I believe thinking of Uncle Silas makes me nervous and I can t help thinking of him nearly always Nor can I although we might both easily find something better to think of Suppose we try said Lady Knollys But first I must know a little more about that mister Charke and what circumstances enabled Uncle Silas s enemies to found on his death that wicked slander which has done no one any good and caused some persons so much misery There is Uncle Silas I may say ruined by it and we all know how it darkened the life of my dear father People will talk my dear Your uncle Silas had injured himself before that in the opinion of the people of his county He was a black sheep in fact Very bad stories were told and believed of him His marriage certainly was a disadvantage you know and the miserable scenes that went on in his disreputable house all that predisposed people to believe ill of him How long is it since it happened Oh a long time I think before you were born answered she And the injustice still lives they have not forgotten it yet said I for such a period appeared to me long enough to have consigned anything in its nature perishable to oblivion Lady Knollys smiled Tell me like a darling cousin the whole story as well as you can recollect it Who was mister Charke mister Charke my dear was a gentleman on the turf that is the phrase I think one of those London men without birth or breeding who merely in right of their vices and their money are admitted to associate with young dandies who like hounds and horses and all that sort of thing That set knew him very well but of course no one else He was at the Matlock races and your uncle asked him to Bartram Haugh and the creature Jew or Gentile whatever he was fancied there was more honour than perhaps there really was in a visit to Bartram Haugh For the kind of person you describe it was I think a rather unusual honour to be invited to stay in the house of a man of Uncle Ruthyn s birth Well so it was perhaps for though they knew him very well on the course and would ask him to their tavern dinners they would not of course admit him to the houses where ladies were But Silas s wife was not much regarded at Bartram Haugh Indeed she was very little seen for she was every evening tipsy in her bedroom poor woman How miserable I exclaimed I don t think it troubled Silas very much for she drank gin they said poor thing and the expense was not much and on the whole I really think he was glad she drank for it kept her out of his way and was likely to kill her At this time your poor father who was thoroughly disgusted at his marriage had stopped the supplies you know and Silas was very poor and as hungry as a hawk and they said he pounced upon this rich London gamester intending to win his money I am telling you now all that was said afterwards The races lasted I forget how many days and mister Charke stayed at Bartram Haugh all this time and for some days after It was thought that poor Austin would pay all Silas s gambling debts and so this wretched mister Charke made heavy wagers with him on the races and they played very deep besides at Bartram He and Silas used to sit up at night at cards All these particulars as I told you came out afterwards for there was an inquest you know and then Silas published what he called his statement and there was a great deal of most distressing correspondence in the newspapers And why did mister Charke kill himself I asked Well I will tell you first what all are agreed about The second night after the races your uncle and mister Charke sat up till between two and three o clock in the morning quite by themselves in the parlour mister Charke s servant was at the Stag s Head Inn at Feltram and therefore could throw no light upon what occurred at night at Bartram Haugh but he was there at six o clock in the morning and very early at his master s door by his direction He had locked it as was his habit upon the inside and the key was in the lock which turned out afterwards a very important point On knocking he found that he could not awaken his master because as it appeared when the door was forced open his master was lying dead at his bedside not in a pool but a perfect pond of blood as they described it with his throat cut How horrible cried I So it was Your uncle Silas was called up and greatly shocked of course and he did what I believe was best He had everything left as nearly as possible in the exact state in which it had been found and he sent his own servant forthwith for the coroner and being himself a justice of the peace he took the depositions of mister Charke s servant while all the incidents were still fresh in his memory Could anything be more straightforward more right and wise I said Oh nothing of course answered Lady Knollys I thought a little drily CHAPTER XXVII MORE ABOUT TOM CHARKE S SUICIDE So the inquest was held and mister Manwaring of Wail Forest was the only juryman who seemed to entertain the idea during the inquiry that mister Charke had died by any hand but his own And how could he fancy such a thing I exclaimed indignantly Well you will see the result was quite enough to justify them in saying as they did that he died by his own hand The window was found fastened with a screw on the inside as it had been when the chambermaid had arranged it at nine o clock no one could have entered through it Besides it was on the third story and the rooms are lofty so it stood at a great height from the ground and there was no ladder long enough to reach it The house is built in the form of a hollow square and mister Charke s room looked into the narrow court yard within There is but one door leading into this and it did not show any sign of having been open for years The door was locked upon the inside and the key in the lock so that nobody could have made an entrance that way either for it was impossible you see to unlock the door from the outside And how could they affect to question anything so clear I asked There did come nevertheless a kind of mist over the subject which gave those who chose to talk unpleasantly an opportunity of insinuating suspicions though they could not themselves find the clue of the mystery In the first place it appeared that he had gone to bed very tipsy and that he was heard sing ing and noisy in his room while getting to bed not the mood in which men make away with themselves Then although his own razor was found in that dreadful blood it is shocking to have to hear all this near his right hand the fingers of his left were cut to the bone Then the memorandum book in which his bets were noted was nowhere to be found That you know was very odd His keys were there attached to a chain He wore a great deal of gold and trinkets I saw him wretched man on the course They had got off their horses He and your uncle were walking on the course Did he look like a gentleman I inquired as I dare say other young ladies would He looked like a Jew my dear He had a horrid brown coat with a velvet cape curling black hair over his collar and great whiskers very high shoulders and he was puffing a cigar straight up into the air I was shocked to see Silas in such company And did his keys discover anything I asked On opening his travelling desk and a small japanned box within it a vast deal less money was found than was expected in fact very little Your uncle said that he had won some of it the night before at play and that Charke complained to him when tipsy of having had severe losses to counterbalance his gains on the races Besides he had been paid but a small part of those gains About his book it appeared that there were little notes of bets on the backs of letters and it was said that he sometimes made no other memorandum of his wagers but this was disputed and among those notes there was not one referring to Silas But then there was an omission of all allusion to his transactions with two other well known gentlemen So that was not singular No certainly that was quite accounted for said I And then came the question continued she what motive could mister Charke possibly have had for making away with himself But is not that very difficult to make out in many cases I interposed It was said that he had some mysterious troubles in London at which he used to hint Some people said that he really was in a scrape but others that there was no such thing and that when he talked so he was only jesting There was no suspicion during the inquest that your uncle Silas was involved except those questions of mister Manwaring s What were they I asked I really forget but they greatly offended your uncle and there was a little scene in the room mister Manwaring seemed to think that some one had somehow got into the room Through the door it could not be nor down the chimney for they found an iron bar across the flue near the top in the masonry The window looked into a court yard no bigger than a ball room They went down and examined it but though the ground beneath was moist they could not discover the slightest trace of a footprint So far as they could make out mister Charke had hermetically sealed himself into his room and then cut his throat with his own razor Yes said I for it was all secured that is the window and the door upon the inside and no sign of any attempt to get in Just so and when the walls were searched and as your uncle Silas directed the wainscoting removed some months afterwards when the scandal grew loudest then it was evident that there was no concealed access to the room So the answer to all those calumnies was simply that the crime was impossible said I How dreadful that such a slander should have required an answer at all It was an unpleasant affair even then although I cannot say that anyone supposed Silas guilty but you know the whole thing was disreputable that mister Charke was a discreditable inmate the occurrence was horrible and there was a glare of publicity which brought into relief the scandals of Bartram Haugh But in a little time it became all on a sudden a great deal worse My cousin paused to recollect exactly There were very disagreeable whispers among the sporting people in London This person Charke had written two letters Yes two They were published about two months after by the villain to whom they were written he wanted to extort money They were first talked of a great deal among that set in town but the moment they were published they produced a sensation in the country and a storm of newspaper commentary The first of these was of no great consequence but the second was very startling embarrassing and even alarming What was it Cousin Monica I whispered I can only tell you in a general way it is so very long since I read it but both were written in the same kind of slang and parts as hard to understand as a prize fight I hope you never read those things I satisfied this sudden educational alarm and Lady Knollys proceeded I am afraid you hardly hear me the wind makes such an uproar Well listen The letter said distinctly that he mister Charke had made a very profitable visit to Bartram Haugh and mentioned in exact figures for how much he held your uncle Silas s I O U s for he could not pay him I can t say what the sum was I only remember that it was quite frightful It took away my breath when I read it Uncle Silas had lost it I asked Yes and owed it and had given him those papers called I O U s promising to pay which of course mister Charke had locked up with his money and the insinuation was that Silas had made away with him to get rid of this debt and that he had also taken a great deal of his money I just recollect these points which were exactly what made the impression continued Lady Knollys after a short pause the letter was written in the evening of the last day of the wretched man s life so that there had not been much time for your uncle Silas to win back his money and he stoutly alleged that he did not owe mister Charke a guinea It mentioned an enormous sum as being actually owed by Silas and it cautioned the man an agent to whom he wrote not to mention the circumstance as Silas could only pay by getting the money from his wealthy brother who would have the management and he distinctly said that he had kept the matter very close at Silas s request That you know was a very awkward letter and all the worse that it was written in brutally high spirits and not at all like a man meditating an exit from the world You can t imagine what a sensation the publication of these letters produced In a moment the storm was up and certainly Silas did meet it bravely yes with great courage and ability What a pity he did not early enter upon some career of ambition Well well it is idle regretting He suggested that the letters were forgeries He alleged that Charke was in the habit of boasting and telling enormous falsehoods about his gambling transactions especially in his letters He reminded the world how often men affect high animal spirits at the very moment of meditating suicide He alluded in a manly and graceful way to his family and their character He took a high and menacing tone with his adversaries and he insisted that what they dared to insinuate against him was physically impossible I asked in what form this vindication appeared It was a letter printed as a pamphlet everybody admired its ability ingenuity and force and it was written with immense rapidity Was it at all in the style of his letters I innocently asked My cousin laughed Oh dear no Ever since he avowed himself a religious character he had written nothing but the most vapid and nerveless twaddle Your poor dear father used to send his letters to me to read and I sometimes really thought that Silas was losing his faculties but I believe he was only trying to write in character I suppose the general feeling was in his favour I said I don t think it was anywhere but in his own county it was certainly unanimously against him There is no use in asking why but so it was and I think it would have been easier for him with his unaided strength to uproot the Peak than to change the convictions of the Derbyshire gentlemen They were all against him Of course there were predisposing causes Your uncle published a very bitter attack upon them describing himself as the victim of a political conspiracy and I recollect he mentioned that from the hour of the shocking catastrophe in his house he had forsworn the turf and all pursuits and amusements connected with it People sneered and said he might as well go as wait to be kicked out Were there law suits about all this I asked Everybody expected that there would for there were very savage things printed on both sides and I think too that the persons who thought worst of him expected that evidence would yet turn up to convict Silas of the crime they chose to impute and so years have glided away and many of the people who remembered the tragedy of Bartram Haugh and took the strongest part in the denunciation and ostracism that followed are dead and no new light had been thrown upon the occurrence and your uncle Silas remains an outcast At first he was quite wild with rage and would have fought the whole county man by man if they would have met him But he had since changed his habits and as he says his aspirations altogether He has become religious The only occupation remaining to him He owes money he is poor he is isolated and he says sick and religious Your poor father who was very decided and inflexible never helped him beyond the limit he had prescribed after Silas s mesalliance He wanted to get him into Parliament and would have paid his expenses and made him an allowance but either Silas had grown lazy or he understood his position better than poor Austin or he distrusted his powers or possibly he really is in ill health but he objected his religious scruples Your poor papa thought self assertion possible where an injured man has right to rely upon but he had been very long out of the world and the theory won t do Nothing is harder than to get a person who has once been effectually slurred received again Silas I think was right I don t think it was practicable Dear child how late it is exclaimed Lady Knollys suddenly looking at the Louis Quatorze clock that crowned the mantelpiece It was near one o clock The storm had a little subsided and I took a less agitated and more confident view of Uncle Silas than I had at an earlier hour of that evening And what do you think of him I asked Lady Knollys drummed on the table with her finger points as she looked into the fire I don t understand metaphysics my dear nor witchcraft I sometimes believe in the supernatural and sometimes I don t Silas Ruthyn is himself alone and I can t define him because I don t understand him Perhaps other souls than human are sometimes born into the world and clothed in flesh It is not only about that dreadful occurrence but nearly always throughout his life early and late he has puzzled me I have tried in vain to understand him But at one time of his life I am sure he was awfully wicked eccentric indeed in his wickedness gay frivolous secret and dangerous At one time I think he could have made poor Austin do almost anything but his influence vanished with his marriage never to return again No I don t understand him He always bewildered me like a shifting face sometimes smiling but always sinister in an unpleasant dream CHAPTER XXVIII I AM PERSUADED So now at last I had heard the story of Uncle Silas s mysterious disgrace We sat silent for a while and I gazing into vacancy sent him in a chariot of triumph chapletted ringed and robed through the city of imagination crying after him Innocent innocent martyr and crowned All the virtues and honesties reason and conscience in myriad shapes tier above tier of human faces from the crowded pavement crowded windows crowded roofs joined in the jubilant acclamation and trumpeters trumpeted and drums rolled and great organs and choirs through open cathedral gates rolled anthems of praise and thanksgiving and the bells rang out and cannons sounded and the air trembled with the roaring harmony and Silas Ruthyn the full length portrait stood in the burnished chariot with a proud sad clouded face that rejoiced not with the rejoicers and behind him the slave thin as a ghost white faced and sneering something in his ear while I and all the city went on crying Innocent innocent martyr and crowned And now the reverie was ended and there were only Lady Knollys stern thoughtful face with the pale light of sarcasm on it and the storm outside thundering and lamenting desolately It was very good of Cousin Monica to stay with me so long It must have been unspeakably tiresome And now she began to talk of business at home and plainly to prepare for immediate flight and my heart sank I know that I could not then have defined my feelings and agitations I am not sure that I even now could Any misgiving about Uncle Silas was in my mind a questioning the foundations of my faith and in itself an impiety And yet I am not sure that some such misgiving faint perhaps and intermittent may not have been at the bottom of my tribulation I was not very well Lady Knollys had gone out for a walk She was not easily tired and sometimes made a long excursion The sun was setting now when Mary Quince brought me a letter which had just arrived by the post My heart throbbed violently I was afraid to break the broad black seal It was from Uncle Silas I ran over in my mind all the unpleasant mandates which it might contain to try and prepare myself for a shock At last I opened the letter It directed me to hold myself in readiness for the journey to Bartram Haugh It stated that I might bring two maids with me if I wished so many and that his next letter would give me the details of my route and the day of my departure for Derbyshire and he said that I ought to make arrangements about Knowl during my absence but that he was hardly the person properly to be consulted on that matter Then came a prayer that he might be enabled to acquit himself of his trust to the full satisfaction of his conscience and that I might enter upon my new relations in a spirit of prayer I looked round my room so long familiar and now so endeared by the idea of parting and change The old house dear dear Knowl how could I leave you and all your affectionate associations and kind looks and voices for a strange land With a great sigh I took Uncle Silas s letter and went down stairs to the drawing room From the lobby window where I loitered for a few moments I looked out upon the well known forest trees The sun was down It was already twilight and the white vapours of coming night were already filming their thinned and yellow foliage Everything looked melancholy How little did those who envied the young inheritrex of a princely fortune suspect the load that lay at her heart or bating the fear of death how gladly at that moment she would have parted with her life Lady Knollys had not yet returned and it was darkening rapidly a mass of black clouds stood piled in the west through the chasms of which was still reflected a pale metallic lustre The drawing room was already very dark but some streaks of this cold light fell upon a black figure which would otherwise have been unseen leaning beside the curtains against the window frame It advanced abruptly with creaking shoes it was Doctor Bryerly I was startled and surprised not knowing how he had got there I stood staring at him in the dusk rather awkwardly I am afraid How do you do Miss Ruthyn said he extending his hand long hard and brown as a mummy s and stooping a little so as to approach more nearly for it was not easy to see in the imperfect light You re surprised I dare say to see me here so soon again I did not know you had arrived I am glad to see you Doctor Bryerly Nothing unpleasant I hope has happened No nothing unpleasant Miss The will has been lodged and we shall have probate in due course but there has been something on my mind and I m come to ask you two or three questions which you had better answer very considerately Is Miss Knollys still here Yes but she is not returned from her walk I am glad she is here I think she takes a sound view and women understand one another better As for me it is plainly my duty to put it before you as it strikes me and to offer all I can do in accomplishing should you wish it a different arrangement You don t know your uncle you said the other day No I ve never seen him You understand your late father s intention in making you his ward I suppose he wished to show his high opinion of my uncle s fitness for such a trust That s quite true but the nature of the trust in this instance is extraordinary I don t understand Why if you die before you come to the age of twenty one the entire of the property will go to him do you see and he has the custody of your person in the meantime you are to live in his house under his care and authority You see now I think how it is and I did not like it when your father read the will to me and I said so Do you I hesitated to speak not sure that I quite comprehended him And the more I think of it the less I like it Miss said Doctor Bryerly in a calm stern tone Merciful Heaven Doctor Bryerly you can t suppose that I should not be as safe in my uncle s house as in the Lord Chancellor s I ejaculated looking full in his face But don t you see Miss it is not a fair position to put your uncle in replied he after a little hesitation But suppose he does not think so You know if he does he may decline it Well that s true but he won t Here is his letter and he produced it announcing officially that he means to accept the office but I think he ought to be told it is not delicate under all circumstances You know Miss that your uncle mister Silas Ruthyn was talked about unpleasantly once You mean I began I mean about the death of mister Charke at Bartram Haugh Yes I have heard that I said he was speaking with a shocking aplomb We assume of course unjustly but there are many who think quite differently And possibly Doctor Bryerly it was for that very reason that my dear papa made him my guardian There can be no doubt of that Miss it was to purge him of that scandal And when he has acquitted himself honourably of that trust don t you think such a proof of confidence so honourably fulfilled must go far to silence his traducers Why if all goes well it may do a little but a great deal less than you fancy But take it that you happen to die Miss during your minority We are all mortal and there are three years and some months to go how will it be then Don t you see Just fancy how people will talk I think you know that my uncle is a religious man said I Well Miss what of that he asked again He is he has suffered intensely I continued He has long retired from the world he is very religious Ask our curate mister Fairfield if you doubt it But I am not disputing it Miss I m only supposing what may happen an accident we ll call it small pox diphtheria that s going very much Three years and three months you know is a long time You proceed to Bartram Haugh thinking you have much goods laid up for many years but your Creator you know may say Thou fool this day is thy soul required of thee You go and what pray is thought of your uncle mister Silas Ruthyn who walks in for the entire inheritance and who has long been abused like a pickpocket or worse in his own county I m told You are a religious man Doctor Bryerly according to your lights I said The Swedenborgian smiled Well knowing that he is so too and having yourself experienced the power of religion do not you think him deserving of every confidence Don t you think it well that he should have this opportunity of exhibiting both his own character and the reliance which my dear papa reposed on it and that we should leave all consequences and contingencies in the hands of Heaven It appears to have been the will of Heaven hitherto said Doctor Bryerly I could not see with what expression of face but he was looking down and drawing little diagrams with his stick on the dark carpet and spoke in a very low tone that your uncle should suffer under this ill report In countervailing the appointment of Providence we must employ our reason with conscientious diligence as to the means and if we find that they are as likely to do mischief as good we have no right to expect a special interposition to turn our experiment into an ordeal I think you ought to weigh it well I am sure there are reasons against it If you make up your mind that you would rather be placed under the care say of Lady Knollys I will endeavour all I can to effect it That could not be done without his consent could it said I No but I don t despair of getting that on terms of course remarked he I don t quite understand I said I mean for instance if he were allowed to keep the allowance for your maintenance eh I mistake my uncle Silas very much I said if that allowance is any object whatever to him compared with the moral value of the position If he were deprived of that I am sure he would decline the other We might try him at all events said Doctor Bryerly on whose dark sinewy features even in this imperfect light I thought I detected a smile Perhaps said I I appear very foolish in supposing him actuated by any but sordid motives but he is my near relation and I can t help it sir That is a very serious thing Miss Ruthyn he replied You are very young and cannot see it at present as you will hereafter He is very religious you say and all that but his house is not a proper place for you It is a solitude its master an outcast and it has been the repeated scene of all sorts of scandals and of one great crime and Lady Knollys thinks your having been domesticated there will be an injury to you all the days of your life So I do Maud said Lady Knollys who had just entered the room unperceived How do you do Doctor Bryerly a serious injury You have no idea how entirely that house is condemned and avoided and the very name of its inmates tabooed How monstrous how cruel I exclaimed Very unpleasant my dear but perfectly natural You are to recollect that quite independently of the story of mister Charke the house was talked about and the county people had cut your uncle Silas long before that adventure was dreamed of and as to the circumstance of your being placed in his charge by his brother who took from strong family feeling a totally one sided view of the affair from the first having the slightest effect in restoring his position in the county you must quite give that up Except me if he will allow me and the clergyman not a soul in the country will visit at Bartram Haugh They may pity you and think the whole thing the climax of folly and cruelty but they won t visit at Bartram or know Silas or have anything to do with his household They will see at all events what my dear papa s opinion was They know that already answered she and it has not and ought not to have the slightest weight with them There are people there who think themselves just as great as the Ruthyns or greater and your poor father s idea of carrying it by a demonstration was simply the dream of a man who had forgotten the world and learned to exaggerate himself in his long seclusion I know he was beginning himself to hesitate and I think if he had been spared another year that provision of his will would have been struck out Doctor Bryerly nodded and he said And if he had the power to dictate now would he insist on that direction It is a mistake every way injurious to you his child and should you happen to die during your sojourn under your uncle s care it would woefully defeat the testator s object and raise such a storm of surmise and inquiry as would awaken all England and send the old scandal on the wing through the world again Doctor Bryerly will I have no doubt arrange it all In fact I do not think it would be very difficult to bring Silas to terms and if you do not consent to his trying Maud mark my words you will live to repent it Here were two persons viewing the question from totally different points both perfectly disinterested both in their different ways I believe shrewd and even wise and both honourable urging me against it and in a way that undefinably alarmed my imagination as well as moved my reason I looked from one to the other there was a silence By this time the candles had come and we could see one another I only wait your decision Miss Ruthyn said the trustee to see your uncle If his advantage was the chief object contemplated in this arrangement he will be the best judge whether his interest is really best consulted by it or no and I think he will clearly see that it is not so and will answer accordingly I cannot answer now you must allow me to think it over I will do my best I am very much obliged my dear Cousin Monica you are so very good and you too Doctor Bryerly Doctor Bryerly by this time was looking into his pocket book and did not acknowledge my thanks even by a nod I must be in London the day after to morrow Bartram Haugh is nearly sixty miles from here and only twenty of that by rail I find Forty miles of posting over those Derbyshire mountains is slow work but if you say try I ll see him to morrow morning You must say try you must my dear Maud But how can I decide in a moment Oh dear Cousin Monica I am so distracted But you need not decide at all the decision rests with him Come he is more competent than you You must say yes Again I looked from her to Doctor Bryerly and from him to her again I threw my arms about her neck and hugging her closely to me I cried Oh Cousin Monica dear Cousin Monica advise me I am a wretched creature You must advise me I did not know till now how irresolute a character was mine I knew somehow by the tone of her voice that she was smiling as she answered Why dear I have advised you I do advise you and then she added impetuously I entreat and implore if you really think I love you that you will follow my advice It is your duty to leave your uncle Silas whom you believe to be more competent than you are to decide after full conference with Doctor Bryerly who knows more of your poor father s views and intentions in making that appointment than either you or I Shall I say yes I cried drawing her close and kissing her helplessly Oh tell me tell me to say yes Yes of course yes She agrees Doctor Bryerly to your kind proposal I am to understand so he asked Very well yes Doctor Bryerly I replied You have resolved wisely and well said he briskly like a man who has got a care off his mind I forgot to say Doctor Bryerly it was very rude that you must stay here to night He can t my dear interposed Lady Knolly s it is a long way He will dine Won t you Doctor Bryerly No he can t You know you can t sir said my cousin peremptorily You must not worry him my dear with civilities he can t accept He ll bid us good bye this moment Good bye Doctor Bryerly You ll write immediately don t wait till you reach town Bid him good bye Maud I ll say a word to you in the hall And thus she literally hurried him out of the room leaving me in a state of amazement and confusion not able to review my decision unsatisfied but still unable to recall it I stood where they had left me looking after them I suppose like a fool Lady Knollys returned in a few minutes If I had been a little cooler I was shrewd enough to perceive that she had sent poor Doctor Bryerly away upon his travels to find board and lodging half way to Bartram to remove him forthwith from my presence and thus to make my decision if mine it was irrevocable I applaud you my dear said Cousin Knollys in her turn embracing me heartily You are a sensible little darling and have done exactly what you ought to have done I hope I have I faltered Hope fiddle stuff the thing s as plain as a pikestaff And in came Branston to say that dinner was served CHAPTER XXIX HOW THE AMBASSADOR FARED Lady Knollys I could plainly see when we got into the brighter lights at the dinner table was herself a good deal excited she was relieved and glad and was garrulous during our meal and told me all her early recollections of dear papa Most of them I had heard before but they could not be told too often Notwithstanding my mind sometimes wandered often indeed to the conference so unexpected so suddenly decisive possibly so momentous and with a dismayed uncertainly the question had I done right was always before me I dare say my cousin understood my character better perhaps after all my honest self study then I do even now Irresolute suddenly reversing my own decisions impetuous in action as she knew me she feared I am sure a revocation of my commission to Doctor Bryerly and thought of the countermand I might send galloping after him So kind creature she laboured to occupy my thoughts and when one theme was exhausted found another and had always her parry prepared as often as I directed a reflection or an enquiry to the re opening of the question which she had taken so much pains to close That night I was troubled I was already upbraiding myself I could not sleep and at last sat up in bed and cried I lamented my weakness in having assented to Doctor Bryerly s and my cousin s advice Was I not departing from my engagement to my dear papa Was I not consenting that my Uncle Silas should be induced to second my breach of faith by a corresponding perfidy Lady Knollys had done wisely in despatching Doctor Bryerly so promptly for most assuredly had he been at Knowl next morning when I came down I should have recalled my commission That day in the study I found four papers which increased my perturbation They were in dear papa s handwriting and had an indorsement in these words Copy of my letter addressed to one of the trustees named in my will Here then were the contents of those four sealed letters which had excited mine and Lady Knollys curiosity on the agitating day on which the will was read It contained these words I name my oppressed and unhappy brother Silas Ruthyn residing at my house of Bartram Haugh as guardian of the person of my beloved child to convince the world if possible and failing that to satisfy at least all future generations of our family that his brother who knew him best had implicit confidence in him and that he deserved it A cowardly and preposterous slander originating in political malice and which never have been whispered had he not been poor and imprudent is best silenced by this ordeal of purification All I possess goes to him if my child dies under age and the custody of her person I commit meanwhile to him alone knowing that she is as safe in his as she could have been under my own care I rely upon your remembrance of our early friendship to make this known wherever an opportunity occurs and also to say what your sense of justice may warrant The other letters were in the same spirit My heart sank like lead as I read them I quaked with fear What had I done My father s wise and noble vindication of our dishonoured name I had presumed to frustrate I had like a coward receded from my easy share in the task and merciful Heaven I had broken my faith with the dead With these letters in my hand white with fear I flew like a shadow to the drawing room where Cousin Monica was and told her to read them I saw by her countenance how much alarmed she was by my looks but she said nothing only read the letters hurriedly and then exclaimed Is this all my dear child I really fancied you had found a second will and had lost everything Why my dearest Maud we knew all this before We quite understood poor dear Austin s motive Why are you so easily disturbed Oh Cousin Monica I think he was right it all seems quite reasonable now and I oh what a crime it must be stopped My dear Maud listen to reason Doctor Bryerly has seen your uncle at Bartram at least two hours ago You can t stop it and why on earth should you if you could Don t you think your uncle should be consulted said she But he has decided I have his letter speaking of it as settled and Doctor Bryerly oh Cousin Monica he s gone to tempt him Nonsense girl Doctor Bryerly is a good and just man I do believe and has beside no imaginable motive to pervert either his conscience or his judgment He s not gone to tempt him stuff but to unfold the facts and invite his consideration and I say considering how thoughtlessly such duties are often undertaken and how long Silas has been living in lazy solitude shut out from the world and unused to discuss anything I do think it only conscientious and honourable that he should have a fair and distinct view of the matter in all its bearings submitted to him before he indolently incurs what may prove the worst danger he was ever involved in So Lady Knollys argued with feminine energy and I must confess with a good deal of the repetition which I have sometimes observed in logicians of my own sex and she puzzled without satisfying me I don t know why I went to that room I said quite frightened or why I went to that press how it happened that these papers which we never saw there before were the first things to strike my eye to day What do you mean dear said Lady Knollys I mean this I think I was brought there and that there is poor papa s appeal to me as plain as if his hand came and wrote it upon the wall I nearly screamed the conclusion of this wild confession You are nervous my darling your bad nights have worn you out Let us go out the air will do you good and I do assure you that you will very soon see that we are quite right and rejoice conscientiously that you have acted as you did But I was not to be satisfied although my first vehemence was quieted In my prayers that night my conscience upbraided me When I lay down in bed my nervousness returned fourfold Everybody at all nervously excitable has suffered some time or another by the appearance of ghastly features presenting themselves in every variety of contortion one after another the moment the eyes are closed This night my dear father s face troubled me sometimes white and sharp as ivory sometimes strangely transparent like glass sometimes all hanging in cadaverous folds always with the same unnatural expression of diabolical fury From this dreadful vision I could only escape by sitting up and staring at the light At length worn out I dropped asleep and in a dream I distinctly heard papa s voice say sharply outside the bed curtain Maud we shall be late at Bartram Haugh And I awoke in a horror the wall as it seemed still ringing with the summons and the speaker I fancied standing at the other side of the curtain A miserable night I passed In the morning looking myself like a ghost I stood in my night dress by Lady Knollys bed I have had my warning I said Oh Cousin Monica papa has been with me and ordered me to Bartram Haugh and go I will She stared in my face uncomfortably and then tried to laugh the matter off but I know she was troubled at the strange state to which agitation and suspense had reduced me You re taking too much for granted Maud said she Silas Ruthyn most likely will refuse his consent and insist on your going to Bartram Haugh Heaven grant I exclaimed but if he doesn t it is all the same to me go I will He may turn me out but I ll go and try to expiate the breach of faith that I fear is so horribly wicked We had several hours still to wait for the arrival of the post For both of us the delay was a suspense for me an almost agonising one At length at an unlooked for moment Branston did enter the room with the post bag There was a large letter with the Feltram post mark addressed to Lady Knollys it was Doctor Bryerly s despatch we read it together It was dated on the day before and its purport was thus RESPECTED MADAM I this day saw mister Silas Ruthyn at Bartram Haugh and he peremptorily refuses on any terms to vacate the guardianship or to consent to Miss Ruthyn s residing anywhere but under his own immediate care As he bases his refusal first upon a conscientious difficulty declaring that he has no right through fear of personal contingencies to abdicate an office imposed in so solemn a way and so naturally devolving on him as only brother to the deceased and secondly upon the effect such a withdrawal at the instance of the acting trustee would have upon his own character amounting to a public self condemnation and as he refused to discuss these positions with me I could make no way whatsoever with him Finding therefore that his mind was quite made up after a short time I took my leave He mentioned that preparations for his niece s reception are being completed and that he will send for her in a few days so that I think it will be advisable that I should go down to Knowl to assist Miss Ruthyn with any advice she may require before her departure to discharge servants get inventories made and provide for the care of the place and grounds during her minority I am respected Madam yours truly HANS E BRYERLY I can t describe to you how chapfallen and angry my cousin looked She sniffed once or twice and then said rather bitterly in a subdued tone Well now I hope you are pleased No no no you know I m not grieved to the heart my only friend my dear Cousin Monica but my conscience is at rest you don t know what a sacrifice it is I am a most unhappy creature I feel an indescribable foreboding I am frightened but you won t forsake me Cousin Monica No darling never she said sadly And you ll come and see me won t you as often as you can Yes dear that is if Silas allows me and I m sure he will she added hastily seeing I suppose my terror in my face All I can do you may be sure I will and perhaps he will allow you to come to me now and then for a short visit You know I am only six miles away little more than half an hour s drive and though I hate Bartram and detest Silas Yes I detest Silas she repeated in reply to my surprised gaze I will call at Bartram that is I say if he allows me for you know I haven t been there for a quarter of a century and though I never understood Silas I fancy he forgives no sins whether of omission or commission I wondered what old grudge could make my cousin judge Uncle Silas always so hardly I could not suppose it was justice I had seen my hero indeed lately so disrespectfully handled before my eyes that he had as idols will lost something of his sacredness But as an article of faith I still cultivated my trust in his divinity and dismissed every intruding doubt with an exorcism as a suggestion of the evil one But I wronged Lady Knollys in suspecting her of pique or malice or anything more than that tendency to take strong views which some persons attribute to my sex So then the little project of Cousin Monica s guardianship which had it been poor papa s wish would have made me so very happy was quite knocked on the head to revive no more I comforted myself however with her promise to re open communications with Bartram Haugh and we grew resigned I remember next morning as we sat at a very late breakfast Lady Knollys reading a letter suddenly made an exclamation and a little laugh and read on with increased interest for a few minutes and then with another little laugh she looked up placing her hand with the open letter in it beside her tea cup You ll not guess whom I ve been reading about said she with her head the least thing on one side and an arch smile I felt myself blushing cheeks forehead even down to the tips of my fingers I anticipated the name I was to hear She looked very much amused Was it possible that Captain Oakley was married I really have not the least idea I replied with that kind of overdone carelessness which betrays us No I see quite plainly you have not but you can t think how prettily you blush answered she very much diverted I really don t care I replied with some little dignity and blushing deeper and deeper Will you make a guess she asked I can t guess Well shall I tell you Just as you please Well I will that is I ll read a page of my letter which tells it all Do you know Georgina Fanshawe she asked Lady Georgina No Well no matter she s in Paris now and this letter is from her and she says let me see the place Yesterday what do you think quite an apparition you shall hear My brother Craven yesterday insisted on my accompanying him to Le Bas shop in that odd little antique street near the Greve it is a wonderful old curiosity shop I forget what they call them here When we went into this place it was very nearly deserted and there were so many curious things to look at all about that for a minute or two I did not observe a tall woman in a grey silk and a black velvet mantle and quite a nice new Parisian bonnet You will be charmed by the by with the new shape it is only out three weeks and is quite indescribably elegant I think at least They have them I am sure by this time at Molnitz s so I need say no more And now that I am on this subject of dress I have got your lace and I think you will be very ungrateful if you are not charmed with it Well I need not read all that here is the rest and she read But you ll ask about my mysterious dame in the new bonnet and velvet mantle she was sitting on a stool at the counter not buying but evidently selling a quantity of stones and trinkets which she had in a card box and the man was picking them up one by one and I suppose valuing them I was near enough to see such a darling little pearl cross with at least half a dozen really good pearls in it and had begun to covet them for my set when the lady glanced over my shoulder and she knew me in fact we knew one another and who do you think she was Well you ll not guess in a week and I can t wait so long so I may as well tell you at once she was that horrid old Mademoiselle Blassemare whom you pointed out to me at Elverston and I never forgot her face since nor she it seems mine for she turned away very quickly and when I next saw her her veil was down Did not you tell me Maud that you had lost your pearl cross while that dreadful Madame de la Rougierre was here Yes but I know but what has she to do with Mademoiselle de Blassemare you were going to say they are one and the same person Oh I perceive answered I with that dim sense of danger and dismay with which one hears suddenly of an enemy of whom one has lost sight for a time I ll write and tell Georgie to buy that cross I wager my life it is yours said Lady Knollys firmly The servants indeed made no secret of their opinion of Madame de la Rougierre and frankly charged her with a long list of larcenies Even Anne Wixted who had enjoyed her barren favour while the gouvernante was here hinted privately that she had bartered a missing piece of lace belonging to me with a gipsy pedlar for French gloves and an Irish poplin And so surely as I find it is yours I ll set the police in pursuit But you must not bring me into court said I half amused and half alarmed No occasion my dear Mary Quince and missus Rusk can prove it perfectly And why do you dislike her so very much I asked Cousin Monica leaned back in her chair and searched the cornice from corner to corner with upturned eyes for the reason and at last laughed a little amused at herself Well really it is not easy to define and perhaps it is not quite charitable but I know I hate her and I know you little hypocrite you hate her as much as I and we both laughed a little But you must tell me all you know of her history Her history echoed she I really know next to nothing about it only that I used to see her sometimes about the place that Georgina mentions and there were some unpleasant things said about her but you know they may be all lies The worst I know of her is her treatment of you and her robbing the desk Cousin Monica always called it her robbery and I think that s enough to hang her Suppose we go out for a walk So together we went and I resumed about Madame but no more could I extract perhaps there was not much more to hear CHAPTER XXX ON THE ROAD All at Knowl was indicative of the break up that was so near at hand Doctor Bryerly arrived according to promise He was in a whirl of business all the time He and mister Danvers conferred about the management of the estate It was agreed that the grounds and gardens should be let but not the house of which missus Rusk was to take the care The gamekeeper remained in office and some out door servants But the rest were to go except Mary Quince who was to accompany me to Bartram Haugh as my maid Don t part with Quince said Lady Knollys peremptorily they ll want you but don t She kept harping on this point and recurred to it half a dozen times every day They ll say you know that she is not fit for a lady s maid as she certainly is not if it in the least signified in such a wilderness as Bartram Haugh but she is attached trustworthy and honest and those are qualities valuable everywhere especially in a solitude Don t allow them to get you a wicked young French milliner in her stead Sometimes she said things that jarred unpleasantly on my nerves and left an undefined sense of danger Such as I know she s true to you and a good creature but is she shrewd enough Or with an anxious look I hope Mary Quince is not easily frightened Or suddenly Can Mary Quince write in case you were ill Or Can she take a message exactly Or Is she a person of any enterprise and resource and cool in an emergency Now these questions did not come all in a string as I write them down here but at long intervals and were followed quickly by ordinary talk but they generally escaped from my companion after silence and gloomy thought and though I could extract nothing more defined than these questions yet they seemed to me to point at some possible danger contemplated in my good cousin s dismal ruminations Another topic that occupied my cousin s mind a good deal was obviously the larceny of my pearl cross She made a note of the description furnished by the recollection respectively of Mary Quince missus Rusk and myself I had fancied her little vision of the police was no more than the result of a momentary impulse but really to judge by her methodical examinations of us I should have fancied that she had taken it up in downright earnest Having learned that my departure from Knowl was to be so very soon she resolved not to leave me before the day of my journey to Bartram Haugh and as day after day passed by and the hour of our leave taking approached she became more and more kind and affectionate A feverish and sorrowful interval it was to me Of Doctor Bryerly though staying in the house we saw almost nothing except for an hour or so at tea time He breakfasted very early and dined solitarily and at uncertain hours as business permitted The second evening of his visit Cousin Monica took occasion to introduce the subject of his visit to Bartram Haugh You saw him of course said Lady Knollys Yes he saw me he was not well On hearing who I was he asked me to go to his room where he sat in a silk dressing gown and slippers About business principally said Cousin Monica laconically That was despatched in very few words for he was quite resolved and placed his refusal upon grounds which it was difficult to dispute But difficult or no mind you he intimated that he would hear nothing more on the subject so that was closed Well and what is his religion now inquired she irreverently We had some interesting conversation on the subject He leans much to what we call the doctrine of correspondents He is read rather deeply in the writings of Swedenborg and seemed anxious to discuss some points with one who professes to be his follower To say truth I did not expect to find him either so well read or so deeply interested in the subject Was he angry when it was proposed that he should vacate the guardianship Not at all Contrariwise he said he had at first been so minded himself His years his habits and something of the unfitness of the situation the remoteness of Bartram Haugh from good teachers and all that had struck him and nearly determined him against accepting the office But then came the views which I stated in my letter and they governed him and nothing could shake them he said or induce him to re open the question in his own mind All the time Doctor Bryerly was relating his conference with the head of the family at Bartram Haugh my cousin commented on the narrative with a variety of little pishes and sneers which I thought showed more of vexation than contempt I was glad to hear all that Doctor Bryerly related It gave me a kind of confidence and I experienced a momentary reaction After all could Bartram Haugh be more lonely than I had found Knowl Was I not sure of the society of my Cousin Millicent who was about my own age Was it not quite possible that my sojourn in Derbyshire might turn out a happy though very quiet remembrance through all my after life Why should it not What time or place would be happy if we gave ourselves over to dismal imaginations So the summons reached me from Uncle Silas The hours at Knowl were numbered The evening before I departed I visited the full length portrait of Uncle Silas and studied it for the last time carefully with deep interest for many minutes but with results vaguer than ever With a brother so generous and so wealthy always ready to help him forward with his talents with his lithe and gorgeous beauty the shadow of which hung on that canvas what might he not have accomplished whom might he not have captivated And yet where and what was he A poor and shunned old man occupying a lonely house and place that did not belong to him married to degradation with a few years of suspected and solitary life before him and then swift oblivion his best portion I gazed on the picture to fix it well and vividly in my remembrance I might still trace some of its outlines and tints in its living original whom I was next day to see for the first time in my life So the morning came my last for many a day at Knowl a day of partings a day of novelty and regrets The travelling carriage and post horses were at the door Cousin Monica s carriage had just carried her away to the railway We had embraced with tears and her kind face was still before me and her words of comfort and promise in my ears The early sharpness of morning was still in the air the frosty dew still glistened on the window panes We had made a hasty breakfast my share of which was a single cup of tea The aspect of the house how strange Uncarpeted uninhabited doors for the most part locked all the servants but missus Rusk and Branston departed The drawing room door stood open and a charwoman was washing the bare floor I was looking my last for who could say how long on the old house and lingered The luggage was all up I made Mary Quince get in first for every delay was precious and now the moment was come I hugged and kissed missus Rusk in the hall God bless you Miss Maud darling You must not fret mind the time won t be long going over no time at all and you ll be bringing back a fine young gentleman who knows as great as the Duke of Wellington for your husband and I ll take the best of care of everything and the birds and the dogs till you come back and I ll go and see you and Mary if you ll allow in Derbyshire and so forth I got into the carriage and bid Branston who shut the door good bye and kissed hands to missus Rusk who was smiling and drying her eyes and courtesying on the hall door steps The dogs who had started gleefully with the carriage were called back by Branston and driven home wondering and wistful looking back with ears oddly cocked and tails dejected My heart thanked them for their kindness and I felt like a stranger and very desolate It was a bright clear morning It had been settled that it was not worth the trouble changing from the carriage to the railway for sake of five and twenty miles and so the entire journey of sixty miles was to be made by the post road the pleasantest travelling if the mind were free The grander and more distant features of the landscape we may see well enough from the window of the railway carriage but it is the foreground that interests and instructs us like a pleasant gossiping history and that we had in old days from the post chaise window It was more than travelling picquet Something of all conditions of life luxury and misery high spirits and low all sorts of costume livery rags millinery faces buxom faces wrinkled faces kind faces wicked no end of interest and suggestion passing in a procession silent and vivid and all in their proper scenery The golden corn sheafs the old dark alleyed orchards and the high streets of antique towns There were few dreams brighter few books so pleasant We drove by the dark wood it always looked dark to me where the mausoleum stands where my dear parents both lay now I gazed on its sombre masses not with a softened feeling but a peculiar sense of pain and was glad when it was quite past All the morning I had not shed a tear Good Mary Quince cried at leaving Knowl Lady Knollys eyes were not dry as she kissed and blessed me and promised an early visit and the dark lean energetic face of the housekeeper was quivering and her cheeks wet as I drove away But I whose grief was sorest never shed a tear I only looked about from one familiar object to another pale excited not quite apprehending my departure and wondering at my own composure But when we reached the old bridge with the tall osiers standing by the buttress and looked back at poor Knowl the places we love and are leaving look so fairy like and so sad in the clear distance and this is the finest view of the gabled old house with its slanting meadow lands and noble timber reposing in solemn groups I gazed at the receding vision and the tears came at last and I wept in silence long after the fair picture was hidden from view by the intervening uplands I was relieved and when we had made our next change of horses and got into a country that was unknown to me the new scenery and the sense of progress worked their accustomed effects on a young traveller who had lived a particularly secluded life and I began to experience on the whole a not unpleasurable excitement Mary Quince and I with the hopefulness of inexperienced travellers began already to speculate about our proximity to Bartram Haugh and were sorely disappointed when we heard from the nondescript courier more like a ostler than a servant who sat behind in charge of us and the luggage and represented my guardian s special care at nearly one o clock that we had still forty miles to go a considerable portion of which was across the high Derbyshire mountains before we reached Bartram Haugh The fact was we had driven at a pace accommodated rather to the convenience of the horses than to our impatience and finding at the quaint little inn where we now halted that we must wait for a nail or two in a loose shoe of one of our relay we consulted and being both hungry agreed to beguile the time with an early dinner which we enjoyed very sociably in a queer little parlour with a bow window and commanding with a litle garden for foreground a very pretty landscape Good Mary Quince like myself had quite dried her tears by this time and we were both highly interested and I a little nervous too about our arrival and reception at Bartram Some time of course was lost in this pleasant little parlour before we found ourselves once more pursuing our way The slowest part of our journey was the pull up the long mountain road ascending zig zag as sailors make way against a head wind by tacking I forget the name of the pretty little group of houses it did not amount to a village buried in trees where we got our four horses and two postilions for the work was severe I can only designate it as the place where Mary Quince and I had our tea very comfortably and bought some gingerbread very curious to look upon but quite uneatable The greater portion of the ascent when we were fairly upon the mountain was accomplished at a walk and at some particularly steep points we had to get out and go on foot But this to me was quite delightful I had never scaled a mountain before and the ferns and heath the pure boisterous air and above all the magnificent view of the rich country we were leaving behind now gorgeous and misty in sunset tints stretching in gentle undulations far beneath us quite enchanted me We had just reached the summit when the sun went down The low grounds at the other side were already lying in cold grey shadow and I got the man who sat behind to point out as well as he could the site of Bartram Haugh But mist was gathering over all by this time The filmy disk of the moon which was to light us on so soon as twilight faded into night hung high in air I tried to see the sable mass of wood which he described But it was vain and to acquire a clear idea of the place as of its master I must only wait that nearer view which an hour or two more would afford me And now we rapidly descended the mountain side The scenery was wilder and bolder than I was accustomed to Our road skirted the edge of a great heathy moor The silvery light of the moon began to glimmer and we passed a gipsy bivouac with fires alight and caldrons hanging over them It was the first I had seen Two or three low tents a couple of dark withered crones veritable witches a graceful girl standing behind gazing after us and men in odd shaped hats with gaudy waistcoats and bright coloured neck handkerchiefs and gaitered legs stood lazily in front They had all a wild tawdry display of colour and a group of alders in the rear made a background of shade for tents fires and figures I opened a front window of the chariot and called to the postboys to stop The groom from behind came to the window Are not those gipsies I enquired Yes please m them s gipsies sure Miss he answered glancing with that odd smile half contemptuous half superstitious with which I have since often observed the peasants of Derbyshire eyeing those thievish and uncanny neighbours CHAPTER XXXI BARTRAM HAUGH In a moment a tall lithe girl black haired black eyed and as I thought inexpressibly handsome was smiling with such beautiful rings of pearly teeth at the window and in her peculiar accent with a suspicion of something foreign in it proposing with many courtesies to tell the lady her fortune I had never seen this wild tribe of the human race before children of mystery and liberty Such vagabondism and beauty in the figure before me I looked at their hovels and thought of the night and wondered at their independence and felt my inferiority I could not resist She held up her slim oriental hand Yes I ll hear my fortune I said returning the sibyl s smile instinctively Give me some money Mary Quince No not that I said rejecting the thrifty sixpence she tendered for I had heard that the revelations of this weird sisterhood were bright in proportion to the kindness of their clients and was resolved to approach Bartram with cheerful auguries That five shilling piece I insisted and honest Mary reluctantly surrendered the coin So the feline beauty took it with courtesies and thankees smiling still and hid it away as if she stole it and looked on my open palm still smiling and told me to my surprise that there was somebody I liked very much and I was almost afraid she would name Captain Oakley that he would grow very rich and that I should marry him that I should move about from place to place a great deal for a good while to come That I had some enemies who should be sometimes so near as to be in the same room with me and yet they should not be able to hurt me That I should see blood spilt and yet not my own and finally be very happy and splendid like the heroine of a fairy tale Did this strange girlish charlatan see in my face some signs of shrinking when she spoke of enemies and set me down for a coward whose weakness might be profitable Very likely At all events she plucked a long brass pin with a round bead for a head from some part of her dress and holding the point in her fingers and exhibiting the treasure before my eyes she told me that I must get a charmed pin like that which her grandmother had given to her and she ran glibly through a story of all the magic expended on it and told me she could not part with it but its virtue was that you were to stick it through the blanket and while it was there neither rat nor cat nor snake and then came two more terms in the catalogue which I suppose belonged to the gipsy dialect and which she explained to mean as well as I could understand the first a malevolent spirit and the second a cove to cut your throat could approach or hurt you A charm like that she gave me to understand I must by hook or by crook obtain She had not a second None of her people in the camp over there possessed one I am ashamed to confess that I actually paid her a pound for this brass pin The purchase was partly an indication of my temperament which could never let an opportunity pass away irrevocably without a struggle and always apprehended Some day or other I ll reproach myself for having neglected it and partly a record of the trepidations of that period of my life At all events I had her pin and she my pound and I venture to say I was the gladder of the two She stood on the road side bank courtseying and smiling the first enchantress I had encountered and I watched the receding picture with its patches of firelight its dusky groups and donkey carts white as skeletons in the moonlight as we drove rapidly away They I suppose had a wild sneer and a merry laugh over my purchase as they sat and ate their supper of stolen poultry about their fire and were duly proud of belonging to the superior race Mary Quince shocked at my prodigality hinted a remonstrance It went to my heart Miss it did They re such a lot young and old all alike thieves and vagabonds and many a poor body wanting Tut Mary never mind Everyone has her fortune told some time in her life and you can t have a good one without paying I think Mary we must be near Bartram now The road now traversed the side of a steep hill parallel to which along the opposite side of a winding river rose the dark steeps of a corresponding upland covered with forest that looked awful and dim in the deep shadow while the moonlight rippled fitfully upon the stream beneath It seems to be a beautiful country I said to Mary Quince who was munching a sandwich in the corner and thus appealed to adjusted her bonnet and made an inspection from her window which however commanded nothing but the heathy slope of the hill whose side we were traversing Well Miss I suppose it is but there s a deal o mountains is not there And so saying honest Mary leaned back again and went on with her sandwich We were now descending at a great pace I knew we were coming near I stood up as well as I could in the carriage to see over the postilions heads I was eager but frightened too agitated as the crisis of the arrival and meeting approached At last a long stretch of comparatively level country below us with masses of wood as well as I could see irregularly overspreading it became visible as the narrow valley through which we were speeding made a sudden bend Down we drove and now I did perceive a change A great grass grown park wall overtopped with mighty trees but still on and on we came at a canter that seemed almost a gallop The old grey park wall flanking us at one side and a pretty pastoral hedgerow of ash trees irregularly on the other At last the postilions began to draw bridle and at a slight angle the moon shining full upon them we wheeled into a wide semicircle formed by the receding park walls and halted before a great fantastic iron gate and a pair of tall fluted piers of white stone all grass grown and ivy bound with great cornices surmounted with shields and supporters the Ruthyn bearings washed by the rains of Derbyshire for many a generation of Ruthyns almost smooth by this time and looking bleached and phantasmal like giant sentinels with each a hand clasped in his comrade s to bar our passage to the enchanted castle the florid tracery of the iron gate showing like the draperies of white robes hanging from their extended arms to the earth Our courier got down and shoved the great gate open and we entered between sombre files of magnificent forest trees one of those very broad straight avenues whose width measures the front of the house This was all built of white stone resembling that of Caen which parts of Derbyshire produce in such abundance So this was Bartram and here was Uncle Silas I was almost breathless as I approached The bright moon shining full on the white front of the old house revealed not only its highly decorated style its fluted pillars and doorway rich and florid carving and balustraded summit but also its stained and moss grown front Two giant trees overthrown at last by the recent storm lay with their upturned roots and their yellow foliage still flickering on the sprays that were to bloom no more where they had fallen at the right side of the court yard which like the avenue was studded with tufted weeds and grass All this gave to the aspect of Bartram a forlorn character of desertion and decay contrasting almost awfully with the grandeur of its proportions and richness of its architecture There was a ruddy glow from a broad window in the second row and I thought I saw some one peep from it and disappear at the same moment there was a furious barking of dogs some of whom ran scampering into the court yard from a half closed side door and amid their uproar the bawling of the man in the back seat who jumped down to drive them off and the crack of the postilions whips who struck at them we drew up before the lordly door steps of this melancholy mansion Just as our attendant had his hand on the knocker the door opened and we saw by a not very brilliant candle light three figures a shabby little old man thin and very much stooped with a white cravat and looking as if his black clothes were too large and made for some one else stood with his hand upon the door a young plump but very pretty female figure in unusually short petticoats with fattish legs and nice ankles in boots stood in the centre and a dowdy maid like an old charwoman behind her The household paraded for welcome was not certainly very brilliant Amid the riot the trunks were deliberately put down by our attendant who kept shouting to the old man at the door and to the dogs in turn and the old man was talking and pointing stiffly and tremulously but I could not hear what he said Was it possible could that mean looking old man be Uncle Silas The idea stunned me but I almost instantly perceived that he was much too small and I was relieved and even grateful It was certainly an odd mode of procedure to devote primary attention to the trunks and boxes leaving the travellers still shut up in the carriage of which they were by this time pretty well tired I was not sorry for the reprieve however being nervous about first impressions and willing to defer mine I sat shyly back peeping at the candle and moonlight picture before me myself unseen Will you tell yes or no is my cousin in the coach screamed the plump young lady stamping her stout black boot in a momentary lull Yes I was there sure And why the puck don t you let her out you stupe you Run down Giblets you never do nout without driving and let Cousin Maud out You re very welcome to Bartram This greeting was screamed at an amazing pitch and repeated before I had time to drop the window and say thank you I d a let you out myself there s a good dog you would na bite Cousin the parenthesis was to a huge mastiff who thrust himself beside her by this time quite pacified only I daren t go down the steps for the governor said I shouldn t The venerable person who went by the name of Giblets had by this time opened the carriage door and our courier or boots he looked more like the latter functionary had lowered the steps and in greater trepidation than I experienced when in after days I was presented to my sovereign I glided down to offer myself to the greeting and inspection of the plain spoken young lady who stood at the top of the steps to receive me She welcomed me with a hug and a hearty buss as she called that salutation on each cheek and pulled me into the hall and was evidently glad to see me And you re tired a bit I warrant and who s the old un who she asked eagerly in a stage whisper which made my ear numb for five minutes after Oh oh the maid and a precious old un ha ha ha But lawk how grand she is with her black silk cloak and crape and I only in twilled cotton and rotten old Coburg for Sundays Odds it s a shame but you ll be tired you will It s a smartish pull they do say from Knowl I know a spell of it only so far as the Cat and Fiddle near the Lunnon road Come up will you Would you like to come in first and talk a bit wi the governor Father you know he s a bit silly he is this while I found that the phrase meant only bodily infirmity He took a pain o Friday newralgie something or other he calls it rheumatics it is when it takes old Giblets there and he s sitting in his own room or maybe you d like better to come to your bedroom first for it is dirty work travelling they do say Yes I preferred the preliminary adjustment Mary Quince was standing behind me and as my voluble kinswoman talked on we had each ample time and opportunity to observe the personnel of the other and she made no scruple of letting me perceive that she was improving it for she stared me full in the face taking in evidently feature after feature and she felt the material of my mantle pretty carefully between her finger and thumb and manually examined my chain and trinkets and picked up my hand as she might a glove to con over my rings I can t say of course exactly what impression I may have produced on her But in my cousin Milly I saw a girl who looked younger than her years plump but with a slender waist with light hair lighter than mine and very blue eyes rather round on the whole very good looking She had an odd swaggering walk a toss of her head and a saucy and imperious but rather good natured and honest countenance She talked rather loud with a good ringing voice and a boisterous laugh when it came If I was behind the fashion what would Cousin Monica have thought of her She was arrayed as she had stated in black twilled cotton expressive of her affliction but it was made almost as short in the skirt as that of the prints of the Bavarian broom girls She had white cotton stockings and a pair of black leather boots with leather buttons and for a lady prodigiously thick soles which reminded me of the navvy boots I had so often admired in Punch I must add that the hands with which she assisted her scrutiny of my dress though pretty were very much sunburnt indeed And what s her name she demanded nodding to Mary Quince who was gazing on her awfully with round eyes as an inland spinster might upon a whale beheld for the first time Mary courtesied and I answered Mary Quince she repeated You re welcome Quince What shall I call her I ve a name for all o them Old Giles there is Giblets He did not like it first but he answers quick enough now and Old Lucy Wyat there nodding toward the old woman is Lucia de l Amour A slightly erroneous reading of Lammermoor for my cousin sometimes made mistakes and was not much versed in the Italian opera You know it s a play and I call her L Amour for shortness and she laughed hilariously and I could not forbear joining and winking at me she called aloud L Amour To which the crone with a high cauled cap resembling Mother Hubbard responded with a courtesy and Yes m Are all the trunks and boxes took up They were Well we ll come now and what shall I call you Quince Let me see According to your pleasure Miss answered Mary with dignity and a dry courtesy Why you re as hoarse as a frog Quince We ll call you Quinzy for the present That ll do Come along Quinzy So my Cousin Milly took me under the arm and pulled me forward but as we ascended she let me go leaning back to make inspection of my attire from a new point of view Hallo cousin she cried giving my dress a smack with her open hand What a plague do you want of all that bustle you ll leave it behind lass the first bush you jump over I was a good deal astounded I was also very near laughing for there was a sort of importance in her plump countenance and an indescribable grotesqueness in the fashion of her garments which heightened the outlandishness of her talk in a way which I cannot at all describe What palatial wide stairs those were which we ascended with their prodigious carved banisters of oak and each huge pillar on the landing place crowned with a shield and carved heraldic supporters florid oak panelling covered the walls But of the house I could form no estimate for Uncle Silas s housekeeping did not provide light for hall and passages and we were dependent on the glimmer of a single candle but there would be quite enough of this kind of exploration in the daylight So along dark oak flooring we advanced to my room and I had now an opportunity of admiring at my leisure the lordly proportions of the building Two great windows with dark and tarnished curtains rose half as high again as the windows of Knowl and yet Knowl in its own style is a fine house The door frames like the window frames were richly carved the fireplace was in the same massive style and the mantelpiece projected with a mass of very rich carving On the whole I was surprised I had never slept in so noble a room before The furniture I must confess was by no means on a par with the architectural pretensions of the apartment A French bed a piece of carpet about three yards square a small table two chairs a toilet table no wardrobe no chest of drawers The furniture painted white and of the light and diminutive kind was particularly ill adapted to the scale and style of the apartment one end only of which it occupied and that but sparsely leaving the rest of the chamber in the nakedness of a stately desolation My cousin Milly ran away to report progress to the Governor as she termed Uncle Silas Well Miss Maud I never did expect to see the like o that exclaimed honest Mary Quince Did you ever see such a young lady She s no more like one o the family than I am Law bless us and what s she dressed like Well well well And Mary with a rueful shake of her head clicked her tongue pathetically to the back of her teeth while I could not forbear laughing And such a scrap o furniture Well well well and the same ticking of the tongue followed But in a few minutes back came Cousin Milly and with a barbarous sort of curiosity assisted in unpacking my trunks and stowing away the treasures on which she ventured a variety of admiring criticisms in the presses which like cupboards filled recesses in the walls with great oak doors the keys of which were in them As I was making my hurried toilet she entertained me now and then with more strictly personal criticisms Your hair s a shade darker than mine it s none the better o that though is it Mine s said to be the right shade I don t know what do you say I conceded the point with a good grace I wish my hands was as white though you do lick me there but it s all gloves and I never could abide em I think I ll try though they are very white sure I wonder which is the prettiest you or me I don t know I m sure which do you think I laughed outright at this challenge and she blushed a little and for the first time seemed for a moment a little shy Well you are a half an inch longer than me I think don t you I was fully an inch taller so I had no difficulty in making the proposed admission Well you do look handsome doesn t she Quinzy lass but your frock comes down almost to your heels it does And she glanced from mine to hers and made a little kick up with the heel of the navvy boot to assist her in measuring the comparative distance Maybe mine s a thought too short she suggested Who s there Oh it s you is it she cried as Mother Hubbard appeared at the door Come in L Amour don t you know lass you re always welcome She had come to let us know that Uncle Silas would be happy to see me whenever I was ready and that my cousin Millicent would conduct me to the room where he awaited me In an instant all the comic sensations awakened by my singular cousin s eccentricities vanished and I was thrilled with awe I was about to see in the flesh faded broken aged but still identical that being who had been the vision and the problem of so many years of my short life CHAPTER XXXII UNCLE SILAS I thought my odd cousin was also impressed with a kind of awe though different in degree from mine for a shade overcast her face and she was silent as we walked side by side along the gallery accompanied by the crone who carried the candle which lighted us to the door of that apartment which I may call Uncle Silas s presence chamber Milly whispered to me as we approached Mind how you make a noise the governor s as sharp as a weasel and nothing vexes him like that She was herself toppling along on tiptoe We paused at a door near the head of the great staircase and L Amour knocked timidly with her rheumatic knuckles A voice clear and penetrating from within summoned us to enter The old woman opened the door and the next moment I was in the presence of Uncle Silas At the far end of a handsome wainscoted room near the hearth in which a low fire was burning beside a small table on which stood four waxlights in tall silver candlesticks sat a singular looking old man The dark wainscoting behind him and the vastness of the room in the remoter parts of which the light which fell strongly upon his face and figure expended itself with hardly any effect exhibited him with the forcible and strange relief of a finely painted Dutch portrait For some time I saw nothing but him A face like marble with a fearful monumental look and for an old man singularly vivid strange eyes the singularity of which rather grew upon me as I looked for his eyebrows were still black though his hair descended from his temples in long locks of the purest silver and fine as silk nearly to his shoulders He rose tall and slight a little stooped all in black with an ample black velvet tunic which was rather a gown than a coat with loose sleeves showing his snowy shirt some way up the arm and a pair of wrist buttons then quite out of fashion which glimmered aristocratically with diamonds I know I can t convey in words an idea of this apparition drawn as it seemed in black and white venerable bloodless fiery eyed with its singular look of power and an expression so bewildering was it derision or anguish or cruelty or patience The wild eyes of this strange old man were fixed upon me as he rose an habitual contraction which in certain lights took the character of a scowl did not relax as he advanced toward me with his thin lipped smile He said something in his clear gentle but cold voice the import of which I was too much agitated to catch and he took both my hands in his welcomed me with a courtly grace which belonged to another age and led me affectionately with many inquiries which I only half comprehended to a chair near his own I need not introduce my daughter she has saved me that mortification You ll find her I believe good natured and affectionate au reste I fear a very rustic Miranda and fitted rather for the society of Caliban than of a sick old Prospero Is it not so Millicent The old man paused sarcastically for an answer with his eyes fixed severely on my odd cousin who blushed and looked uneasily to me for a hint I don t know who they be neither one nor t other Very good my dear he replied with a little mocking bow You see my dear Maud what a Shakespearean you have got for a cousin It s plain however she has made acquaintance with some of our dramatists she has studied the role of Miss Hoyden so perfectly It was not a reasonable peculiarity of my uncle that he resented with a good deal of playful acrimony my poor cousin s want of education for which if he were not to blame certainly neither was she You see her poor thing a result of all the combined disadvantages of want of refined education refined companionship and I fear naturally of refined tastes but a sojourn at a good French conventual school will do wonders and I hope to manage by and by In the meantime we jest at our misfortunes and love one another I hope cordially He extended his thin white hand with a chilly smile towards Milly who bounced up and took it with a frightened look and he repeated holding her hand rather slightly I thought Yes I hope very cordially and then turning again to me he put it over the arm of his chair and let it go as a man might drop something he did not want from a carriage window Having made this apology for poor Milly who was plainly bewildered he passed on to her and my relief to other topics every now and then expressing his fears that I was fatigued and his anxiety that I should partake of some supper or tea but these solicitudes somehow seemed to escape his remembrance almost as soon as uttered and he maintained the conversation which soon degenerated into a close and to me a painful examination respecting my dear father s illness and its symptoms upon which I could give no information and his habits upon which I could Perhaps he fancied that there might be some family predisposition to the organic disease of which his brother died and that his questions were directed rather to the prolonging of his own life than to the better understanding of my dear father s death How little was there left to this old man to make life desirable and yet how keenly I afterwards found he clung to it Have we not all of us seen those to whom life was not only undesirable but positively painful a mere series of bodily torments yet hold to it with a desperate and pitiable tenacity old children or young it is all the same See how a sleepy child will put off the inevitable departure for bed The little creature s eyes blink and stare and it needs constant jogging to prevent his nodding off into the slumber which nature craves His waking is a pain he is quite worn out and peevish and stupid and yet he implores a respite and deprecates repose and vows he is not sleepy even to the moment when his mother takes him in her arms and carries him in a sweet slumber to the nursery So it is with us old children of earth and the great sleep of death and nature our kind mother Just so reluctantly we part with consciousness the picture is even to the last so interesting the bird in the hand though sick and moulting so inestimably better than all the brilliant tenants of the bush We sit up yawning and blinking and stupid the whole scene swimming before us and the stories and music humming off into the sound of distant winds and waters It is not time yet we are not fatigued we are good for another hour still and so protesting against bed we falter and drop into the dreamless sleep which nature assigns to fatigue and satiety He then spoke a little eulogy of his brother very polished and indeed in a kind of way eloquent He possessed in a high degree that accomplishment too little cultivated I think by the present generation of expressing himself with perfect precision and fluency There was too a good deal of slight illustrative quotation and a sprinkling of French flowers over his conversation which gave to it a character at once elegant and artificial It was all easy light and pointed and being quite new to me had a wonderful fascination He then told me that Bartram was the temple of liberty that the health of a whole life was founded in a few years of youth air and exercise and that accomplishments at least if not education should wait upon health Therefore while at Bartram I should dispose of my time quite as I pleased and the more I plundered the garden and gipsied in the woodlands the better Then he told me what a miserable invalid he was and how the doctors interfered with his frugal tastes A glass of beer and a mutton chop his ideal of a dinner he dared not touch They made him drink light wines which he detested and live upon those artificial abominations all liking for which vanishes with youth There stood on a side table in its silver coaster a long necked Rhenish bottle and beside it a thin pink glass and he quivered his fingers in a peevish way toward them But unless he found himself better very soon he would take his case into his own hands and try the dietary to which nature pointed He waved his fingers toward his bookcases and told me his books were altogether at my service during my stay but this promise ended I must confess disappointingly At last remarking that I must be fatigued he rose and kissed me with a solemn tenderness placed his hand upon what I now perceived to be a large Bible with two broad silk markers red and gold folded in it the one I might conjecture indicating the place in the Old the other in the New Testament It stood on the small table that supported the waxlights with a handsome cut bottle of eau de cologne his gold and jewelled pencil case and his chased repeater chain and seals beside it There certainly were no indications of poverty in Uncle Silas s room and he said impressively Remember that book in it your father placed his trust in it he found his reward in it lives my only hope consult it my beloved niece day and night as the oracle of life Then he laid his thin hand on my head and blessed me and then kissed my forehead No a exclaimed Cousin Milly s lusty voice I had quite forgotten her presence and looked at her with a little start She was seated on a very high old fashioned chair she had palpably been asleep her round eyes were blinking and staring glassily at us and her white legs and navvy boots were dangling in the air Have you anything to remark about Noah enquired her father with a polite inclination and an ironical interest No a she repeated in the same blunt accents I didn t snore did I No a The old man smiled and shrugged a little at me it was the smile of disgust Good night my dear Maud and turning to her he said with a peculiar gentle sharpness Had not you better wake my dear and try whether your cousin would like some supper So he accompanied us to the door outside which we found L Amour s candle awaiting us I m awful afraid of the Governor I am Did I snore that time No dear at least I did not hear it I said unable to repress a smile Well if I didn t I was awful near it she said reflectively We found poor Mary Quince dozing over the fire but we soon had tea and other good things of which Milly partook with a wonderful appetite I was in a qualm about it said Milly who by this time was quite herself again When he spies me a napping maybe he don t fetch me a prod with his pencil case over the head Odd girl it is sore When I contrasted the refined and fluent old gentleman whom I had just left with this amazing specimen of young ladyhood I grew sceptical almost as to the possibility of her being his child I was to learn however how little she had I won t say of his society but even of his presence that she had no domestic companion of the least pretensions to education that she ran wild about the place never except in church so much as saw a person of that rank to which she was born and that the little she knew of reading and writing had been picked up in desultory half hours from a person who did not care a pin about her manners or decorum and perhaps rather enjoyed her grotesqueness and that no one who was willing to take the least trouble about her was competent to make her a particle more refined than I saw her the wonder ceased We don t know how little is heritable and how much simply training until we encounter some such spectacle as that of my poor cousin Milly When I lay down in my bed and reviewed the day it seemed like a month of wonders Uncle Silas was always before me the voice so silvery for an old man so preternaturally soft the manners so sweet so gentle the aspect smiling suffering spectral It was no longer a shadow I had now seen him in the flesh But after all was he more than a shadow to me When I closed my eyes I saw him before me still in necromantic black ashy with a pallor on which I looked with fear and pain a face so dazzlingly pale and those hollow fiery awful eyes It sometimes seemed as if the curtain opened and I had seen a ghost I had seen him but he was still an enigma and a marvel The living face did not expound the past any more than the portrait portended the future He was still a mystery and a vision and thinking of these things I fell asleep Mary Quince who slept in the dressing room the door of which was close to my bed and lay open to secure me against ghosts called me up and the moment I knew where I was I jumped up and peeped eagerly from the window It commanded the avenue and court yard but we were many windows removed from that over the hall door and immediately beneath ours lay the two giant lime trees prostrate and uprooted which I had observed as we drove up the night before I saw more clearly in the bright light of morning the signs of neglect and almost of dilapidation which had struck me as I approached The court yard was tufted over with grass seldom from year to year crushed by the carriage wheels or trodden by the feet of visitors This melancholy verdure thickened where the area was more remote from the centre and under the windows and skirting the walls to the left was reinforced by a thick grove of nettles The avenue was all grass grown except in the very centre where a narrow track still showed the roadway The handsome carved balustrade of the court yard was discoloured with lichens and in two places gapped and broken and the air of decay was heightened by the fallen trees among whose sprays and yellow leaves the small birds were hopping Before my toilet was completed in marched my cousin Milly We were to breakfast alone that morning and so much the better she told me Sometimes the Governor ordered her to breakfast with him and never left off chaffing her till his newspaper came and sometimes he said such things he made her cry and then he only boshed her more and packed her away to her room but she was by chalks nicer than him talk as he might Was not she nicer was not she was not she Upon this point she was so strong and urgent that I was obliged to reply by a protest against awarding the palm of elegance between parent and child and declaring I liked her very much which I attested by a kiss I know right well which of us you do think s the nicest and no mistake only you re afraid of him and he had no business boshing me last night before you I knew he was at it though I couldn t twig him altogether but wasn t he a sneak now wasn t he This was a still more awkward question so I kissed her again and said she must never ask me to say of my uncle in his absence anything I could not say to his face At which speech she stared at me for a while and then treated me to one of her hearty laughs after which she seemed happier and gradually grew into better humour with her father Sometimes when the curate calls he has me up for he s as religious as six he is and they read Bible and prays ho don t they You ll have that lass like me to go through and maybe I don t hate it oh no We breakfasted in a small room almost a closet off the great parlour which was evidently quite disused Nothing could be homelier than our equipage or more shabby than the furniture of the little apartment Still somehow I liked it It was a total change but one likes roughing it a little at first CHAPTER XXXIII THE WINDMILL WOOD I had not time to explore this noble old house as my curiosity prompted for Milly was in such a fuss to set out for the blackberry dell that I saw little more than just so much as I necessarily traversed in making my way to and from my room The actual decay of the house had been prevented by my dear father and the roof windows masonry and carpentry had all been kept in repair But short of indications of actual ruin there are many manifestations of poverty and neglect which impress with a feeling of desolation It was plain that not nearly a tithe of this great house was inhabited long corridors and galleries stretched away in dust and silence and were crossed by others whose dark arches inspired me in the distance with an awful sort of sadness It was plainly one of those great structures in which you might easily lose yourself and with a pleasing terror it reminded me of that delightful old abbey in missus Radcliffe s romance among whose silent staircases dim passages and long suites of lordly but forsaken chambers begirt without by the sombre forest the family of La Mote secured a gloomy asylum My cousin Milly and I however were bent upon an open air ramble and traversing several passages she conducted me to a door which led us out upon a terrace overgrown with weeds and by a broad flight of steps we descended to the level of the grounds beneath Then on over the short grass under the noble trees we walked Milly in high good humour and talking away volubly in her short garment navvy boots and a weather beaten hat She carried a stick in her gloveless hand Her conversation was quite new to me and resembled very much what I would have fancied the holiday recollections of a schoolboy and the language in which it was sustained was sometimes so outlandish that I was forced to laugh outright a demonstration which she plainly did not like Her talk was about the great jumps she had made how she snow balled the chaps in winter how she could slide twice the length of her stick beyond Briddles the cow boy With this and similar conversation she entertained me The grounds were delightfully wild and neglected But we had now passed into a vast park beautifully varied with hollows and uplands and such glorious old timber massed and scattered over its slopes and levels Among these we got at last into a picturesque dingle the grey rocks peeped from among the ferns and wild flowers and the steps of soft sward along its sides were dark in the shadows of silver stemmed birch and russet thorn and oak under which in the vaporous night the Erl king and his daughter might glide on their aerial horses In the lap of this pleasant dell were the finest blackberry bushes I think I ever saw bearing fruit quite fabulous and plucking these and chatting we rambled on very pleasantly I had first thought of Milly s absurdities to which in description I cannot do justice simply because so many details have by distance of time escaped my recollection But her ways and her talk were so indescribably grotesque that she made me again and again quiver with suppressed laughter But there was a pitiable and even a melancholy meaning underlying the burlesque This creature with no more education than a dairy maid I gradually discovered had fine natural aptitudes for accomplishment a very sweet voice and wonderfully delicate ear and a talent for drawing which quite threw mine into the shade It was really astonishing Poor Milly in all her life had never read three books and hated to think of them One over which she was wont to yawn and sigh and stare fatiguedly for an hour every Sunday by command of the Governor was a stout volume of sermons of the earlier school of George III and a drier collection you can t fancy I don t think she read anything else But she had notwithstanding ten times the cleverness of half the circulating library misses one meets with Besides all this I had a long sojourn before me at Bartram Haugh and I had learned from Milly as I had heard before what a perennial solitude it was with a ludicrous fear of learning Milly s preposterous dialect and turning at last into something like her So I resolved to do all I could for her teach her whatever I knew if she would allow me and gradually if possible effect some civilising changes in her language and as they term it in boarding schools her demeanour But I must pursue at present our first day s ramble in what was called Bartram Chase People can t go on eating blackberries always so after a while we resumed our walk along this pretty dell which gradually expanded into a wooded valley level beneath and enclosed by irregular uplands receding as it were in mimic bays and harbours at some points and running out at others into broken promontories ending in clumps of forest trees Just where the glen which we had been traversing expanded into this broad but wooded valley it was traversed by a high and close paling which although it looked decayed was still very strong In this there was a wooden gate rudely but strongly constructed and at the side we were approaching stood a girl who was leaning against the post with one arm resting on the top of the gate This girl was neither tall nor short taller than she looked at a distance she had not a slight waist sooty black was her hair with a broad forehead perpendicular but low she had a pair of very fine dark lustrous eyes and no other good feature unless I may so call her teeth which were very white and even Her face was rather short and swarthy as a gipsy s observant and sullen too and she did not move only eyed us negligently from under her dark lashes as we drew near Altogether a not unpicturesque figure with a dusky red petticoat of drugget and tattered jacket of bottle green stuff with short sleeves which showed her brown arms from the elbow That s Pegtop s daughter said Milly Who is Pegtop I asked He s the miller see yonder it is and she pointed to a very pretty feature in the landscape a windmill crowning the summit of a hillock which rose suddenly above the level of the treetops like an island in the centre of the valley The mill not going to day Beauty bawled Milly No a Beauty it baint replied the girl loweringly and without stirring And what s gone with the stile demanded Milly aghast It s tore away from the paling Well so it be replied the wood nymph in the red petticoat showing her fine teeth with a lazy grin Who s a bin and done all that demanded Milly Not you nor me lass said the girl Twas old Pegtop your father did it cried Milly in rising wrath Appen it wor she replied And the gate locked That s it the gate locked she repeated sulkily with a defiant side glance at Milly And where s Pegtop At t other side somewhere how should I know where he be she replied Who s got the key Here it be lass she answered striking her hand on her pocket And how durst you stay us here Unlock it huzzy this minute cried Milly with a stamp Her answer was a sullen smile Open the gate this instant bawled Milly Well I won t I expected that Milly would have flown into a frenzy at this direct defiance but she looked instead puzzled and curious the girl s unexpected audacity bewildered her Why you fool I could get over the paling as soon as look at you but I won t What s come over you Open the gate I say or I ll make you Do let her alone dear I entreated fearing a mutual assault She has been ordered may be not to open it Is it so my good girl Well thou rt not the biggest fool o the two she observed commendatively thou saint hit it lass And who ordered you exclaimed Milly Fayther Old Pegtop Well that s summat to laugh at it is our servant a shutting us out of our own grounds No servant o yourn Come lass what do you mean He be old Silas s miller and what s that to thee With these words the girl made a spring on the hasp of the padlock and then got easily over the gate Can t you do that cousin whispered Milly to me with an impatient nudge I wish you d try No dear come away Milly and I began to withdraw Lookee lass twill be an ill day s work for thee when I tell the Governor said Milly addressing the girl who stood on a log of timber at the other side regarding us with a sullen composure We ll be over in spite o you cried Milly You lie answered she And why not huzzy demanded my cousin who was less incensed at the affront than I expected All this time I was urging Milly in vain to come away Yon lass is no wild cat like thee that s why said the sturdy portress If I cross I ll give you a knock said Milly And I ll gi thee another she answered with a vicious wag of the head Come Milly I ll go if you don t I said But we must not be beat whispered she vehemently catching my arm and ye shall get over and see what I will gi her I ll not get over Then I ll break the door for ye shall come through exclaimed Milly kicking the stout paling with her ponderous boot Purr it purr it purr it cried the lass in the red petticoat with a grin Do you know who this lady is cried Milly suddenly She is a prettier lass than thou answered Beauty She s my cousin Maud Miss Ruthyn of Knowl and she s a deal richer than the Queen and the Governor s taking care of her and he ll make old Pegtop bring you to reason The girl eyed me with a sulky listlessness a little inquisitively I thought See if he don t threatened Milly You positively must come I said drawing her away with me Well shall we come in cried Milly trying a last summons You ll not come in that much she answered surlily measuring an infinitesimal distance on her finger with her thumb which she pinched against it the gesture ending with a snap of defiance and a smile that showed her fine teeth I ve a mind to shy a stone at you shouted Milly Faire away I ll shy wi ye as long as ye like lass take heed o yerself and Beauty picked up a round stone as large as a cricket ball With difficulty I got Milly away without an exchange of missiles and much disgusted at my want of zeal and agility Well come along cousin I know an easy way by the river when it s low answered Milly She s a brute is not she As we receded we saw the girl slowly wending her way towards the old thatched cottage which showed its gable from the side of a little rugged eminence embowered in spreading trees and dangling and twirling from its string on the end of her finger the key for which a battle had so nearly been fought The stream was low enough to make our flank movement round the end of the paling next it quite easy and so we pursued our way and Milly s equanimity returned and our ramble grew very pleasant again Our path lay by the river bank and as we proceeded the dwarf timber was succeeded by grander trees which crowded closer and taller and at last the scenery deepened into solemn forest and a sudden sweep in the river revealed the beautiful ruin of a steep old bridge with the fragments of a gate house on the farther side Oh Milly darling I exclaimed what a beautiful drawing this would make I should so like to make a sketch of it So it would Make a picture do here s a stone that s pure and flat to sit upon and you look very tired Do make it and I ll sit by you Yes Milly I am tired a little and I will sit down but we must wait for another day to make the picture for we have neither pencil nor paper But it is much too pretty to be lost so let us come again to morrow To morrow be hanged you ll do it to day bury me wick but you shall I m wearying to see you make a picture and I ll fetch your conundrums out o your drawer for do t you shall CHAPTER XXXIV ZAMIEL It was all vain my remonstrating She vowed that by crossing the stepping stones close by she could by a short cut reach the house and return with my pencils and block book in a quarter of an hour Away then with many a jump and fling scampered Milly s queer white stockings and navvy boots across the irregular and precarious stepping stones over which I dared not follow her so I was fain to return to the stone so pure and flat on which I sat enjoying the grand sylvan solitude the dark background and the grey bridge mid way so tall and slim across whose ruins a sunbeam glimmered and the gigantic forest trees that slumbered round opening here and there in dusky vistas and breaking in front into detached and solemn groups It was the setting of a dream of romance It would have been the very spot in which to read a volume of German folk lore and the darkening colonnades and silent nooks of the forest seemed already haunted with the voices and shadows of those charming elves and goblins As I sat here enjoying the solitude and my fancies among the low branches of the wood at my right I heard a crashing and saw a squat broad figure in a stained and tattered military coat and loose short trousers one limb of which flapped about a wooden leg He was forcing himself through His face was rugged and wrinkled and tanned to the tint of old oak his eyes black beadlike and fierce and a shock of sooty hair escaped from under his battered wide awake nearly to his shoulders This forbidding looking person came stumping and jerking along toward me whisking his stick now and then viciously in the air and giving his fell of hair a short shake like a wild bull preparing to attack I stood up involuntarily with a sense of fear and surprise almost fancying I saw in that wooden legged old soldier the forest demon who haunted Der Freischuetz So he approached shouting Hollo you how came you here Dost eer And he drew near panting and sometimes tugging angrily in his haste at his wooden leg which sunk now and then deeper than was convenient in the sod This exertion helped to anger him and when he halted before me his dark face smirched with smoke and dust and the nostrils of his flat drooping nose expanded and quivered as he panted like the gills of a fish an angrier or uglier face it would not be easy to fancy Ye ll all come when ye like will ye and do nout but what pleases yourselves won t you And who rt thou Dost eer who are ye I say and what the deil seek ye in the woods here Come bestir thee If his wide mouth and great tobacco stained teeth his scowl and loud discordant tones were intimidating they were also extremely irritating The moment my spirit was roused my courage came I am Miss Ruthyn of Knowl and mister Silas Ruthyn your master is my uncle Hoo he exclaimed more gently an if Silas be thy uncle thou lieutenant be come to live wi him and thou rt she as come overnight eh I made no answer but I believe I looked both angrily and disdainfully And what make ye alone here and how was I to know t an Milly not wi ye nor no one But Maud or no Maud I wouldn t let the Dooke hisself set foot inside the palin without Silas said let him And you may tell Silas them s the words o Dickon Hawkes and I ll stick to m and what s more I ll tell him myself I will I ll tell him there be no use o my striving and straining hee day an night and night and day watchin again poachers and thieves and gipsies and they robbing lads if rules won t be kep and folk do jist as they pleases Dang it lass thou rt in luck I didn t heave a brick at thee when I saw thee first I ll complain of you to my uncle I replied So do and and appen thou lieutenant find thyself in the wrong box lass thou canst na say I set the dogs arter thee nor cau d thee so much as a wry name nor heave a stone at thee did I Well and where s the complaint then I simply answered rather fiercely Be good enough to leave me Well I make no objections mind I m takin thy word thou rt Maud Ruthyn appen thou be saint and appen thou baint I m not aweer on t but I takes thy word and all I want to know s just this did Meg open the gate to thee I made him no answer and to my great relief I saw Milly striding and skipping across the unequal stepping stones Hallo Pegtop what are you after now she cried as she drew near This man has been extremely impertinent You know him Milly I said Why that s Pegtop Dickon Dirty old Hawkes that never was washed I tell you lad ye ll see what the Governor thinks o t a ha He ll talk to you I done or said nout not but I should and there s the fack she can t deny t she hadn t a hard word from I and I don t care the top o that thistle what no one says not I But I tell thee Milly I stopped some o thy pranks and I ll stop more Ye ll be shying no more stones at the cattle Tell your tales and welcome cried Milly I wish I was here when you jawed cousin If Winny was here she d catch you by the timber toe and put you on your back Ay she ll be a good un yet if she takes arter thee retorted the old man with a fierce sneer Drop it and get away wi ye cried she or maybe I d call Winny to smash your timber leg for you A ha there s more on t She s a sweet un Isn t she he replied sardonically You did not like it last Easter when Winny broke it with a kick Twas a kick o a horse he growled with a glance at me Twas no such thing twas Winny did it and he laid on his back for a week while carpenter made him a new one And Milly laughed hilariously I ll fool no more wi ye losing my time I won t but mind ye I ll speak wi Silas And going away he put his hand to his crumpled wide awake and said to me with a surly difference Good evening Miss Ruthyn good evening ma am and ye ll please remember I did not mean nout to vex thee And so he swaggered away jerking and waddling over the sward and was soon lost in the wood It s well he s a little bit frightened I never saw him so angry I think he is awful mad Perhaps he really is not aware how very rude he is I suggested I hate him We were twice as pleasant with poor Tom Driver he never meddled with any one and was always in liquor Old Gin was the name he went by But this brute I do hate him he comes from Wigan I think and he s always spoiling sport and he whops Meg that s Beauty you know and I don t think she d be half as bad only for him Listen to him whistlin I did hear whistling at some distance among the trees I declare if he isn t callin the dogs Climb up here I tell ye and we climbed up the slanting trunk of a great walnut tree and strained our eyes in the direction from which we expected the onset of Pegtop s vicious pack But it was a false alarm Well I don t think he would do that after all hardly but he is a brute sure And that dark girl who would not let us through is his daughter is she Yes that s Meg Beauty I christened her when I called him Beast but I call him Pegtop now and she s Beauty still and that s the way o t Come sit down now an make your picture she resumed so soon as we had dismounted from our position of security I m afraid I m hardly in the vein I don t think I could draw a straight line My hand trembles I wish you could Maud said Milly with a look so wistful and entreating that considering the excursion she had made for the pencils I could not bear to disappoint her Well Milly we must only try and if we fail we can t help it Sit you down beside me and I ll tell you why I begin with one part and not another and you ll see how I make trees and the river and yes that pencil it is hard and answers for the fine light lines but we must begin at the beginning and learn to copy drawings before we attempt real views like this And if you wish it Milly I m resolved to teach you everything I know which after all is not a great deal and we shall have such fun making sketches of the same landscapes and then comparing And so on Milly quite delighted and longing to begin her course of instruction sat down beside me in a rapture and hugged and kissed me so heartily that we were very near rolling together off the stone on which we were seated Her boisterous delight and good nature helped to restore me and both laughing heartily together I commenced my task Dear me who s that I exclaimed suddenly as looking up from my block book I saw the figure of a slight man in the careless morning dress of a gentleman crossing the ruinous bridge in our direction with considerable caution upon the precarious footing of the battlement which alone offered an unbroken passage This was a day of apparitions Milly recognised him instantly The gentleman was mister Carysbroke He had taken The Grange only for a year He lived quite to himself and was very good to the poor and was the only gentleman for ever so long who had visited at Bartram and oddly enough nowhere else But he wanted leave to cross through the grounds and having obtained it had repeated his visit partly induced no doubt by the fact that Bartram boasted no hospitalities and that there was no risk of meeting the county folk there With a stout walking stick in his hand and a short shooting coat and a wide awake hat in much better trim than Zamiel s he emerged from the copse that covered the bridge walking at a quick but easy pace He ll be goin to see old Snoddles I guess said Milly looking a little frightened and curious for Milly I need not say was a bumpkin and stood in awe of this gentleman s good breeding though she was as brave as a lion and would have fought the Philistines at any odds with the jawbone of an ass Appen he won t see us whispered Milly hopefully But he did and raising his hat with a cheerful smile that showed very white teeth he paused Charming day Miss Ruthyn I raised my head suddenly as he spoke from habit appropriating the address it was so marked that he raised his hat respectfully to me and then continued to Milly mister Ruthyn I hope quite well but I need hardly ask you seem so happy Will you kindly tell him that I expect the book I mentioned in a day or two and when it comes I ll either send or bring it to him immediately Milly and I were standing by this time but she only stared at him tongue tied her cheeks rather flushed and her eyes very round and to facilitate the dialogue as I suppose he said again He s quite well I hope Still no response from Milly and I provoked though myself a little shy made answer My uncle mister Ruthyn is very well thank you and I felt that I blushed as I spoke Ah pray excuse me may I take a great liberty you are Miss Ruthyn of Knowl Will you think me very impertinent I m afraid you will if I venture to introduce myself My name is Carysbroke and I had the honour of knowing poor mister Ruthyn when I was quite a little boy and he has shown a kindness for me since and I hope you will pardon the liberty I fear I ve taken I think my friend Lady Knollys too is a relation of yours what a charming person she is Oh is not she such a darling I said and then blushed at my outspoken affection But he smiled kindly as if he liked me for it and he said You know whatever I think I dare not quite say that but frankly I can quite understand it She preserves her youth so wonderfully and her fun and her good nature are so entirely girlish What a sweet view you have selected he continued changing all at once I ve stood just at this point so often to look back at that exquisite old bridge Do you observe you re an artist I see something very peculiar in that tint of the grey with those odd cross stains of faded red and yellow I do indeed I was just remarking the peculiar beauty of the colouring was not I Milly Milly stared at me and uttered an alarmed Yes and looked as if she had been caught in a robbery Yes and you have so very peculiar a background he resumed It was better before the storm though but it is very good still Then a little pause and Do you know this country at all rather suddenly No not in the least that is I ve only had the drive to this place but what I did see interested me very much You will be charmed with it when you know it better the very place for an artist I m a wretched scribbler myself and I carry this little book in my pocket and he laughed deprecatingly while he drew forth a thin fishing book as it looked They are mere memoranda you see I walk so much and come unexpectedly on such pretty nooks and studies I just try to make a note of them but it is really more writing than sketching my sister says it is a cipher which nobody but myself understands However I ll try and explain just two because you really ought to go and see the places Oh no not that he laughed as accidentally the page blew over that s the Cat and Fiddle a curious little pot house where they gave me some very good ale one day Milly at this exhibited some uneasy tokens of being about to speak but not knowing what might be coming I hastened to observe on the spirited little sketches to which he meant to draw my attention I want to show you only the places within easy reach a short ride or drive So he proceeded to turn over two or three in addition to the two he had at first proposed and then another then a little sketch just tinted and really quite a charming little gem of Cousin Monica s pretty gabled old house and every subject had its little criticism or its narrative or adventure As he was about returning this little sketch book to his pocket still chatting to me he suddenly recollected poor Milly who was looking rather lowering but she brightened a good deal as he presented it to her with a little speech which she palpably misunderstood for she made one of her odd courtesies and was about I thought to put it into her large pocket and accept it as a present Look at the drawings Milly and then return it I whispered At his request I allowed him to look at my unfinished sketch of the bridge and while he was measuring distances and proportions with his eye Milly whispered rather angrily to me And why should I Because he wants it back and only meant to lend it to you whispered I Lend it to me and after you Bury me wick if I look at a leaf of it she retorted in high dudgeon Take it lass give it him yourself I ll not and she popped it into my hand and made a sulky step back My cousin is very much obliged I said returning the book and smiling for her and he took it smiling also and said I think if I had known how very well you draw Miss Ruthyn I should have hesitated about showing you my poor scrawls But these are not my best you know Lady Knollys will tell you that I can really do better a great deal better I think And then with more apologies for what he called his impertinence he took his leave and I felt altogether very much pleased and flattered He could not be more than twenty nine or thirty I thought and he was decidedly handsome that is his eyes and teeth and clear brown complexion were and there was something distinguished and graceful in his figure and gesture and altogether there was the indescribable attraction of intelligence and I fancied though this of course was a secret that from the moment he spoke to us he felt an interest in me I am not going to be vain It was a grave interest but still an interest for I could see him studying my features while I was turning over his sketches and he thought I saw nothing else It was flattering too his anxiety that I should think well of his drawing and referring me to Lady Knollys Carysbroke had I ever heard my dear father mention that name I could not recollect it But then he was habitually so silent that his not doing so argued nothing CHAPTER XXXV WE VISIT A ROOM IN THE SECOND STOREY mister Carysbroke amused my fancy sufficiently to prevent my observing Milly s silence till we had begun our return homeward The Grange must be a pretty house if that little sketch be true is it far from this Twill be two mile Are you vexed Milly I asked for both her tone and looks were angry Yes I am vexed and why not lass What has happened Well now that is rich Why look at that fellow Carysbroke he took no more notice to me than a dog and kep talking to you all the time of his pictures and his walks and his people Why a pig s better manners than that But Milly dear you forget he tried to talk to you and you would not answer him I expostulated And is not that just what I say I can t talk like other folk ladies I mean Every one laughs at me an I m dressed like a show I am It s a shame I saw Polly Shives what a lady she is my eyes laughing at me in church last Sunday I was minded to give her a bit of my mind An I know I m queer It s a shame it is Why should I be so rum it is a shame I don t want to be so nor it isn t my fault And poor Milly broke into a flood of tears and stamped on the ground and buried her face in her short frock which she whisked up to her eyes and an odder figure of grief I never beheld And I could not make head or tail of what he was saying cried poor Milly through her buff cotton with a stamp and you twigged every word o t An why am I so It s a shame a shame Oh ho ho it s a shame But my dear Milly we were talking of drawing and you have not learned yet but you shall I ll teach you and then you ll understand all about it An every one laughs at me even you though you try Maud you can scarce keep from laughing sometimes I don t blame you for I know I m queer but I can t help it and it s a shame Well my dear Milly listen to me if you allow me I assure you I ll teach you all the music and drawing I know You have lived very much alone and as you say ladies have a way of speaking of their own that is different from the talk of other people Yes that they have an gentlemen too like the Governor and that Carysbroke and a precious lingo it is dang it why the devil himself could not understand it an I m like a fool among you I could most drown myself It s a shame It is you know it is It s a shame But I ll teach you that lingo too if you wish it Milly and you shall know everything that I know and I ll manage to have your dresses better made By this time she was looking very ruefully but attentively in my face her round eyes and nose swelled and her cheeks all wet I think if they were a little longer yours is longer you know and the sentence was interrupted by a sob Now Milly you must not be crying if you choose you may be just as the same as any other lady and you shall and you will be very much admired I can tell you if only you will take the trouble to quite unlearn all your odd words and ways and dress yourself like other people and I will take care of that if you let me and I think you are very clever Milly and I know you are very pretty Poor Milly s blubbered face expanded into a smile in spite of herself but she shook her head looking down Noa noa Maud I fear twon t be And indeed it seemed I had proposed to myself a labour of Hercules But Milly was really a clever creature could see quickly and when her ungainly dialect was mastered describe very pleasantly and if only she would endure the restraint and possessed the industry requisite I did not despair and was resolved at least to do my part Poor Milly she was really very grateful and entered into the project of her education with great zeal and with a strange mixture of humility and insubordination Milly was in favour of again attacking Beauty s position on her return and forcing a passage from this side but I insisted on following the route by which we had arrived and so we got round the paling by the river and were treated to a provoking grin of defiance by Beauty who was talking across the gate to a slim young man arrayed in fustian and with an odd looking cap of rabbit skin on his head which on seeing us he pulled sheepishly to the side of his face next to us as he lounged with his arm under his chin on the top bar of the gate After our encounter of to day indeed it was Miss Beauty s wont to exhibit a kind of jeering disdain in her countenance whenever we passed I think Milly would have engaged her again had I not reminded her of her undertaking and exerted my new authority Look at that sneak Pegtop there going up the path to the mill He makes belief now he does not see us but he does though only he s afraid we ll tell the Governor and he thinks Governor won t give him his way with you I hate that Pegtop he stopped me o riding the cows a year ago he did I thought Pegtop might have done worse Indeed it was plain that a total reformation was needed here and I was glad to find that poor Milly seemed herself conscious of it and that her resolution to become more like other people of her station was not a mere spasm of mortification and jealousy but a genuine and very zealous resolve I had not half seen this old house of Bartram Haugh yet At first indeed I had but an imperfect idea of its extent There was a range of rooms along one side of the great gallery with closed window shutters and the doors generally locked Old L Amour grew cross when we went into them although we could see nothing and Milly was afraid to open the windows not that any Bluebeard revelations were apprehended but simply because she knew that Uncle Silas s order was that things should be left undisturbed and this boisterous spirit stood in awe of him to a degree which his gentle manners and apparent quietude rendered quite surprising There were in this house what certainly did not exist at Knowl and what I have never observed thought they may possibly be found in other old houses I mean here and there very high hatches which we could only peep over by jumping in the air They crossed the long corridors and great galleries and several of them were turned across and locked so as to intercept the passage and interrupt our explorations Milly however knew a queer little very steep and dark back stair which reached the upper floor so she and I mounted and made a long ramble through rooms much lower and ruder in finish than the lordly chambers we had left below These commanded various views of the beautiful though neglected grounds but on crossing a gallery we entered suddenly a chamber which looked into a small and dismal quadrangle formed by the inner walls of this great house and of course designed only by the architect to afford the needful light and air to portions of the structure I rubbed the window pane with my handkerchief and looked out The surrounding roof was steep and high The walls looked soiled and dark The windows lined with dust and dirt and the window stones were in places tufted with moss and grass and groundsel An arched doorway had opened from the house into this darkened square but it was soiled and dusty and the damp weeds that overgrew the quadrangle drooped undisturbed against it It was plain that human footsteps tracked it little and I gazed into that blind and sinister area with a strange thrill and sinking This is the second floor there is the enclosed court yard I as it were soliloquised What are you afraid of Maud you look as ye d seen a ghost exclaimed Milly who came to the window and peeped over my shoulder It reminded me suddenly Milly of that frightful business What business Maud what a plague are ye thinking on demanded Milly rather amused It was in one of these rooms maybe this yes it certainly was this for see the panelling has been pulled off the wall that mister Charke killed himself I was staring ruefully round the dim chamber in whose corners the shadows of night were already gathering Charke what about him who s Charke asked Milly Why you must have heard of him said I Not as I m aware on answered she And he killed himself did he hanged himself eh or blowed his brains out He cut his throat in one of these rooms this one I m sure for your papa had the wainscoting stripped from the wall to ascertain whether there was any second door through which a murderer could have come and you see these walls are stripped and bear the marks of the woodwork that has been removed I answered Well that was awful I don t know how they have pluck to cut their throats if I was doing it I d like best to put a pistol to my head and fire like the young gentleman did they say in Deadman s Hollow But the fellows that cut their throats they must be awful game lads I m thinkin for it s a long slice you know Don t don t Milly dear Suppose we come away I said for the evening was deepening rapidly into night Hey and bury me wick but here s the blood don t you see a big black cloud all spread over the floor hereabout don t ye see Milly was stooping over the spot and tracing the outline of this perhaps imaginary mapping in the air with her finger No Milly you could not see it the floor is too dark and it s all in shadow It must be fancy and perhaps after all this is not the room Well I think I m sure it is Stand just look We ll come in the morning and if you are right we can see it better then Come away I said growing frightened And just as we stood up to depart the white high cauled cap and large sallow features of old L Amour peeped in at the door Lawk what brings you here cried Milly nearly as much startled as I at the intrusion What brings you here miss whistled L Amour through her gums We re looking where Charke cut his throat replied Milly Charke the devil said the old woman with an odd mixture of scorn and fury Tisn t his room and come ye out of it please Master won t like when he hears how you keep pulling Miss Maud from one room to another all through the house up and down She was gabbling sternly enough but dropped a low courtesy as I passed her and with a peaked and nodding stare round the room the old woman clapped the door sharply and locked it And who has been a talking about Charke a pack o lies I warrant I s pose you want to frighten Miss Maud here another crippled courtesy wi ghosts and like nonsense You re out there twas she told me and much about it Ghosts indeed I don t vally them not I if I did I know who d frighten me and Milly laughed The old woman stuffed the key in her pocket and her wrinkled mouth pouted and receded with a grim uneasiness A harmless brat and kind she is but wild wild she will be wild So whispered L Amour in my ear during the silence that followed nodding shakily toward Milly over the banister and she courtesied again as we departed and shuffled off toward Uncle Silas s room The Governor is queerish this evening said Milly when we were seated at our tea You never saw him queerish did you You must say what you mean more plainly Milly You don t mean ill I hope Well I don t know what it is but he does grow very queer sometimes you d think he was dead a most maybe two or three days and nights together He sits all the time like an old woman in a swound Well well it is awful Is he insensible when in that state I asked a good deal alarmed I don t know but it never signifies anything It won t kill him I do believe but old L Amour knows all about it I hardly ever go into the room when he s so only when I m sent for and he sometimes wakes up and takes a fancy to call for this one or that One day he sent for Pegtop all the way to the mill and when he came he only stared at him for a minute or two and ordered him out o the room He s like a child a most when he s in one o them dazes I always knew when Uncle Silas was queerish by the injunctions of old L Amour whistled and spluttered over the banister as we came up stairs to mind how we made a noise passing master s door and by the sound of mysterious to ings and fro ings about his room I saw very little of him He sometimes took a whim to have us breakfast with him which lasted perhaps for a week and then the order of our living would relapse into its old routine I must not forget two kind letters from Lady Knollys who was detained away and delighted to hear that I enjoyed my quiet life and promised to apply in person to Uncle Silas for permission to visit me She was to be for the Christmas at Elverston and that was only six miles away from Bartram Haugh so I had the excitement of a pleasant look forward She also said that she would include poor Milly in her invitation and a vision of Captain Oakley rose before me with his handsome gaze turned in wonder on poor Milly for whom I had begun to feel myself responsible CHAPTER XXXVI AN ARRIVAL AT DEAD OF NIGHT I have sometimes been asked why I wear an odd little turquois ring which to the uninstructed eye appears quite valueless and altogether an unworthy companion of those jewels which flash insultingly beside it It is a little keepsake of which I became possessed about this time Come lass what name shall I give you cried Milly one morning bursting into my room in a state of alarming hilarity My own Milly No but you must have a nickname like every one else Don t mind it Milly Yes but I will Shall I call you missus Bustle You shall do no such thing But you must have a name I refuse a name But I ll give you one lass And I won t have it But you can t help me christening you I can decline answering But I ll make you said Milly growing very red Perhaps there was something provoking in my tone for I certainly was very much disgusted at Milly s relapse into barbarism You can t I retorted quietly See if I don t and I ll give ye one twice as ugly I smiled I fear disdainfully And I think you re a minx and a slut and a fool she broke out flushing scarlet I smiled in the same unchristian way And I d give ye a smack o the cheek as soon as look at you And she gave her dress a great slap and drew near me in her wrath I really thought she was about tendering the ordeal of single combat I made her however a paralysing courtesy and with immense dignity sailed out of the room and into Uncle Silas s study where it happened we were to breakfast that morning and for several subsequent ones During the meal we maintained the most dignified reserve and I don t think either so much as looked at the other We had no walk together that day I was sitting in the evening quite alone when Milly entered the room Her eyes were red and she looked very sullen I want your hand cousin she said at the same time taking it by the wrist and administering with it a sudden slap on her plump cheek which made the room ring and my fingers tingle and before I had recovered from my surprise she had vanished I called after her but no answer I pursued but she was running too and I quite lost her at the cross galleries I did not see her at tea nor before going to bed but after I had fallen asleep I was awakened by Milly in floods of tears Cousin Maud will ye forgi me you ll never like me again will ye No I know ye won t I m such a brute I hate it it s a shame And here s a Banbury cake for you I sent to the town for it and some taffy won t ye eat it and here s a little ring tisn t as pretty as your own rings and ye ll wear it maybe for my sake poor Milly s sake before I was so bad to ye if ye forgi me and I ll look at breakfast and if it s on your finger I ll know you re friends wi me again and if ye don t I won t trouble you no more and I think I ll just drown myself out o the way and you ll never see wicked Milly no more And without waiting a moment leaving me only half awake and with the sensations of dreaming she scampered from the room in her bare feet with a petticoat about her shoulders She had left her candle by my bed and her little offerings on the coverlet by me If I had stood an atom less in terror of goblins than I did I should have followed her but I was afraid I stood in my bare feet at my bedside and kissed the poor little ring and put it on my finger where it has remained ever since and always shall And when I lay down longing for morning the image of her pale imploring penitential face was before me for hours and I repented bitterly of my cool provoking ways and thought myself I dare say justly a thousand times more to blame than Milly I searched in vain for her before breakfast At that meal however we met but in the presence of Uncle Silas who though silent and apathetic was formidable and we sitting at a table disproportionably large under the cold strange gaze of my guardian talked only what was inevitable and that in low tones for whenever Milly for a moment raised her voice Uncle Silas would wince place his thin white fingers quickly over his ear and look as if a pain had pierced his brain and then shrug and smile piteously into vacancy When Uncle Silas therefore was not in the talking vein himself and that was not often you may suppose there was very little spoken in his presence When Milly across the table saw the ring upon my finger she drawing in her breath said Oh and with round eyes and mouth she looked so delighted and she made a little motion as if she was on the point of jumping up and then her poor face quivered and she bit her lip and staring imploringly at me her eyes filled fast with tears which rolled down her round penitential cheeks I am sure I felt more penitent than she I know I was crying and smiling and longing to kiss her I suppose we were very absurd but it is well that small matters can stir the affections so profoundly at a time of life when great troubles seldom approach us When at length the opportunity did come never was such a hug out of the wrestling ring as poor Milly bestowed on me swaying me this way and that and burying her face in my dress and blubbering I was so lonely before you came and you so good to me and I such a devil and I ll never call you a name but Maud my darling Maud You must Milly missus Bustle I ll be missus Bustle or anything you like You must I was blubbering like Milly and hugging my best and indeed I wonder how we kept our feet So Milly and I were better friends than ever Meanwhile the winter deepened and we had short days and long nights and long fireside gossipings at Bartram Haugh I was frightened at the frequency of the strange collapses to which Uncle Silas was subject I did not at first mind them much for I naturally fell into Milly s way of talking about them But one day while in one of his queerish states he called for me and I saw him and was unspeakably scared In a white wrapper he lay coiled in a great easy chair I should have thought him dead had I not been accompanied by old L Amour who knew every gradation and symptom of these strange affections She winked and nodded to me with a ghastly significance and whispered Don t make no noise miss till he talks he ll come to for a bit anon Except that there was no sign of convulsions the countenance was like that of an epileptic arrested in one of his contortions There was a frown and smirk like that of idiotcy and a strip of white eyeball was also disclosed Suddenly with a kind of chilly shudder he opened his eyes wide and screwed his lips together and blinked and stared on me with a fatuised uncertainty that gradually broke into a feeble smile Ah the girl Austin s child Well dear I m hardly able I ll speak to morrow next day it is tic neuralgia or something torture tell her So huddling himself together he lay again in his great chair with the same inexpressible helplessness in his attitude and gradually his face resumed its dreadful cast Come away miss he s changed his mind he ll not be fit to talk to you noways all day maybe said the old woman again in a whisper So forth we stole from the room I unspeakably shocked In fact he looked as if he were dying and so in my agitation I told the crone who forgetting the ceremony with which she usually treated me chuckled out derisively A dying is he Well he be like Saint Paul he s bin a dying daily this many a day I looked at her with a chill of horror She did not care I suppose what sort of feelings she might excite for she went on mumbling sarcastically to herself I had paused and overcame my reluctance to speak to her again for I was really very much frightened Do you think he is in danger Shall we send for a doctor I whispered Law bless ye the doctor knows all about it miss The old woman s face had a gleam of that derision which is so shocking in the features of feebleness and age But it is a fit it is paralytic or something horrible it can t be safe to leave him to chance or nature to get through these terrible attacks There s no fear of him tisn t no fits at all he s nout the worse o t Jest silly a bit now and again It s been the same a dozen year and more and the doctor knows all about it answered the old woman sturdily And ye ll find he ll be as mad as bedlam if ye make any stir about it That night I talked the matter over with Mary Quince They re very dark miss but I think he takes a deal too much laudlum said Mary To this hour I cannot say what was the nature of those periodical seizures I have often spoken to medical men about them since but never could learn that excessive use of opium could altogether account for them It was I believe certain however that he did use that drug in startling quantities It was indeed sometimes a topic of complaint with him that his neuralgia imposed this sad necessity upon him The image of Uncle Silas as I had seen him that day troubled and affrighted my imagination as I lay in my bed I had slept very well since my arrival at Bartram So much of the day was passed in the open air and in active exercise that this was but natural But that night I was nervous and wakeful and it was past two o clock when I fancied I heard the sound of horses and carriage wheels on the avenue Mary Quince was close by and therefore I was not afraid to get up and peep from the window My heart beat fast as I saw a post chaise approach the court yard A front window was let down and the postilion pulled up for a few seconds In consequence of some directions received by him I fancied he resumed his route at a walk and so drew up at the hall door on the steps of which a figure awaited his arrival I think it was old L Amour but I could not be quite certain There was a lantern on the top of the balustrade close by the door The chaise lamps were lighted for the night was rather dark A bag and valise as well as I could see were pulled from the interior by the post boy and a box from the top of the vehicle and these were carried into the hall I was obliged to keep my cheek against the window pane to command a view of the point of debarkation and my breath upon the glass which dimmed it again almost as fast as I wiped it away helped to obscure my vision But I saw a tall figure in a cloak get down and swiftly enter the house but whether male or female I could not discern My heart beat fast I jumped at once to a conclusion My uncle was worse was in fact dying and this was the physician too late summoned to his bedside I listened for the ascent of the doctor and his entrance at my uncle s door which in the stillness of the night I thought I might easily hear but no sound reached me I listened so for fully five minutes but without result I returned to the window but the carriage and horses had disappeared I was strongly tempted to wake Mary Quince and take counsel with her and persuade her to undertake a reconnoissance The fact is I was persuaded that my uncle was in extremity and I was quite wild to know the doctor s opinion But after all it would be cruel to summon the good soul from her refreshing nap So as I began to feel very cold I returned to my bed where I continued to listen and conjecture until I fell asleep In the morning as was usual before I was dressed in came Milly How is Uncle Silas I eagerly enquired Old L Amour says he s queerish still but he s not so dull as yesterday answered she Was not the doctor sent for I asked Was he Well that s odd and she said never a word o t to me answered she I m asking only said I I don t know whether he came or no she replied but what makes you take that in your head A chaise arrived here between two and three o clock last night Hey and who told you Milly seemed all on a sudden highly interested I saw it Milly and some one I fancy the doctor came from it into the house Fudge lass who d send for the doctor Twasn t he I tell you What was he like said Milly I could only see clearly that he or she was tall and wore a cloak I replied Then twasn t him nor t other I was thinking on neither and I ll be hanged but I think it will be Cormoran cried Milly with a thoughtful rap with her knuckle on the table Precisely at this juncture a tapping came to the door Come in said I And old L Amour entered the room with a courtesy I came to tell Miss Quince her breakfast s ready said the old lady Who came in the chaise L Amour demanded Milly What chaise spluttered the beldame tartly The chaise that came last night past two o clock said Milly That s a lie and a damn lie cried the beldame There worn t no chaise at the door since Miss Maud there come from Knowl I stared at the audacious old menial who could utter such language Yes there was a chaise and Cormoran as I think be come in it said Milly who seemed accustomed to L Amour s daring address And there s another damn lie as big as the t other said the crone her haggard and withered face flushing orange all over I beg you will not use such language in my room I replied very angrily I saw the chaise at the door your untruth signifies very little but your impertinence here I will not permit Should it be repeated I will assuredly complain to my uncle The old woman flushed more fiercely as I spoke and fixed her bleared glare on me with a compression of her mouth that amounted to a wicked grimace She resisted her angry impulse however and only chuckled a little spitefully saying No offence miss it be a way we has in Derbyshire o speaking our minds No offence miss were meant and none took as I hopes and she made me another courtesy And I forgot to tell you Miss Milly the master wants you this minute So Milly in mute haste withdrew followed closely by L Amour CHAPTER XXXVII DOCTOR BRYERLY EMERGES When Milly joined me at breakfast her eyes were red and swollen She was still sniffing with that little sobbing hiccough which betrays even were there no other signs recent violent weeping She sat down quite silent Is he worse Milly I enquired anxiously No nothing s wrong wi him he s right well said Milly fiercely What s the matter then Milly dear The poisonous old witch Twas just to tell the Gov nor how I d said twas Cormoran that came by the po shay last night And who is Cormoran I enquired Ay there it is I d like to tell and you want to hear and I just daren t for he ll send me off right to a French school hang it hang them all if I do And why should Uncle Silas care said I a good deal surprised They re a tellin lies Who said I L Amour that s who So soon as she made her complaint of me the Gov nor asked her sharp enough did anyone come last night or a po shay and she was ready to swear there was no one Are ye quite sure Maud you really did see aught or appen twas all a dream It was no dream Milly so sure as you are there I saw exactly what I told you I replied Gov nor won t believe it anyhow and he s right mad wi me and he threatens me he ll have me off to France I wish twas under the sea I hate France I do like the devil Don t you They re always a threatening me wi France if I dare say a word more about the po shay or or anyone I really was curious about Cormoran but Cormoran was not to be defined to me by Milly nor did she in reality know more than I respecting the arrival of the night before One day I was surprised to see Doctor Bryerly on the stairs I was standing in a dark gallery as he walked across the floor of the lobby to my uncle s door his hat on and some papers in his hand He did not see me and when he had entered Uncle Silas s door I went down and found Milly awaiting me in the hall So Doctor Bryerly is here I said That s the thin fellow wi the sharp look and the shiny black coat that went up just now asked Milly Yes he s gone into your papa s room said I Appen twas he come tother night He may be staying here though we see him seldom for it s a barrack of a house it is The same thought had struck me for a moment but was dismissed immediately It certainly was not Doctor Bryerly s figure which I had seen So without any new light gathered from this apparition we went on our way and made our little sketch of the ruined bridge We found the gate locked as before and as Milly could not persuade me to climb it we got round the paling by the river s bank While at our drawing we saw the swarthy face sooty locks and old weather stained red coat of Zamiel who was glowering malignly at us from among the trunks of the forest trees and standing motionless as a monumental figure in the side aisle of a cathedral When we looked again he was gone Although it was a fine mild day for the wintry season we yet cloaked as we were could not pursue so still an occupation as sketching for more than ten or fifteen minutes As we returned in passing a clump of trees we heard a sudden outbreak of voices angry and expostulatory and saw under the trees the savage old Zamiel strike his daughter with his stick two great blows one of which was across the head Beauty ran only a short distance away while the swart old wood demon stumped lustily after her cursing and brandishing his cudgel My blood boiled I was so shocked that for a moment I could not speak but in a moment more I screamed You brute How dare you strike the poor girl She had only run a few steps and turned about confronting him and us her eyes gleaming fire her features pale and quivering to suppress a burst of weeping Two little rivulets of blood were trickling over her temple I say fayther look at that she said with a strange tremulous smile lifting her hand which was smeared with blood Perhaps he was ashamed and the more enraged on that account for he growled another curse and started afresh to reach her whirling his stick in the air Our voices however arrested him My uncle shall hear of your brutality The poor girl Strike him Meg if he does it again and pitch his leg into the river to night when he s asleep I d serve you the same and out came an oath You d have her lick her fayther would ye Look out And he wagged his head with a scowl at Milly and a flourish of his cudgel Be quiet Milly I whispered for Milly was preparing for battle and I again addressed him with the assurance that on reaching home I would tell my uncle how he had treated the poor girl Tis you she may thank for t a wheedling o her to open that gate he snarled That s a lie we went round by the brook cried Milly I did not think proper to discuss the matter with him and looking very angry and I thought a little put out he jerked and swayed himself out of sight I merely repeated my promise of informing my uncle as he went to which over his shoulder he bawled Silas won t mind ye that snapping his horny finger and thumb The girl remained where she had stood wiping the blood off roughly with the palm of her hand and looking at it before she rubbed it on her apron My poor girl I said you must not cry I ll speak to my uncle about you But she was not crying She raised her head and looked at us a little askance with a sullen contempt I thought And you must have these apples won t you We had brought in our basket two or three of those splendid apples for which Bartram was famous I hesitated to go near her these Hawkeses Beauty and Pegtop were such savages So I rolled the apples gently along the ground to her feet She continued to look doggedly at us with the same expression and kicked away the apples sullenly that approached her feet Then wiping her temple and forehead in her apron without a word she turned and walked slowly away Poor thing I m afraid she leads a hard life What strange repulsive people they are When we reached home at the head of the great staircase old L Amour was awaiting me and with a courtesy and very respectfully she informed me that the Master would be happy to see me Could it be about my evidence as to the arrival of the mysterious chaise that he summoned me to this interview Gentle as were his ways there was something undefinable about Uncle Silas which inspired fear and I should have liked few things less than meeting his gaze in the character of a culprit There was an uncertainty too as to the state in which I might find him and a positive horror of beholding him again in the condition in which I had last seen him I entered the room then in some trepidation but was instantly relieved Uncle Silas was in the same health apparently and as nearly as I could recollect it in precisely the same rather handsome though negligent garb in which I had first seen him Doctor Bryerly what a marked and vulgar contrast and yet somehow how reassuring sat at the table near him and was tying up papers His eyes watched me I thought with an anxious scrutiny as I approached and I think it was not until I had saluted him that he recollected suddenly that he had not seen me before at Bartram and stood up and greeted me in his usual abrupt and somewhat familiar way It was vulgar and not cordial and yet it was honest and indefinably kind Up rose my uncle that strangely venerable pale portrait in his loose Rembrandt black velvet How gentle how benignant how unearthly and inscrutable I need not say how she is Those lilies and roses Doctor Bryerly speak their own beautiful praises of the air of Bartram I almost regret that her carriage will be home so soon I only hope it may not abridge her rambles It positively does me good to look at her It is the glow of flowers in winter and the fragrance of a field which the Lord hath blessed Country air Miss Ruthyn is a right good kitchen to country fare I like to see young women eat heartily You have had some pounds of beef and mutton since I saw you last said doctor Bryerly And this sly speech made he scrutinised my countenance in silence rather embarrassingly My system Doctor Bryerly as a disciple of Aesculapius you will approve health first accomplishment afterwards The Continent is the best field for elegant instruction and we must see the world a little by and by Maud and to me if my health be spared there would be an unspeakable though a melancholy charm in the scenes where so many happy though so many wayward and foolish young days were passed and I think I should return to these picturesque solitudes with perhaps an increased relish You remember old Chaulieu s sweet lines Desert aimable solitude Sejour du calme et de la paix Asile ou n entrerent jamais Le tumulte et l inquietude I can t say that care and sorrow have not sometimes penetrated these sylvan fastnesses but the tumults of the world thank Heaven never There was a sly scepticism I thought in Doctor Bryerly s sharp face and hardly waiting for the impressive never he said I forgot to ask who is your banker Oh Bartlet and Hall Lombard Street answered Uncle Silas dryly and shortly doctor Bryerly made a note of it with an expression of face which seemed with a sly resolution to say You shan t come the anchorite over me I saw Uncle Silas s wild and piercing eye rest suspiciously on me for a moment as if to ascertain whether I felt the spirit of Doctor Bryerly s almost interruption and nearly at the same moment stuffing his papers into his capacious coat pockets Doctor Bryerly rose and took his leave When he was gone I bethought me that now was a good opportunity of making my complaint of Dickon Hawkes Uncle Silas having risen I hesitated and began Uncle may I mention an occurrence which I witnessed Certainly child he answered fixing his eye sharply on me I really think he fancied that the conversation was about to turn upon the phantom chaise So I described the scene which had shocked Milly and me an hour or so ago in the Windmill Wood You see my dear child they are rough persons their ideas are not ours their young people must be chastised and in a way and to a degree that we would look upon in a serious light I ve found it a bad plan interfering in strictly domestic misunderstandings and should rather not But he struck her violently on the head uncle with a heavy cudgel and she was bleeding very fast Ah said my uncle dryly And only that Milly and I deterred him by saying that we would certainly tell you he would have struck her again and I really think if he goes on treating her with so much violence and cruelty he may injure her seriously or perhaps kill her Why you romantic little child people in that rank of life think absolutely nothing of a broken head answered Uncle Silas in the same way But is it not horrible brutality uncle To be sure it is brutality but then you must remember they are brutes and it suits them said he I was disappointed I had fancied that Uncle Silas s gentle nature would have recoiled from such an outrage with horror and indignation and instead here he was the apologist of that savage ruffian Dickon Hawkes And he is always so rude and impertinent to Milly and to me I continued Oh impertinent to you that s another matter I must see to that Nothing more my dear child Well there was nothing more He s a useful servant Hawkes and though his looks are not prepossessing and his ways and language rough yet he is a very kind father and a most honest man a thoroughly moral man though severe a very rough diamond though and has no idea of the refinements of polite society I venture to say he honestly believes that he has been always unexceptionably polite to you so we must make allowances And Uncle Silas smoothed my hair with his thin aged hand and kissed my forehead Yes we must make allowances we must be kind What says the Book Judge not that ye be not judged Your dear father acted upon that maxim so noble and so awful and I strive to do so Alas dear Austin longo intervalle far behind and you are removed my example and my help you are gone to your rest and I remain beneath my burden still marching on by bleak and alpine paths under the awful night O nuit nuit douloureuse O toi tardive aurore Viens tu vas tu venir es tu bien loin encore And repeating these lines of Chenier with upturned eyes and one hand lifted and an indescribable expression of grief and fatigue he sank stiffly into his chair and remained mute with eyes closed for some time Then applying his scented handkerchief to them hastily and looking very kindly at me he said Anything more dear child Nothing uncle thank you very much only about that man Hawkes I dare say that he does not mean to be so uncivil as he is but I am really afraid of him and he makes our walks in that direction quite unpleasant I understand quite my dear I will see to it and you must remember that nothing is to be allowed to vex my beloved niece and ward during her stay at Bartram nothing that her old kinsman Silas Ruthyn can remedy So with a tender smile and a charge to shut the door perfectly but without clapping it he dismissed me Doctor Bryerly had not slept at Bartram but at the little inn in Feltram and he was going direct to London as I afterwards learned Your ugly doctor s gone away in a fly said Milly as we met on the stairs she running up I down On reaching the little apartment which was our sitting room however I found that she was mistaken for Doctor Bryerly with his hat and a great pair of woollen gloves on and an old Oxford grey surtout that showed his lank length to advantage buttoned all the way up to his chin had set down his black leather bag on the table and was reading at the window a little volume which I had borrowed from my uncle s library It was Swedenborg s account of the other worlds Heaven and Hell He closed it on his finger as I entered and without recollecting to remove his hat he made a step or two towards me with his splay creaking boots With a quick glance at the door he said Glad to see you alone for a minute very glad But his countenance on the contrary looked very anxious CHAPTER XXXVIII A MIDNIGHT DEPARTURE I m going this minute I I want to know another glance at the door are you really quite comfortable here Quite I answered promptly You have only your cousin s company he continued glancing at the table which was laid for two Yes but Milly and I are very happy together That s very nice but I think there are no teachers you see painters and singers and that sort of thing that is usual with young ladies No teachers of that kind of any kind are there No my uncle thinks it better I should lay in a store of health he says I know and the carriage and horses have not come how soon are they expected I really can t say and I assure you I don t much care I think running about great fun You walk to church Yes Uncle Silas s carriage wants a new wheel he told me Ay but a young woman of your rank you know it is not usual she should be without the use of a carriage Have you horses to ride I shook my head Your uncle you know has a very liberal allowance for your maintenance and education I remembered something in the will about it and Mary Quince was constantly grumbling that he did not spend a pound a week on our board I answered nothing but looked down Another glance at the door from Doctor Bryerly s sharp black eyes Is he kind to you Very kind most gentle and affectionate Why doesn t he keep company with you Does he ever dine with you or drink tea or talk to you Do you see much of him He is a miserable invalid his hours and regimen are peculiar Indeed I wish very much you would consider his case he is I believe often insensible for a long time and his mind in a strange feeble state sometimes I dare say worn out in his young days and I saw that preparation of opium in his bottle he takes too much Why do you think so Doctor Bryerly It s made on water the spirit interferes with the use of it beyond a certain limit You have no idea what those fellows can swallow Read the Opium Eater I knew two cases in which the quantity exceeded De Quincy s Aha it s new to you and he laughed quietly at my simplicity And what do you think his complaint is I asked Pooh I haven t a notion but probably one way or another he has been all his days working on his nerves and his brain These men of pleasure who have no other pursuit use themselves up mostly and pay a smart price for their sins And so he s kind and affectionate but hands you over to your cousin and the servants Are his people civil and obliging Well I can t say much for them there is a man named Hawkes and his daughter who are very rude and even abusive sometimes and say they have orders from my uncle to shut us out from a portion of the grounds but I don t believe that for Uncle Silas never alluded to it when I was making my complaint of them to day From what part of the grounds is that asked Doctor Bryerly sharply I described the situation as well as I could Can we see it from this he asked peeping from the window Oh no Doctor Bryerly made a note in his pocket book here and I said But I am really quite sure it was a story of Dickon s he is such a surly disobliging man And what sort is that old servant that came in and out of his room Oh that is old L Amour I answered rather indirectly and forgetting that I was using Milly s nickname And is she civil he asked No she certainly was not a most disagreeable old woman with a vein of wickedness I thought I had heard her swearing They don t seem to be a very engaging lot said Doctor Bryerly but where there s one there will be more See here I was just reading a passage and he opened the little volume at the place where his finger marked it and read for me a few sentences the purport of which I well remember although of course the words have escaped me It was in that awful portion of the book which assumes to describe the condition of the condemned and it said that independently of the physical causes in that state operating to enforce community of habitation and an isolation from superior spirits there exist sympathies aptitudes and necessities which would of themselves induce that depraved gregariousness and isolation too And what of the rest of the servants are they better he resumed We saw little or nothing of the others except of old Giblets the butler who went about like a little automaton of dry bones poking here and there and whispering and smiling to himself as he laid the cloth and seeming otherwise quite unconscious of an external world This room is not got up like mister Ruthyn s does he talk of furnishings and making things a little smart No Well I must say I think he might Here there was a little silence and Doctor Bryerly with his accustomed simultaneous glance at the door said in low cautious tones very distinctly Have you been thinking at all over that matter again I mean about getting your uncle to forego his guardianship I would not mind his first refusal You could make it worth his while unless he that is unless he s very unreasonable indeed and I think you would consult your interest Miss Ruthyn by doing so and if possible getting out of this place But I have not thought of it at all I am much happier here than I had at all expected and I am very fond of my cousin Milly How long have you been here exactly I told him It was some two or three months Have you seen your other cousin yet the young gentleman No H m Aren t you very lonely he enquired We see no visitors here but that you know I was prepared for Doctor Bryerly read the wrinkles on his splay boot intently and peevishly and tapped the sole lightly on the ground Yes it is very lonely and the people a bad lot You d be pleasanter somewhere else with Lady Knollys for instance eh Well there certainly But I am very well here really the time passes very pleasantly and my uncle is so kind I have only to mention anything that annoys me and he will see that it is remedied he is always impressing that on me Yes it is not a fit place for you said Doctor Bryerly Of course about your uncle he resumed observing my surprised look it is all right but he s quite helpless you know At all events think about it Here s my address Hans Emmanuel Bryerly M D seventeen King Street Covent Garden London don t lose it mind and he tore the leaf out of his note book Here s my fly at the door and you must you must he was looking at his watch mind you must think of it seriously and so you see don t let anyone see that You ll be sure to leave it throwing about The best way will be just to scratch it on the door of your press inside you know and don t put my name you ll remember that only the rest of the address and burn this Quince is with you Yes I answered glad to have a satisfactory word to say Well don t let her go it s a bad sign if they wish it Don t consent mind but just tip me a hint and you ll have me down And any letters you get from Lady Knollys you know for she s very plain spoken you d better burn them off hand And I ve stayed too long though mind what I say scratch it with a pin and burn that and not a word to a mortal about it Good bye oh I was taking away your book And so in a fuss with a slight shake of the hand getting up his umbrella his bag and tin box he hurried from the room and in a minute more I heard the sound of his vehicle as it drove away I looked after it with a sigh the uneasy sensations which I had experienced respecting my sojourn at Bartram Haugh were re awakened My ugly vulgar true friend was disappearing beyond those gigantic lime trees which hid Bartram from the eyes of the outer world The fly with the doctor s valise on top vanished and I sighed an anxious sigh The shadow of the over arching trees contracted and I felt helpless and forsaken and glancing down the torn leaf Doctor Bryerly s address met my eye between my fingers I slipt it into my breast and ran up stairs stealthily trembling lest the old woman should summon me again at the head of the stairs into Uncle Silas s room where under his gaze I fancied I should be sure to betray myself But I glided unseen and safely by entered my room and shut my door So listening and working I with my scissors point scratched the address where Doctor Bryerly had advised Then in positive terror lest some one should even knock during the operation I with a match consumed to ashes the tell tale bit of paper Now for the first time I experienced the unpleasant sensations of having a secret to keep I fancy the pain of this solitary liability was disproportionately acute in my case for I was naturally very open and very nervous I was always on the point of betraying it apropos des bottes always reproaching myself for my duplicity and in constant terror when honest Mary Quince approached the press or good natured Milly made her occasional survey of the wonders of my wardrobe I would have given anything to go and point to the tiny inscription and say This is Doctor Bryerly s address in London I scratched it with my scissors point taking every precaution lest anyone you my good friends included should surprise me I have ever since kept this secret to myself and trembled whenever your frank kind faces looked into the press There you at last know all about it Can you ever forgive my deceit But I could not make up my mind to reveal it nor yet to erase the inscription which was my alternative thought Indeed I am a wavering irresolute creature as ever lived in my ordinary mood High excitement or passion only can inspire me with decision Under the inspiration of either however I am transformed and often both prompt and brave Some one left here last night I think Miss said Mary Quince with a mysterious nod one morning Twas two o clock and I was bad with the toothache and went down to get a pinch o red pepper leaving the candle a light here lest you should awake When I was coming up as I was crossing the lobby at the far end of the long gallery what should I hear but a horse snorting and some people a talking short and quiet like So I looks out o the window and there surely I did see two horses yoked to a shay and a fellah a pullin a box up o top and out comes a walise and a bag and I think it was old Wyat please m that Miss Milly calls L Amour that stood in the doorway a talking to the driver And who got into the chaise Mary I asked Well Miss I waited as long as I could but the pain was bad and me so awful cold I gave it up at last and came back to bed for I could not say how much longer they might wait And you ll find Miss twill be kep a secret like the shay as you saw d Miss last week I hate them dark ways and secrets and old Wyat she does tell stories don t she and she as ought to be partickler seein her time be short now and she so old It is awful an old un like that telling such crams as she do Milly was as curious as I but could throw no light on this We both agreed however that the departure was probably that of the person whose arrival I had accidentally witnessed This time the chaise had drawn up at the side door round the corner of the left side of the house and no doubt driven away by the back road Another accident had revealed this nocturnal move It was very provoking however that Mary Quince had not had resolution to wait for the appearance of the traveller We all agreed however that we were to observe a strict silence and that even to Wyat L Amour I had better continue to call her Mary Quince was not to hint what she had seen I suspect however that injured curiosity asserted itself and that Mary hardly adhered to this self denying resolve But cheerful wintry suns and frosty skies long nights and brilliant starlight with good homely fires in our snuggery gossipings stories short readings now and then and brisk walks through the always beautiful scenery of Bartram Haugh and above all the unbroken tenor of our life which had fallen into a serene routine foreign to the idea of danger or misadventure gradually quieted the qualms and misgivings which my interview with Doctor Bryerly had so powerfully resuscitated My cousin Monica to my inexpressible joy had returned to her country house and an active diplomacy through the post office was negotiating the re opening of friendly relations between the courts of Elverston and of Bartram At length one fine day Cousin Monica smiling pleasantly with her cloak and bonnet on and her colour fresh from the shrewd air of the Derbyshire hills stood suddenly before me in our sitting room Our meeting was that of two school companions long separated Cousin Monica was always a girl in my eyes What a hug it was what a shower of kisses and ejaculations enquiries and caresses At last I pressed her down into a chair and laughing she said You have no idea what self denial I have exercised to bring this visit about I who detest writing have actually written five letters to Silas and I don t think I said a single impertinent thing in one of them What a wonderful little old thing your butler is I did not know what to make of him on the steps Is he a struldbrug or a fairy or only a ghost Where on earth did your uncle pick him up I m sure he came in on All Hallows E en to answer an incantation not your future husband I hope and he ll vanish some night into gray smoke and whisk sadly up the chimney He s the most venerable little thing I ever beheld in my life I leaned back in the carriage and thought I should absolutely die of laughing He s gone up to prepare your uncle for my visit and I really am very glad for I m sure I shall look as young as Hebe after him But who is this Who are you my dear This was addressed to poor Milly who stood at the corner of the chimney piece staring with her round eyes and plump cheeks in fear and wonder upon the strange lady How stupid of me I exclaimed Milly dear this is your cousin Lady Knollys And so you are Millicent Well dear I am very glad to see you And Cousin Monica was on her feet again in an instant with Milly s hand very cordially in hers and she gave her a kiss upon each cheek and patted her head Milly I must mention was a much more presentable figure than when I first encountered her Her dresses were at least a quarter of a yard longer Though very rustic therefore she was not so barbarously grotesque by any means CHAPTER XXXIX COUSIN MONICA AND UNCLE SILAS MEET Cousin Monica with her hands upon Milly s shoulders looked amusedly and kindly in her face And said she we must be very good friends you funny creature you and I I m allowed to be the most saucy old woman in Derbyshire quite incorrigibly privileged and nobody is ever affronted with me so I say the most shocking things constantly I m a bit that way myself and I think said poor Milly making an effort and growing very red she quite lost her head at that point and was incompetent to finish the sentiment she had prefaced You think Now take my advice and never wait to think my dear talk first and think afterwards that is my way though indeed I can t say I ever think at all It is a very cowardly habit Our cold blooded cousin Maud there thinks sometimes but it is always such a failure that I forgive her I wonder when your little pre Adamite butler will return He speaks the language of the Picts and Ancient Britons I dare say and your father requires a little time to translate him And Milly dear I am very hungry so I won t wait for your butler who would give me I suppose one of the cakes baked by King Alfred and some Danish beer in a skull but I ll ask you for a little of that nice bread and butter With which accordingly Lady Knollys was quickly supplied but it did not at all impede her utterance Do you think girls you could be ready to come away with me if Silas gives leave in an hour or two I should so like to take you both home with me to Elverston How delightful you darling cried I embracing and kissing her for my part I should be ready in five minutes what do you say Milly Poor Milly s wardrobe I am afraid was more portable than handsome and she looked horribly affrighted and whispered in my ear My best petticoat is away at the laundress say in a week Maud What does she say asked Lady Knollys She fears she can t be ready I answered dejectedly There s a deal of my slops in the wash blurted out poor Milly staring straight at Lady Knollys In the name of wonder what does my cousin mean asked Lady Knollys Her things have not come home yet from the laundress I replied and at this moment our wondrous old butler entered to announce to Lady Knollys that his master was ready to receive her whenever she was disposed to favour him and also to make polite apologies for his being compelled by his state of health to give her the trouble of ascending to his room So Cousin Monica was at the door in a moment over her shoulder calling to us Come girls Please not yet my lady you alone and he requests the young ladies will be in the way as he will send for them presently I began to admire poor Giblets as the wreck of a tolerably respectable servant Very good perhaps it is better we should kiss and be friends in private first said Cousin Knollys laughing and away she went under the guidance of the mummy I had an account of this tete a tete afterwards from Lady Knollys When I saw him my dear she said I could hardly believe my eyes such white hair such a white face such mad eyes such a death like smile When I saw him last his hair was dark he dressed himself like a modern Englishman and he really preserved a likeness to the full length portrait at Knowl that you fell in love with you know but angels and ministers of grace such a spectre I asked myself is it necromancy or is it delirium tremens that has reduced him to this And said he with that odious smile that made me fancy myself half insane You see a change Monica What a sweet gentle insufferable voice he has Somebody once told me about the tone of a glass flute that made some people hysterical to listen to and I was thinking of it all the time There was always a peculiar quality in his voice I do see a change Silas I said at last and no doubt so do you in me a great change There has been time enough to work a greater than I observe in you since you last honoured me with a visit said he I think he was at his old sarcasms and meant that I was the same impertinent minx he remembered long ago uncorrected by time and so I am and he must not expect compliments from old Monica Knollys It is a long time Silas but that you know is not my fault said I Not your fault my dear your instinct We are all imitative creatures the great people ostracised me and the small ones followed We are very like turkeys we have so much good sense and so much generosity Fortune in a freak wounded my head and the whole brood were upon me pecking and gobbling gobbling and pecking and you among them dear Monica It wasn t your fault only your instinct so I quite forgive you but no wonder the peckers wear better than the pecked You are robust and I what I am Now Silas I have not come here to quarrel If we quarrel now mind we can never make it up we are too old so let us forget all we can and try to forgive something and if we can do neither at all events let there be truce between us while I am here My personal wrongs I can quite forgive and I do Heaven knows from my heart but there are things which ought not to be forgiven My children have been ruined by it I may by the mercy of Providence be yet set right in the world and so soon as that time comes I will remember and I will act but my children you will see that wretched girl my daughter education society all would come too late my children have been ruined by it I have not done it but I know what you mean I said You menace litigation whenever you have the means but you forget that Austin placed you under promise when he gave you the use of this house and place never to disturb my title to Elverston So there is my answer if you mean that I mean what I mean he replied with his old smile You mean then said I that for the pleasure of vexing me with litigation you are willing to forfeit your tenure of this house and place Suppose I did mean precisely that why should I forfeit anything My beloved brother by his will has given me a right to the use of Bartram Haugh for my life and attached no absurd condition of the kind you fancy to his gift Silas was in one of his vicious old moods and liked to menace me His vindictiveness got the better of his craft but he knows as well as I do that he never could succeed in disturbing the title of my poor dear Harry Knollys and I was not at all alarmed by his threats and I told him so as coolly as I speak to you now Well Monica he said I have weighed you in the balance and you are not found wanting For a moment the old man possessed me the thought of my children of past unkindness and present affliction and disgrace exasperated me and I was mad It was but for a moment the galvanic spasm of a corpse Never was breast more dead than mine to the passions and ambitions of the world They are not for white locks like these nor for a man who for a week in every month lies in the gate of death Will you shake hands Here I do strike a truce and I do forget and forgive everything I don t know what he meant by this scene I have no idea whether he was acting or lost his head or in fact why or how it occurred but I am glad darling that unlike myself I was calm and that a quarrel has not been forced upon me When our turn came and we were summoned to the presence Uncle Silas was quite as usual but Cousin Monica s heightened colour and the flash of her eyes showed plainly that something exciting and angry had occurred Uncle Silas commented in his own vein upon the effect of Bartram air and liberty all he had to offer and called on me to say how I liked them And then he called Milly to him kissed her tenderly smiled sadly upon her and turning to Cousin Monica said This is my daughter Milly oh she has been presented to you down stairs has she You have no doubt been interested by her As I told her cousin Maud though I am not yet quite a Sir Tunbelly Clumsy she is a very finished Miss Hoyden Are not you my poor Milly You owe your distinction my dear to that line of circumvallation which has ever since your birth intercepted all civilisation on its way to Bartram You are much obliged Milly to everybody who whether naturally or un naturally turned a sod in that invisible but impenetrable work For your accomplishments rather singular than fashionable you are indebted in part to your cousin Lady Knollys Is not she Monica Thank her Milly This is your truce Silas said Lady Knollys with a quiet sharpness I think Silas Ruthyn you want to provoke me to speak in a way before these young creatures which we should all regret So my badinage excites your temper Monnie Think how you would feel then if I had found you by the highway side mangled by robbers and set my foot upon your throat and spat in your face But stop this Why have I said this simply to emphasize my forgiveness See girls Lady Knollys and I cousins long estranged forget and forgive the past and join hands over its buried injuries Well be it so only let us have done with ironies and covert taunts And with these words their hands were joined and Uncle Silas after he had released hers patted and fondled it with his laughing icily and very low all the time I wish so much dear Monica he said when this piece of silent by play was over that I could ask you to stay to night but absolutely I have not a bed to offer and even if I had I fear my suit would hardly prevail Then came Lady Knollys invitation for Milly and me He was very much obliged he smiled over it a great deal meditating I thought he was puzzled and amid his smiles his wild eyes scanned Cousin Monica s frank face once or twice suspiciously There was a difficulty an undefined difficulty about letting us go that day but on a future one soon very soon he would be most happy Well there was an end of that little project for to day at least and Cousin Monica was too well bred to urge it beyond a certain point Milly my dear will you put on your hat and show me the grounds about the house May she Silas I should like to renew my acquaintance You ll see them sadly neglected Monnie A poor man s pleasure grounds must rely on Nature and trust to her for effects Where there is fine timber however and abundance of slope and rock and hollow we sometimes gain in picturesqueness what we lose by neglect in luxury Then as Cousin Monica said she would cross the grounds by a path and meet her carriage at a point to which we would accompany her and so make her way home she took leave of Uncle Silas a ceremony whereat without I thought much zeal at either side a kiss took place Now girls said Cousin Knollys when we were fairly in motion over the grass what do you say will he let you come yes or no I can t say but I think dear this to Milly he ought to let you see a little more of the world than appears among the glens and bushes of Bartram Very pretty they are like yourself but very wild and very little seen Where is your brother Milly is not he older than you I don t know where and he is older by six years and a bit By and by when Milly was gesticulating to frighten some herons by the river s brink into the air Cousin Monica said confidentially to me He has run away I m told I wish I could believe it and enlisted in a regiment going to India perhaps the best thing for him Did you see him here before his judicious self banishment No Well I suppose you have had no loss Doctor Bryerly says from all he can learn he is a very bad young man And now tell me dear is Silas kind to you Yes always gentle just as you saw him to day but we don t see a great deal of him very little in fact And how do you like your life and the people she asked My life very well and the people pretty well There s an old women we don t like old Wyat she is cross and mysterious and tells untruths but I don t think she is dishonest so Mary Quince says and that you know is a point and there is a family father and daughter called Hawkes who live in the Windmill Wood who are perfect savages though my uncle says they don t mean it but they are very disagreeable rude people and except them we see very little of the servants or other people But there has been a mysterious visit some one came late at night and remained for some days though Milly and I never saw them and Mary Quince saw a chaise at the side door at two o clock at night Cousin Monica was so highly interested at this that she arrested her walk and stood facing me with her hand on my arm questioning and listening and lost as it seemed in dismal conjecture It is not pleasant you know I said No it is not pleasant said Lady Knollys very gloomily And just then Milly joined us shouting to us to look at the herons flying so Cousin Monica did and smiled and nodded in thanks to Milly and was again silent and thoughtful as we walked on You are to come to me mind both of you girls she said abruptly you shall I ll manage it When silence returned and Milly ran away once more to try whether the old gray trout was visible in the still water under the bridge Cousin Monica said to me in a low tone looking hard at me You ve not seen anything to frighten you Maud Don t look so alarmed dear she added with a little laugh which was not very merry however I don t mean frighten in any awful sense in fact I did not mean frighten at all I meant I can t exactly express it anything to vex or make you uncomfortable have you No I can t say I have except that room in which mister Charke was found dead Oh you saw that did you I should like to see it so much Your bedroom is not near it Oh no on the floor beneath and looking to the front And Doctor Bryerly talked a little to me and there seemed to be something on his mind more than he chose to tell me so that for some time after I saw him I really was as you say frightened but except that I really have had no cause And what was in your mind when you asked me Well you know Maud you are afraid of ghosts banditti and every thing and I wished to know whether you were uncomfortable and what your particular bogle was just now that I assure you was all and I know she continued suddenly changing her light tone and manner for one of pointed entreaty what Doctor Bryerly said and I implore of you Maud to think of it seriously and when you come to me you shall do so with the intention of remaining at Elverston Now Cousin Monica is this fair You and Doctor Bryerly both talk in the same awful way to me and I assure you you don t know how nervous I am sometimes and yet you won t either of you say what you mean Now Monica dear cousin won t you tell me You see dear it is so lonely it s a strange place and he so odd I don t like the place and I don t like him I ve tried but I can t and I think I never shall He may be a very what was it that good little silly curate at Knowl used to call him a very advanced Christian that is it and I hope he is but if he is only what he used to be his utter seclusion from society removes the only check except personal fear and he never had much of that upon a very bad man And you must know my dear Maud what a prize you are and what an immense trust it is Suddenly Cousin Monica stopped short and looked at me as if she had gone too far But you know Silas may be very good now although he was wild and selfish in his young days Indeed I don t know what to make of him but I am sure when you have thought it over you will agree with me and Doctor Bryerly that you must not stay here It was vain trying to induce my cousin to be more explicit I hope to see you at Elverston in a very few days I will shame Silas into letting you come I don t like his reluctance But don t you think he must know that Milly would require some little outfit before her visit Well I can t say I hope that is all but be it what it may I ll make him let you come and immediately too After she had gone I experienced a repetition of those undefined doubts which had tortured me for some time after my conversation with doctor Bryerly I had truly said however I was well enough contented with my mode of life here for I had been trained at Knowl to a solitude very nearly as profound CHAPTER XL IN WHICH I MAKE ANOTHER COUSIN S ACQUAINTANCE My correspondence about this time was not very extensive About once a fortnight a letter from honest missus Rusk conveyed to me how the dogs and ponies were in queer English oddly spelt some village gossip a critique upon Doctor Clay s or the Curate s last sermon and some severities generally upon the Dissenters doings with loves to Mary Quince and all good wishes to me Sometimes a welcome letter from cheerful Cousin Monica and now to vary the series a copy of complimentary verses without a signature very adoring very like Byron I then fancied and now I must confess rather vapid Could I doubt from whom they came I had received about a month after my arrival a copy of verses in the same hand in a plaintive ballad style of the soldierly sort in which the writer said that as living his sole object was to please me so dying I should be his latest thought and some more poetic impieties asking only in return that when the storm of battle had swept over I should shed a tear on seeing the oak lie where it fell Of course about this lugubrious pun there could be no misconception The Captain was unmistakably indicated and I was so moved that I could no longer retain my secret but walking with Milly that day confided the little romance to that unsophisticated listener under the chestnut trees The lines were so amorously dejected and yet so heroically redolent of blood and gunpowder that Milly and I agreed that the writer must be on the verge of a sanguinary campaign It was not easy to get at Uncle Silas s Times or Morning Post which we fancied would explain these horrible allusions but Milly bethought her of a sergeant in the militia resident in Feltram who knew the destination and quarters of every regiment in the service and circuitously from this authority we learned to my infinite relief that Captain Oakley s regiment had still two years to sojourn in England I was summoned one evening by old L Amour to my uncle s room I remember his appearance that evening so well as he lay back in his chair the pillow the white glare of his strange eye his feeble painful smile You ll excuse my not rising dear Maud I am so miserably ill this evening I expressed my respectful condolence Yes I am to be pitied but pity is of no use dear he murmured peevishly I sent for you to make you acquainted with your cousin my son Where are you Dudley A figure seated in a low lounging chair at the other side of the fire and which till then I had not observed at these words rose up a little slowly like a man stiff after a day s hunting and I beheld with a shock that held my breath and fixed my eyes upon him in a stare the young man whom I had encountered at Church Scarsdale on the day of my unpleasant excursion there with Madame and who to the best of my belief was also one of that ruffianly party who had so unspeakably terrified me in the warren at Knowl I suppose I looked very much affrighted If I had been looking at a ghost I could not have felt much more scared and incredulous When I was able to turn my eyes upon my uncle he was not looking at me but with a glimmer of that smile with which a father looks on a son whose youth and comeliness he admires his white face was turned towards the young man in whom I beheld nothing but the image of odious and dreadful associations Come sir said my uncle we must not be too modest Here s your cousin Maud what do you say How are ye Miss he said with a sheepish grin Miss Come come Miss us no Misses said my uncle she is Maud and you Dudley or I mistake or we shall have you calling Milly madame She ll not refuse you her hand I venture to think Come young gentleman speak for yourself How are ye Maud he said doing his best and drawing near he extended his hand You re welcome to Bartram Haugh Miss Kiss your cousin sir Where s your gallantry On my honour I disown you exclaimed my uncle with more energy than he had shown before With a clumsy effort and a grin that was both sheepish and impudent he grasped my hand and advanced his face The imminent salute gave me strength to spring back a step or two and he hesitated My uncle laughed peevishly Well well that will do I suppose In my time first cousins did not meet like strangers but perhaps we were wrong we are learning modesty from the Americans and old English ways are too gross for us I have I ve seen him before that is and at this point I stopped My uncle turned his strange glare in a sort of scowl of enquiry upon me Oh hey why this is news You never told me Where have you met eh Dudley Never saw her in my days so far as I m aweer on said the young man No Well then Maud will you enlighten us said Uncle Silas coldly I did see that young gentleman before I faltered Meaning me ma am he asked coolly Yes certainly you I did uncle answered I And where was it my dear Not at Knowl I fancy Poor dear Austin did not trouble me or mine much with his hospitalities This was not a pleasant tone to take in speaking of his dead brother and benefactor but at the moment I was too much engaged upon the one point to observe it I met I could not say my cousin I met him uncle your son that young gentleman I saw him I should say at Church Scarsdale and afterwards with some other persons in the warren at Knowl It was the night our gamekeeper was beaten Well Dudley what do you say to that asked Uncle Silas I never was at them places so help me I don t know where they be and I never set eyes on the young lady before as I hope to be saved in all my days said he with a countenance so unchanged and an air so confident that I began to think I must be the dupe of one of those strange resemblances which have been known to lead to positive identification in the witness box afterwards proved to be utterly mistaken You look so so uncomfortable Maud at the idea of having seen him before that I hardly wonder at the vehemence of his denial There was plainly something disagreeable but you see as respects him it is a total mistake My boy was always a truth telling fellow you may rely implicitly on what he says You were not at those places I wish I may began the ingenuous youth with increased vehemence There there that will do your honour and word as a gentleman and that you are though a poor one will quite satisfy your cousin Maud Am I right my dear I do assure you as a gentleman I never knew him to say the thing that was not So mister Dudley Ruthyn began not to curse but to swear in the prescribed form that he had never seen me before or the places I had named since I was weaned by That s enough now shake hands if you won t kiss like cousins interrupted my uncle And very uncomfortably I did lend him my hand to shake You ll want some supper Dudley so Maud and I will excuse your going Good night my dear boy and he smiled and waved him from the room That s as fine a young fellow I think as any English father can boast for his son true brave and kind and quite an Apollo Did you observe how finely proportioned he is and what exquisite features the fellow has He s rustic and rough as you see but a year or two in the militia I ve a promise of a commission for him he s too old for the line will form and polish him He wants nothing but manner and I protest when he has had a little drilling of that kind I do believe he ll be as pretty a fellow as you d find in England I listened with amazement I could discover nothing but what was disagreeable in the horrid bumpkin and thought such an instance of the blindness of parental partiality was hardly credible I looked down dreading another direct appeal to my judgment and Uncle Silas I suppose referred those downcast looks to maiden modesty for he forbore to task mine by any new interrogatory Dudley Ruthyn s cool and resolute denial of ever having seen me or the places I had named and the inflexible serenity of his countenance while doing so did very much shake my confidence in my own identification of him I could not be quite certain that the person I had seen at Church Scarsdale was the very same whom I afterwards saw at Knowl And now in this particular instance after the lapse of a still longer period could I be perfectly certain that my memory deceived by some accidental points of resemblance had not duped me and wronged my cousin Dudley Ruthyn I suppose my uncle had expected from me some signs of acquiesence in his splendid estimate of his cub and was nettled at my silence After a short interval he said I ve seen something of the world in my day and I can say without a misgiving of partiality that Dudley is the material of a perfect English gentleman I am not blind of course the training must be supplied a year or two of good models active self criticism and good society I simply say that the material is there Here was another interval of silence And now tell me child what these recollections of Church Church what Church Scarsdale I replied Yes thank you Church Scarsdale and Knowl are So I related my stories as well as I could Well dear Maud the adventure of Church Scarsdale is hardly so terrific as I expected said Uncle Silas with a cold little laugh and I don t see if he had really been the hero of it why he should shrink from avowing it I know I should not And I really can t say that your pic nic party in the grounds of Knowl has frightened me much more A lady waiting in the carriage and two or three tipsy young men Her presence seems to me a guarantee that no mischief was meant but champagne is the soul of frolic and a row with the gamekeepers a natural consequence It happened to me once forty years ago when I was a wild young buck one of the worst rows I ever was in And Uncle Silas poured some eau de cologne over the corner of his handkerchief and touched his temples with it If my boy had been there I do assure you and I know him he would say so at once I fancy he would rather boast of it I never knew him utter an untruth When you know him a little you ll say so With these words Uncle Silas leaned back exhausted and languidly poured some of his favourite eau de cologne over the palms of his hands nodded a farewell and in a whisper wished me good night Dudley s come whispered Milly taking me under the arm as I entered the lobby But I don t care he never gives me nout and he gets money from Governor as much as he likes and I never a sixpence It s a shame So there was no great love between the only son and only daughter of the younger line of the Ruthyns I was curious to learn all that Milly could tell me of this new inmate of Bartram Haugh and Milly was communicative without having a great deal to relate and what I heard from her tended to confirm my own disagreeable impressions about him She was afraid of him He was a woundy ugly customer in a wax she could tell me He was the only one she ever knowed as had pluck to jaw the Governor But he was afeard on the Governor too His visits to Bartram Haugh I heard were desultory and this to my relief would probably not outlast a week or a fortnight He was such a fashionable cove he was always a gadding about mostly to Liverpool and Birmingham and sometimes to Lunnun itself He was keeping company one time with Beauty Governor thought and he was awfully afraid he d a married her but that was all bosh and nonsense and Beauty would have none of his chaff and wheedling for she liked Tom Brice and Milly thought that Dudley never cared a crack of a whip for her He used to go to the Windmill to have a smoke with Pegtop and he was a member of the Feltram Club that met at the Plume o Feathers He was a rare good shot she heard and he was before the justices for poaching but they could make nothing of it And the Governor said it was all through spite of him for they hate us for being better blood than they And all but the squires and those upstart folk loves Dudley he is so handsome and gay though he be a bit cross at home And Governor says he ll be a Parliament man yet spite o them all Next morning when our breakfast was nearly ended Dudley tapped at the window with the end of his clay pipe a churchwarden Milly called it just such a long curved pipe as Joe Willet is made to hold between his lips in those charming illustrations of Barnaby Rudge which we all know so well and lifting his wide awake with a burlesque salutation which I suppose would have charmed the Plume of Feathers he dropped kicked and caught his wide awake with an agility and gravity as he replaced it so inexpressibly humorous that Milly went off in a loud fit of laughter with the ejaculation Did you ever It was odd how repulsively my confidence in my original identification always revived on unexpectedly seeing Dudley after an interval I could perceive that this piece of comic by play was meant to make a suitable impression on me I received it however with a killing gravity and after a word or two to Milly he lounged away having first broken his pipe bit by bit into pieces which he balanced in turn on his nose and on his chin from which features he jerked them into his mouth with a precision which along with his excellent pantomime of eating them highly excited Milly s mirth and admiration CHAPTER XLI MY COUSIN DUDLEY Greatly to my satisfaction this engaging person did not appear again that day But next day Milly told me that my uncle had taken him to task for the neglect with which he was treating us He did pitch into him sharp and short and not a word from him only sulky like and I so frightened I durst not look up almost and they said a lot I could not make head or tail of and Governor ordered me out o the room and glad I was to go and so they had it out between them Milly could throw no light whatsoever upon the adventures at Church Scarsdale and Knowl and I was left still in doubt which sometimes oscillated one way and sometimes another But on the whole I could not shake off the misgivings which constantly recurred and pointed very obstinately to Dudley as the hero of those odious scenes Oddly enough though I now felt far less confident upon the point than I did at first sight I had begun to distrust my memory and to suspect my fancy but of this there could be no question that between the person so unpleasantly linked in my remembrance with those scenes and Dudley Ruthyn a striking though possibly only a general resemblance did exist Milly was certainly right as to the gist of Uncle Silas s injunction for we saw more of Dudley henceforward He was shy he was impudent he was awkward he was conceited altogether a most intolerable bumpkin Though he sometimes flushed and stammered and never for a moment was at his ease in my presence yet to my inexpressible disgust there was a self complacency in his manner and a kind of triumph in his leer which very plainly told me how satisfied he was as to the nature of the impression he was making upon me I would have given worlds to tell him how odious I thought him Probably however he would not have believed me Perhaps he fancied that ladies affected airs of indifference and repulsion to cover their real feelings I never looked at or spoke to him when I could avoid either and then it was as briefly as I could To do him justice however he seemed to have no liking for our society and certainly never seemed altogether comfortable in it I find it hard to write quite impartially even of Dudley Ruthyn s personal appearance but with an effort I confess that his features were good and his figure not amiss though a little fattish He had light whiskers light hair and a pink complexion and very good blue eyes So far my uncle was right and if he had been perfectly gentlemanlike he really might have passed for a handsome man in the judgment of some critics But there was that odious mixture of mauvaise honte and impudence a clumsiness a slyness and a consciousness in his bearing and countenance not distinctly boorish but low which turned his good looks into an ugliness more intolerable than that of feature and a corresponding vulgarity pervading his dress his demeanour and his very walk marred whatever good points his figure possessed If you take all this into account with the ominous and startling misgivings constantly recurring you will understand the mixed feelings of anger and disgust with which I received the admiration he favoured me with Gradually he grew less constrained in my presence and certainly his manners were not improved by his growing ease and confidence He came in while Milly and I were at luncheon jumped up with a right about face performed in the air sitting on the sideboard whence grinning slyly and kicking his heels he leered at us Will you have something Dudley asked Milly No lass but I ll look at ye and maybe drink a drop for company And with these words he took a sportsman s flask from his pocket and helping himself to a large glass and a decanter he compounded a glass of strong brandy and water as he talked and refreshed himself with it from time to time Curate s up wi the Governor he said with a grin I wanted a word wi him but I s pose I ll hardly git in this hour or more they re a praying and disputing and a Bible chopping as usual Ha ha But twon t hold much longer old Wyat says now that Uncle Austin s dead there s nout to be made o praying and that work no longer and it don t pay of itself O fie For shame you sinner laughed Milly He wasn t in a church these five years he says and then only to meet a young lady Now isn t he a sinner Maud isn t he Dudley grinning looked with a languishing slyness at me biting the edge of his wide awake which he held over his breast Dudley Ruthyn probably thought there was a manly and desperate sort of fascination in the impiety he professed I wonder Milly said I at your laughing How can you laugh You d have me cry would ye answered Milly I certainly would not have you laugh I replied I know I wish some one ud cry for me and I know who said Dudley in what he meant for a very engaging way and he looked at me as if he thought I must feel flattered by his caring to have my tears Instead of crying however I leaned back in my chair and began quietly to turn over the pages of Walter Scott s poems which I and Milly were then reading in the evenings The tone in which this odious young man spoke of his father his coarse mention of mine and his low boasting of his irreligion disgusted me more than ever with him They parsons be slow coaches awful slow I ll have a good bit to wait I s pose I should be three miles away and more by this time drat it He was eyeing the legging of the foot which he held up while he spoke as if calculating how far away that limb should have carried him by this time Why can t folk do their Bible and prayers o Sundays and get it off their stomachs I say Milly lass will ye see if Governor be done wi the Curate Do I m a losing the whole day along o him Milly jumped up accustomed to obey her brother and as she passed me whispered with a wink Money And away she went Dudley whistled a tune and swung his foot like a pendulum as he followed her with his side glance I say it is a hard case Miss a lad o spirit should be kept so tight I haven t a shilling but what comes through his fingers an drat the tizzy he ll gi me till he knows the reason why Perhaps I said my uncle thinks you should earn some for yourself I d like to know how a fella s to earn money now a days You wouldn t have a gentleman to keep a shop I fancy But I ll ha a fistful jist now and no thanks to he Them executors you know owes me a deal o money Very honest chaps of course but they re cursed slow about paying I know I made no remark upon this elegant allusion to the executors of my dear father s will An I tell ye Maud when I git the tin I know who I ll buy a farin for I do lass The odious creature drawled this with a sidelong leer which I suppose he fancied quite irresistible I am one of those unfortunate persons who always blushed when I most wished to look indifferent and now to my inexpressible chagrin with its accustomed perversity I felt the blush mount to my cheeks and glow even on my forehead I saw that he perceived this most disconcerting indication of a sentiment the very idea of which was so detestable that equally enraged with myself and with him I did not know how to exhibit my contempt and indignation Mistaking the cause of my discomposure mister Dudley Ruthyn laughed softly with an insufferable suavity And there s some at lass I must have in return Honour thy father you know you would not ha me disobey the Governor No you wouldn t would ye I darted at him a look which I hoped would have quelled his impertinence but I blushed most provokingly more violently than ever I d back them eyes again the county I would he exclaimed with a condescending enthusiasm You re awful pretty you are Maud I don t know what came over me t other night when Governor told me to buss ye but dang it ye shan t deny me now and I ll have a kiss lass in spite o thy blushes He jumped from his elevated seat on the sideboard and came swaggering toward me with an odious grin and his arms extended I started to my feet absolutely transported with fury Drat me if she baint a going to fight me he chuckled humorously Come Maud you would not be ill natured sure Arter all it s only our duty Governor bid us kiss didn t he Don t don t sir Stand back or I ll call the servants And as it was I began to scream for Milly There s how it is wi all they cattle You never knows your own mind ye don t he said surlily You make such a row about a bit o play Drop it will you There s no one a harming you is there I m not for sartain And with an angry chuckle he turned on his heel and left the room I think I was perfectly right to resist with all the vehemence of which I was capable this attempt to assume an intimacy which notwithstanding my uncle s opinion to the contrary seemed to me like an outrage Milly found me alone not frightened but very angry I had quite made up my mind to complain to my uncle but the Curate was still with him and by the time he had gone I was cooler My awe of my uncle had returned I fancied that he would treat the whole affair as a mere playful piece of gallantry So with the comfortable conviction that he had had a lesson and would think twice before repeating his impertinence I resolved with Milly s approbation to leave matters as they were Dudley greatly to my comfort was huffed with me and hardly appeared and was sulky and silent when he did I lived then in the pleasant anticipation of his departure which Milly thought would be very soon My uncle had his Bible and his consolations but it cannot have been pleasant to this old roue converted though he was this refined man of fashion to see his son grow up an outcast and a Tony Lumpkin for whatever he may have thought of his natural gifts he must have known how mere a boor he was I try to recall my then impressions of my uncle s character Grizzly and chaotic the image rises silver head feet of clay I as yet knew little of him I began to perceive that he was what Mary Quince used to call dreadful particular I suppose a little selfish and impatient He used to get cases of turtle from Liverpool He drank claret and hock for his health and ate woodcock and other light and salutary dainties for the same reason and was petulant and vicious about the cooking of these and the flavour and clearness of his coffee His conversation was easy polished and with a sentimental glazing cold but across this artificial talk with its French rhymes racy phrases and fluent eloquence like a streak of angry light would at intervals suddenly gleam some dismal thought of religion I never could quite satisfy myself whether they were affectations or genuine like intermittent thrills of pain The light of his large eyes was very peculiar I can liken it to nothing but the sheen of intense moonlight on burnished metal But that cannot express it It glared white and suddenly almost fatuous I thought of Moore s lines whenever I looked on it Oh ye dead oh ye dead whom we know by the light you give From your cold gleaming eyes though you move like men who live I never saw in any other eye the least glimmer of the same baleful effulgence His fits too his hoverings between life and death between intellect and insanity a dubious marsh fire existence horrible to look on I was puzzled even to comprehend his feelings toward his children Sometimes it seemed to me that he was ready to lay down his soul for them at others he looked and spoke almost as if he hated them He talked as if the image of death was always before him yet he took a terrible interest in life while seemingly dozing away the dregs of his days in sight of his coffin Oh Uncle Silas tremendous figure in the past burning always in memory in the same awful lights the fixed white face of scorn and anguish It seems as if the Woman of Endor had led me to that chamber and showed me a spectre Dudley had not left Bartram Haugh when a little note reached me from Lady Knollys It said DEAREST MAUD I have written by this post to Silas beseeching a loan of you and my Cousin Milly I see no reason your uncle can possibly have for refusing me and therefore I count confidently on seeing you both at Elverston to morrow to stay for at least a week I have hardly a creature to meet you I have been disappointed in several visitors but another time we shall have a gayer house Tell Milly with my love that I will not forgive her if she fails to accompany you Believe me ever your affectionate cousin MONICA KNOLLYS Milly and I were both afraid that Uncle Silas would refuse his consent although we could not divine any sound reason for his doing so and there were many in favour of his improving the opportunity of allowing poor Milly to see some persons of her own sex above the rank of menials At about twelve o clock my uncle sent for us and to our great delight announced his consent and wished us a very happy excursion CHAPTER XLII ELVERSTON AND ITS PEOPLE So Milly and I drove through the gabled high street of Feltram next day We saw my gracious cousin smoking with a man like a groom at the door of the Plume of Feathers I drew myself back as we passed and Milly popped her head out of the window I m blessed said she laughing if he hadn t his thumb to his nose and winding up his little finger the way he does with old Wyat L Amour ye know and you may be sure he said something funny for Jim Jolliter was laughin with his pipe in his hand I wish I had not seen him Milly I feel as if it were an ill omen He always looks so cross and I dare say he wished us some ill I said No no you don t know Dudley if he were angry he d say nothing that s funny no he s not vexed only shamming vexed The scenery through which we passed was very pretty The road brought us through a narrow and wooded glen Such studies of ivied rocks and twisted roots A little stream tinkled lonely through the hollow Poor Milly In her odd way she made herself companionable I have sometimes fancied an enjoyment of natural scenery not so much a faculty as an acquirement It is so exquisite in the instructed so strangely absent in uneducated humanity But certainly with Milly it was inborn and hearty and so she could enter into my raptures and requite them Then over one of those beautiful Derbyshire moors we drove and so into a wide wooded hollow where was our first view of Cousin Monica s pretty gabled house beautified with that indescribable air of shelter and comfort which belongs to an old English residence with old timber grouped round it and something in its aspect of the quaint old times and bygone merrymakings saying sadly but genially Come in I bid you welcome For two hundred years or more have I been the home of this beloved old family whose generations I have seen in the cradle and in the coffin and whose mirth and sorrows and hospitalities I remember All their friends like you were welcome and you like them will here enjoy the warm illusions that cheat the sad conditions of mortality and like them you will go your way and others succeed you till at last I too shall yield to the general law of decay and disappear By this time poor Milly had grown very nervous a state which she described in such very odd phraseology as threw me in spite of myself for I affected an impressive gravity in lecturing her upon her language into a hearty fit of laughter I must mention however that in certain important points Milly was very essentially reformed Her dress though not very fashionable was no longer absurd And I had drilled her into speaking and laughing quietly and for the rest I trusted to the indulgence which is always I think more honestly and easily obtained from well bred than from under bred people Cousin Monica was out when we arrived but we found that she had arranged a double bedded room for me and Milly greatly to our content and good Mary Quince was placed in the dressing room beside us We had only just commenced our toilet when our hostess entered as usual in high spirits welcomed and kissed us both again and again She was indeed in extraordinary delight for she had anticipated some stratagem or evasion to prevent our visit and in her usual way she spoke her mind as frankly about Uncle Silas to poor Milly as she used to do of my dear father to me I did not think he would let you come without a battle and you know if he chose to be obstinate it would not have been easy to get you out of the enchanted ground for so it seems to be with that awful old wizard in the midst of it I mean Silas your papa my dear Honestly is not he very like Michael Scott I never saw him answered poor Milly At least that I m aware of she added perceiving us smile But I do think he s a thought like old Michael Dobbs that sells the ferrets maybe you mean him Why you told me Maud that you and Milly were reading Walter Scott s poems Well no matter Michael Scott my dear was a dead wizard with ever so much silvery hair lying in his grave for ever so many years with just life enough to scowl when they took his book and you ll find him in the Lay of the Last Minstrel exactly like your papa my dear And my people tell me that your brother Dudley has been seen drinking and smoking about Feltram this week How long does he remain at home Not very long eh And Maud dear he has not been making love to you Well I see of course he has And apropos of love making I hope that impudent creature Charles Oakley has not been teasing you with notes or verses Indeed but he has though interposed Miss Milly a good deal to my chagrin for I saw no particular reason for placing his verses in Cousin Monica s hands So I confessed the two little copies of verses with the qualification however that I did not know from whom they came Well now dear Maud have not I told you fifty times over to have nothing to say to him I ve found out my dear he plays and he is very much in debt I ve made a vow to pay no more for him I ve been such a fool you have no notion and I m speaking you know against myself it would be such a relief if he were to find a wife to support him and he has been I m told very sweet upon a rich old maid a button maker s sister in Manchester This arrow was well shot But don t be frightened you are richer as well as younger and no doubt will have your chance first my dear and in the meantime I dare say those verses like Falstaff s billet doux you know are doing double duty I laughed but the button maker was a secret trouble to me and I would have given I know not what that Captain Oakley were one of the company that I might treat him with the refined contempt which his deserts and my dignity demanded Cousin Monica busied herself about Milly s toilet and was a very useful lady s maid chatting in her own way all the time and at last tapping Milly under the chin with her finger she said very complacently I think I have succeeded Miss Milly look in the glass She really is a very pretty creature And Milly blushed and looked with a shy gratification which made her still prettier on the mirror Milly indeed was very pretty She looked much taller now that her dresses were made of the usual length A little plump she was beautifully fair with such azure eyes and rich hair The more you laugh the better Milly for you ve got very pretty teeth very pretty and if you were my daughter or if your father would become president of a college of magicians and give you up to me I venture to say I would place you very well and even as it is we must try my dear So down to the drawing room we went and Cousin Monica entered leading us both by the hands By this time the curtains were closed and the drawing room dependent on the pleasant glow of the fire and the slight provisional illumination usual before dinner Here are my two cousins began Lady Knollys this is Miss Ruthyn of Knowl whom I take the liberty of calling Maud and this is Miss Millicent Ruthyn Silas s daughter you know whom I venture to call Milly and they are very pretty as you will see when we get a little more light and they know it very well themselves And as she spoke a frank eyed gentle prettyish lady not so tall as I but with a very kind face rose up from a book of prints and smiling took our hands She was by no means young as I then counted youth past thirty I suppose and with an air that was very quiet and friendly and engaging She had never been a mere fashionable woman plainly but she had the ease and polish of the best society and seemed to take a kindly interest both in Milly and me and Cousin Monica called her Mary and sometimes Polly That was all I knew of her for the present So very pleasantly the time passed by till the dressing bell rang and we ran away to our room Did I say anything very bad asked poor Milly standing exactly before me so soon as our door was shut Nothing Milly you are doing admirably And I do look a great fool don t I she demanded You look extremely pretty Milly and not a bit like a fool I watch everything I think I ll learn it at last but it comes a little troublesome at first and they do talk different from what I used you were quite right there When we returned to the drawing room we found the party already assembled and chatting evidently with spirit The village doctor whose name I forget a small man grey with shrewd grey eyes sharp and mulberry nose whose conflagration extended to his rugged cheeks and touched his chin and forehead was conversing no doubt agreeably with Mary as Cousin Monica called her guest Over my shoulder Milly whispered mister Carysbroke And Milly was quite right that gentleman chatting with Lady Knollys his elbow resting on the chimney piece was indeed our acquaintance of the Windmill Wood He instantly recognised us and met us with his pleased and intelligent smile I was just trying to describe to Lady Knollys the charming scenery of the Windmill Wood among which I was so fortunate as to make your acquaintance Miss Ruthyn Even in this beautiful county I know of nothing prettier Then he sketched it as it were with a few light but glowing words What a sweet scene said Cousin Monica only think of her never bringing me through it She reserves it I fancy for her romantic adventures and you I know are very benevolent Ilbury and all that kind of thing but I am not quite certain that you would have walked along that narrow parapet over a river to visit a sick old woman if you had not happened to see two very pretty demoiselles on the other side What an ill natured speech I must either forfeit my character for disinterested benevolence so justly admired or disavow a motive that does such infinite credit to my taste exclaimed mister Carysbroke I think a charitable person would have said that a philanthropist in prosecuting his virtuous but perilous vocation was unexpectedly rewarded by a vision of angels And with these angels loitered away the time which ought to have been devoted to good Mother Hubbard in her fit of lumbago and returned without having set eyes on that afflicted Christian to amaze his worthy sister with poetic babblings about wood nymphs and such pagan impieties rejoined Lady Knollys Well be just he replied laughing did not I go next day and see the patient Yes next day you went by the same route in quest of the dryads I am afraid and were rewarded by the spectacle of Mother Hubbard Will nobody help a humane man in difficulties mister Carysbroke appealed I do believe said the lady whom as yet I knew only as Mary that every word that Monica says is perfectly true And if it be so am I not all the more in need of help Truth is simply the most dangerous kind of defamation and I really think I m most cruelly persecuted At this moment dinner was announced and a meek and dapper little clergyman with smooth pink cheeks and tresses parted down the middle whom I had not seen before emerged from shadow This little man was assigned to Milly mister Carysbroke to me and I know not how the remaining ladies divided the doctor between them That dinner the first at Elverston I remember as a very pleasant repast Everyone talked it was impossible that conversation should flag where Lady Knollys was and mister Carysbroke was very agreeable and amusing At the other side of the table the little pink curate I was happy to see was prattling away with a modest fluency in an under tone to Milly who was following my instructions most conscientiously and speaking in so low a key that I could hardly hear at the opposite side one word she was saying That night Cousin Monica paid us a visit as we sat chatting by the fire in our room and I told her I have just been telling Milly what an impression she has made The pretty little clergyman il en est epris he has evidently quite lost his heart to her I dare say he ll preach next Sunday on some of King Solomon s wise sayings about the irresistible strength of women Yes said Lady Knollys or maybe on the sensible text Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour and so forth At all events I may say Milly whoso findeth a husband such as he findeth a tolerably good thing He is an exemplary little creature second son of Sir Harry Biddlepen with a little independent income of his own beside his church revenues of ninety pounds a year and I don t think a more harmless and docile little husband could be found anywhere and I think Miss Maud you seemed a good deal interested too I laughed and blushed I suppose and Cousin Monica skipping after her wont to quite another matter said in her odd frank way And how has Silas been not cross I hope or very odd There was a rumour that your brother Dudley had gone a soldiering to India Milly or somewhere but that was all a story for he has turned up just as usual And what does he mean to do with himself He has got some money now your poor father s will Maud Surely he doesn t mean to go on lounging and smoking away his life among poachers and prize fighters and worse people He ought to go to Australia like Thomas Swain who they say is making a fortune a great fortune and coming home again That s what your brother Dudley should do if he has either sense or spirit but I suppose he won t too long abandoned to idleness and low company and he ll not have a shilling left in a year or two Does he know I wonder that his father has served a notice or something on doctor Bryerly telling him to pay sixteen hundred pounds of poor Austin s legacy to him and saying that he has paid debts of the young man and holds his acknowledgments to that amount He won t have a guinea in a year if he stays here I d give fifty pounds he was in Van Diemen s Land not that I care for the cub Milly any more than you do but I really don t see any honest business he has in England Milly gaped in a total puzzle as Lady Knollys rattled on You know Milly you must not be talking about this when you go home to Bartram because Silas would prevent your coming to me any more if he thought I spoke so freely but I can t help it so you must promise to be more discreet than I And I am told that all kinds of claims are about to be pressed against him now that he is thought to have got some money and he has been cutting down oak and selling the bark Doctor Bryerly has been told in that Windmill Wood and he has kilns there for burning charcoal and got a man from Lancashire who understands it Hawk or something like that Ay Hawkes Dickon Hawkes that s Pegtop you know Maud said Milly Well I dare say but a man of very bad character doctor Bryerly says and he has written to mister Danvers about it for that is what they call waste cutting down and selling the timber and the oakbark and burning the willows and other trees that are turned into charcoal It is all waste and doctor Bryerly is about to put a stop to it Has he got your carriage for you Maud and your horses asked Cousin Monica suddenly They have not come yet but in a few weeks Dudley says positively Cousin Monica laughed a little and shook her head Yes Maud the carriage and horses will always be coming in a few weeks till the time is over and meanwhile the old travelling chariot and post horses will do very well and she laughed a little again That s why the stile s pulled away at the paling I suppose and Beauty Meg Hawkes that is is put there to stop us going through for I often spied the smoke beyond the windmill observed Milly Cousin Monica listened with interest and nodded silently I was very much shocked It seemed to me quite incredible I think Lady Knollys read my amazement and my exalted estimate of the heinousness of the procedure in my face for she said You know we can t quite condemn Silas till we have heard what he has to say He may have done it in ignorance or it is just possible he may have the right Quite true He may have the right to cut down trees at Bartram Haugh At all events I am sure he thinks he has I echoed The fact was that I would not avow to myself a suspicion of Uncle Silas Any falsehood there opened an abyss beneath my feet into which I dared not look And now dear girls good night You must be tired We breakfast at a quarter past nine not too early for you I know And so saying she kissed us smiling and was gone I was so unpleasantly occupied for some time after her departure with the knaveries said to be practised among the dense cover of the Windmill Wood that I did not immediately recollect that we had omitted to ask her any particulars about her guests Who can Mary be asked Milly Cousin Monica says she s engaged to be married and I think I heard the Doctor call her Lady Mary and I intended asking her ever so much about her but what she told us about cutting down the trees and all that quite put it out of my head We shall have time enough to morrow however to ask questions I like her very much I know And I think said Milly it is to mister Carysbroke she s to be married Do you said I remembering that he had sat beside her for more than a quarter of an hour after tea in very close and low toned conversation and have you any particular reason I asked Well I heard her once or twice call him dear and she called him his Christian name just like Lady Knollys did Ilbury I think and I saw him gi her a sly kiss as she was going up stairs I laughed Well Milly I said I remarked something myself I thought like confidential relations but if you really saw them kiss on the staircase the question is pretty well settled Ay lass You re not to say lass Well Maud then I did see them with the corner of my eye and my back turned when they did not think I could spy anything as plain as I see you now I laughed again but I felt an odd pang something of mortification something of regret but I smiled very gaily as I stood before the glass un making my toilet preparatory to bed Maud Maud fickle Maud What Captain Oakley already superseded and mister Carysbroke oh humiliation engaged So I smiled on very much vexed and being afraid lest I had listened with too apparent an interest to this impostor I sang a verse of a gay little chanson and tried to think of Captain Oakley who somehow had become rather silly CHAPTER XLIII NEWS AT BARTRAM GATE Milly and I thanks to our early Bartram hours were first down next morning and so soon as Cousin Monica appeared we attacked her So Lady Mary is the fiancee of mister Carysbroke said I very cleverly and I think it was very wicked of you to try and involve me in a flirtation with him yesterday And who told you that pray asked Lady Knollys with a pleasant little laugh Milly and I discovered it simple as we stand here I answered But you did not flirt with mister Carysbroke Maud did you she asked No certainly not but that was not your doing wicked woman but my discretion And now that we know your secret you must tell us all about her and all about him and in the first place what is her name Lady Mary what I demanded Who would have thought you so cunning Two country misses two little nuns from the cloisters of Bartram Well I suppose I must answer It is vain trying to hide anything from you but how on earth did you find it out We ll tell you that presently but you shall first tell us who she is I persisted Well that I will of course without compulsion She is Lady Mary Carysbroke said Lady Knollys A relation of mister Carysbroke s I asserted Yes a relation but who told you he was mister Carysbroke asked Cousin Monica Milly told me when we saw him in the Windmill Wood And who told you Milly It was L Amour answered Milly with her blue eyes very wide open What does the child mean L Amour You don t mean love exclaimed Lady Knollys puzzled in her turn I mean old Wyat she told me and the Governor You re not to say that I interposed You mean your father suggested Lady Knollys Well yes father told her and so I knew him What could he mean exclaimed Lady Knollys laughing as it were in soliloquy and I did not mention his name I recollect now He recognised you and you him when you came into the room yesterday and now you must tell me how you discovered that he and Lady Mary were to be married So Milly restated her evidence and Lady Knollys laughed unaccountably heartily and she said They will be so confounded but they deserve it and remember I did not say so Oh we acquit you All I say is such a deceitful dangerous pair of girls all things considered I never heard of before exclaimed Lady Knollys There s no such thing as conspiring in your presence Good morning I hope you slept well She was addressing the lady and gentleman who were just entering the room from the conservatory You ll hardly sleep so well to night when you have learned what eyes are upon you Here are two very pretty detectives who have found out your secret and entirely by your imprudence and their own cleverness have discovered that you are a pair of betrothed lovers about to ratify your vows at the hymeneal altar I assure you I did not tell of you you betrayed yourselves If you will talk in that confidential way on sofas and call one another stealthily by your Christian names and actually kiss at the foot of the stairs while a clever detective is scaling them apparently with her back toward you you must only take the consequences and be known prematurely as the hero and heroine of the forthcoming paragraph in the Morning Post Milly and I were horribly confounded but Cousin Monica was resolved to place us all upon the least formal terms possible and I believe she had set about it in the right way And now girls I am going to make a counter discovery which I fear a little conflicts with yours This mister Carysbroke is Lord Ilbury brother of this Lady Mary and it is all my fault for not having done my honours better but you see what clever match making little creatures they are You can t think how flattered I am at being made the subject of a theory even a mistaken one by Miss Ruthyn And so after our modest fit was over Milly and I were very merry like the rest and we all grew a great deal more intimate that morning I think altogether those were the pleasantest and happiest days of my life gay intelligent and kindly society at home charming excursions sometimes riding sometimes by carriage to distant points of beauty in the county Evenings varied with music reading and spirited conversation Now and then a visitor for a day or two and constantly some neighbour from the town or its dependencies dropt in Of these I but remember tall old Miss Wintletop most entertaining of rustic old maids with her nice lace and thick satin and her small kindly round face pretty I dare say in other days and now frosty but kindly who told us such delightful old stories of the county in her father s and grandfather s time who knew the lineage of every family in it and could recount all its duels and elopements give us illustrative snatches from old election squibs and lines from epitaphs and tell exactly where all the old world highway robberies had been committed how it fared with the chief delinquents after the assizes and above all where and of what sort the goblins and elves of the county had made themselves seen from the phantom post boy who every third night crossed Windale Moor by the old coach road to the fat old ghost in mulberry velvet who showed his great face crutch and ruffles by moonlight at the bow window of the old court house that was taken down in eighteen oh three You cannot imagine what agreeable evenings we passed in this society or how rapidly my good Cousin Milly improved in it I remember well the intense suspense in which she and I awaited the answer from Bartram Haugh to kind Cousin Monica s application for an extension of our leave of absence It came and with it a note from Uncle Silas which was curious and therefore is printed here MY DEAR LADY KNOLLYS To your kind letter I say yes that is for another week not a fortnight with all my heart I am glad to hear that my starlings chatter so pleasantly at all events the refrain is not that of Sterne s They can get out and do get out and shall get out as much as they please I am no gaoler and shut up nobody but myself I have always thought that young people have too little liberty My principle has been to make little free men and women of them from the first In morals altogether in intellect more than we allow self education is that which abides and it only begins where constraint ends Such is my theory My practice is consistent Let them remain for a week longer as you say The horses shall be at Elverston on Tuesday the seventh I shall be more than usually sad and solitary till their return so pray I selfishly entreat do not extend their absence You will smile remembering how little my health will allow me to see of them even when at home but as Chaulieu so prettily says I stupidly forget the words but the sentiment is this although concealed by a sylvan wall of leaves impenetrable he is pursuing his favourite nymphs through the alleys and intricacies of a rustic labyrinth yet your songs your prattle and your laughter faint and far away inspire my fancy and through my ears I see your unseen smiles your blushes your floating tresses and your ivory feet and so though sad am happy though alone in company and such is my case One only request and I have done Pray remind them of a promise made to me The Book of Life the fountain of life it must be drunk of night and morning or their spiritual life expires And now Heaven bless and keep you my dear cousin and with all assurances of affection to my beloved niece and my child believe me ever yours affectionately SILAS RUTHYN Said Cousin Monica with a waggish smile And so girls you have Chaulieu and the evangelists the French rhymester in his alley and Silas in the valley of the shadow of death perfect liberty and a peremptory order to return in a week all illustrating one another Poor Silas old as he is I don t think his religion fits him I really rather liked his letter I was struggling hard to think well of him and Cousin Monica knew it and I really think if I had not been by she would often have been less severe on him As we were all sitting pleasantly about the breakfast table a day or two after the sun shining on the pleasant wintry landscape Cousin Monica suddenly exclaimed I quite forgot to tell you that Charles Oakley has written to say he is coming on Wednesday I really don t want him Poor Charlie I wonder how they manage those doctors certificates I know nothing ails him and he d be much better with his regiment Wednesday how odd Exactly the day after my departure I tried to look perfectly unconcerned Lady Knollys had addressed herself more to Lady Mary and Milly than to me and nobody in particular was looking at me Notwithstanding with my usual perversity I felt myself blushing with a brilliancy that may have been very becoming but which was so intolerably provoking that I would have risen and left the room but that matters would have been so infinitely worse I could have boxed my odious ears I could almost have jumped from the window I felt that Lord Ilbury saw it I saw Lady Mary s eyes for a moment resting gravely on my tell tale my lying cheeks for I really had begun to think much less celestially of Captain Oakley I was angry with Cousin Monica who knowing my blushing infirmity had mentioned her nephew so suddenly while I was strapped by etiquette in my chair with my face to the window and two pair of most disconcerting eyes at least opposite I was angry with myself generally angry refused more tea rather dryly and was laconic to Lord Ilbury all which of course was very cross and foolish and afterwards from my bed room window I saw Cousin Monica and Lady Mary among the flowers under the drawing room window talking as I instinctively knew of that little incident I was standing at the glass My odious stupid perjured face I whispered furiously at the same time stamping on the floor and giving myself quite a smart slap on the cheek I can t go down I m ready to cry I ve a mind to return to Bartram to day I am always blushing and I wish that impudent Captain Oakley was at the bottom of the sea I was perhaps thinking more of Lord Ilbury than I was aware and I am sure if Captain Oakley had arrived that day I should have treated him with most unjustifiable rudeness Notwithstanding this unfortunate blush the remainder of our visit passed very happily for me No one who has not experienced it can have an idea how intimate a small party such as ours will grow in a short time in a country house Of course a young lady of a well regulated mind cannot possibly care a pin about any one of the opposite sex until she is well assured that he is beginning at least to like her better than all the world beside but I could not deny to myself that I was rather anxious to know more about Lord Ilbury than I actually did know There was a Peerage in its bright scarlet and gold uniform corpulent and tempting upon the little marble table in the drawing room I had many opportunities of consulting it but I never could find courage to do so For an inexperienced person it would have been a matter of several minutes and during those minutes what awful risk of surprise and detection One day all being quiet I did venture and actually with a beating heart got so far as to find out the letter Il when I heard a step outside the door which opened a little bit and I heard Lady Knollys luckily arrested at the entrance talk some sentences outside her hand still upon the door handle I shut the book as missus Bluebeard might the door of the chamber of horrors at the sound of her husband s step and skipped to a remote part of the room where Cousin Knollys found me in a mysterious state of agitation On any other subject I would have questioned Cousin Monica unhesitatingly upon this somehow I was dumb I distrusted myself and dreaded my odious habit of blushing and knew that I should look so horribly guilty and become so agitated and odd that she would have reasonably concluded that I had quite lost my heart to him After the lesson I had received and my narrow escape of detection in the very act you may be sure I never trusted myself in the vicinity of that fat and cruel Peerage which possessed the secret but would not disclose without compromising me In this state of tantalizing darkness and conjecture I should have departed had not Cousin Monica quite spontaneously relieved me The night before our departure she sat with us in our room chatting a little farewell gossip And what do you think of Ilbury she asked I think him clever and accomplished and amusing but he sometimes appears to me very melancholy that is for a few minutes together and then I fancy with an effort re engages in our conversation Yes poor Ilbury He lost his brother only about five months since and is only beginning to recover his spirits a little They were very much attached and people thought that he would have succeeded to the title had he lived because Ilbury is difficile or a philosopher or a Saint Kevin and in fact has begun to be treated as a premature old bachelor What a charming person his sister Lady Mary is She has made me promise to write to her I said I suppose such hypocrites are we to prove to Cousin Knollys that I did not care particularly to hear anything more about him Yes and so devoted to him He came down here and took The Grange for change of scene and solitude of all things the worst for a man in grief a morbid whim as he is beginning to find out for he is very glad to stay here and confesses that he is much better since he came His letters are still addressed to him as mister Carysbroke for he fancied if his rank were known that the county people would have been calling upon him and so he would have found himself soon involved in a tiresome round of dinners and must have gone somewhere else You saw him Milly at Bartram before Maud came Yes she had when he called there to see her father He thought as he had accepted the trusteeship that he could hardly residing so near omit to visit Silas He was very much struck and interested by him and he has a better opinion of him you are not angry Milly than some ill natured people I could name and he says that the cutting down of the trees will turn out to have been a mere slip But these slips don t occur with clever men in other things and some persons have a way of always making them in their own favour And to talk of other things I suspect that you and Milly will probably see Ilbury at Bartram for I think he likes you very much You did she mean both or only me So our pleasant visit was over Milly s good little curate had been much thrown in her way by our deep and dangerous cousin Monica He was most laudably steady and his flirtation advanced upon the field of theology where happily Milly s little reading had been concentrated A mild and earnest interest in poor pretty Milly s orthodoxy was the leading feature of his case and I was highly amused at her references to me when we had retired at night upon the points which she had disputed with him and her anxious reports of their low toned conferences carried on upon a sequestered ottoman where he patted and stroked his crossed leg as he smiled tenderly and shook his head at her questionable doctrine Milly s reverence for her instructor and his admiration grew daily and he was known among us as Milly s confessor He took luncheon with us on the day of our departure and with an adroit privacy which in a layman would have been sly presented her in right of his holy calling with a little book the binding of which was mediaeval and costly and whose letter press dealt in a way which he commended with some points on which she was not satisfactory and she found on the fly leaf this little inscription Presented to Miss Millicent Ruthyn by an earnest well wisher first December eighteen forty four A text very neatly penned followed this and the presentation was made unctiously indeed but with a blush as well as the accustomed smile and with eyes that were lowered The early crimson sun of December had gone down behind the hills before we took our seats in the carriage Lord Ilbury leaned with his elbow on the carriage window looking in and he said to me I really don t know what we shall do Miss Ruthyn we shall all feel so lonely For myself I think I shall run away to Grange This appeared to me as nearly perfect eloquence as human lips could utter His hand still rested on the window and the reverend Sprigge Biddlepen was standing with a saddened smirk on the door steps when the whip smacked the horses scrambled into motion and away we rolled down the avenue leaving behind us the pleasantest house and hostess in the world and trotting fleetly into darkness towards Bartram Haugh We were both rather silent Milly had her book in her lap and I saw her every now and then try to read her earnest well wisher s little inscription but there was not light to read by When we reached the great gate of Bartram Haugh it was dark Old Crowl who kept the gate I heard enjoining the postilion to make no avoidable noise at the hall door for the odd but startling reason that he believed my uncle would be dead by this time Very much shocked and frightened we stopped the carriage and questioned the tremulous old porter Uncle Silas it seemed had been silly ish all yesterday and could not be woke this morning and the doctor had been here twice being now in the house Is he better I asked tremblingly Not as I m aweer on Miss he lay at God s mercy two hours agone appen he s in heaven be this time Drive on drive fast I said to the driver Don t be frightened Milly please Heaven we shall find all going well After some delay during which my heart sank and I quite gave up Uncle Silas the aged little servant man opened the door and trotted shakily down the steps to the carriage side Uncle Silas had been at death s door for hours the question of life had trembled in the scale but now the doctor said he might do Where was the doctor In master s room he blooded him three hours agone I don t think that Milly was so frightened as I My heart beat and I was trembling so that I could hardly get upstairs CHAPTER XLIV A FRIEND ARISES At the top of the great staircase I was glad to see the friendly face of Mary Quince who stood candle in hand greeting us with many little courtesies and a very haggard and pallid smile Very welcome Miss hoping you are very well All well and you are well Mary and oh tell us quickly how is Uncle Silas We thought he was gone Miss this morning but doing fairly now doctor says in a trance like I was helping old Wyat most of the day and was there when doctor blooded him an he spoke at last but he must be awful weak he took a deal o blood from his arm Miss I held the basin And he s better decidedly better I asked Well he s better doctor says he talked some and doctor says if he goes off asleep again and begins a snoring like he did before we re to loose the bandage and let him bleed till he comes to his self again which it seems to me and Wyat is the same thing a most as saying he s to be killed off hand for I don t believe he has a drop to spare as you ll say likewise Miss if you ll please look in the basin This was not an invitation with which I cared to comply I thought I was going to faint I sat on the stairs and sipped a little water and Quince sprinkled a little in my face and my strength returned Milly must have felt her father s danger more than I for she was affectionate and loved him from habit and relation although he was not kind to her But I was more nervous and more impetuous and my feelings both stimulated and overpowered me more easily The moment I was able to stand I said thinking of nothing but the one idea We must see him come Milly I entered his sitting room a common dip candle hanging like the tower of Pisa all to one side with a dim long wick in a greasy candlestick profaned the table of the fastidious invalid The light was little better than darkness and I crossed the room swiftly still transfixed by the one idea of seeing my uncle His bed room door beside the fireplace stood partly open and I looked in Old Wyat a white high cauled ghost was pottering in her slippers in the shadow at the far side of the bed The doctor a stout little bald man with a paunch and a big bunch of seals stood with his back to the fireplace which corresponded with that in the next room eyeing his patient through the curtains of the bed with a listless sort of importance The head of the large four poster rested against the opposite wall Its foot was presented toward the fireplace but the curtains at the side which alone I could see from my position were closed The little doctor knew me and thinking me I suppose a person of consequence removed his hands from behind him suffering the skirts of his coat to fall forward and with great celerity and gravity made me a low but important bow then choosing more particularly to make my acquaintance he further advanced and with another reverence he introduced himself as Doctor Jolks in a murmured diapason He bowed me back again into my uncle s study and the light of old Wyat s dreadful candle Doctor Jolks was suave and pompous I longed for a fussy practitioner who would have got over the ground in half the time Coma madam coma Miss Ruthyn your uncle I may tell you has been in a very critical state highly so Coma of the most obstinate type He would have sunk he must have gone in fact had I not resorted to a very extreme remedy and bled him freely which happily told precisely as we could have wished A wonderful constitution a marvellous constitution prodigious nervous fibre the greatest pity in the world he won t give himself fair play His habits you know are quite I may say destructive We do our best we do all we can but if the patient won t cooperate it can t possibly end satisfactorily And Jolks accompanied this with an awful shrug Is there anything Do you think change of air What an awful complaint it is I exclaimed He smiled mysteriously looking down and shook his head undertaker like Why we can hardly call it a complaint Miss Ruthyn I look upon it he has been poisoned he has had you understand me he pursued observing my startled look an overdose of opium you know he takes opium habitually he takes it in laudanum he takes it in water and most dangerous of all he takes it solid in lozenges I ve known people take it moderately I ve known people take it to excess but they all were particular as to measure and that is exactly the point I ve tried to impress upon him The habit of course you understand is formed there s no uprooting that but he won t measure he goes by the eye and by sensation which I need not tell you Miss Ruthyn is going by chance and opium as no doubt you are aware is strictly a poison a poison no doubt which habit will enable you to partake of I may say in considerable quantities without fatal consequences but still a poison and to exhibit a poison so is I need scarcely tell you to trifle with death He has been so threatened and for a time he changes his haphazard mode of dealing with it and then returns he may escape of course that is possible but he may any day overdo the thing I don t think the present crisis will result seriously I am very glad independently of the honour of making your acquaintance Miss Ruthyn that you and your cousin have returned for however zealous I fear the servants are deficient in intelligence and as in the event of a recurrence of the symptoms which however is not probable I would beg to inform you of their nature and how exactly best to deal with them So upon these points he delivered us a pompous little lecture and begged that either Milly or I would remain in the room with the patient until his return at two or three o clock in the morning a reappearance of the coma might be very bad indeed Of course Milly and I did as we were directed We sat by the fire scarcely daring to whisper Uncle Silas about whom a new and dreadful suspicion began to haunt me lay still and motionless as if he were actually dead Had he attempted to poison himself If he believed his position to be as desperate as Lady Knollys had described it was this after all improbable There were strange wild theories I had been told mixed up in his religion Sometimes at an hour s interval a sign of life would come a moan from that tall sheeted figure in the bed a moan and a pattering of the lips Was it prayer what was it who could guess what thoughts were passing behind that white fillited forehead I had peeped at him a white cloth steeped in vinegar and water was folded round his head his great eyes were closed so were his marble lips his figure straight thin and long dressed in a white dressing gown looked like a corpse laid out in the bed his gaunt bandaged arm lay outside the sheet that covered his body With this awful image of death we kept our vigil until poor Milly grew so sleepy that old Wyat proposed that she should take her place and watch with me Little as I liked the crone with the high cauled cap she would at all events keep awake which Milly could not And so at one o clock this new arrangement began mister Dudley Ruthyn is not at home I whispered to old Wyat He went away wi himself yesternight to Cloperton Miss to see the wrestling it was to come off this morning Was he sent for Not he And why not He would na leave the sport for this I m thinking and the old woman grinned uglily When is he to return When he wants money So we grew silent and again I thought of suicide and of the unhappy old man who just then whispered a sentence or two to himself with a sigh For the next hour he had been quite silent and old Wyat informed me that she must go down for candles Ours were already burnt down to the sockets There s a candle in the next room I suggested hating the idea of being left alone with the patient Hoot Miss I dare na set a candle but wax in his presence whispered the old woman scornfully I think if we were to stir the fire and put on a little more coal we should have a great deal of light He ll ha the candles said Dame Wyat doggedly and she tottered from the chamber muttering to herself and I heard her take her candle from the next room and depart shutting the outer door after her Here was I then alone but for this unearthly companion whom I feared inexpressibly at two o clock in the vast old house of Bartram I stirred the fire It was low and would not blaze I stood up and with my hand on the mantelpiece endeavoured to think of cheerful things But it was a struggle against wind and tide vain and so I drifted away into haunted regions Uncle Silas was perfectly still I would not suffer myself to think of the number of dark rooms and passages which now separated me from the other living tenants of the house I awaited with a false composure the return of old Wyat Over the mantelpiece was a looking glass At another time this might have helped to entertain my solitary moments but now I did not like to venture a peep A small thick Bible lay on the chimneypiece and leaning its back against the mirror I began to read in it with a mind as attentively directed as I could While so engaged in turning over the leaves I lighted upon two or three odd looking papers which had been folded into it One was a broad printed thing with names and dates written into blank spaces and was about the size of a quarter of a yard of very broad ribbon The others were mere scraps with Dudley Ruthyn penned in my cousin s vulgar round hand at the foot While I folded and replaced these I really don t know what caused me to fancy that something was moving behind me as I stood with my back toward the bed I do not recollect any sound whatever but instinctively I glanced into the mirror and my eyes were instantly fixed by what I saw The figure of Uncle Silas rose up and dressed in a long white morning gown slid over the end of the bed and with two or three swift noiseless steps stood behind me with a death like scowl and a simper Preternaturally tall and thin he stood for a moment almost touching me with the white bandage pinned across his forehead his bandaged arm stiffly by his side and diving over my shoulder with his long thin hand he snatched the Bible and whispered over my head The serpent beguiled her and she did eat and after a momentary pause he glided to the farthest window and appeared to look out upon the midnight prospect It was cold but he did not seem to feel it With the same inflexible scowl and smile he continued to look out for several minutes and then with a great sigh he sat down on the side of his bed his face immovably turned towards me with the same painful look It seemed to me an hour before old Wyat came back and never was lover made happier at sight of his mistress than I to behold that withered crone You may be sure I did not prolong my watch There was now plainly no risk of my uncle s relapsing into lethargy I had a long hysterical fit of weeping when I got into my room with honest Mary Quince by my side Whenever I closed my eyes the face of Uncle Silas was before me as I had seen it reflected in the glass The sorceries of Bartram were enveloping me once more Next morning the doctor said he was quite out of danger but very weak Milly and I saw him and again in our afternoon walk we saw the doctor marching under the trees in the direction of the Windmill Wood Going down to see that poor girl there he said when he had made his salutation prodding with his levelled stick in the direction Hawke or Hawkes I think Beauty s sick Maud exclaimed Milly Hawkes She s upon my dispensary list Yes said the doctor looking into his little note book Hawkes And what is her complaint Rheumatic fever Not infectious Not the least no more as we say Miss Ruthyn than a broken leg and he laughed obligingly So soon as the doctor had departed Milly and I agreed to follow to Hawkes cottage and enquire more particularly how she was To say truth I am afraid it was rather for the sake of giving our walk a purpose and a point of termination than for any very charitable interest we might have felt in the patient Over the inequalities of the upland slope clumped with trees we reached the gabled cottage with its neglected little farm yard A rheumatic old woman was the only attendant and having turned her ear in an attitude of attention which induced us in gradually exalted keys to enquire how Meg was she informed us in very loud tones that she had long lost her hearing and was perfectly deaf And added considerately When the man comes in appen he ll tell ye what ye want Through the door of a small room at the further end of that in which we were we could see a portion of the narrow apartment of the patient and hear her moans and the doctor s voice We ll see him Milly when he comes out Let us wait here So we stood upon the door stone awaiting him The sounds of suffering had moved my compassion and interested us for the sick girl Blest if here isn t Pegtop said Milly And the weather stained red coat the swarthy forbidding face and sooty locks of old Hawkes loomed in sight as he stumped steadying himself with his stick over the uneven pavement of the yard He touched his hat gruffly to me but did not seem half to like our being where we were for he looked surlily and scratched his head under his wide awake Your daughter is very ill I m afraid said I Ay she ll be costin me a handful like her mother did said Pegtop I hope her room is comfortable poor thing Ay that s it she be comfortable enough I warrant more nor I It be all Meg and nout o Dickon When did her illness commence I asked Day the mare wor shod Saturday I talked a bit wi the workus folk but they won t gi e nout dang em an how be I to do t It be all ays hard bread wi Silas an a deal harder now she ta en them pains I won t stan it much longer Gammon If she keeps on that way I ll just cut See how the workus fellahs ill like that The Doctor gives his services for nothing I said An does nothin bless him ha ha No more nor that old deaf gammon there that costs me three tizzies a week and haint worth a h porth no more nor Meg there that s making all she can o them pains They be all a foolin o me an thinks I don t know t Hey we ll see All this time he was cutting a bit of tobacco into shreds on the window stone A workin man be same as a hoss if he baint cared he can t work tisn t in him and with these words having by this time stuffed his pipe with tobacco he poked the deaf lady who was pattering about with her back toward him rather viciously with the point of his stick and signed for a light It baint in him you can t get it out o im no more nor ye ll draw smoke out o this and he raised his pipe an inch or two with his thumb on the bowl without backy and fire Tisn t in it Maybe I can be of some use I said thinking Maybe he rejoined By this time he received from the old deaf abigail a flaming roll of brown paper and touching his hat to me he withdrew lighting his pipe and sending up little white puffs like the salute of a departing ship So he did not care to hear how his daughter was and had only come here to light his pipe Just then the Doctor emerged We have been waiting to hear how your poor patient is to day I said Very ill indeed and utterly neglected I fear If she were equal to it but she s not I think she ought to be removed to the hospital immediately That poor old woman is quite deaf and the man is so surly and selfish Could you recommend a nurse who would stay here till she s better I will pay her with pleasure and anything you think might be good for the poor girl So this was settled on the spot Doctor Jolks was kind like most men of his calling and undertook to send the nurse from Feltram with a few comforts for the patient and he called Dickon to the yard gate and I suppose told him of the arrangement and Milly and I went to the poor girl s door and asked May we come in There was no answer So with the conventional construction of silence we entered Her looks showed how ill she was We adjusted her bed clothes and darkened the room and did what we could for her noting beside what her comfort chiefly required She did not answer any questions She did not thank us I should almost have fancied that she had not perceived our presence had I not observed her dark sunken eyes once or twice turned up towards my face with a dismal look of wonder and enquiry The girl was very ill and we went every day to see her Sometimes she would answer our questions sometimes not Thoughtful observant surly she seemed and as people like to be thanked I sometimes wonder that we continued to throw our bread upon these ungrateful waters Milly was specially impatient under this treatment and protested against it and finally refused to accompany me into poor Beauty s bed room I think my good Meg said I one day as I stood by her bed she was now recovering with the sure reascent of youth that you ought to thank Miss Milly I ll not thank her said Beauty doggedly Very well Meg I only thought I d ask you for I think you ought As I spoke she very gently took just the tip of my finger which hung close to her coverlet in her fingers and drew it beneath and before I was aware burying her head in the clothes she suddenly clasped my hand in both hers to her lips and kissed it passionately again and again sobbing I felt her tears I tried to withdraw my hand but she held it with an angry pull continuing to weep and kiss it Do you wish to say anything my poor Meg I asked Nout Miss she sobbed gently and she continued to kiss my hand and weep But suddenly she said I won t thank Milly for it s a you it baint her she hadn t the thought no no it s a you Miss I cried hearty in the dark last night thinkin o the apples and the way I knocked them awa wi a pur o my foot the day father rapped me ower the head wi his stick it was kind o you and very bad o me I wish you d beat me Miss ye re better to me than father or mother better to me than a an I wish I could die for you Miss for I m not fit to look at you I was surprised I began to cry I could have hugged poor Meg I did not know her history I have never learned it since She used to talk with the most utter self abasement before me It was no religious feeling it was a kind of expression of her love and worship of me all the more strange that she was naturally very proud There was nothing she would not have borne from me except the slightest suspicion of her entire devotion or that she could in the most trifling way wrong or deceive me I am not young now I have had my sorrows and with them all that wealth virtually unlimited can command and through the retrospect a few bright and pure lights quiver along my life s dark stream dark but for them and these are shed not by the splendour of a splendid fortune but by two or three of the simplest and kindest remembrances such as the poorest and homeliest life may count up and beside which in the quiet hours of memory all artificial triumphs pale and disappear for they are never quenched by time or distance being founded on the affections and so far heavenly CHAPTER XLV A CHAPTER FULL OF LOVERS We had about this time a pleasant and quite unexpected visit from Lord Ilbury He had come to pay his respects understanding that my uncle Silas was sufficiently recovered to see visitors And I think I ll run up stairs first and see him if he admits me and then I have ever so long a message from my sister Mary for you and Miss Millicent but I had better dispose of my business first don t you think so and I shall return in a few minutes And as he spoke our tremulous old butler returned to say that Uncle Silas would be happy to see him So he departed and you can t think how pleasant our homely sitting room looked with his coat and stick in it guarantees of his return Do you think Milly he is going to speak about the timber you know that Cousin Knollys spoke of I do hope not So do I said Milly I wish he d stayed a bit longer with us first for if he does father will sure to turn him out of doors and we ll see no more of him Exactly my dear Milly and he s so pleasant and good natured And he likes you awful well he does I m sure he likes us both equally Milly he talked a great deal to you at Elverston and used to ask you so often to sing those two pretty Lancashire ballads I said but you know when you were at your controversies and religious exercises in the window with that pillar of the church the reverend Spriggs Biddlepen Get awa wi your nonsense Maud how could I help answering when he dodged me up and down my Testament and catechism an I most hate him I tell you and Cousin Knollys you re such fools I do And whatever you say the lord likes you uncommon and well you know it ye hussy I know no such thing and you don t think it you hussy and I really don t care who likes me or who doesn t except my relations and I make the lord a present to you if you ll have him In this strain were we talking when he re entered the room a little sooner than we had expected to see him Milly who you are to recollect was only in process of reformation and still retained something of the Derbyshire dairymaid gave me a little clandestine pinch on the arm just as he made his appearance I just refused a present from her said odious Milly in answer to his enquiring look because I knew she could not spare it The effect of all this was that I blushed one of my overpowering blushes People told me they became me very much I hope so for the misfortune was frequent and I think nature owed me that compensation It places you both in a most becoming light said Lord Ilbury quite innocently I really don t know which most to admire the generosity of the offer or of the refusal Well it was kind if you but knew I m most tempted to tell him said Milly I checked her with a really angry look and said Perhaps you have not observed it but I really think for a sensible person my cousin Milly here talks more nonsense than any twenty other girls A twenty girl power That s an immense compliment I ve the greatest respect for nonsense I owe it so much and I really think if nonsense were banished the earth would grow insupportable Thank you Lord Ilbury said Milly who had grown quite easy in his company during our long visit at Elverston and I tell you Miss Maud if you grow saucy I ll accept your present and what will you say then I really don t know but just now I want to ask Lord Ilbury how he thinks my uncle looks neither I nor Milly have seen him since his illness Very much weaker I think but he may be gaining strength Still as my business was not quite pleasant I thought it better to postpone it and if you think it would be right I ll write to Doctor Bryerly to ask him to postpone the discussion for a little time I at once assented and thanked him indeed if I had had my way the subject should never have been mentioned I felt so hardhearted and rapacious but Lord Ilbury explained that the trustees were constrained by the provisions of the will and that I really had no power to release them and I hoped that Uncle Silas also understood all this And now said he we ve returned to Grange my sister and I and it is nearer than Elverston so that we are really neighbours and Mary wants Lady Knollys to fix a time she owes us a visit you know and you really must come at the same time it will be so very pleasant the same party exactly meeting in a new scene and we have not half explored our neighbourhood and I ve got down all those Spanish engravings I told you of and the Venetian missals and all the rest I think I remember very accurately the things you were most interested by and they re all there and really you must promise you and Miss Millicent Ruthyn And I forgot to mention you know you complained that you were ill supplied with books so Mary thought you would allow her to share her supply they are the new books you know and when you have read yours you and she can exchange What girl was ever quite frank about her likings I don t think I was more of a cheat than others but I never could tell of myself It is quite true that this duplicity and reserve seldom deceives Our hypocrisies are forced upon some of our sex by the acuteness and vigilance of all in this field of enquiry but if we are sly we are also lynx eyed capital detectives most ingenious in fitting together the bits and dovetails of a cumulative case and in those affairs of love and liking have a terrible exploratory instinct and so for the most part when detected we are found out not only to be in love but to be rogues moreover Lady Mary was very kind but had Lady Mary of her own mere motion taken all this trouble Was there no more energetic influence at the bottom of that welcome chest of books which arrived only half an hour later The circulating library of those days was not the epidemic and ubiquitous influence to which it has grown and there were many places where it could not find you out Altogether that evening Bartram had acquired a peculiar beauty a bright and mellow glow in which even its gate posts and wheelbarrow were interesting and next day came a little cloud Dudley appeared You may be sure he wants money said Milly He and father had words this morning He took a chair at our luncheon found fault with everything in his own laconic dialect ate a good deal notwithstanding and was sulky and with Milly snappish To me on the contrary when Milly went into the hall he was mild and whimpering and disposed to be confidential There s the Governor says he hasn t a bob Danged if I know how an old fellah in his bed room muddles away money at that rate I don t suppose he thinks I can git along without tin and he knows them trustees won t gi e me a tizzy till they get what they calls an opinion dang em Bryerly says he doubts it must all go under settlement They ll settle me nicely if they do and Governor knows all about it and won t gi e me a danged brass farthin an me wi bills to pay an lawyers dang em writing letters He knows summat o that hisself does Governor and he might ha consideration a bit for his own flesh and blood I say But he never does nout for none but hisself I ll sell his books and his jewels next fit he takes that s how I ll fit him This amiable young man glowering with his elbows on the table and his fingers in his great whiskers followed his homily where clergymen append the blessing with a muttered variety of very different matter Now Maud said he pathetically leaning back suddenly in his chair with all his conscious beauty and misfortunes in his face is not it hard lines I thought the appeal was going to shape itself into an application for money but it did not I never know d a reel beauty first chop of course I mean that wasn t kind along of it and I m a fellah as can t git along without sympathy that s why I say it an isn t it hard lines Now say it s hard lines haint it Maud I did not know exactly what hard lines meant but I said I suppose it is very disagreeable And with this concession not caring to hear any more in the same vein I rose intending to take my departure No that s jest it I knew ye d say it Maud Ye re a kind lass ye be tis in yer pretty face I like ye awful I do there s not a handsomer lass in Liverpool nor Lunnon itself no where He had seized my hand and trying to place his arm about my waist essayed that salute which I had so narrowly escaped on my first introduction Don t sir I exclaimed in high indignation escaping at the same moment from his grasp No offence lass no harm Maud you must not be so shy we re cousins you know an I wouldn t hurt ye Maud no more nor I d knock my head off I wouldn t I did not wait to hear the rest of his tender protestations but without showing how nervous I was I glided out of the room quietly making an orderly retreat the more meritorious as I heard him call after me persuasively Come back Maud What are ye afeard on lass Come back I say do now there s a good wench As Milly and I were taking our walk that day in the direction of the Windmill Wood to which in consequence perhaps of some secret order we had now free access we saw Beauty for the first time since her illness in the little yard throwing grain to the poultry How do you find yourself to day Meg I am very glad to see you able to be about again but I hope it is not too soon We were standing at the barred gate of the little enclosure and quite close to Meg who however did not choose to raise her head but continuing to shower her grain and potato skins among her hens and chickens said in a low tone Father baint in sight Look jist round a bit and say if ye see him But Dickon s dusky red costume was nowhere visible So Meg looked up pale and thin and with her old grave observant eyes and she said quietly Tisn t that I m not glad to see ye but if father was to spy me talking friendly wi ye now that I m hearty and you havin no more call to me he d be all ays a watching and thinkin I was tellin o tales and appen he d want me to worrit ye for money Miss Maud an tisn t here he d spend it but in the Feltram pottusses he would and we want for nothin that s good for us But that s how twould be an he d all ays be a jawing and a lickin of I so don t mind me Miss Maud and appen I might do ye a good turn some day A few days after this little interview with Meg as Milly and I were walking briskly for it was a clear frosty day along the pleasant slopes of the sheep walk we were overtaken by Dudley Ruthyn It was not a pleasant surprise There was this mitigation however we were on foot and he driving in a dog cart along the track leading to the moor with his dogs and gun He brought his horse for a moment to a walk and with a careless nod to me removing his short pipe from his mouth he said Governor s callin for ye Milly and he told me to send you slick home to him if I saw you and I think he ll gi e ye some money but ye better take him while he s in the humour lass or mayhap ye ll go long without And with those words apparently intent on his game he nodded again and pipe in mouth drove at a quick trot over the slope of the hill and disappeared So I agreed to await Milly s return while she ran home and rejoined me where I was Away she ran in high spirits and I wandered listlessly about in search of some convenient spot to sit down upon for I was a little tired She had not been gone five minutes when I heard a step approaching and looking round saw the dog cart close by the horse browsing on the short grass and Dudley Ruthyn within a few paces of me Ye see Maud I ve bin thinkin why you re so vexed wi me an I thought I d jest come back an ask ye what I may a done to anger ye so there s no sin in that I think is there I m not angry I did not say so I hope that s enough I said startled and notwithstanding my speech very angry for I felt instinctively that Milly s despatch homeward was a mere trick and I the dupe of this coarse stratagem Well then if ye baint angry so much the better Maud I only want to know why you re afeard o me I never struck a man foul much less hurt a girl in my days besides Maud I likes ye too well to hurt ye Dang it lass you re my cousin ye know and cousins is all ays together and lovin like an none says again it I ve nothing to explain there is nothing to explain I ve been quite friendly I said hurriedly Friendly Well if there baint a cram How can ye think it friendly Maud when ye won t a most shake hands wi me It s enough to make a fellah sware or cry a most Why d ye like aggravatin a poor devil Now baint ye an ill natured little puss Maud an I likin ye so well You re the prettiest lass in Derbyshire there s nothin I wouldn t do for ye And he backed his declaration with an oath Be so good then as to re enter your dog cart and drive away I replied very much incensed Now there it is again Ye can t speak me civil Another fellah d fly out an maybe kiss ye for spite but I baint that sort I m all for coaxin and kindness an ye won t let me What be you drivin at Maud I think I ve said very plainly sir that I wish to be alone You ve nothing to say except utter nonsense and I ve heard quite enough Once for all I beg sir that you will be so good as to leave me Well now look here Maud I ll do anything you like burn me if I don t if you ll only jest be kind to me like cousins should What did I ever do to vex you If you think I like any lass better than you some fellah at Elverston s bin talkin maybe it s nout but lies an nonsense Not but there s lots o wenches likes me well enough though I be a plain lad and speaks my mind straight out I can t see that you are so frank sir as you describe you have just played a shabby trick to bring about this absurd and most disagreeable interview And supposin I did send that fool Milly out o the way to talk a bit wi you here where s the harm Dang it lass ye mustn t be too hard Didn t I say I d do whatever ye wished And you won t said I Ye mean to get along out o this Well now I will There No use of course askin you to kiss and be friends before I go as cousins should Well don t be riled lass I m not askin it only mind I do like you awful and appen I ll find ye in better humour another time Good bye Maud I ll make ye like me at last And with these words to my comfort he addressed himself to his horse and pipe and was soon honestly on his way to the moor CHAPTER XLVI THE RIVALS All the time that Dudley chose to persecute me with his odious society I continued to walk at a brisk pace toward home so that I had nearly reached the house when Milly met me with a note which had arrived for me by the post in her hand Here Milly are more verses He is a very persevering poet whoever he is So I broke the seal but this time it was prose And the first words were Captain Oakley I confess to an odd sensation as these remarkable words met my eye It might possibly be a proposal I did not wait to speculate however but read these sentences traced in the identical handwriting which had copied the lines with which I had been twice favoured Captain Oakley presents his compliments to Miss Ruthyn and trusts she will excuse his venturing to ask whether during his short stay in Feltram he might be permitted to pay his respects at Bartram Haugh He has been making a short visit to his aunt and could not find himself so near without at least attempting to renew an acquaintance which he has never ceased to cherish in memory If Miss Ruthyn would be so very good as to favour him with ever so short a reply to the question he ventures most respectfully to ask her decision would reach him at the Hall Hotel Feltram Well he s a roundabout fellah anyhow Couldn t he come up and see you if he wanted to They poeters they do love writing long yarns don t they And with this reflection Milly took the note and read it through again It s jolly polite anyhow isn t it Maud said Milly who had conned it over and accepted it as a model composition I must have been I think naturally a rather shrewd girl and considering how very little I had seen of the world nothing in fact I often wonder now at the sage conclusions at which I arrived Were I to answer this handsome and cunning fool according to his folly in what position should I find myself No doubt my reply would induce a rejoinder and that compel another note from me and that invite yet another from him and however his might improve in warmth they were sure not to abate Was it his impertinent plan with this show of respect and ceremony to drag me into a clandestine correspondence Inexperienced girl as I was I fired at the idea of becoming his dupe and fancying perhaps that there was more in merely answering his note than it would have amounted to I said That kind of thing may answer very well with button makers but ladies don t like it What would your papa think of it if he found that I had been writing to him and seeing him without his permission If he wanted to see me he could have I really did not know exactly what he could have done he could have timed his visit to Lady Knollys differently at all events he has no right to place me in an embarrassing situation and I am certain Cousin Knollys would say so and I think his note both shabby and impertinent Decision was not with me an intellectual process When quite cool I was the most undecided of mortals but once my feelings were excited I was prompt and bold I ll give the note to Uncle Silas I said quickening my pace toward home he ll know what to do But Milly who I fancy had no objection to the little romance which the young officer proposed told me that she could not see her father that he was ill and not speaking to anyone And arn t ye making a plaguy row about nothin I lay a guinea if ye had never set eyes on Lord Ilbury you d a told him to come and see ye an welcome Don t talk like a fool Milly You never knew me do anything deceitful Lord Ilbury has no more to do with it you know very well than the man in the moon I was altogether very indignant I did not speak another word to Milly The proportions of the house are so great that it is a much longer walk than you would suppose from the hall door to Uncle Silas s room But I did not cool all that way and it was not till I had just reached the lobby and saw the sour jealous face and high caul of old Wyat and felt the influence of that neighbourhood that I paused to reconsider I fancied there was a cool consciousness of success behind all the deferential phraseology of Captain Oakley which nettled me extremely No there could be no doubt I tapped softly at the door What is it now Miss snarled the querulous old woman with her shrivelled fingers on the door handle Can I see my uncle for a moment He s tired and not a word from him all day long Not ill though Awful bad in the night said the old crone with a sudden savage glare in my face as if I had brought it about Oh I m very sorry I had not heard a word of it No one does but old Wyat There s Milly there never asks neither his own child Weakness or what One o them fits He ll slide awa in one o them some day and no one but old Wyat to know nor ask word about it that s how twill be Will you please hand him this note if he is well enough to look at it and say I am at the door She took it with a peevish nod and a grunt closing the door in my face and in a few minutes returned Come in wi ye said Dame Wyat and I appeared Uncle Silas who after his nightly horror or vision lay extended on a sofa with his faded yellow silk dressing gown about him his long white hair hanging toward the ground and that wild and feeble smile lighting his face a glimmer I feared to look upon his long thin arms lay by his sides with hands and fingers that stirred not except when now and then with a feeble motion he wet his temples and forehead with eau de Cologne from a glass saucer placed beside him Excellent girl dutiful ward and niece murmured the oracle heaven reward you your frank dealing is your own safety and my peace Sit you down and say who is this Captain Oakley when you made his acquaintance what his age fortune and expectations and who the aunt he mentions Upon all these points I satisfied him as fully as I was able Wyat the white drops he called in a thin stern tone I ll write a line presently I can t see visitors and of course you can t receive young captains before you ve come out Farewell God bless you dear Wyat was dropping the white restorative into a wine glass and the room was redolent of ether I was glad to escape The figures and whole mise en scene were unearthly Well Milly I said as I met her in the hall your papa is going to write to him I sometimes wonder whether Milly was right and how I should have acted a few months earlier Next day whom should we meet in the Windmill Wood but Captain Oakley The spot where this interesting rencontre occurred was near that ruinous bridge on my sketch of which I had received so many compliments It was so great a surprise that I had not time to recollect my indignation and having received him very affably I found it impossible during our brief interview to recover my lost altitude After our greetings were over and some compliments neatly made he said I had such a curious note from mister Silas Ruthyn I am sure he thinks me a very impertinent fellow for it was really anything but inviting extremely rude in fact But I could not quite see that because he does not want me to invade his bed room an incursion I never dreamed of I was not to present myself to you who had already honoured me with your acquaintance with the sanction of those who were most interested in your welfare and who were just as well qualified as he I fancy to say who were qualified for such an honour My uncle mister Silas Ruthyn you are aware is my guardian and this is my cousin his daughter This was an opportunity of becoming a little lofty and I improved it He raised his hat and bowed to Milly I m afraid I ve been very rude and stupid mister Ruthyn of course has a perfect right to to in fact I was not the least aware that I had the honour of so near a relation s a a and what exquisite scenery you have I think this country round Feltram particularly fine and this Bartram Haugh is I venture to say about the very most beautiful spot in this beautiful region I do assure you I am tempted beyond measure to make Feltram and the Hall Hotel my head quarters for at least a week I only regret the foliage but your trees show wonderfully even in winter so many of them have got that ivy about them They say it spoils trees but it certainly beautifies them I have just ten days leave unexpired I wish I could induce you to advise me how to apply them What shall I do Miss Ruthyn I am the worst person in the world to make plans even for myself I find it so troublesome What do you say Suppose you try Wales or Scotland and climb up some of those fine mountains that look so well in winter I should much prefer Feltram I so wish you would recommend it What is this pretty plant We call that Maud s myrtle She planted it and it s very pretty when it s full in blow said Milly Our visit to Elverston had been of immense use to us both Oh planted by you he said very softly with a momentary corresponding glance May I ever so little just a leaf And without waiting for permission he held a sprig of it next his waistcoat Yes it goes very prettily with those buttons They are very pretty buttons are not they Milly A present a souvenir I dare say This was a terrible hit at the button maker and I thought he looked a little oddly at me but my countenance was so bewitchingly simple that I suppose his suspicions were allayed Now it was very odd of me I must confess to talk in this way and to receive all those tender allusions from a gentleman about whom I had spoken and felt so sharply only the evening before But Bartram was abominably lonely A civilised person was a valuable waif or stray in that region of the picturesque and the brutal and to my lady reader especially because she will probably be hardest upon me I put it can you not recollect any such folly in your own past life Can you not in as many minutes call to mind at least six similar inconsistencies of your own practising For my part I really can t see the advantage of being the weaker sex if we are always to be as strong as our masculine neighbours There was indeed no revival of the little sentiment which I had once experienced When these things once expire I do believe they are as hard to revive as our dead lap dogs guinea pigs and parrots It was my perfect coolness which enabled me to chat I flatter myself so agreeably with the refined Captain who plainly thought me his captive and was probably now and then thinking what was to be done to utilise that little bit of Bartram or to beautify some other when he should see fit to become its master as we rambled over these wild but beautiful grounds It was just about then that Milly nudged me rather vehemently and whispered Look there I followed with mine the direction of her eyes and saw my odious cousin Dudley in a flagrant pair of cross barred peg tops and what Milly before her reformation used to call other slops of corresponding atrocity approaching our refined little party with great strides I really think that Milly was very nearly ashamed of him I certainly was I had no apprehension however of the scene which was imminent The charming Captain mistook him probably for some rustic servant of the place for he continued his agreeable remarks up to the very moment when Dudley whose face was pale with anger and whose rapid advance had not served to cool him without recollecting to salute either Milly or me accosted our elegant companion as follows By your leave master baint you summat in the wrong box here don t you think He had planted himself directly in his front and looked unmistakably menacing May I speak to him Will you excuse me said the Captain blandly Ow ay they ll excuse ye ready enough I dessay you re to deal wi me though Baint ye in the wrong box now I m not conscious sir of being in a box at all replied the Captain with severe disdain It strikes me you are disposed to get up a row Let us if you please get a little apart from the ladies if that is your purpose I mean to turn you out o this the way ye came If you make a row so much the wuss for you for I ll lick ye to fits Tell him not to fight whispered Milly he ll a no chance wi Dudley I saw Dickon Hawkes grinning over the paling on which he leaned mister Hawkes I said drawing Milly with me toward that unpromising mediator pray prevent unpleasantness and go between them An git licked o both sides Rather not Miss thank ye grinned Dickon tranquilly Who are you sir demanded our romantic acquaintance with military sternness I ll tell you who you are you re Oakley as stops at the Hall that Governor wrote over night not to dare show your nose inside the grounds You re a half starved cappen come down here to look for a wife and Before Dudley could finish his sentence Captain Oakley than whose face no regimentals could possibly have been more scarlet at that moment struck with his switch at Dudley s handsome features I don t know how it was done by some devilish cantrip slight A smack was heard and the Captain lay on his back on the ground with his mouth full of blood How do ye like the taste o that roared Dickon from his post of observation In an instant Captain Oakley was on his feet again hatless looking quite frantic and striking out at Dudley who was ducking and dipping quite coolly and again the same horrid sound only this time it was double like a quick postman s knock and Captain Oakley was on the grass again Tapped his smeller by thundered Dickon with a roar of laughter Come away Milly I m growing ill said I Drop it Dudley I tell ye you ll kill him screamed Milly But the devoted Captain whose nose and mouth and shirt front formed now but one great patch of blood and who was bleeding beside over one eye dashed at him again I turned away I felt quite faint and on the point of crying with mere horror Hammer away at his knocker bellowed Dickon in a frenzy of delight He ll break it now if it ain t already cried Milly alluding as I afterwards understood to the Captain s Grecian nose Brayvo little un The Captain was considerably the taller Another smack and I suppose Captain Oakley fell once more Hooray the dinner service again by roared Dickon Stick to that Over the same ground subsoil I say He han t enough yet In a perfect tremor of disgust I was making as quick a retreat as I could and as I did I heard Captain Oakley shriek hoarsely You re a d prizefighter I can t box you I told ye I d lick ye to fits hooted Dudley But you re the son of a gentleman and by you shall fight me as a gentleman A yell of hooting laughter from Dudley and Dickon followed this sally Gi e my love to the Colonel and think o me when ye look in the glass won t ye An so you re goin arter all well follow what s left o yer nose Ye forgot some o yer ivories didn t ye on th grass These and many similar jibes followed the mangled Captain in his retreat CHAPTER XLVII DOCTOR BRYERLY REAPPEARS No one who has not experienced it can imagine the nervous disgust and horror which such a spectacle as we had been forced in part to witness leaves upon the mind of a young person of my peculiar temperament It affected ever after my involuntary estimate of the principal actors in it An exhibition of such thorough inferiority accompanied by such a shock to the feminine sense of elegance is not forgotten by any woman Captain Oakley had been severely beaten by a smaller man It was pitiable but also undignified and Milly s anxieties about his teeth and nose though in a certain sense horrible had also a painful suspicion of the absurd People say on the other hand that superior prowess even in such barbarous contests inspires in our sex an interest akin to admiration I can positively say in my case it was quite the reverse Dudley Ruthyn stood lower than ever in my estimation for though I feared him more it was by reason of these brutal and cold blooded associations After this I lived in constant apprehension of being summoned to my uncle s room and being called on for an explanation of my meeting with Captain Oakley which notwithstanding my perfect innocence looked suspicious but no such inquisition resulted Perhaps he did not suspect me or perhaps he thought not in his haste all women are liars and did not care to hear what I might say I rather lean to the latter interpretation The exchequer just now I suppose by some means was replenished for next morning Dudley set off upon one of his fashionable excursions as poor Milly thought them to Wolverhampton And the same day doctor Bryerly arrived Milly and I from my room window saw him step from his vehicle to the court yard A lean man with sandy hair and whiskers was in the chaise with him doctor Bryerly descended in the unchangeable black suit that always looked new and never fitted him The Doctor looked careworn and older I thought by several years than when I last saw him He was not shown up to my uncle s room on the contrary Milly who was more actively curious than I ascertained that our tremulous butler informed him that my uncle was not sufficiently well for an interview Whereupon doctor Bryerly had pencilled a note the reply to which was a message from Uncle Silas saying that he would be happy to see him in five minutes As Milly and I were conjecturing what it might mean and before the five minutes had expired Mary Quince entered Wyat bid me tell you Miss your uncle wants you this minute When I entered his room Uncle Silas was seated at the table with his desk before him He looked up Could anything be more dignified suffering and venerable I sent for you dear he said very gently extending his thin white hand and taking mine which he held affectionately while he spoke because I desire to have no secrets and wish you thoroughly to know all that concerns your own interests while subject to my guardianship and I am happy to think my beloved niece that you requite my candour Oh here is the gentleman Sit down dear Doctor Bryerly was advancing as it seemed to shake hands with Uncle Silas who however rose with a severe and haughty air not the least over acted and made him a slow ceremonious bow I wondered how the homely Doctor could confront so tranquilly that astounding statue of hauteur A faint and weary smile rather sad than comtemptuous was the only sign he showed of feeling his repulse How do you do Miss he said extending his hand and greeting me after his ungallant fashion as if it were an afterthought I think I may as well take a chair sir said Doctor Bryerly sitting down serenely near the table and crossing his ungainly legs My uncle bowed You understand the nature of the business sir Do you wish Miss Ruthyn to remain asked Doctor Bryerly I sent for her sir replied my uncle in a very gentle and sarcastic tone a smile on his thin lips and his strangely contorted eyebrows raised for a moment contemptuously This gentleman my dear Maud thinks proper to insinuate that I am robbing you It surprises me a little and no doubt you I ve nothing to conceal and wished you to be present while he favours me more particularly with his views I m right I think in describing it as robbery sir Why said Doctor Bryerly thoughtfully for he was treating the matter as one of right and not of feeling it would be certainly taking that which does not belong to you and converting it to your own use but at the worst it would more resemble thieving I think than robbery I saw Uncle Silas s lip eyelid and thin cheek quiver and shrink as if with a thrill of tic douloureux as Doctor Bryerly spoke this unconsciously insulting answer My uncle had however the self command which is learned at the gaming table He shrugged with a chilly sarcastic little laugh and a glance at me Your note says waste I think sir Yes waste the felling and sale of timber in the Windmill Wood the selling of oak bark and burning of charcoal as I m informed said Bryerly as sadly and quietly as a man might relate a piece of intelligence from the newspaper Detectives or private spies of your own or perhaps my servants bribed with my poor brother s money A very high minded procedure Nothing of the kind sir My uncle sneered I mean sir there has been no undue canvass for evidence and the question is simply one of right and it is our duty to see that this inexperienced young lady is not defrauded By her own uncle By anyone said Doctor Bryerly with a natural impenetrability that excited my admiration Of course you come armed with an opinion said my smiling uncle insinuatingly The case is before mister Serjeant Grinders These bigwigs don t return their cases sometimes so quickly as we could wish Then you have no opinion smiled my uncle My solicitor is quite clear upon it and it seems to me there can be no question raised but for form s sake Yes for form s sake you take one and in the meantime upon a nice question of law the surmises of a thick headed attorney and of an ingenious apoth I beg pardon physician are sufficient warrant for telling my niece and ward in my presence that I am defrauding her My uncle leaned back in his chair and smiled with a contemptuous patience over Doctor Bryerly s head as he spoke I don t know whether I used that expression sir but I am speaking merely in a technical sense I mean to say that whether by mistake or otherwise you are exercising a power which you don t lawfully possess and that the effect of that is to impoverish the estate and by so much as it benefits you to wrong this young lady I m a technical defrauder I see and your manner conveys the rest I thank my God sir I am a very different man from what I once was Uncle Silas was speaking in a low tone and with extraordinary deliberation I remember when I should have certainly knocked you down sir or tried it at least for a great deal less But seriously sir what do you propose asked Doctor Bryerly sternly and a little flushed for I think the old man was stirred within him and though he did not raise his voice his manner was excited I propose to defend my rights sir murmured Uncle Silas very grim I m not without an opinion though you are You seem to think sir that I have a pleasure in annoying you you are quite wrong I hate annoying anyone constitutionally I hate it but don t you see sir the position I m placed in I wish I could please everyone and do my duty Uncle Silas bowed and smiled I ve brought with me the Scotch steward from Tolkingden your estate Miss and if you let us we will visit the spot and make a note of what we observe that is assuming that you admit waste and merely question our law If you please sir you and your Scotchman shall do no such thing and bearing in mind that I neither deny nor admit anything you will please further never more to present yourself under any pretext whatsoever either in this house or on the grounds of Bartram Haugh during my lifetime Uncle Silas rose up with the same glassy smile and scowl in token that the interview was ended Good bye sir said Doctor Bryerly with a sad and thoughtful air and hesitating for a moment he said to me Do you think Miss you could afford me a word in the hall Not a word sir snarled Uncle Silas with a white flash from his eyes There was a pause Sit where you are Maud Another pause If you have anything to say to my ward sir you will please to say it here Doctor Bryerly s dark and homely face was turned on me with an expression of unspeakable compassion I was going to say that if you think of any way in which I can be of the least service Miss I m ready to act that s all mind any way He hesitated looking at me with the same expression as if he had something more to say but he only repeated That s all Miss Won t you shake hands Doctor Bryerly before you go I said eagerly approaching him Without a smile with the same sad anxiety in his face with his mind as it seemed to me on something else and irresolute whether to speak it or be silent he took my fingers in a very cold hand and holding it so and slowly shaking it his grave and troubled glance unconsciously rested on Uncle Silas s face while in a sad tone and absent way he said Good bye Miss From before that sad gaze my uncle averted his strange eyes quickly and looked oddly to the window In a moment more Doctor Bryerly let my hand go with a sigh and with an abrupt little nod to me he left the room and I heard that dismallest of sounds the retreating footsteps of a true friend lost Lead us not into temptation if we pray so we must not mock the eternal Majesty of Heaven by walking into temptation of our own accord This oracular sentence was not uttered by my uncle until Doctor Bryerly had been gone at least five minutes I ve forbid him my house Maud first because his perfectly unconscious insolence tries my patience nearly beyond endurance and again because I have heard unfavourable reports of him On the question of right which he disputes I am perfectly informed I am your tenant my dear niece when I am gone you will learn how scrupulous I have been you will see how under the pressure of the most agonising pecuniary difficulties the terrific penalty of a misspent youth I have been careful never by a hair s breadth to transgress the strict line of my legal privileges alike as your tenant Maud and as your guardian how amid frightful agitations I have kept myself by the miraculous strength and grace vouchsafed me pure The world he resumed after a short pause has no faith in any man s conversion it never forgets what he was it never believes him anything better it is an inexorable and stupid judge What I was I will describe in blacker terms and with more heartfelt detestation than my traducers a reckless prodigal a godless profligate Such I was what I am I am If I had no hope beyond this world of all men most miserable but with that hope a sinner saved Then he waxed eloquent and mystical I think his Swedenborgian studies had crossed his notions of religion with strange lights I never could follow him quite in these excursions into the region of symbolism I only recollect that he talked of the deluge and the waters of Mara and said I am washed I am sprinkled and then pausing bathed his thin temples and forehead with eau de Cologne a process which was perhaps suggested by his imagery of sprinkling and so forth Thus refreshed he sighed and smiled and passed to the subject of Doctor Bryerly Of Doctor Bryerly I know that he is sly that he loves money was born poor and makes nothing by his profession But he possesses many thousand pounds under my poor brother s will of your money and he has glided with of course a modest nolo episcopari into the acting trusteeship with all its multitudinous opportunities of your immense property That is not doing so badly for a visionary Swedenborgian Such a man must prosper But if he expected to make money of me he is disappointed Money however he will make of his trusteeship as you will see It is a dangerous resolution But if he will seek the life of Dives the worst I wish him is to find the death of Lazarus But whether like Lazarus he be borne of angels into Abraham s bosom or like the rich man only dies and is buried and the rest neither living nor dying do I desire his company Uncle Silas here seemed suddenly overtaken by exhaustion He leaned back with a ghastly look and his lean features glistened with the dew of faintness I screamed for Wyat But he soon recovered sufficiently to smile his odd smile and with it and his frown nodded and waved me away CHAPTER XLVIII QUESTION AND ANSWER My uncle after all was not ill that day after the strange fashion of his malady be it what it might Old Wyat repeated in her sour laconic way that there was nothing to speak of amiss with him But there remained with me a sense of pain and fear Doctor Bryerly notwithstanding my uncle s sarcastic reflections remained in my estimation a true and wise friend I had all my life been accustomed to rely upon others and here haunted by many unavowed and ill defined alarms and doubts the disappearance of an active and able friend caused my heart to sink Still there remained my dear Cousin Monica and my pleasant and trusted friend Lord Ilbury and in less than a week arrived an invitation from Lady Mary to the Grange for me and Milly to meet Lady Knollys It was accompanied she told me by a note from Lord Ilbury to my uncle supporting her request and in the afternoon I received a message to attend my uncle in his room An invitation from Lady Mary Carysbroke for you and Milly to meet Monica Knollys have you received it asked my uncle so soon as I was seated Answered in the affirmative he continued Now Maud Ruthyn I expect the truth from you I have been frank so shall you Have you ever heard me spoken ill of by Lady Knollys I was quite taken aback I felt my cheeks flushing I was returning his fierce cold gaze with a stupid stare and remained dumb Yes Maud you have I looked down in silence I know it but it is right you should answer have you or have you not I had to clear my voice twice or thrice There was a kind of spasm in my throat I am trying to recollect I said at last Do recollect he replied imperiously There was a little interval of silence I would have given the world to be on any conditions anywhere else in the world Surely Maud you don t wish to deceive your guardian Come the question is a plain one and I know the truth already I ask you again have you ever heard me spoken ill of by Lady Knollys Lady Knollys I said half articulately speaks very freely and often half in jest but I continued observing something menacing in his face I have heard her express disapprobation of some things you have done Come Maud he continued in a stern though still a low key did she not insinuate that charge then I suppose in a state of incubation the other day presented here full fledged with beak and claws by that scheming apothecary the statement that I was defrauding you by cutting down timber upon the grounds She certainly did mention the circumstance but she also argued that it might have been through ignorance of the extent of your rights Come come Maud you must not prevaricate girl I will have it Does she not habitually speak disparagingly of me in your presence and to you Answer I hung my head Yes or no Well perhaps so yes I faltered and burst into tears There don t cry it may well shock you Did she not to your knowledge say the same things in presence of my child Millicent I know it I repeat there is no use in hesitating and I command you to answer Sobbing I told the truth Now sit still while I write my reply He wrote with the scowl and smile so painful to witness as he looked down upon the paper and then he placed the note before me Read that my dear It began MY DEAR LADY KNOLLYS You have favoured me with a note adding your request to that of Lord Ilbury that I should permit my ward and my daughter to avail themselves of Lady Mary s invitation Being perfectly cognisant of the ill feeling you have always and unaccountably cherished toward me and also of the terms in which you have had the delicacy and the conscience to speak of me before and to my child and my ward I can only express my amazement at the modesty of your request while peremptorily refusing it And I shall conscientiously adopt effectual measures to prevent your ever again having an opportunity of endeavouring to destroy my influence and authority over my ward and my child by direct or insinuated slander Your defamed and injured kinsman SILAS RUTHYN I was stunned yet what could I plead against the blow that was to isolate me I wept aloud with my hands clasped looking on the marble face of the old man Without seeming to hear he folded and sealed his note and then proceeded to answer Lord Ilbury When that note was written he placed it likewise before me and I read it also through It simply referred him to Lady Knollys for an explanation of the unhappy circumstances which compelled him to decline an invitation which it would have made his niece and his daughter so happy to accept You see my dear Maud how frank I am with you he said waving the open note which I had just read slightly before he folded it I think I may ask you to reciprocate my candour Dismissed from this interview I ran to Milly who burst into tears from sheer disappointment so we wept and wailed together But in my grief I think there was more reason I sat down to the dismal task of writing to my dear Lady Knollys I implored her to make her peace with my uncle I told her how frank he had been with me and how he had shown me his sad reply to her letter I told her of the interview to which he had himself invited me with doctor Bryerly how little disturbed he was by the accusation no sign of guilt quite the contrary perfect confidence I implored of her to think the best and remembering my isolation to accomplish a reconciliation with Uncle Silas Only think I wrote I only nineteen and two years of solitude before me What a separation No broken merchant ever signed the schedule of his bankruptcy with a heavier heart than did I this letter The griefs of youth are like the wounds of the gods there is an ichor which heals the scars from which it flows and thus Milly and I consoled ourselves and next day enjoyed our ramble our talk and readings with a wonderful resignation to the inevitable Milly and I stood in the relation of Lord Duberly to Doctor Pangloss I was to mend her cackleology and the occupation amused us both I think at the bottom of our submission to destiny lurked a hope that Uncle Silas the inexorable would relent or that Cousin Monica that siren would win and melt him to her purpose Whatever comfort however I derived from the absence of Dudley was not to be of very long duration for one morning as I was amusing myself alone with a piece of worsted work thinking and just at that moment not unpleasantly of many things my cousin Dudley entered the room Back again like a bad halfpenny ye see And how a ye bin ever since lass Purely I warrant be your looks I m jolly glad to see ye I am no cattle going like ye Maud I think I must ask you to let go my hand as I can t continue my work I said very stiffly hoping to chill his enthusiasm a little Anything to pleasure ye Maud tain t in my heart to refuse ye nout I a bin to Wolverhampton lass jolly row there and run

some time I don t think it is respectful I said a little sharply If ye bid me go I d a most go but I could na quite there s nout on earth I would na do for you Maud excep leaving you And that I said with a petulant flush is the only thing on earth I would ask you to do Blessed if you baint a blushin Maud he drawled with an odious grin His stupidity was proof against everything It is too bad I muttered with an indignant little pat of my foot and mimic stamp Well you lasses be queer cattle ye re angry wi me now cos ye think I got into mischief ye do Maud ye know t ye buxsom little fool down there at Wolverhampton and jest for that ye re ready to turn me off again the minute I come back tisn t fair I don t understand you sir and I beg that you ll leave me Now didn t I tell ye about leavin

there s none like ye there isn t and I wish you d have me I ha n t much tin father s run through a deal he s pretty well up a tree ye know but though I baint so rich as some folk I m a better man appen and if ye d take a tidy lad that likes ye awful and id die for your sake why here he is What can you mean sir I exclaimed rising in indignant bewilderment I mean Maud if ye ll marry me you ll never ha cause to complain I ll never let ye want for nout nor gi e ye a wry word Actually a proposal I ejaculated like a person speaking in a dream I stood with my hand on the back of a chair staring at Dudley and looking I dare say as stupefied as I felt There s a good lass ye would na deny me said the odious creature with one knee on the seat of the chair behind which I was standing and attempting to place his arm lovingly round my neck This effectually roused me and starting back I stamped upon the ground with actual fury What has there ever been sir in my conduct words or looks to warrant this unparalleled audacity But that you are as stupid as you are impertinent brutal and ugly you must long ago sir have seen how I dislike you How dare you sir Don t presume to obstruct me I m going to my uncle I had never spoken so violently to mortal before He in turn looked a little confounded and I passed his extended but motionless arm with a quick and angry step He followed me a pace or two however before I reached the door looking horridly angry but stopped and only swore after me some of those wry words which I was never to have heard I was myself however too much incensed and moving at too rapid a pace to catch their import and I had knocked at my uncle s door before I began to collect my thoughts Come in replied my uncle s voice clear thin and peevish I entered and confronted him Your son sir has insulted me He looked at me with a cold curiosity steadly for a few seconds as I stood panting before him with flaming cheeks Insulted you repeated he Egad you surprise me The ejaculation savoured of the old man to borrow his scriptural phrase more than anything I had heard from him before How he continued how has Dudley insulted you my dear child Come you re excited sit down take time and tell me all about it I did not know that Dudley was here I he it is an insult He knew very well he must know I dislike him and he presumed to make a proposal of marriage to me O o oh exclaimed my uncle with a prolonged intonation which plainly said Is that the mighty matter He looked at me as he leaned back with the same steady curiosity this time smiling which somehow frightened me and his countenance looked to me wicked like the face of a witch with a guilt I could not understand And that is the amount of your complaint He made you a formal proposal of marriage Yes he proposed for me As I cooled I began to feel just a very little disconcerted and a suspicion was troubling me that possibly an indifferent person might think that having no more to complain of my language was perhaps a little exaggerated and my demeanour a little too tempestuous My uncle I dare say saw some symptoms of this misgiving for smiling still he said My dear Maud however just you appear to me a little cruel you don t seem to remember how much you are yourself to blame you have one faithful friend at least whom I advise your consulting I mean your looking glass The foolish fellow is young quite ignorant in the world s ways He is in love desperately enamoured Aimer c est craindre et craindre c est souffrir And suffering prompts to desperate remedies We must not be too hard on a rough but romantic young fool who talks according to his folly and his pain CHAPTER XLIX AN APPARITION But after all he suddenly resumed as if a new thought had struck him is it quite such folly after all It really strikes me dear Maud that the subject may be worth a second thought No no you won t refuse to hear me he said observing me on the point of protesting I am of course assuming that you are fancy free I am assuming too that you don t care twopence about Dudley and even that you fancy you dislike him You know in that pleasant play poor Sheridan delightful fellow all our fine spirits are dead he makes missus Malaprop say there is nothing like beginning with a little aversion Now though in matrimony of course that is only a joke yet in love believe me it is no such thing His own marriage with Miss Ogle I know was a case in point She expressed a positive horror of him at their first acquaintance and yet I believe she would a few months later have died rather than not have married him I was again about to speak but with a smile he beckoned me into silence There are two or three points you must bear in mind One of the happiest privileges of your fortune is that you may without imprudence marry simply for love There are few men in England who could offer you an estate comparable with that you already possess or in fact appreciably increase the splendour of your fortune If therefore he were in all other respects eligible I can t see that his poverty would be an objection to weigh for one moment He is quite a rough diamond He has been like many young men of the highest rank too much given up to athletic sports to that society which constitutes the aristocracy of the ring and the turf and all that kind of thing You see I am putting all the worst points first But I have known so many young men in my day after a madcap career of a few years among prizefighters wrestlers and jockeys learning their slang and affecting their manners take up and cultivate the graces and the decencies There was poor dear Newgate many degrees lower in that kind of frolic who when he grew tired of it became one of the most elegant and accomplished men in the House of Peers Poor Newgate he s gone too I could reckon up fifty of my early friends who all began like Dudley and all turned out more or less like Newgate At this moment came a knock at the door and Dudley put in his head most inopportunely for the vision of his future graces and accomplishments My good fellow said his father with a sharp sort of playfulness I happen to be talking about my son and should rather not be overheard you will therefore choose another time for your visit Dudley hesitated gruffly at the door but another look from his father dismissed him And now my dear you are to remember that Dudley has fine qualities the most affectionate son in his rough way that ever father was blessed with most admirable qualities indomitable courage and a high sense of honour and lastly that he has the Ruthyn blood the purest blood I maintain it in England My uncle as he said this drew himself up a little unconsciously his thin hand laid lightly over his heart with a little patting motion and his countenance looked so strangely dignified and melancholy that in admiring contemplation of it I lost some sentences which followed next Therefore dear naturally anxious that my boy should not be dismissed from home as he must be should you persevere in rejecting his suit I beg that you will reserve your decision to this day fortnight when I will with much pleasure hear what you may have to say on the subject But till then observe me not a word That evening he and Dudley were closeted for a long time I suspect that he lectured him on the psychology of ladies for a bouquet was laid beside my plate every morning at breakfast which it must have been troublesome to get for the conservatory at Bartram was a desert In a few days more an anonymous green parrot arrived in a gilt cage with a little note in a clerk s hand addressed to Miss Ruthyn of Knowl Bartram Haugh c It contained only Directions for caring green parrot at the close of which underlined the words appeared The bird s name is Maud The bouquets I invariably left on the table cloth where I found them the bird I insisted on Milly s keeping as her property During the intervening fortnight Dudley never appeared as he used sometimes to do before at luncheon nor looked in at the window as we were at breakfast He contented himself with one day placing himself in my way in the hall in his shooting accoutrements and with a clumsy shuffling kind of respect and hat in hand he said I think Miss I must a spoke uncivil t other day I was so awful put about and didn t know no more nor a child what I was saying and I wanted to tell ye I m sorry for it and I beg your pardon very humble I do I did not know what to say I therefore said nothing but made a grave inclination and passed on Two or three times Milly and I saw him at a little distance in our walks He never attempted to join us Once only he passed so near that some recognition was inevitable and he stopped and in silence lifted his hat with an awkward respect But although he did not approach us he was ostentatious with a kind of telegraphic civility in the distance He opened gates he whistled his dogs to heel he drove away cattle and then himself withdrew I really think he watched us occasionally to render these services for in this distant way we encountered him decidedly oftener than we used to do before his flattering proposal of marriage You may be sure that we discussed Milly and I that occurrence pretty constantly in all sorts of moods Limited as had been her experience of human society she very clearly saw now how far below its presentable level was her hopeful brother The fortnight sped swiftly as time always does when something we dislike and shrink from awaits us at its close I never saw Uncle Silas during that period It may seem odd to those who merely read the report of our last interview in which his manner had been more playful and his talk more trifling than in any other that from it I had carried away a profounder sense of fear and insecurity than from any other It was with a foreboding of evil and an awful dejection that on a very dark day in Milly s room I awaited the summons which I was sure would reach me from my punctual guardian As I looked from the window upon the slanting rain and leaden sky and thought of the hated interview that awaited me I pressed my hand to my troubled heart and murmured O that I had wings like a dove then would I flee away and be at rest Just then the prattle of the parrot struck my ear I looked round on the wire cage and remembered the words The bird s name is Maud Poor bird I said I dare say Milly it longs to get out If it were a native of this country would not you like to open the window and then the door of that cruel cage and let the poor thing fly away Master wants Miss Maud said Wyat s disagreeable tones at the half open door I followed in silence with the pressure of a near alarm at my heart like a person going to an operation When I entered the room my heart beat so fast that I could hardly speak The tall form of Uncle Silas rose before me and I made him a faltering reverence He darted from under his brows a wild fierce glance at old Wyat and pointed to the door imperiously with his skeleton finger The door shut and we were alone A chair he said pointing to a seat Thank you uncle I prefer standing I faltered He also stood his white head bowed forward the phosphoric glare of his strange eyes shone upon me from under his brows his finger nails just rested on the table You saw the luggage corded and addressed as it stands ready for removal in the hall he asked I had Milly and I had read the cards which dangled from the trunk handles and gun case The address was mister Dudley R Ruthyn Paris via Dover I am old agitated on the eve of a decision on which much depends Pray relieve my suspense Is my son to leave Bartram to day in sorrow or to remain in joy Pray answer quickly I stammered I know not what I was incoherent wild perhaps but somehow I expressed my meaning my unalterable decision I thought his lips grew whiter and his eyes shone brighter as I spoke When I had quite made an end he heaved a great sigh and turning his eyes slowly to the right and the left like a man in a helpless distraction he whispered God s will be done I thought he was upon the point of fainting a clay tint darkened the white of his face and seeming to forget my presence he sat down looking with a despairing scowl on his ashy old hand as it lay upon the table I stood gazing at him feeling almost as if I had murdered the old man he still gazing askance with an imbecile scowl upon his hand Shall I go sir I at length found courage to whisper Go he said looking up suddenly and it seemed to me as if a stream of cold sheet lightning had crossed and enveloped me for a moment Go oh a yes yes Maud go I must see poor Dudley before his departure he added as it were in soliloquy Trembling lest he should revoke his permission to depart I glided quickly and noiselessly from the room Old Wyat was prowling outside with a cloth in her hand pretending to dust the carved door case She frowned a stare of enquiry over her shrunken arm on me as I passed Milly who had been on the watch ran and met me We heard my uncle s voice as I shut the door calling Dudley He had been waiting probably in the adjoining room I hurried into my chamber with Milly at my side and there my agitation found relief in tears as that of girlhood naturally does A little while after we saw from the window Dudley looking I thought very pale get into a vehicle on the top of which his luggage lay and drive away from Bartram I began to take comfort His departure was an inexpressible relief His final departure a distant journey We had tea in Milly s room that night Firelight and candles are inspiring In that red glow I always felt and feel more safe as well as more comfortable than in the daylight quite irrationally for we know the night is the appointed day of such as love the darkness better than light and evil walks thereby But so it is Perhaps the very consciousness of external danger enhances the enjoyment of the well lighted interior just as the storm does that roars and hurtles over the roof While Milly and I were talking very cosily a knock came to the room door and without waiting for an invitation to enter old Wyat came in and glowering at us with her brown claw upon the door handle she said to Milly Ye must leave your funnin Miss Milly and take your turn in your father s room Is he ill I asked She answered addressing not me but Milly A wrought two hours in a fit arter Master Dudley went Twill be the death o him I m thinkin poor old fellah I wor sorry myself when I saw Master Dudley a going off in the moist to day poor fellah There s trouble enough in the family without a that but twon t be a family long I m thinkin Nout but trouble nout but trouble since late changes came Judging by the sour glance she threw on me as she said this I concluded that I represented those late changes to which all the sorrows of the house were referred I felt unhappy under the ill will even of this odious old woman being one of those unhappily constructed mortals who cannot be indifferent when they reasonably ought and always yearn after kindness even that of the worthless I must go I wish you d come wi me Maud I m so afraid all alone said Milly imploringly Certainly Milly I answered not liking it you may be sure you shan t sit there alone So together we went old Wyat cautioning us for our lives to make no noise We passed through the old man s sitting room where that day had occurred his brief but momentous interview with me and his parting with his only son and entered the bed room at the farther end A low fire burned in the grate The room was in a sort of twilight A dim lamp near the foot of the bed at the farther side was the only light burning there Old Wyat whispered an injunction not to speak above our breaths nor to leave the fireside unless the sick man called or showed signs of weariness These were the directions of the doctor who had been there So Milly and I sat ourselves down near the hearth and old Wyat left us to our resources We could hear the patient breathe but he was quite still In whispers we talked but our conversation flagged I was after my wont upbraiding myself for the suffering I had inflicted After about half an hour s desultory whispering and intervals growing longer and longer of silence it was plain that Milly was falling asleep She strove against it and I tried hard to keep her talking but it would not do sleep overcame her and I was the only person in that ghastly room in a state of perfect consciousness There were associations connected with my last vigil there to make my situation very nervous and disagreeable Had I not had so much to occupy my mind of a distinctly practical kind Dudley s audacious suit my uncle s questionable toleration of it and my own conduct throughout that most disagreeable period of my existence I should have felt my present situation a great deal more As it was I thought of my real troubles and something of Cousin Knollys and I confess a good deal of Lord Ilbury When looking towards the door I thought I saw a human face about the most terrible my fancy could have called up looking fixedly into the room It was only a three quarter and not the whole figure the door hid that in a great measure and I fancied I saw too a portion of the fingers The face gazed toward the bed and in the imperfect light looked like a livid mask with chalky eyes I had so often been startled by similar apparitions formed by accidental lights and shadows disguising homely objects that I stooped forward expecting though tremulously to see this tremendous one in like manner dissolve itself into its harmless elements and now to my unspeakable terror I became perfectly certain that I saw the countenance of Madame de la Rougierre With a cry I started back and shook Milly furiously from her trance Look look I cried But the apparition or illusion was gone I clung so fast to Milly s arm cowering behind her that she could not rise Milly Milly Milly Milly I went on crying like one struck with idiotcy and unable to say anything else In a panic Milly who had seen nothing and could conjecture nothing of the cause of my terror jumped up and clinging to one another we huddled together into the corner of the room I still crying wildly Milly Milly Milly and nothing else What is it where is it what do you see cried Milly clinging to me as I did to her It will come again it will come oh heaven What what is it Maud The face the face I cried Oh Milly Milly Milly We heard a step softly approaching the open door and in a horrible sauve qui peut we rushed and stumbled together toward the light by Uncle Silas s bed But old Wyat s voice and figure reassured us Milly I said so soon as pale and very faint I reached my apartment no power on earth shall ever tempt me to enter that room again after dark Why Maud dear what in Heaven s name did you see said Milly scarcely less terrified Oh I can t I can t I can t Milly Never ask me It is haunted The room is haunted horribly Was it Charke whispered Milly looking over her shoulder all aghast No no don t ask me a fiend in a worse shape I was relieved at last by a long fit of weeping and all night good Mary Quince sat by me and Milly slept by my side Starting and screaming and drugged with sal volatile I got through that night of supernatural terror and saw the blessed light of heaven again Doctor Jolks when he came to see my uncle in the morning visited me also He pronounced me very hysterical made minute enquiries respecting my hours and diet asked what I had had for dinner yesterday There was something a little comforting in his cool and confident pooh poohing of the ghost theory The result was a regimen which excluded tea and imposed chocolate and porter earlier hours and I forget all beside and he undertook to promise that if I would but observe his directions I should never see a ghost again CHAPTER L MILLY S FAREWELL A few days time saw me much better Doctor Jolks was so contemptuously sturdy and positive on the point that I began to have comfortable doubts about the reality of my ghost and having still a horror indescribable of the illusion if such it were the room in which it appeared and everything concerning it I would neither speak nor so far as I could think of it So though Bartram Haugh was gloomy as well as beautiful and some of its associations awful and the solitude that reigned there sometimes almost terrible yet early hours bracing exercise and the fine air that predominates that region soon restored my nerves to a healthier tone But it seemed to me that Bartram Haugh was to be to me a vale of tears or rather in my sad pilgrimage that valley of the shadow of death through which poor Christian fared alone and in the dark One day Milly ran into the parlour pale with wet cheeks and without saying a word threw her arms about my neck and burst into a paroxysm of weeping What is it Milly what s the matter dear what is it I cried aghast but returning her close embrace heartily Oh Maud Maud darling he s going to send me away Away dear where away And leave me alone in this dreadful solitude where he knows I shall die of fear and grief without you Oh no no it must be a mistake I m going to France Maud I m going away missus Jolks is going to London day ar ter to morrow and I m to go wi her and an old French lady he says from the school will meet me there and bring me the rest o the way Oh ho ho ho ho o o o cried poor Milly hugging me closer still with her head buried in my shoulder and swaying me about like a wrestler in her agony I never wor away from home afore except that little bit wi you over there at Elverston and you wor wi me then Maud an I love ye better than Bartram better than a an I think I ll die Maud if they take me away I was just as wild in my woe as poor Milly and it was not until we had wept together for a full hour sometimes standing sometimes walking up and down the room sometimes sitting and getting up in turns to fall on one another s necks that Milly plucking her handkerchief from her pocket drew a note from it at the same time which as it fell upon the floor she at once recollected to be one from Uncle Silas to me It was to this effect I wish to apprise my dear niece and ward of my plans Milly proceeds to an admirable French school as a pensionnaire and leaves this on Thursday next If after three months trial she finds it in any way objectionable she returns to us If on the contrary she finds it in all respects the charming residence it has been presented to me you on the expiration of that period join her there until the temporary complication of my affairs shall have been so far adjusted as to enable me to receive you once more at Bartram Hoping for happier days and wishing to assure you that three months is the extreme limit of your separation from my poor Milly I have written this feeling alas unequal to seeing you at present Bartram Tuesday P S I can have no objection to your apprising Monica Knollys of these arrangements You will understand of course not a copy of this letter but its substance Over this document scanning it as lawyers do a new Act of Parliament we took comfort After all it was limited a separation not to exceed three months possibly much shorter On the whole too I pleased myself with thinking Uncle Silas s note though peremptory was kind Our paroxysms subsided into sadness a close correspondence was arranged Something of the bustle and excitement of change supervened If it turned out to be in truth a charming residence how very delightful our meeting in France with the interest of foreign scenery ways and faces would be So Thursday arrived a new gush of sorrow a new brightening up and amid regrets and anticipations we parted at the gate at the farther end of the Windmill Wood Then of course were more good byes more embraces and tearful smiles Good missus Jolks who met us there was in a huge fuss I believe it was her first visit to the metropolis and she was in proportion heated and important and terrified about the train so we had not many last words I watched poor Milly whose head was stretched from the window her hand waving many adieux until the curve of the road and the clump of old ash trees thick with ivy hid Milly carriage and all from view My eyes filled again with tears I turned towards Bartram At my side stood honest Mary Quince Don t take on so Miss twon t be no time passing three months is nothing at all she said smiling kindly I smiled through my tears and kissed the good creature and so side by side we re entered the gate The lithe young man in fustian whom I had seen talking with Beauty on the morning of our first encounter with that youthful Amazon was awaiting our re entrance with the key in his hand He stood half behind the open wicket One lean brown cheek one shy eye and his sharp up turned nose I saw as we passed He was treating me to a stealthy scrutiny and seemed to shun my glance for he shut the door quickly and busied himself locking it and then began stubbing up some thistles which grew close by with the toe of his thick shoe his back to us all the time It struck me that I recognised his features and I asked Mary Quince Have you seen that young man before Quince He brings up game for your uncle sometimes Miss and lends a hand in the garden I believe Do you know his name Mary They call him Tom I don t know what more Miss Tom I called please Tom come here for a moment Tom turned about and approached slowly He was more civil than the Bartram people usually were for he plucked off his shapeless cap of rabbit skin with a clownish respect Tom what is your other name Tom what my good man I asked Tom Brice ma am Haven t I seen you before Tom Brice I pursued for my curiosity was excited and with it much graver feelings for there certainly was a resemblance in Tom s features to those of the postilion who had looked so hard at me as I passed the carriage in the warren at Knowl on the evening of the outrage which had scared that quiet place Appen you may have ma am he answered quite coolly looking down the buttons of his gaiters Are you a good whip do you drive well I ll drive a plough wi most lads hereabout answered Tom Have you ever been to Knowl Tom Tom gaped very innocently Anan he said Here Tom is half a crown He took it readily enough That be very good said Tom with a nod having glanced sharply at the coin I can t say whether he applied that term to the coin or to his luck or to my generous self Now Tom you ll tell me have you ever been to Knowl Maught a bin ma am but I don t mind no sich place no As Tom spoke this with great deliberation like a man who loves truth putting a strain upon his memory for its sake he spun the silver coin two or three times into the air and caught it staring at it the while with all his might Now Tom recollect yourself and tell me the truth and I ll be a friend to you Did you ride postilion to a carriage having a lady in it and I think several gentlemen which came to the grounds of Knowl when the party had their luncheon on the grass and there was a a quarrel with the gamekeepers Try Tom to recollect you shall upon my honour have no trouble about it and I ll try to serve you Tom was silent while with a vacant gape he watched the spin of his half crown twice and then catching it with a smack in his hand which he thrust into his pocket he said still looking in the same direction I never rid postilion in my days ma am I know nout o sich a place though appen I maught a bin there Knowl ye ca t I was ne er out o Derbyshire but thrice to Warwick fair wi horses be rail an twice to York You re certain Tom Sartin sure ma am And Tom made another loutish salute and cut the conference short by turning off the path and beginning to hollo after some trespassing cattle I had not felt anything like so nearly sure in this essay at identification as I had in that of Dudley Even of Dudley s identity with the Church Scarsdale man I had daily grown less confident and indeed had it been proposed to bring it to the test of a wager I do not think I should in the language of sporting gentlemen have cared to back my original opinion There was however a sufficient uncertainty to make me uncomfortable and there was another uncertainty to enhance the unpleasant sense of ambiguity On our way back we passed the bleaching trunks and limbs of several ranks of barkless oaks lying side by side some squared by the hatchet perhaps sold for there were large letters and Roman numerals traced upon them in red chalk I sighed as I passed them by not because it was wrongfully done for I really rather leaned to the belief that Uncle Silas was well advised in point of law But alas here lay low the grand old family decorations of Bartram Haugh not to be replaced for centuries to come under whose spreading boughs the Ruthyns of three hundred years ago had hawked and hunted On the trunk of one of these I sat down to rest Mary Quince meanwhile pattering about in unmeaning explorations While thus listlessly seated the girl Meg Hawkes walked by carrying a basket Hish she said quickly as she passed without altering a pace or raising her eyes don t ye speak nor look fayther spies us I ll tell ye next turn Next turn when was that Well she might be returning and as she could not then say more than she had said in merely passing without a pause I concluded to wait for a short time and see what would come of it After a short time I looked about me a little and I saw Dickon Hawkes Pegtop as poor Milly used to call him with an axe in his hand prowling luridly among the timber Observing that I saw him he touched his hat sulkily and by and by passed me muttering to himself He plainly could not understand what business I could have in that particular part of the Windmill Wood and let me see it in his countenance His daughter did pass me again but this time he was near and she was silent Her next transit occurred as he was questioning Mary Quince at some little distance and as she passed precisely in the same way she said Don t you be alone wi Master Dudley nowhere for the world s worth The injunction was so startling that I was on the point of questioning the girl But I recollected myself and waited in the hope that in her future transits she might be more explicit But one word more she did not utter and the jealous eye of old Pegtop was so constantly upon us that I refrained There was vagueness and suggestion enough in the oracle to supply work for many an hour of anxious conjecture and many a horrible vigil by night Was I never to know peace at Bartram Haugh Ten days of poor Milly s absence and of my solitude had already passed when my uncle sent for me to his room When old Wyat stood at the door mumbling and snarling her message my heart died within me It was late just that hour when dejected people feel their anxieties most when the cold grey of twilight has deepened to its darkest shade and before the cheerful candles are lighted and the safe quiet of the night sets in When I entered my uncle s sitting room though his window shutters were open and the wan streaks of sunset visible through them like narrow lakes in the chasms of the dark western clouds a pair of candles were burning one stood upon the table by his desk the other on the chimneypiece before which his tall thin figure stooped His hand leaned on the mantelpiece and the light from the candle just above his bowed head touched his silvery hair He was looking as it seemed into the subsiding embers of the fire and was a very statue of forsaken dejection and decay Uncle I ventured to say having stood for some time unperceived near his table Ah yes Maud my dear child my dear child He turned and with the candle in his hand smiling his silvery smile of suffering on me He walked more feebly and stiffly I thought than I had ever seen him move before Sit down Maud pray sit there I took the chair he indicated In my misery and my solitude Maud I have invoked you like a spirit and you appear With his two hands leaning on the table he looked across at me in a stooping attitude he had not seated himself I continued silent until it should be his pleasure to question or address me At last he said raising himself and looking upward with a wild adoration his finger tips elevated and glimmering in the faint mixed light No I thank my Creator I am not quite forsaken Another silence during which he looked steadfastly at me and muttered as if thinking aloud My guardian angel my guardian angel Maud you have a heart He addressed me suddenly Listen for a few moments to the appeal of an old and broken hearted man your guardian your uncle your suppliant I had resolved never to speak to you more on this subject But I was wrong It was pride that inspired me mere pride I felt myself growing pale and flushed by turns during the pause that followed I m very miserable very nearly desperate What remains for me what remains Fortune has done her worst thrown in the dust her wheels rolled over me and the servile world who follow her chariot like a mob stamp upon the mangled wretch All this had passed over me and left me scarred and bloodless in this solitude It was not my fault Maud I say it was no fault of mine I have no remorse though more regrets than I can count and all scored with fire As people passed by Bartram and looked upon its neglected grounds and smokeless chimneys they thought my plight I dare say about the worst a proud man could be reduced to They could not imagine one half its misery But this old hectic this old epileptic this old spectre of wrongs calamities and follies had still one hope my manly though untutored son the last male scion of the Ruthyns Maud have I lost him His fate my fate I may say Milly s fate we all await your sentence He loves you as none but the very young can love and that once only in a life He loves you desperately a most affectionate nature a Ruthyn the best blood in England the last man of the race and I if I lose him I lose all and you will see me in my coffin Maud before many months I stand before you in the attitude of a suppliant shall I kneel His eyes were fixed on me with the light of despair his knotted hands clasped his whole figure bowed toward me I was inexpressibly shocked and pained Oh uncle uncle I cried and from very excitement I burst into tears I saw that his eyes were fixed on me with a dismal scrutiny I think he divined the nature of my agitation but he determined notwithstanding to press me while my helpless agitation continued You see my suspense you see my miserable and frightful suspense You are kind Maud you love your father s memory your pity your father s brother you would not say no and place a pistol at his head Oh I must I must I must say no Oh spare me uncle for Heaven s sake Don t question me don t press me I could not I could not do what you ask I yield Maud I yield my dear I will not press you you shall have time your own time to think I will accept no answer now no none Maud He said this raising his thin hand to silence me There Maud enough I have spoken as I always do to you frankly perhaps too frankly but agony and despair will speak out and plead even with the most obdurate and cruel With these words Uncle Silas entered his bed chamber and shut the door not violently but with a resolute hand and I thought I heard a cry I hastened to my own room I threw myself on my knees and thanked Heaven for the firmness vouchsafed me I could not believe it to have been my own I was more miserable in consequence of this renewed suit on behalf of my odious cousin than I can describe My uncle had taken such a line of importunity that it became a sort of agony to resist I thought of the possibility of my hearing of his having made away with himself and was every morning relieved when I heard that he was still as usual I have often wondered since at my own firmness In that dreadful interview with my uncle I had felt in the whirl and horror of my mind on the very point of submitting just as nervous people are said to throw themselves over precipices through sheer dread of falling CHAPTER LI SARAH MATILDA COMES TO LIGHT Some time after this interview one day as I sat sad enough in my room looking listlessly from the window with good Mary Quince whom whether in the house or in my melancholy rambles I always had by my side I was startled by the sound of a loud and shrill female voice in violent hysterical action gabbling with great rapidity sobbing and very nearly screaming in a sort of fury I started up staring at the door Lord bless us cried honest Mary Quince with round eyes and mouth agape staring in the same direction Mary Mary what can it be Are they beating some one down yonder I don t know where it comes from gasped Quince I will I will I ll see her It s her I want Oo hoo hoo hoo oo o Miss Maud Ruthyn of Knowl Miss Ruthyn of Knowl Hoo hoo hoo hoo oo What on earth can it be I exclaimed in great bewilderment and terror It was now plainly very near indeed and I heard the voice of our mild and shaky butler evidently remonstrating with the distressed damsel I ll see her she continued pouring a torrent of vile abuse upon me which stung me with a sudden sense of anger What had I done to be afraid of anyone How dared anyone in my uncle s house in my house mix my name up with her detestable scurrilities For Heaven s sake Miss don t ye go out cried poor Quince it s some drunken creature But I was very angry and like a fool as I was I threw open the door exclaiming in a loud and haughty key Here is Miss Ruthyn of Knowl Who wants to see her A pink and white young lady with black tresses violent weeping shrill voluble was flouncing up the last stair and shook her dress out on the lobby and poor old Giblets as Milly used to call him was following in her wake with many small remonstrances and entreaties perfectly unheeded The moment I looked at this person it struck me that she was the identical lady whom I had seen in the carriage at Knowl Warren The next moment I was in doubt the next still more so She was decidedly thinner and dressed by no means in such lady like taste Perhaps she was hardly like her at all I began to distrust all these resemblances and to fancy with a shudder that they originated perhaps only in my own sick brain On seeing me this young lady as it seemed to me a good deal of the barmaid or lady s maid species dried her eyes fiercely and with a flaming countenance called upon me peremptorily to produce her lawful husband Her loud insolent outrageous attack had the effect of enhancing my indignation and I quite forget what I said to her but I well remember that her manner became a good deal more decent She was plainly under the impression that I wanted to appropriate her husband or at least that he wanted to marry me and she ran on at such a pace and her harangue was so passionate incoherent and unintelligible that I thought her out of her mind she was far from it however I think if she had allowed me even a second for reflection I should have hit upon her meaning As it was nothing could exceed my perplexity until plucking a soiled newspaper from her pocket she indicated a particular paragraph already sufficiently emphasised by double lines of red ink at its sides It was a Lancashire paper of about six weeks since and very much worn and soiled for its age I remember in particular a circular stain from the bottom of a vessel either of coffee or brown stout The paragraph was as follows recording an event a year or more anterior to the date of the paper MARRIAGE On Tuesday August seven eighteen at Leatherwig Church by the reverend Arthur Hughes Dudley R Ruthyn esquire only son and heir of Silas Ruthyn esquire of Bartram Haugh Derbyshire to Sarah Matilda second daughter of John Mangles esquire of Wiggan in this county At first I read nothing but amazement in this announcement but in another moment I felt how completely I was relieved and showing I believe my intense satisfaction in my countenance for the young lady eyed me with considerable surprise and curiosity I said This is extremely important You must see mister Silas Ruthyn this moment I am certain he knows nothing of it I will conduct you to him No more he does I know that myself she replied following me with a self asserting swagger and a great rustling of cheap silk As we entered Uncle Silas looked up from his sofa and closed his Revue des Deux Mondes What is all this he enquired drily This lady has brought with her a newspaper containing an extraordinary statement which affects our family I answered Uncle Silas raised himself and looked with a hard narrow scrutiny at the unknown young lady A libel I suppose in the paper he said extending his hand for it No uncle no only a marriage I answered Not Monica he said as he took it Pah it smells all over of tobacco and beer he added throwing a little eau de Cologne over it He raised it with a mixture of curiosity and disgust saying again pah as he did so He read the paragraph and as he did his face changed from white all over to lead colour He raised his eyes and looked steadily for some seconds at the young lady who seemed a little awed by his strange presence And you are I suppose the young lady Sarah Matilda nee Mangles mentioned in this little paragraph he said in a tone you would have called a sneer were it not that it trembled Sarah Matilda assented My son is I dare say within reach It so happens that I wrote to arrest his journey and summon him here some days since some days since some days since he repeated slowly like a person whose mind has wandered far away from the theme on which he is speaking He had rung his bell and old Wyat always hovering about his rooms entered I want my son immediately If not in the house send Harry to the stables if not there let him be followed instantly Brice is an active fellow and will know where to find him If he is in Feltram or at a distance let Brice take a horse and Master Dudley can ride it back He must be here without the loss of one moment There intervened nearly a quarter of an hour during which whenever he recollected her Uncle Silas treated the young lady with a hyper refined and ceremonious politeness which appeared to make her uneasy and even a little shy and certainly prevented a renewal of those lamentations and invectives which he had heard faintly from the stair head But for the most part Uncle Silas seemed to forget us and his book and all that surrounded him lying back in the corner of his sofa his chin upon his breast and such a fearful shade and carving on his features as made me prefer looking in any direction but his At length we heard the tread of Dudley s thick boots on the oak boards and faint and muffled the sound of his voice as he cross examined old Wyat before entering the chamber of audience I think he suspected quite another visitor and had no expectation of seeing the particular young lady who rose from her chair as he entered in an opportune flood of tears crying Oh Dudley Dudley oh Dudley could you Oh Dudley your own poor Sal You could not you would not your lawful wife This and a good deal more with cheeks that streamed like a window pane in a thunder shower spoke Sarah Matilda with all her oratory working his arm which she clung to up and down all the time like the handle of a pump But Dudley was manifestly confounded and dumbfoundered He stood for a long time gaping at his father and stole just one sheepish glance at me and with red face and forehead looked down at his boots and then again at his father who remained just in the attitude I have described and with the same forbidding and dreary intensity in his strange face Like a quarrelsome man worried in his sleep by a noise Dudley suddenly woke up as it were with a start in a half suppressed exasperation and shook her off with a jerk and a muttered curse as she whisked involuntarily into a chair with more violence than could have been pleasant Judging by your looks and demeanour sir I can almost anticipate your answers said my uncle addressing him suddenly Will you be good enough pray madame parenthetically to our visitor command yourself for a few moments Is this young person the daughter of a mister Mangles and is her name Sarah Matilda I dessay answered Dudley hurriedly Is she your wife Is she my wife repeated Dudley ill at ease Yes sir it is a plain question All this time Sarah Matilda was perpetually breaking into talk and with difficulty silenced by my uncle Well appen she says I am does she replied Dudley Is she your wife sir Mayhap she so considers it after a fashion he replied with an impudent swagger seating himself as he did so What do you think sir persisted Uncle Silas I don t think nout about it replied Dudley surlily Is that account true said my uncle handing him the paper They wishes us to believe so at any rate Answer directly sir We have our thoughts upon it If it be true it is capable of every proof For expedition s sake I ask you There is no use in prevaricating Who wants to deny it It is true there There I knew he would screamed the young woman hysterically with a laugh of strange joy Shut up will ye growled Dudley savagely Oh Dudley Dudley darling what have I done Bin and ruined me jest that s all Oh no no no Dudley Ye know I wouldn t I could not could not hurt ye Dudley No no no He grinned at her and with a sharp side nod said Wait a bit Oh Dudley don t be vexed dear I did not mean it I would not hurt ye for all the world Never Well never mind You and yours tricked me finely and now you ve got me that s all My uncle laughed a very odd laugh I knew it of course and upon my word madame you and he make a very pretty couple sneered Uncle Silas Dudley made no answer looking however very savage And with this poor young wife so recently wedded the low villain had actually solicited me to marry him I am quite certain that my uncle was as entirely ignorant as I of Dudley s connection and had therefore no participation in this appalling wickedness And I have to congratulate you my good fellow on having secured the affections of a very suitable and vulgar young woman I baint the first o the family as a done the same retorted Dudley At this taunt the old man s fury for a moment overpowered him In an instant he was on his feet quivering from head to foot I never saw such a countenance like one of those demon grotesques we see in the Gothic side aisles and groinings a dreadful grimace monkey like and insane and his thin hand caught up his ebony stick and shook it paralytically in the air If ye touch me wi that I ll smash ye by shouted Dudley furious raising his hands and hitching his shoulder just as I had seen him when he fought Captain Oakley For a moment this picture was suspended before me and I screamed I know not what in my terror But the old man the veteran of many a scene of excitement where men disguise their ferocity in calm tones and varnish their fury with smiles had not quite lost his self command He turned toward me and said Does he know what he s saying And with an icy laugh of contempt his high thin forehead still flushed he sat down trembling If you want to say aught I ll hear ye Ye may jaw me all ye like and I ll stan it Oh I may speak Thank you sneered Uncle Silas glancing slowly round at me and breaking into a cold laugh Ay I don t mind cheek not I but you must not go for to do that ye know Gammon I won t stand a blow I won t fro no one Well sir availing myself of your permission to speak I may remark without offence to the young lady that I don t happen to recollect the name Mangles among the old families of England I presume you have chosen her chiefly for her virtues and her graces missus Sarah Matilda not apprehending this compliment quite as Uncle Silas meant it dropped a courtesy notwithstanding her agitation and wiping her eyes said with a blubbered smile You re very kind sure I hope for both your sakes she has got a little money I don t see how you are to live else You re too lazy for a game keeper and I don t think you could keep a pot house you are so addicted to drinking and quarrelling The only thing I am quite clear upon is that you and your wife must find some other abode than this You shall depart this evening and now mister and missus Dudley Ruthyn you may quit this room if you please Uncle Silas had risen and made them one of his old courtly bows smiling a death like sneer and pointing to the door with his trembling fingers Come will ye said Dudley grinding his teeth You re pretty well done here Not half understanding the situation but looking woefully bewildered she dropped a farewell courtesy at the door Will ye cut barked Dudley in a tone that made her jump and suddenly without looking about he strode after her from the room Maud how shall I recover this The vulgar villain the fool What an abyss were we approaching and for me the last hope gone and for me utter utter irretrievable ruin He was passing his fingers tremulously back and forward along the top of the mantelpiece like a man in search of something and continued so looking along it feebly and vacantly although there was nothing there I wish uncle you do not know how much I wish I could be of any use to you Maybe I can He turned and looked at me sharply Maybe you can he echoed slowly Yes maybe you can he repeated more briskly Let us let us see let us think that d fellow my head You re not well uncle Oh yes very well We ll talk in the evening I ll send for you I found Wyat in the next room and told her to hasten as I thought he was ill I hope it was not very selfish but such had grown to be my horror of seeing him in one of his strange seizures that I hastened from the room precipitately partly to escape the risk of being asked to remain The walls of Bartram House are thick and the recess at the doorway deep As I closed my uncle s door I heard Dudley s voice on the stairs I did not wish to be seen by him or by his lady as his poor wife called herself who was engaged in vehement dialogue with him as I emerged and not caring either to re enter my uncle s room I remained quietly ensconced within the heavy door case in which position I overheard Dudley say with a savage snarl You ll jest go back the way ye came I m not goin wi ye if that s what ye be drivin at dang your impitins Oh Dudley dear what have I done what have I done ye hate me so What a ye done Ye vicious little beast ye You ve got us turned out an disinherited wi yer d d bosh that s all don t ye think it s enough I could only hear her sobs and shrill tones in reply for they were descending the stairs and Mary Quince reported to me in a horrified sort of way that she saw him bundle her into the fly at the door like a truss of hay into a hay loft And he stood with his head in at the window scolding her till it drove away I knew he wor jawing her poor thing By the way he kep waggin his head an he had his fist inside a shakin in her face I m sure he looked wicked enough for anything an she a crying like a babby an lookin back an wavin her wet hankicher to him poor thing and she so young Tis a pity Dear me I often think Miss tis well for me I never was married And see how we all would like to get husbands for all that though so few is happy together Tis a queer world and them that s single is maybe the best off after all CHAPTER LII THE PICTURE OF A WOLF I went down that evening to the sitting room which had been assigned to Milly and me in search of a book my good Mary Quince always attending me The door was a little open and I was startled by the light of a candle proceeding from the fireside together with a considerable aroma of tobacco and brandy On my little work table which he had drawn beside the hearth lay Dudley s pipe his brandy flask and an empty tumbler and he was sitting with one foot on the fender his elbow on his knee and his head resting in his hand weeping His back being a little toward the door he did not perceive us and we saw him rub his knuckles in his eyes and heard the sounds of his selfish lamentation Mary and I stole away quietly leaving him in possession wondering when he was to leave the house according to the sentence which I had heard pronounced upon him I was delighted to see old Giblets quietly strapping his luggage in the hall and heard from him in a whisper that he was to leave that evening by rail he did not know whither About half an hour afterwards Mary Quince going out to reconnoitre heard from old Wyat in the lobby that he had just started to meet the train Blessed be heaven for that deliverance An evil spirit had been cast out and the house looked lighter and happier It was not until I sat down in the quiet of my room that the scenes and images of that agitating day began to move before my memory in orderly procession and for the first time I appreciated with a stunning sense of horror and a perfect rapture of thanksgiving the value of my escape and the immensity of the danger which had threatened me It may have been miserable weakness I think it was But I was young nervous and afflicted with a troublesome sort of conscience which occasionally went mad and insisted in small things as well as great upon sacrifices which my reason now assures me were absurd Of Dudley I had a perfect horror and yet had that system of solicitation that dreadful and direct appeal to my compassion that placing of my feeble girlhood in the seat of the arbiter of my aged uncle s hope or despair been long persisted in my resistance might have been worn out who can tell and I self sacrificed Just as criminals in Germany are teased and watched and cross examined year after year incessantly into a sort of madness and worn out with the suspense the iteration the self restraint and insupportable fatigue they at last cut all short accuse themselves and go infinitely relieved to the scaffold you may guess then for me nervous self diffident and alone how intense was the comfort of knowing that Dudley was actually married and the harrowing importunity which had just commenced for ever silenced That night I saw my uncle I pitied him though I feared him I was longing to tell him how anxious I was to help him if only he could point out the way It was in substance what I had already said but now strongly urged He brightened he sat up perpendicularly in his chair with a countenance not weak or fatuous now but resolute and searching and which contracted into dark thought or calculation as I talked I dare say I spoke confusedly enough I was always nervous in his presence there was I fancy something mesmeric in the odd sort of influence which without effort he exercised over my imagination Sometimes this grew into a dismal panic and Uncle Silas polished mild seemed unaccountably horrible to me Then it was no longer an accidental fascination of electro biology It was something more His nature was incomprehensible by me He was without the nobleness without the freshness without the softness without the frivolities of such human nature as I had experienced either within myself or in other persons I instinctively felt that appeals to sympathies or feelings could no more affect him than a marble monument He seemed to accommodate his conversation to the moral structure of others just as spirits are said to assume the shape of mortals There were the sensualities of the gourmet for his body and there ended his human nature as it seemed to me Through that semi transparent structure I thought I could now and then discern the light or the glare of his inner life But I understood it not He never scoffed at what was good or noble his hardest critic could not nail him to one such sentence and yet it seemed somehow to me that his unknown nature was a systematic blasphemy against it all If fiend he was he was yet something higher than the garrulous and withal feeble demon of Goethe He assumed the limbs and features of our mortal nature He shrouded his own and was a profoundly reticent Mephistopheles Gentle he had been to me kindly he had nearly always spoken but it seemed like the mild talk of one of those goblins of the desert whom Asiatic superstition tells of who appear in friendly shapes to stragglers from the caravan beckon to them from afar call them by their names and lead them where they are found no more Was then all his kindness but a phosphoric radiance covering something colder and more awful than the grave It is very noble of you Maud it is angelic your sympathy with a ruined and despairing old man But I fear you will recoil I tell you frankly that less than twenty thousand pounds will not extricate me from the quag of ruin in which I am entangled lost Recoil Far from it I ll do it There must be some way Enough my fair young protectress celestial enthusiast enough Though you do not yet I recoil I could not bring myself to accept this sacrifice What signifies even to me my extrication I lie a mangled wretch with fifty mortal wounds on my crown what avails the healing of one wound when there are so many beyond all cure Better to let me perish where I fall and reserve your money for the worthier objects whom perhaps hereafter may avail to save But I will do this I must I cannot see you suffer with the power in my hands unemployed to help you I exclaimed Enough dear Maud the will is here enough there is balm in your compassion and good will Leave me ministering angel for the present I cannot If you will we can talk of it again Good night And so we parted The attorney from Feltram I afterwards heard was with him nearly all that night trying in vain to devise by their joint ingenuity any means by which I might tie myself up But there were none I could not bind myself I was myself full of the hope of helping him What was this sum to me great as it seemed Truly nothing I could have spared it and never felt the loss I took up a large quarto with coloured prints one of the few books I had brought with me from dear old Knowl Too much excited to hope for sleep in bed I opened it and turned over the leaves my mind still full of Uncle Silas and the sum I hoped to help him with Unaccountably one of those coloured engravings arrested my attention It represented the solemn solitude of a lofty forest a girl in Swiss costume was flying in terror and as she fled flinging a piece of meat behind her which she had taken from a little market basket hanging upon her arm Through the glade a pack of wolves were pursuing her The narrative told that on her return homeward with her marketing she had been chased by wolves and barely escaped by flying at her utmost speed from time to time retarding as she did so the pursuit by throwing piece by piece the contents of her basket in her wake to be devoured and fought for by the famished beasts of prey This print had seized my imagination I looked with a curious interest on the print something in the disposition of the trees their great height and rude boughs interlacing and the awful shadow beneath reminded me of a portion of the Windmill Wood where Milly and I had often rambled Then I looked at the figure of the poor girl flying for her life and glancing terrified over her shoulder Then I gazed on the gaping murderous pack and the hoary brute that led the van and then I leaned back in my chair and I thought perhaps some latent association suggested what seemed a thing so unlikely of a fine print in my portfolio from Vandyke s noble picture of Belisarius Idly I traced with my pencil as I leaned back on an envelope that lay upon the table this little inscription It was mere fiddling and absurd as it looked there was nothing but an honest meaning in it twenty thousand l Date Obolum Belisario My dear father had translated the little Latin inscription for me and I had written it down as a sort of exercise of memory and also perhaps as expressive of that sort of compassion which my uncle s fall and miserable fate excited invariably in me So I threw this queer little memorandum upon the open leaf of the book and again the flight the pursuit and the bait to stay it engaged my eye And I heard a voice near the hearthstone as I thought say in a stern whisper Fly the fangs of Belisarius What s that said I turning sharply to Mary Quince Mary rose from her work at the fireside staring at me with that odd sort of frown that accompanies fear and curiosity You spoke Did you speak I said catching her by the arm very much frightened myself No Miss no dear answered she plainly thinking that I was a little wrong in my head There could be no doubt it was a trick of the imagination and yet to this hour I could recognise that clear stern voice among a thousand were it to speak again Jaded after a night of broken sleep and much agitation I was summoned next morning to my uncle s room He received me oddly I thought His manner had changed and made an uncomfortable impression upon me He was gentle kind smiling submissive as usual but it seemed to me that he experienced henceforth toward me the same half superstitous repulsion which I had always felt from him Dream or voice or vision which had done it There seemed to be an unconscious antipathy and fear When he thought I was not looking his eyes were sometimes grimly fixed for a moment upon me When I looked at him his eyes were upon the book before him and when he spoke a person not heeding what he uttered would have fancied that he was reading aloud from it There was nothing tangible but this shrinking from the encounter of our eyes I said he was kind as usual He was even more so But there was this new sign of our silently repellant natures Dislike it could not be He knew I longed to serve him Was it shame Was there not a shade of horror in it I have not slept said he For me the night has passed in thought and the fruit of it is this I cannot Maud accept your noble offer I am very sorry exclaimed I in all honesty I know it my dear niece and appreciate your goodness but there are many reasons none of them I trust ignoble and which together render it impossible No It would be misunderstood my honour shall not be impugned But sir that could not be you have never proposed it It would be all from first to last my doing True dear Maud but I know alas more of this evil and slanderous world than your happy inexperience can do Who will receive our testimony None no not one The difficulty the insuperable moral difficulty is this that I should expose myself to the plausible imputation of having worked upon you unduly for this end and more that I could not hold myself quite free from blame It is your voluntary goodness Maud But you are young inexperienced and it is I hold it my duty to stand between you and any dealing with your property at so unripe an age Some people may call this Quixotic In my mind it is an imperious mandate of conscience and I peremptorily refuse to disobey it although within three weeks an execution will be in this house I did not quite know what an execution meant but from two harrowing novels with whose distresses I was familiar I knew that it indicated some direful process of legal torture and spoliation Oh uncle I oh sir you cannot allow this to happen What will people say of me And and there is poor Milly and everything Think what it will be It cannot be helped you cannot help it Maud Listen to me There will be an execution here I cannot say exactly how soon but I think in a little more than a fortnight I must provide for your comfort You must leave I have arranged that you shall join Milly for the present in France till I have time to look about me You had better I think write to your cousin Lady Knollys She with all her oddities has a heart Can you say Maud that I have been kind You have never been anything but kind I exclaimed That I ve been self denying when you made me a generous offer he continued That I now act to spare you pain You may tell her not as a message from me but as a fact that I am seriously thinking of vacating my guardianship that I feel I have done her an injustice and that so soon as my mind is a little less tortured I shall endeavour to effect a reconciliation with her and would wish ultimately to transfer the care of your person and education to her You may say I have no longer an interest even in vindicating my name My son has wrecked himself by a marriage I forgot to tell you he stopped at Feltram and this morning wrote to pray a parting interview If I grant it it shall be the last I shall never see him or correspond with him more The old man seemed much overcome and held his hankerchief to his eyes He and his wife are I understand about to emigrate the sooner the better he resumed bitterly Deeply Maud I regret having tolerated his suit to you even for a moment Had I thought it over as I did the whole case last night nothing could have induced me to permit it But I have lived for so long like a monk in his cell my wants and observation limited to the narrow compass of this chamber that my knowledge of the world has died out with my youth and my hopes and I did not as I ought to have done consider many objections Therefore dear Maud on this one subject I entreat be silent its discussion can effect nothing now I was wrong and frankly ask you to forget my mistake I had been on the point of writing to Lady Knollys on this odious subject when happily it was set at rest by the disclosure of yesterday and being so I could have no difficulty in acceding to my uncle s request He was conceding so much that I could not withhold so trifling a concession in return I hope Monica will continue to be kind to poor Milly after I am gone Here there were a few seconds of meditation Maud you will not I think refuse to convey the substance of what I have just said in a letter to Lady Knollys and perhaps you would have no objection to let me see it when it is written It will prevent the possibility of its containing any misconception of what I have just spoken and Maud you won t forget to say whether I have been kind It would be a satisfaction to me to know that Monica was assured that I never either teased or bullied my young ward With these words he dismissed me and forthwith I completed such a letter as would quite embody what he had said and in my own glowing terms being in high good humour with Uncle Silas recorded my estimate of his gentleness and good nature and when I submitted it to him he expressed his admiration of what he was pleased to call my cleverness in so exactly conveying what he wished and his gratitude for the handsome terms in which I had spoken of my old guardian CHAPTER LIII AN ODD PROPOSAL As I and Mary Quince returned from our walk that day and had entered the hall I was surprised most disagreeably by Dudley s emerging from the vestibule at the foot of the great staircase He was I suppose in his travelling costume a rather soiled white surtout a great coloured muffler in folds about his throat his chimney pot on and his fur cap sticking out from his pocket He had just descended I suppose from my uncle s room On seeing me he stepped back and stood with his shoulders to the wall like a mummy in a museum I pretended to have a few words to say to Mary before leaving the hall in the hope that as he seemed to wish to escape me he would take the opportunity of getting quickly off the scene But he had changed his mind it would seem in the interval for when I glanced in that direction again he had moved toward us and stood in the hall with his hat in his hand I must do him the justice to say he looked horribly dismal sulky and frightened Ye ll gi e me a word Miss only a thing I ought to say for your good by mind it s for your good Miss Dudley stood a little way off viewing me with his hat in both hands and a glooming countenance I detested the idea of either hearing or speaking to him but I had no resolution to refuse and only saying I can t imagine what you can wish to speak to me about I approached him Wait there at the banister Quince There was a fragrance of alcohol about the flushed face and gaudy muffler of this odious cousin which heightened the effect of his horribly dismal features He was speaking besides a little thickly but his manner was dejected and he was treating me with an elaborate and discomfited respect which reassured me I m a bit up a tree Miss he said shuffling his feet on the oak floor I behaved a d fool but I baint one o they sort I m a fellah as ill fight his man an stan up to m fair don t ye see An baint one o they sort no dang it I baint Dudley delivered his puzzling harangue with a good deal of undertoned vehemence and was strangely agitated He too had got an unpleasant way of avoiding my eye and glancing along the floor from corner to corner as he spoke which gave him a very hang dog air He was twisting his fingers in his great sandy whisker and pulling it roughly enough to drag his cheek about by that savage purchase and with his other hand he was crushing and rubbing his hat against his knee The old boy above there be half crazed I think he don t mean half as he says thof not he But I m in a bad fix anyhow a regular sell it s been and I can t get a tizzy out of him So ye see I m up a tree Miss and he sich a one he ll make it a wuss mull if I let him He s as sharp wi me as one o them lawyer chaps dang em and he s a lot of I O s and rubbitch o mine and Bryerly writes to me he can t gi e me my legacy cause he s got a notice from Archer and Sleigh a warnin him not to gi e me as much as a bob for I signed it away to governor he says which I believe s a lie I may a signed some writing appen I did when I was a bit cut one night But that s no way to catch a gentleman and twon t stand There s justice to be had and twon t stand I say and I m not in is hands that way Thof I may be a bit up the spout too I don t deny only I baint agoin the whole hog all at once I m none o they sort He ll find I baint Here Mary Quince coughed demurely from the foot of the stair to remind me that the conversation was protracted I don t very well understand I said gravely and I am now going upstairs Don t jest a minute Miss it s only a word ye see We ll be goin t Australia Sary Mangles an me aboard the Seamew on the fifth I m for Liverpool to night and she ll meet me there an an please God Almighty ye ll never see me more an I d rather gi e ye a lift Maud before I go an I tell ye what if ye ll just gi e me your written promise ye ll gi e me that twenty thousand ye were offering to gi e the Governor I ll take ye cleverly out o Bartram and put ye wi your cousin Knollys or anywhere ye like best Take me from Bartram for twenty thousand pounds Take me away from my guardian You seem to forget sir my indignation rising as I spoke that I can visit my cousin Lady Knollys whenever I please Well that is as it may be he said with a sulky deliberation scraping about a little bit of paper that lay on the floor with the toe of his boot It is as it may be and that is as I say sir and considering how you have treated me your mean treacherous and infamous suit and your cruel treason to your poor wife I am amazed at your effrontery I turned to leave him being in truth in one of my passions Don t ye be a flying out he said peremptorily and catching me roughly by the wrist I baint a going to vex ye What a mouth you be as can t see your way Can t ye speak wi common sense like a woman dang it for once and not keep brawling like a brat can t ye see what I m saying I ll take ye out o all this and put ye wi your cousin or wheresoever you list if ye ll gi e me what I say He was for the first time looking me in the face but with contracted eyes and a countenance very much agitated Money said I with a prompt disdain Ay money twenty thousand pounds there On or off he replied with an unpleasant sort of effort You ask my promise for twenty thousand pounds and you shan t have it My cheeks were flaming and I stamped on the ground as I spoke If he had known how to appeal to my better feelings I am sure I should have done perhaps not quite that all at once at least but something handsome to assist him But this application was so shabby and insolent What could he take me for That I should suppose his placing me with Cousin Monica constituted her my guardian Why he must fancy me the merest baby There was a kind of stupid cunning in this that disgusted my good nature and outraged my self importance You won t gi e me that then he said looking down again with a frown and working his mouth and cheeks about as I could fancy a man rolling a piece of tobacco in his jaw Certainly not sir I replied Take it then he replied still looking down very black and discontented I joined Mary Quince extremely angry As I passed under the carved oak arch of the vestibule I saw his figure in the deepening twilight The picture remains in its murky halo fixed in memory Standing where he last spoke in the centre of the hall not looking after me but downward and as well as I could see with the countenance of a man who has lost a game and a ruinous wager too that is black and desperate I did not utter a syllable on the way up When I reached my room I began to reconsider the interview more at my leisure I was such were my ruminations to have agreed at once to his preposterous offer and to have been driven while he smirked and grimaced behind my back at his acquaintances through Feltram in his dog cart to Elverston and then to the just indignation of my uncle to have been delivered up to Lady Knolly s guardianship and to have handed my driver as I alighted the handsome fare of twenty point zero l It required the impudence of Tony Lumpkin without either his fun or his shrewdness to have conceived such a prodigious practical joke Maybe you d like a little tea Miss insinuated Mary Quince What impertinence I exclaimed with one of my angry stamps on the floor Not you dear old Quince I added No no tea just now And I resumed my ruminations which soon led me to this train of thought Stupid and insulting as Dudley s proposition was it yet involved a great treason against my uncle Should I be weak enough to be silent may he not wishing to forestall me misrepresent all that has passed so as to throw the blame altogether upon me This idea seized upon me with a force which I could not withstand and on the impulse of the moment I obtained admission to my uncle and related exactly what had passed When I had finished my narrative which he listened to without once raising his eyes my uncle cleared his throat once or twice as if to speak He was smiling I thought with an effort and with elevated brows When I concluded he hummed one of those sliding notes which a less refined man might have expressed by a whistle of surprise and contempt and again he essayed to speak but continued silent The fact is he seemed to me very much disconcerted He rose from his seat and shuffled about the room in his slippers I believe affecting only to be in search of something opening and shutting two or three drawers and turning over some books and papers and at length taking up some loose sheets of manuscript he appeared to have found what he was looking for and began to read them carelessly with his back towards me and with another effort to clear his voice he said at last And pray what could the fool mean by all that I think he must have taken me for an idiot sir I answered Not unlikely He has lived in a stable among horses and ostlers he has always seemed to me something like a centaur that is a centaur composed not of man and horse but of an ape and an ass And upon this jibe he laughed not coldly and sarcastically as was his wont but I thought flurriedly And continuing to look into his papers he said his back still toward me as he read And he did not favour you with an exposition of his meaning which except in so far as it estimated his deserts at the modest sum you have named appears to me too oracular to be interpreted without a kindred inspiration And again he laughed He was growing more like himself As to your visiting your cousin Lady Knollys the stupid rogue had only five minutes before heard me express my wish that you should do so before leaving this I am quite resolved you shall that is unless dear Maud you should yourself object but of course we must wait for an invitation which I conjecture will not be long in coming In fact your letter will naturally bring it about and I trust open the way to a permanent residence with her The more I think it over the more am I convinced dear niece that as things are likely to turn out my roof would be no desirable shelter for you and that under all circumstances hers would Such were my motives Maud in opening through your letter a door of reconciliation between us I felt that I ought to have kissed his hand that he had indicated precisely the future that I most desired and yet there was within me a vague feeling akin to suspicion akin to dismay which chilled and overcast my soul But Maud he said I am disquieted to think of that stupid jackanapes presuming to make you such an offer A creditable situation truly arriving in the dark at Elverston under the solitary escort of that wild young man with whom you would have fled from my guardianship and Maud I tremble as I ask myself the question would he have conducted you to Elverston at all When you have lived as long in the world as I you will appreciate its wickedness more justly Here there was a little pause I know my dear that were he convinced of his legal marriage with that young woman he resumed perceiving how startled I looked such an idea of course would not have entered his head but he does not believe any such thing Contrary to fact and logic he does honestly think that his hand is still at his disposal and I certainly do suspect that he would have employed that excursion in endeavouring to persuade you to think as he does Be that how it may however it is satisfactory to me to know that you shall never more be troubled by one word from that ill regulated young man I made him my adieux such as they were this evening and never more shall he enter the walls of Bartram Haugh while we two live Uncle Silas replaced the papers which had ostensibly interested him so much and returned There was a vein which was visible near the angle of his lofty temple and in moments of agitation stood out against the surrounding pallor in a knotted blue cord and as he came back smiling askance I saw this sign of inward tumult We can however afford to despise the follies and knaveries of the world Maud as long as we act as we have hitherto done with perfect confidence in each other Heaven bless you dear Maud Your report troubled me I believe more than it need troubled me a good deal but reflection assures me it is nothing He is gone In a few days time he will be on the sea I will issue my orders to morrow morning and he will never more during his brief stay in England gain admission to Bartram Haugh Good night my good niece I thank you And so I returned to Mary Quince on the whole happier than I had left her but still with the confused and jarring vision I could not interpret perpetually rising before me and as from time to time shapeless anxieties agitated me relieving them by appeals to Him who alone is wise and strong Next day brought me a goodnatured gossiping letter from dear Milly written in compulsory French which was in some places very difficult to interpret She gave me a very pleasant account of the place and her opinion of the girls who were inmates and mentioned some of the nuns with high commendation The language plainly cramped poor Milly s genius but although there was by no means so much fun as an honest English letter would have brought me there could be no mistake about her liking the place and she expressed her honest longing to see me in the most affectionate terms This letter came enclosed in one to my uncle from the proper authority in the convent and as there was neither address within nor post mark without I was as much in the dark as ever as to poor Milly s whereabouts Pencilled across the envelope of this letter in my uncle s hand were the words Let me have your answer when sealed and I will transmit it S R When accordingly some days later I did place my letter to Milly in my uncle s hands he told me the reason of his reserves on the subject I thought it best dear Maud not to plague you with a secret and Milly s present address is one It will in a few weeks become the rallying point of our diverse routes when you shall meet her and I join you both Nobody until the storm shall have blown over must know where I am to be found except my lawyer and I think you would prefer ignorance to the trouble of keeping a secret on which so much may depend This being reasonable and even considerate I acquiesced In that interval there reached me such a charming gay and affectionate letter a very long letter too though the writer was scarcely seven miles away from dear Cousin Monica full of pleasant gossip and rose coloured and golden castles in the air and the kindest interest in poor Milly and the warmest affection for me One other incident varied that interval if possible more pleasantly than those It was the announcement in a Liverpool paper of the departure of the Seamew bound for Melbourne and among the passengers were reported Dudley Ruthyn Esquire of Bartram H and missus D Ruthyn And now I began to breathe freely I plainly saw the end of my probation approaching a short excursion to France a happy meeting with Milly and then a delightful residence with Cousin Monica for the remainder of my nonage You will say then that my spirits and my serenity were quite restored Not quite How marvellously lie our anxieties in filmy layers one over the other Take away that which has lain on the upper surface for so long the care of cares the only one as it seemed to you between your soul and the radiance of Heaven and straight you find a new stratum there As physical science tells us no fluid is without its skin so does it seem with this fine medium of the soul and these successive films of care that form upon its surface on mere contact with the upper air and light What was my new trouble A very fantastic one you will say the illusion of a self tormentor It was the face of Uncle Silas which haunted me Notwithstanding the old pale smile there was a shrinking grimness and the always averted look Sometimes I fancied his mind was disordered I could not account for the eerie lights and shadows that flickered on his face except so There was a look of shame and fear of me amazing as that seems in the sheen of his peaked smile I thought Perhaps he blames himself for having tolerated Dudley s suit for having urged it on grounds of personal distress for having altogether lowered though under sore temptation both himself and his office and he thinks that he has forfeited my respect Such was my analysis but in the coup d oeil of that white face that dazzled me in darkness and haunted my daily reveries with a faded light there was an intangible character of the insidious and the terrible CHAPTER LIV IN SEARCH OF mister CHARKE S SKELETON On the whole however I was unspeakably relieved Dudley Ruthyn esquire and missus D Ruthyn were now skimming the blue waves on the wings of the Seamew and every morning widened the distance between us which was to go on increasing until it measured a point on the antipodes The Liverpool paper containing this golden line was carefully preserved in my room and like the gentleman who when much tried by the shrewish heiress whom he had married used to retire to his closet and read over his marriage settlement I used when blue devils haunted me to unfold my newspaper and read the paragraph concerning the Seamew The day I now speak of was a dismal one of sleety snow My own room seemed to me cheerier than the lonely parlour where I could not have had good Mary Quince so decorously A good fire that kind and trusty face the peep I had just indulged in at my favourite paragraph and the certainty of soon seeing my dear cousin Monica and afterwards affectionate Milly raised my spirits So said I as old Wyat you say is laid up with rheumatism and can t turn up to scold me I think I ll run up stairs and make an exploration and find poor mister Charke s skeleton in a closet Oh law Miss Maud how can you say such things exclaimed good old Quince lifting up her honest grey head and round eyes from her knitting I had grown so familiar with the frightful tradition of mister Charke and his suicide that I could now afford to frighten old Quince with him I am quite serious I am going to have a ramble up stairs and down stairs like goosey goosey gander and if I do light upon his chamber it is all the more interesting I feel so like Adelaide in the Romance of the Forest the book I was reading to you last night when she commenced her delightful rambles through the interminable ruined abbey in the forest Shall I go with you Miss No Quince stay there keep a good fire and make some tea I suspect I shall lose heart and return very soon and with a shawl about me cowl fashion over my head I stole up stairs I shall not recount with the particularity of the conscientious heroine of missus Ann Radcliffe all the suites of apartments corridors and lobbies which I threaded in my ramble It will be enough to mention that I lighted upon a door at the end of a long gallery which I think ran parallel with the front of the house it interested me because it had the air of having been very long undisturbed There were two rusty bolts which did not evidently belong to its original securities and had been though very long ago somewhat clumsily superadded Dusty and rusty they were but I had no difficulty in drawing them back There was a rusty key I remember it well with a crooked handle in the lock I tried to turn it but could not My curiosity was piqued I was thinking of going back and getting Mary Quince s assistance It struck me however that possibly it was not locked so I pulled the door and it opened quite easily I did not find myself in a strangely furnished suite of apartments but at the entrance of a gallery which diverged at right angles from that through which I had just passed it was very imperfectly lighted and ended in total darkness I began to think how far I had already come and to consider whether I could retrace my steps with accuracy in case of a panic and I had serious thoughts of returning The idea of mister Charke was growing unpleasantly sharp and menacing and as I looked down the long space before me losing itself among ambiguous shadows lulled in a sinister silence and as it were inviting my entrance like a trap I was very near yielding to the cowardly impulse But I took heart of grace and determined to see a little more I opened a side door and entered a large room where were in a corner some rusty and cobwebbed bird cages but nothing more It was a wainscoted room but a white mildew stained the panels I looked from the window it commanded that dismal weed choked quadrangle into which I had once looked from another window I opened a door at its farther end and entered another chamber not quite so large but equally dismal with the same prison like look out not very easily discerned through the grimy panes and the sleet that was falling thickly outside The door through which I had entered made a little accidental creak and with my heart at my lips I gazed at it expecting to see Charke or the skeleton of which I had talked so lightly stalk in at the half open aperture But I had an odd sort of courage which was always fighting against my cowardly nerves and I walked to the door and looking up and down the dismal passage was reassured Well one room more just that whose deep set door fronted me with a melancholy frown at the opposite end of the chamber So to it I glided shoved it open advancing one step and the great bony figure of Madame de la Rougierre was before me I could see nothing else The drowsy traveller who opens his sheets to slip into bed and sees a scorpion coiled between them may have experienced a shock the same in kind but immeasurably less in degree She sat in a clumsy old arm chair with an ancient shawl about her and her bare feet in a delft tub She looked a thought more withered Her wig shoved back disclosed her bald wrinkled forehead and enhanced the ugly effect of her exaggerated features and the gaunt hollows of her face With a sense of incredulity and terror I gazed freezing at this evil phantom who returned my stare for a few seconds with a shrinking scowl dismal and grim as of an evil spirit detected The meeting at least then and there was as complete a surprise for her as for me She could not tell how I might take it but she quickly rallied burst into a loud screeching laugh and with her old Walpurgis gaiety danced some fantastic steps in her bare wet feet tracking the floor with water and holding out with finger and thumb in dainty caricature her slammakin old skirt while she sang some of her nasal patois with an abominable hilarity and emphasis With a gasp I too recovered from the fascination of the surprise I could not speak though for some seconds and Madame was first Ah dear Maud what surprise Are we not overjoy dearest and cannot speak I am full of joy quite charmed ravie of seeing you So are you of me your face betray Ah yes thou dear little baboon here is poor Madame once more Who could have imagine I thought you were in France Madame I said with a dismal effort And so I was dear Maud I av just arrive Your uncle Silas he wrote to the superioress for gouvernante to accompany a young lady that is you Maud on her journey and she send me and so ma chere here is poor Madame arrive to charge herself of that affair How soon do we leave for France Madame I asked I do not know but the old women wat is her name Wyat I suggested Oh oui Waiatt she says two three week And who conduct you to poor Madame s apartment my dear Maud She inquired insinuatingly No one I answered promptly I reached it quite accidentally and I can t imagine why you should conceal yourself Something like indignation kindled in my mind as I began to wonder at the sly strategy which had been practised upon me I av not conceal myself Mademoiselle retorted the governness I av act precisally as I av been ordered Your uncle mister Silas Ruthyn he is afraid Waiatt says to be interrupted by his creditors and everything must be done very quaitly I have been commanded to avoid me faire voir you know and I must obey my employer voila tout And for how long have you been residing here I persisted in the same resentful vein Bout a week It is soche triste place I am so glad to see you Maud I ve been so isolee you dear leetle fool You are not glad Madame you don t love me you never did I exclaimed with sudden vehemence Yes I am very glad you know not chere petite niaise how I av desire to educate you a leetle more Let us understand one another You think I do not love you Mademoiselle because you have mentioned to your poor papa that little dereglement in his library I have repent very often that so great indiscretion of my life I thought to find some letters of doctor Braierly I think that man was trying to get your property my dear Maud and if I had found something I would tell you all about But it was very great sottise and you were very right to denounce me to Monsieur Je n ai point de rancune contre vous No no none at all On the contrary I shall be your gardienne tutelaire wat you call guardian angel ah yes that is it You think I speak par derision not at all No my dear cheaile I do not speak par moquerie unless perhaps the very least degree in the world And with these words Madame laughed unpleasantly showing the black caverns at the side of her mouth and with a cold steady malignity in her gaze Yes I said I know what you mean Madame you hate me Oh wat great ogly word I am shock vous me faites honte Poor Madame she never hate any one she loves all her friends and her enemies she leaves to Heaven while I am as you see more gay more joyeuse than ever they have not been appy no they have not been fortunate these others Wen I return I find always some of my enemy they av die and some they have put themselves into embarrassment or there has arrived to them some misfortune and Madame shrugged and laughed a little scornfully A kind of horror chilled my rising anger and I was silent You see my dear Maud it is very natural you should think I hate you When I was with mister Austin Ruthyn at Knowl you know you did not like a me never But in consequence of our intimacy I confide you that which I av of most dear in the world my reputation It is always so The pupil can calomniate without been discover the gouvernante Av I not been always kind to you Maud Which av I use of violence or of sweetness the most I am like other persons jalouse de ma reputation and it was difficult to suffer with patience the banishment which was invoked by you because chiefly for your good and for an indiscretion to which I was excited by motives the most pure and laudable It was you who spied so cleverly eh and denounce me to Monsieur Ruthyn Helas wat bad world it is I do not mean to speak at all about that occurrence Madame I will not discuss it I dare say what you tell me of the cause of your engagement here is true and I suppose we must travel as you say in company but you must know that the less we see of each other while in this house the better I am not so sure of that my sweet little bete your education has been neglected or rather entirely abandoned since you av arrive at this place I am told You must not be a bestiole We must do you and I as we are ordered mister Silas Ruthyn he will tell us All this time Madame was pulling on her stockings getting her boots on and otherwise proceeding with her dowdy toilet I do not know why I stood there talking to her We often act very differently from what we would have done upon reflection I had involved myself in a dialogue as wiser generals than I have entangled themselves in a general action when they meant only an affair of outposts I had grown a little angry and would not betray the least symptom of fear although I felt that sensation profoundly My beloved father thought you so unfit a companion for me that he dismissed you at an hour s notice and I am very sure that my uncle will think as he did you are not a fit companion for me and had my uncle known what had passed he would never have admitted you to this house never Helas Quelle disgrace And you really think so my dear Maud exclaimed Madame adjusting her wig before her glass in the corner of which I could see half of her sly grinning face as she ogled herself in it I do and so do you Madame I replied growing more frightened It may be we shall see but everyone is not so cruel as you ma chere petite calomniatrice You shan t call me those names I said in an angry tremor What name dearest cheaile Calomniatrice that is an insult Why my most foolish little Maud we may say rogue and a thousand other little words in play which we do not say seriously You are not playing you never play you are angry and you hate me I exclaimed vehemently Oh fie wat shame Do you not perceive dearest cheaile how much education you still need You are proud little demoiselle you must become on the contrary quaite humble Je ferai baiser le babouin a vous ha ha ha I weel make a you to kees the monkey You are too proud my dear cheaile I am not such a fool as I was at Knowl I said you shall not terrify me here I will tell my uncle the whole truth I said Well it may be that is the best she replied with provoking coolness You think I don t mean it Of course you do she replied And we shall see what my uncle thinks of it We shall see my dear she replied with an air of mock contrition Adieu Madame You are going to Monsieur Ruthyn very good I made her no answer but more agitated than I cared to show her I left the room I hurried along the twilight passage and turned into the long gallery that opened from it at right angles I had not gone half a dozen steps on my return when I heard a heavy tread and a rustling behind me I am ready my dear I weel accompany you said the smirking phantom hurrying after me Very well was my reply and threading our way with a few hesitations and mistakes we reached and descended the stairs and in a minute more stood at my uncle s door My uncle looked hard and strangely at us as we entered He looked indeed as if his temper was violently excited and glared and muttered to himself for a few seconds and treating Madame to a stare of disgust he asked peevishly Why am I disturbed pray Miss Maud a Ruthyn she weel explain replied Madame with a great courtesy like a boat going down in a ground swell Will you explain my dear he asked in his coldest and most sarcastic tone I was agitated and I am sure my statement was confused I succeeded however in saying what I wanted Why Madame this is a grave charge Do you admit it pray Madame with the coolest possible effrontery denied it all with the most solemn asseverations and with streaming eyes and clasped hands conjured me melodramatically to withdraw that intolerable story and to do her justice I stared at her for a while astounded and turning suddenly to my uncle as vehemently asserted the truth of every syllable I had related You hear my dear child you hear her deny everything what am I to think You must excuse the bewilderment of my old head Madame de la that lady has arrived excellently recommended by the superioress of the place where dear Milly awaits you and such persons are particular It strikes me my dear niece that you must have made a mistake I protested here But he went on without seeming to hear the parenthesis I know my dear Maud that you are quite incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone but you are liable to be deceived like other young people You were no doubt very nervous and but half awake when you fancied you saw the occurrence you describe and Madame de de De la Rougierre I supplied Yes thank you Madame de la Rougierre who has arrived with excellent testimonials strenuously denies the whole thing Here is a conflict my dear in my mind a presumption of mistake I confess I should prefer that theory to a peremptory assumption of guilt I felt incredulous and amazed it seemed as if a dream were being enacted before me A transaction of the most serious import which I had witnessed with my own eyes and described with unexceptionable minuteness and consistency is discredited by that strange and suspicious old man with an imbecile coolness It was quite in vain my reiterating my statement backing it with the most earnest asseverations I was beating the air It did not seem to reach his mind It was all received with a simper of feeble incredulity He patted and smoothed my head he laughed gently and shook his while I insisted and Madame protested her purity in now tranquil floods of innocent tears and murmured mild and melancholy prayers for my enlightenment and reformation I felt as if I should lose my reason There now dear Maud we have heard enough it is I do believe a delusion Madame de la Rougierre will be your companion at the utmost for three or four weeks Do exercise a little of your self command and good sense you know how I am tortured Do not I entreat add to my perplexities You may make yourself very happy with Madame if you will I have no doubt I propose to Mademoiselle said Madame drying her eyes with a gentle alacrity to profit of my visit for her education But she does not seem to weesh wat I think is so useful She threatened me with some horrid French vulgarism de faire baiser le babouin a moi whatever that means and I know she hates me I replied impetuously Doucement doucement said my uncle with a smile at once amused and compassionate Doucement ma chere With great hands and cunning eyes uplifted Madame tearfully for her tears came on short notice again protested her absolute innocence She had never in all her life so much as heard one so villain phrase You see my dear you have misheard young people never attend You will do well to take advantage of Madame s short residence to get up your French a little and the more you are with her the better I understand then mister Ruthyn you weesh I should resume my instructions asked Madame Certainly and converse all you can in French with Mademoiselle Maud You will be glad my dear that I ve insisted on it he said turning to me when you have reached France where you will find they speak nothing else And now dear Maud no not a word more you must leave me Farewell Madame And he waved us out a little impatiently and I without one look toward Madame de la Rougierre stunned and incensed walked into my room and shut the door CHAPTER LV THE FOOT OF HERCULES I stood at the window still the same leaden sky and feathery sleet before me trying to estimate the magnitude of the discovery I had just made Gradually a kind of despair seized me and I threw myself passionately on my bed weeping aloud Good Mary Quince was of course beside me in a moment with her pale concerned face Oh Mary Mary she s come that dreadful woman Madame de la Rougierre has come to be my governess again and Uncle Silas won t hear or believe anything about her It is vain talking he is prepossessed Was ever so unfortunate a creature as I Who could have fancied or feared such a thing Oh Mary Mary what am I to do what is to become of me Am I never to shake off that vindictive terrible woman Mary said all she could to console me I was making too much of her What was she after all more than a governess she could not hurt me I was not a child no longer she could not bully me now and my uncle though he might be deceived for a while would not be long finding her out Thus and soforth did good Mary Quince declaim and at last she did impress me a little and I began to think that I had perhaps been making too much of Madame s visit But still imagination that instrument and mirror of prophecy showed her formidable image always on its surface with a terrible moving background of shadows In a few minutes there was a knock at my door and Madame herself entered She was in walking costume There had been a brief clearing of the weather and she proposed our making a promenade together On seeing Mary Quince she broke into a rapture of compliment and greeting and took what mister Richardson would have called her passive hand and pressed it with wonderful tenderness Honest Mary suffered all this somewhat reluctantly never smiling and on the contrary looking rather ruefully at her feet Weel you make a some tea When I come back dear Mary Quince I av so much to tell you and dear Miss Maud of all my adventures while I av been away it will make a you laugh ever so much I was what you theenk near ever so near to be married And upon this she broke into a screeching laugh and shook Mary Quince merrily by the shoulder I sullenly declined going out or rising and when she had gone away I told Mary that I should confine myself to my room while Madame stayed But self denying ordinances self imposed are not always long observed by youth Madame de la Rougierre laid herself out to be agreeable she had no end of stories more than half no doubt pure fictions to tell but all in that triste place amusing Mary Quince began to entertain a better opinion of her She actually helped to make beds and tried to be in every way of use and seemed to have quite turned over a new leaf and so gradually she moved me first to listen and at last to talk On the whole these terms were better than a perpetual skirmish but notwithstanding all her gossip and friendliness I continued to have a profound distrust and even terror of her She seemed curious about the Bartram Haugh family and all their ways and listened darkly when I spoke I told her bit by bit the whole story of Dudley and she used whenever there was news of the Seamew to read the paragraph for my benefit and in poor Milly s battered little Atlas she used to trace the ship s course with a pencil writing in from point to point the date at which the vessel was spoken at sea She seemed amused at the irrepressible satisfaction with which I received these minutes of his progress and she used to calculate the distance on such a day he was two hundred and sixty miles on such another five hundred the last point was more than eight hundred good better best best of all would be those deleecious antipode w ere he would so soon promener on his head twelve thousand mile away and at the conceit she would fall into screams of laughter Laugh as she might however there was substantial comfort in thinking of the boundless stretch of blue wave that rolled between me and that villainous cousin I was now on very odd terms with Madame She had not relapsed into her favourite vein of oracular sarcasm and menace she had on the contrary affected her good humoured and genial vein But I was not to be deceived by this I carried in my heart that deep seated fear of her which her unpleasant good humour and gaiety never disturbed for a moment I was very glad therefore when she went to Todcaster by rail to make some purchases for the journey which we were daily expecting to commence and happy in the opportunity of a walk good old Mary Quince and I set forth for a little ramble As I wished to make some purchases in Feltram I set out with Mary Quince for my companion On reaching the great gate we found it locked The key however was in it and as it required more than the strength of my hand to turn Mary tried it At the same moment old Crowle came out of the sombre lodge by its side swallowing down a mouthful of his dinner in haste No one I believe liked the long suspicious face of the old man seldom shorn or washed and furrowed with great grimy perpendicular wrinkles Leering fiercely at Mary not pretending to see me he wiped his mouth hurriedly with the back of his hand and growled Drop it Open it please mister Crowle said Mary renouncing the task Crowle wiped his mouth as before looking inauspicious shuffling to the spot and muttering to himself he first satisfied himself that the lock was fast and then lodged the key in his coat pocket and still muttering retraced his steps We want the gate open please said Mary No answer Miss Maud wants to go into the town she insisted We wants many a thing we can t get he growled stepping into his habitation Please open the gate I said advancing He half turned on his threshold and made a dumb show of touching his hat although he had none on Can t ma am without an order from master no one goes out here You won t allow me and my maid to pass the gate I said Tisn t me ma am said he but I can t break orders and no one goes out without the master allows And without awaiting further parley he entered shutting his hatch behind him So Mary and I stood looking very foolish at one another This was the first restraint I had experienced since Milly and I had been refused a passage through the Windmill paling The rule however on which Crowle insisted I felt confident could not have been intended to apply to me A word to Uncle Silas would set all right and in the meantime I proposed to Mary that we should take a walk my favourite ramble into the Windmill Wood I looked toward Dickon s farmstead as we passed thinking that Beauty might have been there I did see the girl who was plainly watching us She stood in the doorway of the cottage withdrawn into the shade and I fancied anxious to escape observation When we had passed on a little I was confirmed in that belief by seeing her run down the footpath which led from the rear of the farm yard in the direction contrary to that in which we were moving So I thought poor Meg falls from me Mary Quince and I rambled on through the wood till we reached the windmill itself and seeing its low arched door open we entered the chiaro oscuro of its circular basement As we did so I heard a rush and the creak of a plank and looking up I saw just a foot no more disappearing through the trap door In the case of one we love or fear intensely what feats of comparative anatomy will not the mind unconsciously perform Constructing the whole living animal from the turn of an elbow the curl of a whisker a segment of a hand How instantaneous and unerring is the instinct Oh Mary what have I seen I whispered recovering from the fascination that held my gaze fast to the topmost rounds of the ladder that disappeared in the darkness above the open door in the loft Come Mary come away At the same instant appeared the swarthy sullen face of Dickon Hawkes in the shadow of the aperture Having but one serviceable leg his descent was slow and awkward and having got his head to the level of the loft he stopped to touch his hat to me and to hasp and lock the trap door When this was done the man again touched his hat and looked steadily and searchingly at me for a second or so while he got the key into his pocket These fellahs stores their flour too long ere ma am There s a deal o trouble a looking arter it I ll talk wi Silas and settle that By this time he had got upon the worn tiled floor and touching his hat again he said I m a goin to lock the door ma am So with a start and again whispering Come Mary come away With my arm fast in hers we made a swift departure I feel very faint Mary said I Come quickly There s nobody following us No Miss dear That man with the wooden leg is putting a padlock on the door Come very fast I said and when we had got a little farther I said Look again and see whether anyone is following No one Miss answered Mary plainly surprised He s putting the key in his pocket and standin there a lookin after us Oh Mary did not you see it What Miss asked Mary almost stopping Come on Mary Don t pause They will observe us I whispered hurrying her forward What did you see Miss repeated Mary Mr Dudley I whispered with a terrified emphasis not daring to turn my head as I spoke Lawk Miss remonstrated honest Quince with a protracted intonation of wonder and incredulity which plainly implied a suspicion that I was dreaming Yes Mary When we went into that dreadful room that dark round place I saw his foot on the ladder His foot Mary I can t be mistaken I won t be questioned You ll find I m right He s here He never went in that ship at all A fraud has been practised on me it is infamous it is terrible I m frightened out of my life For heaven s sake look back again and tell me what you see Nothing Miss answered Mary in contagious whispers but that wooden legged chap standin hard by the door And no one with him No one Miss We got without pursuit through the gate in the paling I drew breath so soon as we had reached the cover of the thicket near the chestnut hollow and I began to reflect that whoever the owner of the foot might be and I was still instinctively certain that it was no other than Dudley concealment was plainly his object I need not then be at all uneasy lest he should pursue us As we walked slowly and in silence along the grassy footpath I heard a voice calling my name from behind Mary Quince had not heard it at all but I was quite certain It was repeated twice or thrice and looking in considerable doubt and trepidation under the hanging boughs I saw Beauty not ten yards away standing among the underwood I remember how white the eyes and teeth of the swarthy girl looked as with hand uplifted toward her ear she watched us while as it seemed listening for more distant sounds Beauty beckoned eagerly to me advancing with looks of great fear and anxiety two or three short steps toward me She baint to come said Beauty under her breath so soon as I had nearly reached her pointing without raising her hand at Mary Quince Tell her to sit on the ash tree stump down yonder and call ye as loud as she can if she sees any fellah a comin this way an rin ye back to me and she impatiently beckoned me away on her errand When I returned having made this dispositions I perceived how pale the girl was Are you ill Meg I asked Never ye mind Well enough Listen Miss I must tell it all in a crack an if she calls rin awa to her and le me to myself for if fayther or t other un wor to kotch me here I think they d kill me a most Hish She paused a second looking askance in the direction where she fancied Mary Quince was Then she resumed in a whisper Now lass mind ye ye ll keep what I say to yourself You re not to tell that un nor any other for your life mind a word o what I m goin to tell ye I ll not say a word Go on Did ye see Dudley I think I saw him getting up the ladder In the mill Ha that s him He never went beyond Todcaster He staid in Feltram after It was my turn to look pale now My worst conjecture was established CHAPTER LVI I CONSPIRE That s a bad un he is oh Miss Miss Maud It s nout that s good as keeps him an fayther mind lass ye promised you would not tell no one as keeps them two a talkin and a smokin secret like together in the mill An fayther don t know I found him out They don t let me into the town but Brice tells me and he knows it s Dudley and it s nout that s good but summat very bad An I reckon Miss it

me from eleven o clock to nigh one o Tuesday night an went in and come out like thieves feard ye d see em And how does Brice know anything bad I asked with a strange freezing sensation creeping from my heels to my head and down again I am sure deadly pale but speaking very collectedly Brice said Miss he saw Dudley a cryin and lookin awful black and says he to fayther Tisn t in my line nohow an I can t and says fayther to he No one likes they soart o things but how can ye help it The old boy s behind ye wi his pitchfork and ye canna stop An wi that he bethought him o Brice and says he What be

for the world s wealth don t ye let one o them see ye ve got ought in your head not even that un Before I could say another word the girl had glided from me with a wild gesture of silence and a shake of her head I can t at all account for the state in which I was There are resources both of energy and endurance in human nature which we never suspect until the tremendous voice of necessity summons them into play Petrified with a totally new horror but with something of the coldness and impassiveness of the transformation I stood spoke and acted a wonder almost a terror to myself I met Madame on my return as if nothing had happened I heard her ugly gabble and looked at the fruits of her hour s shopping as I might hear and see and talk and smile in a dream But the night was dreadful When Mary Quince and I were alone I locked the door I continued walking up and down the room with my hands clasped looking at the inexorable floor the walls the ceiling with a sort of imploring despair I was afraid to tell my dear old Mary The least indiscretion would be failure and failure destruction I answered her perplexed solicitudes by telling her that I was not very well that I was uneasy but I did not fail to extract from her a promise that she would not hint to mortal either my suspicions about Dudley or our rencontre with Meg Hawkes I remember how when after we had got late at night into bed I sat up shivering with horror in mine while honest Mary s tranquil breathing told how soundly she slept I got up and looked from the window expecting to see some of those wolfish dogs which they had brought to the place prowling about the court yard Sometimes I prayed and felt tranquillised and fancied that I was perhaps to have a short interval of sleep But the serenity was delusive and all the time my nerves were strung hysterically Sometimes I felt quite wild and on the point of screaming At length that dreadful night passed away Morning came and a less morbid though hardly a less terrible state of mind Madame paid me an early visit A thought struck me I knew that she loved shopping and I said quite carelessly Your yesterday s shopping tempts me Madame and I must get a few things before we leave for France Suppose we go into Feltram to day and make my purchases you and I She looked from the corner of her cunning eye in my face without answering I did not blench and she said Vary good I would be vary appy and again she looked oddly at me Wat hour my dear Maud One o clock I think that weel de very well eh I assented and she grew silent I wonder whether I did look as careless as I tried I do not know Through the whole of this awful period I was I think supernatural and I even now look back with wonder upon my strange self command Madame I hoped had heard nothing of the order which prohibited my exit from the place She would herself conduct me to Feltram and secure by accompanying me my free egress Once in Feltram I would assert my freedom and manage to reach my dear cousin Knollys Back to Bartram no power should convey me My heart swelled and fluttered in the awful suspense of that hour Oh Bartram Haugh how came you by those lofty walls Which of my ancestors had begirt me with an impassable barrier in this horrible strait Suddenly I remembered my letter to Lady Knollys If I were disappointed in effecting my escape through Feltram all would depend upon it Having locked my door I wrote as follows Oh my beloved cousin as you hope for comfort in your hour of fear aid me now Dudley has returned and is secreted somewhere about the grounds It is a fraud They all pretend to me that he is gone away in the Seamew and he or they had his name published as one of the passengers Madame de la Rougierre has appeared She is here and my uncle insists on making her my close companion I am at my wits ends I cannot escape the walls are a prison and I believe the eyes of my gaolers are always upon me Dogs are kept for pursuit yes dogs and the gates are locked against my escape God help me I don t know where to look or whom to trust I fear my uncle more than all I think I could bear this better if I knew what their plans are even the worst If ever you loved or pitied me dear cousin I conjure you help me in this extremity Take me away from this Oh darling for God s sake take me away Your distracted and terrified cousin MAUD Bartram Haugh I sealed this letter jealously as if the inanimate missive would burst its cerements and proclaim my desperate appeal through all the chambers and passages of silent Bartram Old Quince greatly to cousin Monica s amusement persisted in furnishing me with those capacious pockets which belonged to a former generation I was glad of this old world eccentricity now and placed my guilty letter that amidst all my hypocrisies spoke out with terrible frankness deep in this receptacle and having hid away the pen and ink my accomplices I opened the door and resumed my careless looks awaiting Madame s return I was to demand to mister Ruthyn the permission to go to Feltram and I think he will allow He want to speak to you With Madame I entered my uncle s room He was reclining on a sofa his back towards us and his long white hair as fine as spun glass hung over the back of the couch I was going to ask you dear Maud to execute two or three little commissions for me in Feltram My dreadful letter felt lighter in my pocket and my heart beat violently But I have just recollected that this is a market day and Feltram will be full of doubtful characters and tipsy persons so we must wait till to morrow and Madame says very kindly that she will as she does not so much mind make any little purchases to day which cannot conveniently wait Madame assented with a courtesy to Uncle Silas and a great hollow smile to me By this time Uncle Silas had raised himself from his reclining posture and was sitting gaunt and white upon the sofa News of my prodigal to day he said with a peevish smile drawing the newspaper towards him The vessel has been spoken again How many miles away do you suppose He spoke in a plaintive key looking at me with hungry eyes and a horribly smiling countenance How far do you suppose Dudley is to day and he laid the palm of his hand on the paragraph as he spoke Guess For a moment I fancied this was a theatric preparation to give point to the disclosure of Dudley s real whereabouts It was a very long way Guess he repeated So stammering a little and pale I performed the required hypocrisy after which my uncle read aloud for my benefit the line or two in which were recorded the event and the latitude and longitude of the vessel at the time of which Madame made a note in her memory for the purpose of making her usual tracing in poor Milly s Atlas I cannot say how it really was but I fancied that Uncle Silas was all the time reading my countenance with a grim and practised scrutiny but nothing came of it and we were dismissed Madame loved shopping even for its own sake but shopping with opportunities of peculation still more She she had had her luncheon and was dressed for the excursion she did precisely what I now most desired she proposed to take charge of my commissions and my money and thus entrusted left me at liberty to keep tryst at the Chestnut Hollow So soon as I had seen Madame fairly off I hurried Mary Quince and got my things on quickly We left the house by the side entrance which I knew my uncle s windows did not command Glad was I to feel a slight breeze enough to make the mill sails revolve and as we got further into the grounds and obtained a distant view of the picturesque old windmill I felt inexpressibly relieved on seeing that it was actually working We were now in the Chestnut Hollow and I sent Mary Quince to her old point of observation which commanded a view of the path in the direction of the Windmill Wood with her former order to call I ve found it as loudly as she could in case she should see anyone approaching I stopped at the point of our yesterday s meeting I peered under the branches and my heart beat fast as I saw Meg Hawkes awaiting me CHAPTER LVII THE LETTER Come away lass whispered Beauty very pale he s here Tom Brice And she led the way shoving aside the leafless underwood and we reached Tom The slender youth groom or poacher he might answer for either with his short coat and gaitered legs was sitting on a low horizontal bough with his shoulder against the trunk Don t ye mind sit ye still lad said Meg observing that he was preparing to rise and had entangled his hat in the boughs Sit ye still and hark to the lady He ll take it Miss Maud if he can wi na ye lad E es I ll take it he replied holding out his hand Tom Brice you won t deceive me Noa sure said Tom and Meg nearly in the same breath You are an honest English lad Tom you would not betray me I was speaking imploringly Noa sure repeated Tom There was something a little unsatisfactory in the countenance of this light haired youth with the sharpish up turned nose Throughout our interview he said next to nothing and smiled lazily to himself like a man listening to a child s solemn nonsense and leading it on with an amused irony from one wise sally to another Thus it seemed to me that this young clown without in the least intending to be offensive was listening to me with a profound and lazy mockery I could not choose however and such as he was I must employ him or none Now Tom Brice a great deal depends on this That s true for her Tom Brice said Meg who now and then confirmed my asseverations I ll give you a pound now Tom and I placed the coin and the letter together in his hand And you are to give this letter to Lady Knollys at Elverston you know Elverston don t you He does Miss Don t ye lad E es Well do so Tom and I ll be good to you so long as I live D ye hear lad E es said Tom it s very good You ll take the letter Tom I said in much greater trepidation as to his answer than I showed E es I ll take the letter said he rising and turning it about in his fingers under his eye like a curiosity Tom Brice I said If you can t be true to me say so but don t take the letter except to give it to Lady Knollys at Elverston If you won t promise that let me have the note back Keep the pound but tell me that you won t mention my having asked you to carry a letter to Elverston to anyone For the first time Tom looked perfectly serious He twiddled the corner of my letter between his finger and thumb and wore very much the countenance of a poacher about to be committed I don t want to chouce ye Miss but I must take care o myself ye see The letters goes all through Silas s fingers to the post and he d know damn well this worn t among em They do say he opens em and reads em before they go an that s his diversion I don t know but I do believe that s how it be an if this one turned up they d all know it went be hand and I d be spotted for t But you know who I am Tom and I d save you said I eagerly Ye d want savin yerself I m thinkin if that feel oot said Tom cynically I don t say though I ll not take it only this I won t run my head again a wall for no one Tom I said with a sudden inspiration give me back the letter and take me out of Bartram take me to Elverston it will be the best thing for you Tom I mean it will indeed that ever befell you With this clown I was pleading as for my life my hand was on his sleeve I was gazing imploringly in his face But it would not do Tom Brice looked amused again swung his head a little on one side grinning sheepishly over his shoulder on the roots of the trees beside him as if he were striving to keep himself from an uncivil fit of laughter I ll do what a wise lad may Miss but ye don t know they lads they bain t that easy come over and I won t get knocked on the head nor sent to gaol appen for no good to thee nor me There s Meg there she knows well enough I could na manage that so I won t try it Miss by no chance no offence Miss but I d rayther not an I ll just try what I can make o this that s all I can do for ye Tom Brice with these words stood up and looked uneasily in the direction of the Windmill Wood Mind ye Miss coom what will ye ll not tell o me Whar ill ye go now Tom inquired Meg uneasily Never ye mind lass answered he breaking his way through the thicket and soon disappearing E es that ill be it he ll git into the sheepwalk behind the mound They re all down yonder git ye back Miss to the hoose be the side door mind ye don t go round the corner and I ll jest sit awhile among the bushes and wait a good time for a start And good bye Miss and don t ye show like as if there was aught out o common on your mind Hish There was a distant hallooing That be fayther she whispered with a very blank countenance and listened with her sunburnt hand to her ear Tisn t me only Davy he ll be callin she said with a great sigh and a joyless smile Now git ye away i God s name So running lightly along the path under cover of this thick wood I recalled Mary Quince and together we hastened back again to the house and entered as directed by the side door which did not expose us to be seen from the Windmill Wood and like two criminals we stole up by the backstairs and so through the side gallery to my room and there sat down to collect my wits and try to estimate the exact effect of what had just occurred Madame had not returned That was well she always visited my room first and everything was precisely as I had left it a certain sign that her prying eyes and busy fingers had not been at work during my absence When she did appear strange to say it was to bring me unexpected comfort She had in her hand a letter from my dear Lady Knollys a gleam of sunlight from the free and happy outer world entered with it The moment Madame left me to myself I opened it and read as follows I am so happy my dearest Maud in the immediate prospect of seeing you I have had a really kind letter from poor Silas poor I say for I really compassionate his situation about which he has been I do believe quite frank at least Ilbury says so and somehow he happens to know I have had quite an affecting changed letter I will tell you all when I see you He wants me ultimately to undertake that which would afford me the most unmixed happiness I mean the care of you my dear girl I only fear lest my too eager acceptance of the trust should excite that vein of opposition which is in most human beings and induce him to think over his offer less favourably again He says I must come to Bartram and stay a night and promises to lodge me comfortably about which last I honestly do not care a pin when the chance of a comfortable evening s gossip with you is in view Silas explains his sad situation and must hold himself in readiness for early flight if he would avoid the risk of losing his personal liberty It is a sad thing that he should have so irretrievably ruined himself that poor Austin s liberality seems to have positively precipitated his extremity His great anxiety is that I should see you before you leave for your short stay in France He thinks you must leave before a fortnight I am thinking of asking you to come over here I know you would be just as well at Elverston as in France but perhaps as he seems disposed to do what we all wish it may be safer to let him set about it in his own way The truth is I have so set my heart upon it that I fear to risk it by crossing him even in a trifle He says I must fix an early day next week and talks as if he meant to urge me to make a longer visit than he defined I shall be only too happy I begin my dear Maud to think that there is no use in trying to control events and that things often turn out best and most exactly to our wishes by being left quite to themselves I think it was Talleyrand who praised the talent of waiting so much In high spirits and with my head brimful of plans I remain dearest Maud ever your affectionate cousin MONICA Here was an inexplicable puzzle A faint radiance of hope however began to overspread a landscape only a few minutes before darkened by total eclipse but construct what theory I might all were inconsistent with many well established and awful incongruities and their wrecks lay strown over the troubled waters of the gulf into which I gazed Why was Madame here Why was Dudley concealed about the place Why was I a prisoner within the walls What were those dangers which Meg Hawkes seemed to think so great and so imminent as to induce her to risk her lover s safety for my deliverance All these menacing facts stood grouped together against the dark certainty that never were men more deeply interested in making away with one human being than were Uncle Silas and Dudley in removing me Sometimes to these dreadful evidences I abandoned my soul Sometimes reading Cousin Monica s sunny letter the sky would clear and my terrors melt away like nightmares in the morning I never repented however that I had sent my letter by Tom Brice Escape from Bartram Haugh was my hourly longing That evening Madame invited herself to tea with me I did not object It was better just then to be on friendly relations with everybody if possible even on their own terms She was in one of her boisterous and hilarious moods and there was a perfume of brandy She narrated some compliments paid her that morning in Feltram by that good crayature missus Litheways the silk mercer and what ansom faylow was her new foreman she intended plainly that I should queez her and how he follow her with his eyes wherever she went I thought perhaps he fancied she might pocket some of his lace or gloves And all the time her great wicked eyes were rolling and glancing according to her ideas of fascination and her bony face grinning and flaming with the strong drink in which she delighted She sang twaddling chansons and being as was her wont under such exhilarating influences in a vapouring mood she vowed that I should have my carriage and horses immediately I weel try what I can do weeth your Uncle Silas We are very good old friends mister Ruthyn and I she said with a leer which I did not understand and which yet frightened me I never could quite understand why these Jezebels like to insinuate the dreadful truth against themselves but they do Is it the spirit of feminine triumph overcoming feminine shame and making them vaunt their fall as an evidence of bygone fascination and existing power Need we wonder Have not women preferred hatred to indifference and the reputation of witchcraft with all its penalties to absolute insignificance Thus as they enjoyed the fear inspired among simple neighbours by their imagined traffic with the father of ill did Madame I think relish with a cynical vainglory the suspicion of her satanic superiority Next morning Uncle Silas sent for me He was seated at his table and spoke his little French greeting smiling as usual pointing to a chair opposite How far I forget he said carelessly laying his newspaper on the table did you yesterday guess Dudley to be Eleven hundred miles I thought it was Oh yes so it was and then there was an abstracted pause I have been writing to Lord Ilbury your trustee he resumed I ventured to say my dear Maud for having thoughts of a different arrangement for you more suitable under my distressing circumstances I do not wish to vacate without some expression of your estimate of my treatment of you while under my roof I ventured to say that you thought me kind considerate indulgent may I say so I assented What could I say I said you had enjoyed our poor way of living here our rough ways and liberty Was I right Again I assented And in fact that you had nothing to object against your poor old uncle except indeed his poverty which you forgave I think I said truth Did I dear Maud Again I acquiesced All this time he was fumbling among the papers in his coatpocket That is satisfactory So I expected you to say he murmured I expected no less On a sudden a frightful change spread across his face He rose like a spectre with a white scowl Then how do you account for that he shrieked in a voice of thunder and smiting my open letter to Lady Knollys face upward upon the table I stared at my uncle unable to speak until I seemed to lose sight of him but his voice like a bell still yelled in my ears There young hypocrite and liar explain that farrago of slander which you bribed my servant to place in the hands of my kinswoman Lady Knollys And so on and on it went I gazing into darkness until the voice itself became indistinct grew into a buzz and hummed away into silence I think I must have had a fit When I came to myself I was drenched with water my hair face neck and dress I did not in the least know where I was I thought my father was ill and spoke to him Uncle Silas was standing near the window looking unspeakably grim Madame was seated beside me and an open bottle of ether one of Uncle Silas s restoratives on the table before me Who s that who s ill is anyone dead I cried At last I was relieved by long paroxysms of weeping When I was sufficiently recovered I was conveyed into my own room CHAPTER LVIII LADY KNOLLYS CARRIAGE Next morning it was Sunday I lay on my bed in my dressing gown dull apathetic with all my limbs sore and as I thought rheumatic and feeling so ill that I did not care to speak or lift my head My recollection of what had passed in Uncle Silas s room was utterly confused and it seemed to me as if my poor father had been there and taken a share I could not remember how in the conference I was too exhausted and stupid to clear up this horrible muddle and merely lay with my face toward the wall motionless and silent except for a great sigh every now and then Good Mary Quince was in the room there was some comfort in that but I felt quite worn out and had rather she did not speak to me and indeed for the time I felt absolutely indifferent as to whether I lived or died Cousin Monica this morning at pleasant Elverston all unconscious of my sad plight proposed to Lady Mary Carysbroke and Lord Ilbury her guests to drive over to church at Feltram and then pay us a visit at Bartram Haugh to which they readily agreed Accordingly at about two o clock this pleasant party of three arrived at Bartram They walked having left the carriage to follow when the horses were fed and Madame de la Rougierre who was in my uncle s room when little Giblets arrived to say that the party were in the parlour whispered for a little with my uncle who then said Miss Maud Ruthyn has gone out to drive but I shall be happy to see Lady Knollys here if she will do me the favour to come upstairs and see me for a few moments and you can mention that I am very far from well Madame followed him out upon the lobby and added holding him by the collar and whispering earnestly in his ear Bring hair ladysheep up by the backstairs mind the back stairs And the next moment Madame entered my room with long tiptoe steps and looking Mary Quince said as if she were going to be hanged On entering she looked sharply round and being satisfied of Mary Quince s presence she turned the key in the door and made some affectionate enquiries about me in a whisper and then she stole to the window and peeped out standing back some way after which she came to my bedside murmured some tender sentences drew the curtain a little and making some little fidgety adjustments about the room among the rest she took the key from the lock quietly and put it into her pocket This was so odd a procedure that honest Mary Quince rose stoutly from her chair pointing to the lock with her frank little blue eyes fixed on Madame and she whispered Won t you put the key in the lock please Oh certainly Mary Queence but it is better it shall be locked for I think her uncle he is coming to see her and I am sure she would be very much frightened for he is very much displease don t you see and we can tell him she is not well enough or asleep and so he weel go away again without any trouble I heard nothing of this which was conducted in close whispers and Mary although she did not give Madame credit for caring whether I was frightened or not and suspected her motives in everything acquiesced grudgingly fearing lest her alleged reason might possibly be the true one So Madame hovered about the door uneasily and of what went on elsewhere during that period Lady Knollys afterwards gave me the following account We were very much disappointed but of course I was glad to see Silas and your little hobgoblin butler led me upstairs to his room a different way I think from that I came before but I don t know the house of Bartram well enough to speak positively I only know that I was conducted quite across his bedroom which I had not seen on my former visit and so into his sitting room where I found him He seemed very glad to see me came forward smiling I disliked his smile always with both hands out and shook mine with more warmth than I ever remembered in his greeting before and said My dear dear Monica how very good of you the very person I longed to see I have been miserably ill the sad consequence of still more miserable anxiety Sit down pray for a moment And he paid me some nice little French compliment in verse And where is Maud said I I think Maud is by this time about halfway to Elverston said the old gentleman I persuaded her to take a drive and advised a call there which seemed to please her so I conjecture she obeyed How very provoking cried I My poor Maud will be sadly disappointed but you will console her by a visit you have promised to come and I shall try to make you comfortable I shall be happier Monica with this proof of our perfect reconciliation You won t deny me Certainly not I am only too glad to come said I and I want to thank you Silas For what said he For wishing to place Maud in my care I am very much obliged to you I did not suggest it I must say Monica with the least intention of obliging you said Silas I thought he was going to break into one of his ungracious moods But I am obliged to you very much obliged to you Silas and you sha n t refuse my thanks I am happy at all events Monica in having won your good will we learn at last that in the affections only are our capacities for happiness and how true is saint Paul s preference of love the principle that abideth The affections dear Monica are eternal and being so celestial divine and consequently happy deriving happiness and bestowing it I was always impatient of his or anybody else s metaphysics but I controlled myself and only said with my customary impudence Well dear Silas and when do you wish me to come The earlier the better said he Lady Mary and Ilbury will be leaving me on Tuesday morning I can come to you in the afternoon if you think Tuesday a good day Thank you dear Monica I shall be I trust enlightened by that day as to my enemies plans It is a humiliating confession Monica but I am past feeling that It is quite possible that an execution may be sent into this house to morrow and an end of all my schemes It is not likely however hardly possible before three weeks my attorney tells me I shall hear from him to morrow morning and then I shall ask you to name a very early day If we are to have an unmolested fortnight certain you shall hear and name your own day Then he asked me who had accompanied me and lamented ever so much his not being able to go down to receive them and he offered luncheon with a sort of Ravenswood smile and a shrug and I declined telling him that we had but a few minutes and that my companions were walking in the grounds near the house I asked whether Maud was likely to return soon Certainly not before five o clock He thought we should probably meet her on our way back to Elverston but could not be certain as she might have changed her plans So then came no more remaining to be said a very affectionate parting I believe all about his legal dangers was strictly true How he could unless that horrid woman had deceived him with so serene a countenance tell me all those gross untruths about Maud I can only admire In the meantime as I lay in my bed Madame gliding hither and thither whispering sometimes listening at others I suddenly startled them both by saying Whose carriage What carriage dear inquired Quince whose ears were not so sharp as mine Madame peeped from the window Tis the physician Doctor Jolks He is come to see your uncle my dear said Madame But I hear a female voice I said sitting up No my dear there is only the doctor said Madame He is come to your uncle I tell you he is getting out of his carriage and she affected to watch the doctor s descent The carriage is driving away I cried Yes it is draiving away she echoed But I had sprung from my bed and was looking over her shoulder before she perceived me It is Lady Knollys I screamed seizing the window frame to force it up and vainly struggling to open it I cried I m here Cousin Monica For God s sake Cousin Monica Cousin Monica You are mad Meess go back screamed Madame exerting her superior strength to force me back But I saw deliverance and escape gliding away from my reach and strung to unnatural force by desperation I pushed past her and beat the window wildly with my hands screaming Save me save me Here here Monica here Cousin cousin oh save me Madame had seized my wrists and a wild struggle was going on A window pane was broken and I was shrieking to stop the carriage The Frenchwoman looked black and haggard as a fury as if she could have murdered me Nothing daunted frantic I screamed in my despair seeing the carriage drive swiftly away seeing Cousin Monica s bonnet as she sat chatting with her vis a vis Oh oh oh I shrieked in vain and prolonged agony as Madame exerting her strength and matching her fury against my despair forced me back in spite of my wild struggles and pushed me sitting on the bed where she held me fast glaring in my face and chuckling and panting over me I think I felt something of the despair of a lost spirit I remember the face of poor Mary Quince its horror its wonder as she stood gaping into my face over Madame s shoulder and crying What is it Miss Maud What is it dear And turning fiercely on Madame and striving to force her grasp from my wrists Are you hurting the child Let her go let her go I weel let her go Wat old fool are you Mary Queence She is mad I think She as lost hair head Oh Mary cry from the window Stop the carriage I cried Mary looked out but there was by this time of course nothing in sight Why don t a you stop the carriage sneered Madame Call a the coachman and the postilion W ere is the footman Bah elle a le cerveau mal timbre Oh Mary Mary is it gone is it gone Is there nothing there cried I rushing to the window and turning to Madame after a vain straining of my eyes my face against the glass Oh cruel cruel wicked woman why have you done this What was it to you Why do you persecute me What good can you gain by my ruin Rueen Par bleu ma chere you talk too fast Did not a you see it Mary Queence It was the doctor s carriage and missus Jolks and that eempudent faylow young Jolks staring up to the window and Mademoiselle she come in soche shocking deshabille to show herself knocking at the window Twould be very nice thing Mary Queence don t you think I was sitting now on the bedside crying in mere despair I did not care to dispute or to resist Oh why had rescue come so near only to prove that it could not reach me So I went on crying with a clasping of my hands and turning up of my eyes in incoherent prayer I was not thinking of Madame or of Mary Quince or any other person only babbling my anguish and despair helplessly in the ear of heaven I did not think there was soche fool Wat enfant gate My dear cheaile wat a can you mean by soche strange language and conduct Wat for should a you weesh to display yourself in the window in soche orrible deshabille to the people in the doctor s coach It was Cousin Knollys Cousin Knollys Oh Cousin Knollys You re gone you re gone you re gone And if it was Lady Knollys coach there was certainly a coachman and a footman and whoever has the coach there was young gentlemen in it If it was Lady Knollys carriage it would av been worse than the doctor It is no matter it is all over Oh Cousin Monica your poor Maud where is she to turn Is there no help That evening Madame visited me again in one of her sedate and moral moods She found me dejected and passive as she had left me I think Maud there is news but I am not certain I raised my head and looked at her wistfully I think there is letter of bad news from the attorney in London Oh I said in a tone which I am sure implied the absolute indifference of dejection But my dear Maud if t be so we shall go at once you and me to join Meess Millicent in France La belle France You weel like so moche We shall be so gay You cannot imagine there are such naice girl there They all love a me so moche you will be delight How soon do we go I asked I do not know Bote I was to bring in a case of eau de cologne that came this evening and he laid down a letter and say The blow has descended Madame My niece must hold herself in readiness I said For what Monsieur twice bote he did not answer I am sure it is un proces They av ruin him Eh bien my dear I suppose we shall leave this triste place immediately I am so rejoice It appears to me un cimetiere Yes I should like to leave it I said sitting up with a great sigh and sunken eyes It seemed to me that I had quite lost all sense of resentment towards Madame A debility of feeling had supervened the fatigue I suppose and prostration of the passions I weel make excuse to go into his room again said Madame and I weel endeavor to learn something more from him and I weel come back again to you in half an hour She departed But in half an hour did not return I had a dull longing to leave Bartram Haugh For me since the departure of poor Milly it had grown like the haunt of evil spirits and to escape on any terms from it was a blessing unspeakable Another half hour passed and another and I grew insufferably feverish I sent Mary Quince to the lobby to try and see Madame who I feared was probably to ing and fro ing in and out of Uncle Silas s room Mary returned to tell me that she had seen old Wyat who told her that she thought Madame had gone to her bed half an hour before CHAPTER LIX A SUDDEN DEPARTURE Mary said I I am miserably anxious to hear what Madame may have to tell she knows the state I am in and she would not like so much trouble as to look in at my door to say a word Did you hear what she told me No Miss Maud she answered rising and drawing near She thinks we are going to France immediately and to leave this place perhaps for ever Heaven be praised for that if it be so Miss said Mary with more energy than was common with her for there is no luck about it and I don t expect to see you ever well or happy in it You must take your candle Mary and make out her room upstairs I found it accidentally myself one evening But Wyat won t let us upstairs Don t mind her Mary I tell you to go You must try I can t sleep till we hear What direction is her room in Miss asked Mary Somewhere in that direction Mary I answered pointing I cannot describe the turns but I think you will find it if you go along the great passage to your left on getting to the top of the stairs till you come to the cross galleries and then turn to your left and when you have passed four or perhaps five doors you must be very near it and I am sure she will hear if you call But will she tell me she is such a rum un Miss suggested Mary Tell her exactly what I have said to you and when she learns that you already know as much as I do she may unless indeed she wishes to torture me If she won t perhaps at least you can persuade her to come to me for a moment Try dear Mary we can but fail Will you be very lonely Miss while I am away asked Mary uneasily as she lighted her candle I can t help it Mary Go I think if I heard we were going I could almost get up and dance and sing I can t bear this dreadful uncertainty any longer If old Wyat is outside I ll come back and wait here a bit till she s out o the way said Mary and anyhow I ll make all the haste I can The drops and the sal volatile is here Miss by your hand And with an anxious look at me she made her exit softly and did not immediately return by which I concluded that she had found the way clear and had gained the upper story without interruption This little anxiety ended its subsidence was followed by a sense of loneliness and with it of vague insecurity which increased at last to such a pitch that I wondered at my own madness in sending my companion away and at last my terrors so grew that I drew back into the farthest corner of the bed with my shoulders to the wall and my bed clothes huddled about me with only a point open to peep at At last the door opened gently Who s there I cried in extremity of horror expecting I knew not whom Me Miss whispered Mary Quince to my unutterable relief and with her candle flared and a wild and pallid face Mary Quince glided into the room locking the door as she entered I do not know how it was but I found myself holding Mary fast with both my hands as we stood side by side on the floor Mary you are terrified for God s sake what is the matter I cried No Miss said Mary faintly not much I see it in your face What is it Let me sit down Miss I ll tell you what I saw only I m just a bit queerish Mary sat down by my bed Get in Miss you ll take cold Get into bed and I ll tell you It is not much I did get into bed and gazing on Mary s frightened face I felt a corresponding horror For mercy s sake Mary say what it is So again assuring me it was not much she gave me in a somewhat diffuse and tangled narrative the following facts On closing my door she raised her candle above her head and surveyed the lobby and seeing no one there she ascended the stairs swiftly She passed along the great gallery to the left and paused a moment at the cross gallery and then recollected my directions clearly and followed the passage to the right There are doors at each side and she had forgotten to ask me at which Madame s was She opened several In one room she was frightened by a bat which had very nearly put her candle out She went on a little paused and began to lose heart in the dismal solitude when on a sudden a few doors farther on she thought she heard Madame s voice She said that she knocked at the door but receiving no answer and hearing Madame still talking within she opened it There was a candle on the chimneypiece and another in a stable lantern near the window Madame was conversing volubly on the hearth with her face toward the window the entire frame of which had been taken from its place Dickon Hawkes the Zamiel of the wooden leg was supporting it with one hand as it leaned imperfectly against the angle of the recess There was a third figure standing buttoned up in a surtout with a bundle of tools under his arm like a glazier and with a silent thrill of fear she distinctly recognised the features as those of Dudley Ruthyn Twas him Miss so sure as I sit here Well like that they were as mute as mice three pairs of eyes were on me I don t know what made me so study like but som at told me I should not make as though I knew any but Madame and so I made a courtesy as well as I could and I said Might I speak a word wi ye please on the lobby mister Dudley was making belief be this time to look out at window wi his back to me and I kept looking straight on Madame and she said They re mendin my broken glass Mary walking between them and me and coming close up to me very quick and so she marched me backward out o the door prating all the time When we were on the lobby she took my candle from my hand shutting the door behind her and she held the light a bit behind her ear so twas full on my face as she looked sharp into it and after a bit she said again in her queer lingo there was two panes broke in her room and men sent for to mend it I was awful frightened when I saw mister Dudley for I could not believe any such thing before and I don t know how I could look her in the face as I did and not show it I was as smooth and cool as yonder chimneypiece and she has an awful evil eye to stan against but I never flinched and I think she s puzzled for as cunning as she is whether I believe all she said or knowed twas a pack o stories So I told her your message and she said she had not heard another word since but she did believe we had not many more days here and would tell you if she heard to night when she brought his soup to your uncle in half an hour s time I asked her as soon as I could speak whether she was perfectly certain as to the fact that the man in the surtout was Dudley and she made answer I d swear to him on that Bible Miss So far from any longer wishing Madame s return that night I trembled at the idea of it Who could tell who might enter the room with her when the door opened to admit her Dudley so soon as he recovered the surprise had turned about evidently anxious to prevent recognition Dickon Hawkes stood glowering at her Both might have hope of escaping recognition in the imperfect light for the candle on the chimneypiece was flaring in the air and the light from the lantern fell in spots and was confusing What could that ruffian Hawkes be doing in the house Why was Dudley there Could a more ominous combination be imagined I puzzled my distracted head over all Mary Quince s details but could make nothing of their occupation I know of nothing so terrifying as this kind of perpetual puzzling over ominous problems You may imagine how the long hours of that night passed and how my heart beat at every fancied sound outside my door But morning came and with its light some reassurance Early Madame de la Rougierre made her appearance she searched my eyes darkly and shrewdly but made no allusion to Mary Quince s visit Perhaps she expected some question from me and hearing none thought it as well to leave the subject at rest She had merely come in to say that she had heard nothing since but was now going to make my uncle s chocolate and that so soon as her interview was ended she would see me again and let me hear anything she should have gleaned In a little while a knock came to my door and Mary Quince was ordered by old Wyat into my uncle s room She returned flushed in a huge fuss to say that I was to be up and dressed for a journey in half an hour and to go straight when dressed to my uncle s room It was good news at the same time it was a shock I was glad I was stunned I jumped out of bed and set about my toilet with an energy quite new to me Good Mary Quince was busily packing my boxes and consulting as to what I should take with me and what not Was Mary Quince to accompany me He had not said a word on that point and I feared from his silence she was to remain There was comfort however in this that the separation would not be for long I felt confident of that and I was about to join Milly whom I loved better than I could have believed before our separation but whatsoever the conditions might be it was an indescribable relief to have done with Bartram Haugh and leave behind me its sinister lines of circumvallation its haunted recesses and the awful spectres that had lately appeared within its walls I stood too much in awe of my uncle to fail in presenting myself punctually at the close of the half hour I entered his sitting room under the shadow of sour old Wyat s high cauled cap she closed the door behind me and the conference commenced Madame de la Rougierre sat there dressed and draped for a journey and with a thick black lace veil on My uncle rose gaunt and venerable and with a harsh and severe countenance He did not offer his hand he made me a kind of bow more of repulsion than of respect He remained in a standing position supporting his crooked frame by his hand which he leaned on a despatch box he glared on me steadily with his wild phosphoric eyes from under the dark brows I have described to you now corrugated in lines indescribably stern You shall join my daughter at the Pension in France Madame de la Rougierre shall accompany you said my uncle delivering his directions with the stern monotony and the measured pauses of a person dictating an important despatch to a secretary Old missus Quince shall follow with me or if alone in a week You shall pass to night in London to morrow night you proceed thence to Dover and cross by the mail packet You shall now sit down and write a letter to your cousin Monica Knollys which I will first read and then despatch Tomorrow you shall write a note to Lady Knollys from London telling her how you have got over so much of your journey and that you cannot write from Dover as you must instantly start by the packet on reaching it and that until my affairs are a little settled you cannot write to her from France as it is of high importance to my safety that no clue should exist as to our address Intelligence however shall reach her through my attorneys Archer and Sleigh and I trust we shall soon return You will please submit that latter note to Madame de la Rougierre who has my directions to see that it contains no libels upon my character Now sit down So with those unpleasant words tingling in my ears I obeyed Write said he when I was duly placed You shall convey the substance of what I say in your own language The immiment danger this morning announced of an execution rememher the word and he spelled it for me being put into this house either this afternoon or to morrow compels me to anticipate my plans and despatch you for France this day That you are starting with an attendant Here an uneasy movement from Madame whose dignity was perhaps excited An attendant he repeated with a discordant emphasis and you can if you please but I don t solicit that justice say that you have been as kindly treated here as my unfortunate circumstances would permit That is all You have just fifteen minutes to write Begin I wrote accordingly My hysterical state had made me far less combative than I might have proved some months since for there was much that was insulting as well as formidable in his manner I completed my letter however to his satisfaction in the prescribed time and he said as he laid it and its envelope on the table Please to remember that this lady is not your attendant only but that she has authority to direct every detail respecting your journey and will make all the necessary payments on the way You will please then implicitly to comply with her directions The carriage awaits you at the hall door Having thus spoken with another grim bow and I wish you a safe and pleasant journey he receded a step or two and I with an undefinable kind of melancholy though also with a sense of relief withdrew My letter I afterwards found reached Lady Knollys accompanied by one from Uncle Silas who said Dear Maud apprises me that she has written to tell you something of our movements A sudden crisis in my miserable affairs compels a break up as sudden here Maud joins my daughter at the Pension in France I purposely omit the address because I mean to reside in its vicinity until this storm shall have blown over and as the consequences of some of my unhappy entanglements might pursue me even there I must only for the present spare you the pain and trouble of keeping a secret I am sure that for some little time you will excuse the girl s silence in the meantime you shall hear of them and perhaps circuitously from me Our dear Maud started this morning en route for her destination very sorry as am I that she could not enjoy first a flying visit to Elverston but in high spirits notwithstanding at the new life and sights before her At the door my beloved old friend Mary Quince awaited me Am I going with you Miss Maud I burst into tears and clasped her in my arms I m not said Mary very sorrowfully and I never was from you yet Miss since you wasn t the length of my arm And kind old Mary began to cry with me Bote you are coming in a few days Mary Quince expostulated Madame I wonder you are soche fool What is two three days Bah nonsense girl Another farewell to poor Mary Quince quite bewildered at the suddenness of her bereavement A serious and tremulous bow from our little old butler on the steps Madame bawling through the open window to the driver to make good speed and remember that we had but nineteen minutes to reach the station Away we went Old Crowle s iron grille rolled back before us I looked on the receding landscape the giant trees the palatial time stained mansion A strange conflict of feelings sweet and bitter rose and mingled in the reverie Had I been too hard and suspicious with the inhabitants of that old house of my family Was my uncle justly indignant Was I ever again to know such pleasant rambles as some of those I had enjoyed with dear Millicent through the wild and beautiful woodlands I was leaving behind me And there with my latest glimpse of the front of Bartram Haugh I beheld dear old Mary Quince gazing after us Again my tears flowed I waved my handkerchief from the window and now the park wall hid all from view and at a great pace throught the steep wooded glen with the rocky and precipitous character of a ravine we glided and when the road next emerged Bartram Haugh was a misty mass of forest and chimneys slope and hollow and we within a few minutes of the station CHAPTER LX THE JOURNEY Waiting for the train as we stood upon the platform I looked back again toward the wooded uplands of Bartram and far behind the fine range of mountains azure and soft in the distance beyond which lay beloved old Knowl and my lost father and mother and the scenes of my childhood never embittered except by the sibyl who sat beside me Under happier circumstances I should have been at my then early age quite wild with pleasurable excitement on entering London for the first time But black Care sat by me with her pale hand in mine a voice of fear and warning whose words I could not catch was always in my ear We drove through London amid the glare of lamps toward the West end and for a little while the sense of novelty and curiosity overcame my despondency and I peeped eagerly from the window while Madame who was in high good humour spite of the fatigues of our long railway flight screeched scraps of topographic information in my ear for London was a picture book in which she was well read That is Euston Square my dear Russell Square Here is Oxford Street Haymarket See there is the Opera House Hair Majesty s Theatre See all the carriages waiting and so on till we reached at length a little narrow street which she told me was off Piccadilly where we drew up before a private house as it seemed to me a family hotel and I was glad to be at rest for the night Fatigued with the peculiar fatigue of railway travelling dusty a little chilly with eyes aching and wearied I ascended the stairs silently our garrulous and bustling landlady leading the way and telling her oft told story of the house its noble owner in old time and how those fine drawing rooms were taken every year during the Session by the Bishop of Rochet on Copeley and at last into our double bedded room I would fain have been alone but I was too tired and dejected to care very much for anything At tea Madame expanded in spirit like a giant refreshed and chattered and sang and at last seeing that I was nodding advised my going to bed while she ran across the street to see her dear old friend Mademoiselle saint Eloi who was sure to be up and would be offended if she failed to make her ever so short a call I cared little what she said and was glad to be rid of her even for a short time and was soon fast asleep I saw her I know not how much later poking about the room like a figure in a dream and taking off her things She had her breakfast in bed next morning and I was to my comfort left to take mine in solitary possession of our sitting room where I began to wonder how little annoyance I had as yet suffered from her company and began to speculate upon the chances of my making the journey with tolerable comfort Our hostess gave me five minutes of her valuable time Her talk ran chiefly upon nuns and convents and her old acquaintance with Madame and it seemed to me that she had at one time driven a kind of trade no doubt profitable enough in escorting young ladies to establishments on the Continent and although I did not then quite understand the tone in which she spoke to me I often thought afterwards that Madame had represented me as a young person destined for the holy vocation of the veil When she was gone I sat listlessly looking out of the window and saw some chance equipages drive by and now and then a fashionable pedestrian and wondered if this quiet thoroughfare could really be one of the arteries so near the heart of the tumultuous capital I think my nervous vitality must have burnt very low just then for I felt perfectly indifferent about all the novelty and world of wonders beyond and should have hated to leave the dull tranquillity of my window for an excursion through the splendours of the unseen streets and palaces that surrounded me It was one o clock before Madame joined me and finding me in this dull mood she did not press me to accompany her in her drive no doubt well pleased to be rid of me After tea that evening as we sat alone in our room she entertained me with some very odd conversation at the time unintelligible but which acquired a tolerably distinct meaning from the events that followed Two or three times that day Madame appeared to me on the point of saying something of grave import as she scanned me with her bleak wicked stare It was a peculiarity of hers that whenever she was pressed upon by an anxiety that really troubled her her countenance did not look sad or solicitous as other people s would but simply wicked Her great gaunt mouth was compressed and drawn down firmly at the corners and her eyes glared with a dismal scowl At last she said suddenly Are you ever grateful Maud I hope so Madame I answered And how do you show your gratitude For instance would a you do great deal for a person who would run risque for your sake It struck me all at once that she was sounding me about poor Meg Hawkes whose fidelity notwithstanding the treason or cowardice of her lover Tom Brice I never doubted and I grew at once wary and reserved I know of no opportunity thank Heaven for any such service Madame How can anyone serve me at present by themselves incurring danger What do you mean Do you like for example to go to that French Pension Would you not like better some other arrangement Of course there are other arrangements I should like better but I see no use in talking of them they are not to be I answered What other arrangements do you mean my dear cheaile enquired Madame You mean I suppose you would like better to go to Lady Knollys My uncle does not choose it at present and except with his consent nothing can be done He weel never consent dear cheaile But he has consented not immediately indeed but in a short time when his affairs are settled Lanternes They will never be settle said Madame At all events for the present I am to go to France Milly seems very happy and I dare say I shall like it too I am very glad to leave Bartram Haugh at all events But your uncle weel bring you back there said Madame drily It is doubtful whether he will ever return to Bartram himself I said Ah said Madame with a long drawn nasal intonation you theenk I hate you You are quaite wrong my dear Maud I am on the contrary very much interested for you I am I assure you dear a cheaile And she laid her great hand with joints misshapen by old chilblains upon the back of mine I looked up in her face She was not smiling On the contrary her wide mouth was drawn down at the corners ruefully as before and she gazed on my face with a scowl from her abysmal eyes I used to think the flare of that irony which lighted her face so often immeasurably worse than any other expression she could assume but this lack lustre stare and dismal collapse of feature was more wicked still Suppose I should bring you to Lady Knollys and place you in her charge what would a you do then for poor Madame said this dark spectre I was inwardly startled at these words I looked into her unsearchable face but could draw thence nothing but fear Had she made the same overture only two days since I think I would have offered her half my fortune But circumstances were altered I was no longer in the panic of despair The lesson I had received from Tom Brice was fresh in my mind and my profound distrust of her was uppermost I saw before me only a tempter and betrayer and said Do you mean to imply Madame that my guardian is not to be trusted and that I ought to make my escape from him and that you are really willing to aid me in doing so This you see was turning the tables upon her I looked her steadily in the face as I spoke She returned my gaze with a strange stare and a gape which haunted me long after and it seemed as we sat in utter silence that each was rather horribly fascinated by the other s gaze At last she shut her mouth sternly and eyes me with a more determined and meaning scowl and then said in a low tone I believe Maud that you are a cunning and wicked little thing Wisdom is not cunning Madame nor is it wicked to ask your meaning in explicit language I replied And so you clever cheaile we two sit here playing at a game of chess over this little table to decide which shall destroy the other is it not so I will not allow you to destroy me I retorted with a sudden flash Madame stood up and rubbed her mouth with her open hand She looked to me like some evil being seen in a dream I was frightened You are going to hurt me I ejaculated scarce knowing what I said If I were you deserve it You are very malicious ma chere or it may be only very stupid A knock came to the door Come in I cried with a glad sense of relief A maid entered A letter please m she said handing it to me For me snarled Madame snatching it I had seen my uncle s hand and the Feltram post mark Madame broke the seal and read It seemed but a word for she turned it about after the first momentary glance and examined the interior of the envelope and then returned to the line she had already read She folded the letter again drawing her nails in a sharp pinch along the creases as she stared in a blank hesitating way at me You are stupid little ingrate I am employ by Monsieur Ruthyn and of course I am faithful to my employer I do not want to talk to you There you may read that She jerked the letter before me on the table It contained but these words Bartram Haugh thirtieth January eighteen forty five MY DEAR MADAME Be so good as to take the half past eight o clock train to Dover to night Beds are prepared Yours very truly SILAS RUTHYN I cannot say what it was in this short advice that struck me with fear Was it the thick line beneath the word Dover that was so uncalled for and gave me a faint but terrible sense of something preconcerted I said to Madame Why is Dover underlined I do not know little fool no more than you How can I tell what is passing in your oncle s head when he make that a mark Has it not a meaning Madame How can you talk like that she answered more in her old way You are either mocking of me or you are becoming truly a fool She rang the bell called for our bill saw our hostess while I made a few hasty prepartions in my room You need not look after the trunks they will follow us all right Let us go cheaile we av half an hour only to reach the train No one ever fussed like Madame when occasion offered There was a cab at the door into which she hurried me I assumed that she would give all needful directions and leaned back very weary and sleepy already though it was so early listening to her farewell screamed from the cab step and seeing her black cloak flitting and flapping this way and that like the wings of a raven disturbed over its prey In she got and away we drove through a glare of lamps and shop windows still open gas everywhere and cabs busses and carriages still thundering through the streets I was too tired and too depressed to look at those things Madame on the contrary had her head out of the window till we reached the station Where are the rest of the boxes I asked as Madame placed me in charge of her box and my bag in the office of the terminus They will follow with Boots in another cab and will come safe with us in this train Mind those two we weel bring in the carriage with us So into a carriage we got in came Madame s box and my bag Madame stood at the door and I think frightened away intending passengers by her size and shrillness At last the bell rang her into her place the door clapt the whistle sounded and we were off CHAPTER LXI OUR BED CHAMBER I had passed a miserable night and indeed for many nights had not had my due proportion of sleep Still I sometimes fancy that I may have swallowed something in my tea that helped to make me so irresistibly drowsy It was a very dark night no moon and the stars soon hid by the gathering clouds Madame sat silent and ruminating in her place with her rugs about her I in my corner similarly enveloped tried to keep awake Madame plainly thought I was asleep already for she stole a leather flask from her pocket and applied it to her lips causing an aroma of brandy But it was vain struggling against the influence that was stealing over me and I was soon in a profound and dreamless slumber Madame awoke me at last in a huge fuss She had got out all our things and hurried them away to a close carriage which was awaiting us It was still dark and starless We got along the platform I half asleep the porter carrying our rugs by the glare of a pair of gas jets in the wall and out by a small door at the end I remember that Madame contrary to her wont gave the man some money By the puzzling light of the carriage lamps we got in and took our seats Go on screamed Madame and drew up the window with a great chuck and we were enclosed in darkness and silence the most favourable conditions for thought My sleep had not restored me as it might I felt feverish fatigued and still very drowsy though unable to sleep as I had done I dozed by fits and starts and lay awake or half awake sometimes not thinking but in a way imagining what kind of a place Dover would be but too tired and listless to ask Madame any questions and merely seeing the hedges grey in the lamplight glide backward into darkness as I leaned back We turned off the main road at right angles and drew up Get down and poosh it it is open screamed Madame from the window A gate I suppose was thus passed for when we resumed our brisk trot Madame bawled across the carriage We are now in the otel grounds And so all again was darkness and silence and I fell into another doze from which on waking I found that we had come to a standstill and Madame was standing on the low step of an open door paying the driver She herself pulled her box and the bag in I was too tired to care what had become of the rest of our luggage I descended glancing to the right and left but there was nothing visible but a patch of light from the lamps on a paved ground and on the wall We stepped into the hall or vestibule and Madame shut the door and I thought I heard the key turn in it We were in total darkness Where are the lights Madame where are the people I asked more awake than I had been Tis pass three o clock cheaile bote there is always light here She was groping at the side and in a moment more lighted a lucifer match and so a bedroom candle We were in a flagged lobby under an archway at the right and at the left of which opened long flagged passages lost in darkness a winding stair barely wide enough to admit Madame dragging her box led upward under a doorway in a corner at the right Come dear cheaile take your bag don t mind the rugs they are safe enough But where are we to go There is no one I said looking round in wonder It certainly was a strange reception at an hotel Never mind my dear cheaile They know me here and I have always the same room ready when I write for it Follow me quaitely So she mounted carrying the candle The stair was steep and the march long We halted at the second landing and entered a gaunt grimy passage All the way up we had not heard a single sound of life nor seen a human being nor so much as passed a gaslight Viola here tis my dear old room Enter dearest Maud And so I did The room was large and lofty but shabby and dismal There was a tall four post bed with its foot beside the window hung with dark green curtains of some plush or velvet texture that looked like a dusty pall The remaining furniture was scant and old and a ravelled square of threadbare carpet covered a patch of floor at the bedside The room was grim and large and had a cold vault like atmosphere as if long uninhabited but there were cinders in the grate and under it The imperfect light of our mutton fat candle made all this look still more comfortless Madame placed the candle on the chimneypiece locked the door and put the key in her pocket I always do so in otel said she with a wink at me And then with a long ha expressive of fatigue and relief she threw herself into a chair So ere we are at last said she I m glad There s your bed Maud Mine is in the dressing room She took the candle and I went in with her A shabby press bed a chair and table were all its furniture it was rather a closet than a dressing room and had no door except that through which we had entered So we returned and very tired wondering I sat down on the side of my bed and yawned I hope they will call us in time for the packet I said Oh yes they never fail she answered looking steadfastly on her box which she was diligently uncording Uninviting as was my bed I was longing to lie down in it and having made those ablutions which our journey rendered necessary I at length lay down having first religiously stuck my talismanic pin with the head of sealing wax into the bolster Nothing escaped the restless eye of Madame Wat is that dear cheaile she enquired drawing near and scrutinising the head of the gipsy charm which showed like a little ladybird newly lighted on the sheet Nothing a charm folly Pray Madame allow me to go to sleep So with another look and a little twiddle between her finger and thumb she seemed satisfied but unhappily for me she did not seem at all sleepy She busied herself in unpacking and displaying over the back of the chair a whole series of London purchases silk dresses a shawl a sort of lace demi coiffure then in vogue and a variety of other articles The vainest and most slammakin of women the merest slut at home a milliner s lay figure out of doors she had one square foot of looking glass upon the chimneypiece and therein tried effects and conjured up grotesque simpers upon her sinister and weary face I knew that the sure way to prolong this worry was to express my uneasiness under it so I bore it as quietly as I could and at last fell fast asleep with the gaunt image of Madame with a festoon of grey silk with a cerise stripe pinched up in her finger and thumb and smiling over her shoulder across it into the little shaving glass that stood on the chimney I awoke suddenly in the morning and sat up in my bed having for a moment forgotten all about our travelling A moment more however brought all back again Are we in time Madame For the packet she enquired with one of her charming smiles and cutting a caper on the floor To be sure you don t suppose they would forget We have two hours yet to wait Can we see the sea from the window No dearest cheaile you will see t time enough I d like to get up I said Time enough my dear Maud you are fatigued are you sure you feel quite well Well enough to get up I should be better I think out of bed There is no hurry you know you need not even go by the next packet Your uncle he tell me I may use my discretion Is there any water They will bring some Please Madame ring the bell She pulled it with alacrity I afterwards learnt that it did not ring What has become of my gipsy pin I demanded with an unaccountable sinking of the heart Oh the little pin with the red top maybe it as fall on the ground we weel find when you get up I suspected that she had taken it merely to spite me It would have been quite the thing she would have liked I cannot describe to you how the loss of this little charm depressed and excited me I searched the bed I turned over all the bed clothes I searched in and outside at last I gave up How odious I cried somebody has stolen it merely to vex me And like a fool as I was I threw myself on my face on the bed and wept partly in anger partly in dismay After a time however this blew over I had a hope of recovering it If Madame had stolen it it would turn up yet But in the meantime its disappearance troubled me like an omen I am afraid my dear cheaile you are not very well It is really very odd you should make such fuss about a pin Nobody would believe Do you not theenk it would be a good plan to take a your breakfast in your bed She continued to urge this point for some time At last however having by this time quite recovered my self command and resolved to preserve ostensibly fair terms with Madame who could contribute so essentially to make me wretched during the rest of my journey and possibly to prejudice me very seriously on my arrival I said quietly Well Madame I know it is very silly but I had kept that foolish little pin so long and so carefully that I had grown quite fond of it but I suppose it is lost and I must content myself though I cannot laugh as you do So I will get up now and dress I think you will do well to get all the repose you can answered Madame but as you please she added observing that I was getting up So soon as I had got some of my things on I said Is there a pretty view from the window No said Madame I looked out and saw a dreary quadrangle of cut stone in one side of which my window was placed As I looked a dream rose up before me This hotel I said in a puzzled way Is it a hotel Why this is just like it is the inner court of Bartram Haugh Madame clapped her large hands together made a fantastic chasse on the floor burst into a great nasal laugh like the scream of a parrot and then said Well dearest Maud is not clever trick I was so utterly confounded that I could only stare about me in stupid silence a spectacle which renewed Madame s peals of laughter We are at Bartram Haugh I repeated in utter consternation How was this done I had no reply but shrieks of laughter and one of those Walpurgis dances in which she excelled It is a mistake is it What is it All a mistake of course Bartram Haugh it is so like Dover as all philosophers know I sat down in total silence looking out into the deep and dark enclosure and trying to comprehend the reality and the meaning of all this Well Madame I suppose you will be able to satisfy my uncle of your fidelity and intelligence But to me it seems that his money has been ill spent and his directions anything but well observed Ah ha Never mind I think he will forgive me laughed Madame Her tone frightened me I began to think with a vague but overpowering sense of danger that she had acted under the Machiavellian directions of her superior You have brought me back then by my uncle s orders Did I say so No but what you have said can have no other meaning though I can t believe it And why have I been brought here What is the object of all this duplicity and trick I will know It is not possible that my uncle a gentleman and a kinsman can be privy to so disreputable a manouvre First you will eat your breakfast dear Maud next you can tell your story to your uncle Monsieur Ruthyn and then you shall hear what he thinks of my so terrible misconduct What nonsense cheaile Can you not think how many things may appen to change a your uncle s plans Is he not in danger to be arrest Bah You are cheaile still you cannot have intelligence more than a cheaile Dress yourself and I will order breakfast I could not comprehend the strategy which had been practised on me Why had I been so shamelessly deceived If it were decided that I should remain here for what imaginable reason had I been sent so far on my journey to France Why had I been conveyed back with such mystery Why was I removed to this uncomfortable and desolate room on the same floor with the apartment in which Charke had met his death and with no window commanding the front of the house and no view but the deep and weed choked court that looked like a deserted churchyard in a city I suppose I may go to my own room I said Not to day my dear cheaile for it was all disarrange when we go way twill be ready again in two three days Where is Mary Quince I asked Mary Quince she has follow us to France said Madame making what in Ireland they call a bull They are not sure where they will go or what will do for day or two more I will go and get breakfast Adieu for a moment Madame was out of the door as she said this and I thought I heard the key turn in the lock CHAPTER LXII A WELL KNOWN FACE LOOKS IN You who have never experienced it can have no idea how angry and frightened you become under the sinister insult of being locked into a room as on trying the door I found I was The key was in the lock I could see it through the hole I called after Madame I shook at the solid oak door beat upon it with my hands kicked it but all to no purpose I rushed into the next room forgetting if indeed I had observed it that there was no door from it upon the gallery I turned round in an angry and dismayed perplexity and like prisoners in romances examined the windows I was shocked and affrighted on discovering in reality what they occasionally find a series of iron bars crossing the window They were firmly secured in the oak woodwork of the window frame and each window was besides so compactly screwed down that it could not open This bedroom was converted into a prison A momentary hope flashed on me perhaps all the windows were secured alike But it was no such thing these gaol like precautions were confined to the windows to which I had access For a few minutes I felt quite distracted but I bethought me that I must now if ever control my terrors and exert whatever faculties I possessed I stood upon a chair and examined the oak work I thought I detected marks of new chiselling here and there The screws too looked new and they and the scars on the woodwork were freshly smeared over with some coloured stuff by way of disguise While I was making these observations I heard the key stealthily stirred I suspect that Madame wished to surprise me Her approaching step indeed was seldom audible she had the soft tread of the feline tribe I was standing in the centre of the room confronting her when she entered Why did you lock the door Madame I demanded She slipped in suddenly with an insidious smirk and locked the door hastily Hish whispered Madame raising her broad palm and then screwing in her cheeks she made an ogle over her shoulder in the direction of the passage Hish be quiate cheaile weel you and I weel tale you everything presently She paused with her ear laid to the door Now I can speak ma chere I weel tale a you there is bailiff in the house two three four soche impertinent fallows They have another as bad as themselve to make a leest of the furniture we most keep them out of these rooms dear Maud You left the key in the door on the outside I retorted that was not to keep them out but me in Madame Deed I leave the key in the door ejaculated Madame with both hands raised and such a genuine look of consternation as for a moment shook me It was the nature of this woman s deceptions that they often puzzled though they seldom convinced me I re ally think Maud all those so frequent changes and excite ments they weel overturn my poor head And the windows are secured with iron bars what are they for I whispered sternly pointing with my finger at these grim securities That is for more a than forty years when Sir Phileep Aylmer was to reside here and had this room for his children s nursery and was afraid they should fall out But if you look you will find these bars have been put here very recently the screws and marks are quite new Eendeed ejaculated Madame with prolonged emphasis in precisely the same consternation Why my dear they told a me down stair what I have tell a you when I ask the reason Late a me see And Madame mounted on a chair and made her scrutiny with much curiosity but could not agree with me as to the very recent date of the carpentry There is nothing I think so exasperating as that sort of falsehood which affects not to see what is quite palpable Do you mean to say Madame that you really think those chisellings and screws are forty years old How can I tell cheaile What does signify whether it is forty or only fourteen years Bah we av other theeng to theenk about Those villain men I am glad to see bar and bolt and lock and key at least to our room to keep soche faylows out At that moment a knock came to the door and Madame s nasal in moment answered promptly and she opened the door stealthily popping out her head Oh that is all right go you long no ting more go way Who s there I cried Hold a your tongue said Madame imperiously to the visitor whose voice I fancied I recognised go way Out slipped Madame again locking the door but this time she returned immediately bearing a tray with breakfast I think she fancied that I would perhaps attempt to break away and escape but I had no such thought at that moment She hastily set down the tray on the floor at the threshold locking the door as before My share of breakfast was a little tea but Madame s digestion was seldom disturbed by her sympathies and she ate voraciously During this process there was a silence unusual in her company but when her meal was ended she proposed a reconnaissance professing much uncertainty as to whether my Uncle had been arrested or not And in case the poor old gentleman be poot in what you call stone jug where are we to go my dear Maud to Knowl or to Elverston You must direct And so she disappeared turning the key in the door as before It was an old custom of hers locking herself in her room and leaving the key in the lock and the habit prevailed for she left it there again With a heavy heart I completed my simple toilet wondering all the while how much of Madame s story might be false and how much if any true Then I looked out upon the dingy courtyard below in its deep damp shadow and thought How could an assassin have scaled that height in safety and entered so noiselessly as not to awaken the slumbering gamester Then there were the iron bars across my window What a fool had I been to object to that security I was labouring hard to reassure myself and keep all ghastly suspicions at arm s length But I wished that my room had been to the front of the house with some view less dismal Lost in these ruminations of fear as I stood at the window I was startled by the sound of a sharp tread on the lobby and by the key turning in the lock of my door In a panic I sprang back into the corner and stood with my eyes fixed upon the door It opened a little and the black head of Meg Hawkes was introduced Oh Meg I cried thank God I guessed twas you Miss Maud I am feared Miss The miller s daughter was pale and her eyes I thought were red and swollen Oh Meg for God s sake what is it all I darn t come in The old un s gone down and locked the cross door and left me to watch They think I care nout about ye no more nor themselves I donna know all but summat more nor her They tell her nout she s so gi n to drink they say she s not safe an awful quarrelsome I hear a deal when fayther and Master Dudley be a talkin in the mill They think comin in an out I don t mind but I put one think an t other together An don t ye eat nor drink nout here Miss hide away this it s black enough but wholesome anyhow and she slipt a piece of a coarse loaf from under her apron Hide it mind Drink nout but the water in the jug there it s clean spring Oh Meg Oh Meg I know what you mean said I faintly Ay Miss I m feared they ll try it they ll try to make away wi ye somehow I m goin to your friends arter dark I darn t try it no sooner I ll git awa to Ellerston to your lady cousin and I ll bring em back wi me in a rin so keep a good hairt lass Meg Hawkes will stan to ye Ye were better to me than fayther and mother and a and she clasped me round the waist and buried her head in my dress an I ll gie my life for ye darling and if they hurt ye I ll kill myself She recovered her sterner mood quickly Not a word lass she said in her old tone Don t ye try to git away they ll kill ye ye can t do t Leave a to me It won t be whatever it is till two or three o clock in the morning I ll ha e them a here long afore so keep a brave heart there s a darling I suppose she heard or fancied she heard a step approaching for she said Hish Her pale wild face vanished the door shut quickly and softly and the key turned again in the lock Meg in her rude way had spoken softly almost under her breath but no prophecy shrieked by the Pythoness ever thundered so madly in the ears of the hearer I dare say that Meg fancied I was marvellously little moved by her words I felt my gaze grow intense and my flesh and bones literally freeze She did not know that every word she spoke seemed to burst like a blaze in my brain She had delivered her frightful warning and told her story coarsely and bluntly which in effect means distinctly and concisely and I dare say the announcement so made like a quick bold incision in surgery was more tolerable than the slow imperfect mangling which falters and recedes and equivocates with torture Madame was long away I sat down at the window and tried to appreciate my dreadful situation I was stupid the imagery was all frightful but I beheld it as we sometimes see horrors heads cut off and houses burnt in a dream and without the corresponding emotions It did not seem as if all this were really happening to me I remember sitting at the window and looking and blinking at the opposite side of the building like a person unable but striving to see an object distinctly and every minute pressing my hand to the side of my head and saying Oh it won t be it won t be Oh no never it could not be And in this stunned state Madame found me on her return But the valley of the shadow of death has its varieties of dread The horror of great darkness is disturbed by voices and illumed by sights There are periods of incapacity and collapse followed by paroxysms of active terror Thus in my journey during those long hours I found it agonies subsiding into lethargies and these breaking again into frenzy I sometimes wonder how I carried my reason safely through the ordeal Madame locked the door and amused herself with her own business without minding me humming little nasal snatches of French airs as she smirked on her silken purchases displayed in the daylight Suddenly it struck me that it was very dark considering how early it was I looked at my watch it seemed to me a great effort of concentration to understand it Four o clock it said Four o clock It would be dark at five night in one hour Madame what o clock is it Is it evening I cried with my hand to my forehead like a person puzzled Two three minutes past four It had five minutes to four when I came upstairs answered she without interrupting her examination of a piece of darned lace which she was holding close to her eyes at the window Oh Madame Madame I m frightened cried I with a wild and piteous voice grasping her arm and looking up as shipwrecked people may their last to heaven into her inexorable eyes Madame looked frightened too I thought as she stared into my face At last she said rather angrily and shaking her arm loose What you mean cheaile Oh save me Madame oh save me oh save me Madame I pleaded with the wild monotony of perfect terror grasping and clinging to her dress and looking up with an agonised face into the eyes of that shadowy Atropos Save a you indeed Save What niaiserie Oh Madame Oh dear Madame for God s sake only get me away get me from this and I ll do everything you ask me all my life I will indeed Madame I will Oh save me save me save me I was clinging to Madame as to my guardian angel in my agony And who told you cheaile you are in any danger demanded Madame looking down on me with a black and witchlike stare I am Madame I am in great danger Oh Madame think of me take pity on me I have none to help me there is no one but God and you Madame all this time viewed me with the same dismal stare like a sorceress reading futurity in my face Well maybe you are how can I tell Maybe your uncle is mad maybe you are mad You have been my enemy always why should I care Again I burst into wild entreaty and clasping her fast poured forth my supplications with the bitterness of death I have no confidence in you little Maud you are little rogue petite traitresse Reflect if you can how you av always treat Madame You av attempt to ruin me you conspire with the bad domestics at Knowl to destroy me and you expect me here to take a your part You would never listen to me you ad no mercy for me you join to hunt me away from your house like wolf Well what you expect to find me now Bah This terrific Bah with a long nasal yell of scorn rang in my ears like a clap of thunder I say you are mad petite insolente to suppose I should care for you more than the poor hare it will care for the hound more than the bird who has escape will love the oiseleur I do not care I ought not care It is your turn to suffer Lie down on your bed there and suffer quaitely CHAPTER LXIII SPICED CLARET I did not lie down but I despaired I walked round and round the room wringing my hands in utter distraction I threw myself at the bedside on my knees I could not pray I could only shiver and moan with hands clasped and eyes of horror turned up to heaven I think Madame was in her malignant way perplexed That some evil was intended me I am sure she was persuaded but I dare say Meg Hawkes had said rightly in telling me that she was not fully in their secrets The first paroxysm of despair subsided into another state All at once my mind was filled with the idea of Meg Hawkes her enterprise and my chances of escape There is one point at which the road to Elverston makes a short ascent there is a sudden curve there two great ash trees with a roadside stile between at the right side covered with ivy Driving back and forward I did not recollect having particularly remarked this point in the highway but now it was before me in the thin light of the thinnest segment of moon and the figure of Meg Hawkes her back toward me always ascending towards Elverston It was constantly the same picture the same motion without progress the same dreadful suspense and impatience I was now sitting on the side of the bed looking wistfully across the room When I did not see Meg Hawkes I beheld Madame darkly eyeing first one then another point of the chamber evidently puzzling over some problem and in one of her most savage moods sometimes muttering to herself sometimes protruding and sometimes screwing up her great mouth She went into her own room where she remained I think nearly ten minutes and on her return there was that in the flash of her eyes the glow of her face and the peculiar fragrance that surrounded her that showed she had been partaking of her favourite restorative I had not moved since she left my room She paused about the middle of the floor and looked at me with what I can only describe as her wild beast stare You are a very secrete family you Ruthyns you are so coning I hate the coning people By my faith I weel see mister Silas Ruthyn and ask wat he mean I heard him tell old Wyat that mister Dudley is gone away to night He shall tell me everything or else I weel make echec et mat aussi vrai que je vis Madame s words had hardly ceased when I was again watching Meg Hawkes on the steep road mounting but never reaching the top of the acclivity on the way to Elverston and mentally praying that she might be brought safely there Vain prayer of an agonised heart Meg s journey was already frustrated she was not to reach Elverston in time Madame revisited her apartment and returned not I think improved in temper She walked about the room hustling the scanty furniture hither and thither as she encountered it She kicked her empty box out of her way with a horrid crash and a curse in French She strode and swaggered round the room muttering all the way and turning the corners of her course with a furious whisk At last out of the door she went I think she fancied she had not been sufficiently taken into confidence as to what was intended for me It was now growing late and yet no succour I was seized I remember with a dreadful icy shivering I was listening for signals of deliverance At ever distant sound half stifled with a palpitation these sounds piercing my ear with a horrible and exaggerated distinctness Oh Meg Oh cousin Monica Oh come Oh Heaven have mercy Lord have mercy I thought I heard a roaring and jangle of voices Perhaps it came from Uncle Silas s room It might be the tipsy violence of Madame It might merciful Heaven be the arrival of friends I started to my feet I listened quivering with attention Was it in my brain was it real I was at the door and it seemed to open of itself Madame had forgotten to lock it she was losing her head a little by this time The key stood in the gallery door beyond it too was open I fled wildly There was a subsiding sound of voices in my uncle s room I was I know not how on the lobby at the great stair head outside my uncle s apartment My hand was on the banisters my foot on the first step when below me and against the faint light that glimmered through the great window on the landing I saw a bulky human form ascending and a voice said Hush I staggered back and at that instant fancied with a thrill of conviction I heard Lady Knollys s voice in Uncle Silas room I don t know how I entered the room I was there like a ghost I was frightened at my own state Lady Knollys was not there no one but Madame and my guardian I can never forget the look that Uncle Silas fixed on me as he cowered seemingly as appalled as I I think I must have looked like a phantom newly risen from the grave What s that where do you come from whispered he Death death was my whispered answer as I froze with terror where I stood What does she mean what does all this mean said Uncle Silas recovering wonderfully and turning with a withering sneer on Madame Do you think it right to disobey my plain directions and let her run about the house at this hour Death death Oh pray to God for you and me I whispered in the same dreadful tones My uncle stared strangely at me again and after several horrible seconds in which he seemed to have recovered himself he said sternly and coolly You give too much place to your imagination niece Your spirits are in an odd state you ought to have advice Oh uncle pity me Oh uncle you are good you re kind you re kind when you think You could not you could not could not Oh think of your brother that was always so good to you He sees me here He sees us both Oh save me uncle save me and I ll give up everything to you I ll pray to God to bless you I ll never forget your goodness and mercy But don t keep me in doubt If I m to go oh for God s sake shoot me now You were always odd niece I begin to fear you are insane he replied in the same stern icy tone Oh uncle oh am I Am I mad I hope not but you ll conduct yourself like a sane person if you wish to enjoy the privileges of one Then with his finger pointing at me he turned to Madame and said in a tone of suppressed ferocity What s the meaning of this why is she here Madame was gabbling volubly but to me it was only a shrilly noise My whole soul was concentrated in my uncle the arbiter of my life before whom I stood in the wildest agony of supplication That night was dreadful The people I saw dizzily made of smoke or shining vapour smiling or frowning I could have passed my hand through them They were evil spirits There s no ill intended you by there s none said my uncle for the first time violently agitated Madame told you why we ve changed your room You told her about the bailiffs did not you with a stamp of fury he demanded of Madame whose nasal roullades of talk were running on like a accompaniment all the time She had told me indeed only a few hours since and now it sounded to me like the echo of something heard a month ago or more You can t go about the house d n it with bailiffs in occupation There now there s the whole thing Get to your room Maud and don t vex me There s a good girl He was trying to smile as he spoke these last words and with quavering soft tones to quiet me but the old scowl was there the smile was corpse like and contorted and the softness of his tones was more dreadful than another man s ferocity There Madame she ll go quite gently and you can call if you want help Don t let it happen again Come Maud said Madame encircling but not hurting my arm with her grip let us go my friend I did go you will wonder as well you may as you may wonder at the docility with which strong men walk through the press room to the drop and thank the people of the prison for their civility when they bid them good bye and facilitate the fixing of the rope and adjusting of the cap Have you never wondered that they don t make a last battle for life with the unscrupulous energy of terror instead of surrendering it so gently in cold blood on a silent calculation the arithmetic of despair I went upstairs with Madame like a somnambulist I rather quickened my step as I drew near my room I went in and stood a phantom at the window looking into the dark quadrange A thin glimmering crescent hung in the frosty sky and all heaven was strewn with stars Over the steep roof at the other side spread on the dark azure of the night this glorious blazonry of the unfathomable Creator To me a dreadful scroll inexorable eyes the cloud of cruel witnesses looking down in freezing brightness on my prayers and agonies I turned about and sat down leaning my head upon my arms Then suddenly I sat up as for the first time the picture of Uncle Silas s littered room and the travelling bags and black boxes plied on the floor by his table the desk hat case umbrella coats rugs and mufflers all ready for a journey reached my brain and suggested thought The mise en scene had remained in every detail fixed upon my retina and how I wondered When is he going how soon Is he going to carry me away and place me in a madhouse Am I am I mad I began to think Is this all a dream or is it real I remembered how a thin polite gentleman with a tall grizzled head and a black velvet waistcoat came into the carriage on our journey and said a few words to me how Madame whispered him something and he murmured Oh very gently with raised eyebrows and a glance at me and thenceforward spoke no more to me only to Madame and at the next station carried his hat and other travelling chattels into another carriage Had she told him I was mad These horrid bars Madame always with me The direful hints that dropt from my uncle My own terrific sensations All these evidences revolved in my brain and presented themselves in turn like writings on a wheel of fire There came a knock to the door Oh Meg Was it she No old Wyat whispered Madame something about her room So Madame re entered with a little silver tray and flagon in her hands and a glass Nothing came from Uncle Silas in ungentlemanlike fashion Drink Maud said Madame raising the cover and evidently enjoying the fragrant steam I could not I might have done so had I been able to swallow anything for I was too distracted to think of Meg s warning Madame suddenly recollected her mistake of that evening and tried the door but it was duly locked She took the key from her pocket and placed it in her breast You weel av these rooms to yourself ma chere I shall sleep downstairs to night She poured out some of the hot claret into the glass abstractedly and drank it off Tis very good I drank without theenk Bote tis very good Why don t you drink some I could not I repeated And Madame boldly helped herself Vary polite certally to Madame was it to send nothing at all for hair so she pronounced her bote is all same thing And so she ran on in her tipsy vein which was loud and sarcastic with a fierce laugh now and then Afterwards I heard that they were afraid of Madame who was given to cross purposes and violent in her cups She had been noisy and quarrelsome downstairs She was under the delusion that I was to be conveyed away that night to a remote and safe place and she was to be handsomely compensated for services and evidence to be afterwards given She was not to be trusted however with the truth That was to be known but to three people on earth I never knew but I believe that the spiced claret which Madame drank was drugged She was a person who could I have been told Drink a great deal without exhibiting any change from it but an inflamed colour and furious temper I can only state for certain what I saw and that was that shortly after she had finished the claret she laid down upon my bed and I now know fell asleep I then thought she was feigning sleep only and that she was really watching me About an hour after this I suddenly heard a little clink in the yard beneath I peeped out but saw nothing The sound was repeated however sometimes more frequently sometimes at long intervals At last in the deep shadow next the farther wall I thought I could discover a figure sometimes erect sometimes stooping and bowing toward the earth I could see this figure only in the rudest outline mingling with the dark Like a thunderbolt it smote my brain They are making my grave After the first dreadful stun I grew quite wild and ran up and down the room wringing my hands and gasping prayers to heaven Then a calm stole over me such a dreadful calm as I could fancy glide over one who floated in a boat under the shadow of the Traitor s Gate leaving life and hope and trouble behind Shortly after there came a very low tap at my door then another like a tiny post knock I could never understand why it was I made no answer Had I done so and thus shown that I was awake it might have sealed my fate I was standing in the middle of the floor staring at the door which I expected to see open and admit I knew not what troop of spectres CHAPTER LXIV THE HOUR OF DEATH It was a very still night and frosty My candle had long burnt out There was still a faint moonlight which fell in a square of yellow on the floor near the window leaving the rest of the room in what to an eye less accustomed than mine had become to that faint light would have been total darkness Now I am sure I heard a soft whispering outside my door I knew that I was in a state of siege The crisis was come and strange to say I felt myself grow all at once resolute and self possessed It was not a subsidence however of the dreadful excitement but a sudden screwing up of my nerves to a pitch such as I cannot describe I suppose the people outside moved with great caution and the perfect solidity of the floor which had not anywhere a creaking board in it favoured their noiseless movements It was well for me that there were in the house three persons whom it was part of their plan to mystify respecting my fate This alone compelled the extreme caution of their proceedings They suspected that I had placed furniture against the door and were afraid to force it lest a crash a scream perhaps a long and shrilly struggle might follow I remained for a space which I cannot pretend to estimate in the same posture afraid to stir afraid to move my eye from the door A very peculiar grating sound above my head startled me from my watch something of the character of sawing only more crunching and with a faint continued rumble in it utterly inexplicable It sounded over that portion of the roof which was farthest from the door toward which I now glided and as I took my stand under cover of the projecting angle of a clumsy old press that stood close by it I perceived the room a little darkened and I saw a man descend and take his stand upon the window stone He let go a rope which however was still fast round his body and employed both his hands with apparently some exertion about something at the side of the window which in a moment more in one mass bars and all swung noiselessly open admitting the frosty night air and the man whom I now distinctly saw to be Dudley Ruthyn kneeled on the sill and stept after a moment s listening into the room His foot made no sound upon the floor his head was bare and he wore his usual short shooting jacket I cowered to the ground in my post of observation He stood as it seemed to me irresolutely for a moment and then drew from his pocket an instrument which I distinctly saw against the faint moonlight Imagine a hammer one end of which had been beaten out into a longish tapering spike with a handle something longer than usual He drew stealthily to the window and seemed to examine this hurriedly and tested its strength with a twist or two of his hand And then he adjusted it very carefully in his grasp and made two or three little experimental picks with it in the air I remained perfectly still with a terrible composure crouched in my hiding place my teeth clenched and prepared to struggle like a tigress for my life when discovered I thought his next measure would be to light a match I saw a lantern I fancied on the window sill But this was not his plan He stole in a groping way which seemed strange to me who could distinguish objects in this light to the side of my bed the exact position of which he evidently knew he stooped over it Madame was breathing in the deep respiration of heavy sleep Suddenly but softly he laid as it seemed to me his left hand over her face and nearly at the same instant there came a scrunching blow an unnatural shriek beginning small and swelling for two or three seconds into a yell such as are imagined in haunted houses accompanied by a convulsive sound as of the motion of running and the arms drumming on the bed and then another blow and with a horrid gasp he recoiled a step or two and stood perfectly still I heard a horrible tremor quivering through the joints and curtains of the bedstead the convulsions of the murdered woman It was a dreadful sound like the shaking of a tree and rustling of leaves Then once more he steps to the side of the bed and I heard another of those horrid blows and silence and another and more silence and the diabolical surgery was ended For a few seconds I think I was on the point of fainting but a gentle stir outside the door close to my ear startled me and proved that there had been a watcher posted outside There was a little tapping at the door Who s that whispered Dudley hoarsely A friend answered a sweet voice And a key was introduced the door quickly unlocked and Uncle Silas entered I saw that frail tall white figure the venerable silver locks that resembled those upon the honoured head of John Wesley and his thin white hand the back of which hung so close to my face that I feared to breathe I could see his fingers twitching nervously The smell of perfumes and of ether entered the room with him Dudley was trembling now like a man in an ague fit Look what you made me do he said maniacally Steady sir said the old man close beside me Yes you damned old murderer I ve a mind to do for you There Dudley like a dear boy don t give way it s done Right or wrong we can t help it You must be quiet said the old man with a stern gentleness Dudley groaned Whoever advised it you re a gainer Dudley said Uncle Silas Then there was a pause I hope that was not heard said Uncle Silas Dudley walked to the window and stood there Come Dudley you and Hawkes must use expedition You know you must get that out of the way I ve done too much I won t do nout I ll not touch it I wish my hand was off first I wish I was a soger Do as ye like you an Hawkes I won t go nigh it damn ye both and that and he hurled the hammer with all his force upon the floor Come come be reasonable Dudley dear boy There s nothing to fear but your own folly You won t make a noise Oh oh my God said Dudley hoarsely and wiped his forehead with his open hand There now you ll be all well in a minute continued the old man You said twouldn t hurt her If I d a known she d a screeched like that I d never a done it Twas a damn lie You re the damndest villain on earth Come Dudley said the old man under his breath but very sternly make up your mind If you don t choose to go on it can t be helped only it s a pity you began For you it is a good deal it does not much matter for me Ay for you echoed Dudley through his set teeth The old talk Well sir snarled the old man in the same low tones you should have thought of all this before It s only taking leave of the world a year or two sooner but a year or two s something I ll leave you to do as you please Stop will you Stop here I know it s a fixt thing now If a fella does a thing he s damned for you might let him talk a bit anyhow I don t care much if I was shot There now there just stick to that and don t run off again There s a box and a bag here we must change the direction and take them away The box has some jewels Can you see them I wish we had a light No I d rayther not I can see well enough I wish we were out o this Here s the box Pull it to the window said the old man to my inexpressible relief advancing at last a few steps Coolness was given me in that dreadful moment and I knew that all depended on my being prompt and resolute I stood up swiftly I often thought if I had happened to wear silk instead of the cachmere I had on that night its rustle would have betrayed me I distinctly saw the tall stooping figure of my uncle and the outline of his venerable tresses as he stood between me and the dull light of the window like a shape cut in card He was saying just to there and pointing with his long arm at that contracting patch of moonlight which lay squared upon the floor The door was about a quarter open and just as Dudley began to drag Madame s heavy box with my jewel case in it across the floor from her room inhaling a great breath with a mental prayer for help I glided on tiptoe from the room and found myself on the gallery floor I turned to my right simply by chance and followed a long gallery in the dark not running I was too fearful of making the least noise but walking with the tiptoe swiftness of terror At the termination of this was a cross gallery one end of which that to my left terminated in a great window through which the dusky night view was visible With the instinct of terror I chose the darker and turned again to my right hurrying through this long and nearly dark passage I was terrified by a light about thirty feet before me emerging from the ceiling In spotted patches this light fell through the door and sides of a stable lantern and showed me a ladder down which from an open skylight I suppose for the cool night air floated in my face came Dickon Hawkes notwithstanding his maimed condition with so much celerity as to leave me hardly a moment for consideration He sat on the last round of the ladder and tightened the strap of his wooden leg At my left was a door case open but no door I entered it was a short passage about six feet long leading perhaps to a backstair but the door at the end was locked I was forced to stand in this recess then which afforded no shelter while Pegtop stumped by with his lantern in his hand I fancy he had some idea of listening to his master unperceived for he stopped close to my hiding place blew out the candle and pinched the long snuff with his horny finger and thumb Having listened for a few seconds he stumped stealthily along the gallery which I had just traversed and turned the corner in the direction of the chamber where the crime had just been committed and the discovery was impending I could see him against the broad window which in the daytime lighted this long passage and the moment he had passed the corner I resumed my flight I descended a stair corresponding with that backstair as I am told up which Madame had led me only the night before I tried the outer door To my wild surprise it was open In a moment I was upon the step in the free air and as instantaneously was seized by the arm in the gripe of a man It was Tom Brice who had already betrayed me and who was now in surtout and hat waiting to drive the carriage with the guilty father and son from the scene of their abhorred outrage CHAPTER LXV IN THE OAK PARLOUR So it was vain I was trapped and all was over I stood before him on the step the white moon shining on my face I was trembling so that I wonder I could stand my helpless hands raised towards him and I looked up in his face A long shuddering moan Oh oh oh was all I uttered The man still holding my arm looked I thought frightened into my white dumb face Suddenly he said in a wild fierce whisper Never say another word I had not uttered one They shan t hurt ye Miss git ye in I don t care a damn It was an uncouth speech To me it was the voice of an angel With a burst of gratitude that sounded in my own ears like a laugh I thanked God for those blessed words In a moment more he had placed me in the carriage and almost instantly we were in motion very cautiously while crossing the court until he had got the wheels upon the grass and then at a rapid pace improving his speed as the distance increased He drove along the side of the back approach to the house keeping on the grass so that our progress though swaying like that of a ship in a swell was very nearly as noiseless The gate had been left unlocked he swung it open and remounted the box And we were now beyond the spell of Bartram Haugh thundering Heaven be praised along the Queen s highway right in the route to Elverston It was literally a gallop Through the chariot windows I saw Tom stand as he drove and every now and then throw an awful glance over his shoulder Were we pursued Never was agony of prayer like mine as with clasped hands and wild stare I gazed through the windows on the road whose trees and hedges and gabled cottages were chasing one another backward at so giddy a speed We were now ascending that identical steep with the giant ash trees at the right and the stile between which my vision of Meg Hawkes had presented all that night when my excited eye detected a running figure within the hedge I saw the head of some one crossing the stile in pursuit and I heard Brice s name shrieked Drive on on on I screamed But Brice pulled up I was on my knees on the floor of the carriage with clasped hands expecting capture when the door opened and Meg Hawkes pale as death her cloak drawn over her black tresses looked in Oh ho ho thank God she screamed Shake hands lass Tom yer a good un He s a good lad Tom Come in Meg you must sit by me I said recovering all at once Meg made no demur Take my hand I said offering mine to her disengaged one I can t Miss my arm s broke And so it was poor thing She had been espied and overtaken in her errand of mercy for me and her ruffian father had felled her with his cudgel and then locked her into the cottage whence however she had contrived to escape and was now flying to Elverston having tried in vain to get a hearing in Feltram whose people had been for hours in bed The door being shut upon Meg the steaming horses were instantly at a gallop again Tom was still watching as before with many an anxious glance to rearward for pursuit Again he pulled up and came to the window Oh what is it cried I Bout that letter Miss I couldn t help Twas Dickon he found it in my pocket That s a Oh yes no matter thank you thank Heaven Are we near Elverston Twill be a mile Miss and please m to mind I had no finger in t Thanks thank you you re very good I shall always thank you Tom as long as I live At length we entered Elverston I think I was half wild I don t know how I got into the hall I was in the oak parlour I believe when I saw cousin Monica I was standing my arms extended I could not speak but I ran with a loud long scream into her arms I forget a great deal after that CONCLUSION Oh my beloved cousin Monica Thank Heaven you are living still and younger I think than I in all things but in years And Milly my dear companion she is now the happy wife of that good little clergyman Sprigge Biddlepen It has been in my power to be of use to them and he shall have the next presentation to Dawling Meg Hawkes proud and wayward and the most affectionate creature on earth was married to Tom Brice a few months after these events and as both wished to emigrate I furnished them with the capital and I am told they are likely to be rich I hear from my kind Meg often and she seems very happy My dear old friends Mary Quince and missus Rusk are alas growing old but living with me and very happy And after long solicitation I persuaded Doctor Bryerly the best and truest of ministers with my dearest friend s concurrence to undertake the management of the Derbyshire estates In this I have been most fortunate He is the very person for such a charge so punctual so laborious so kind and so shrewd In compliance with medical advice cousin Monica hurried me away to the Continent where she would never permit me to allude to the terrific scenes which remain branded so awfully on my brain It needed no constraint It is a sort of agony to me even now to think of them The plan was craftily devised Neither old Wyat nor Giles the butler had a suspicion that I had returned to Bartram Had I been put to death the secret of my fate would have been deposited in the keeping of four persons only the two Ruthyns Hawkes and ultimately Madame My dear cousin Monica had been artfully led to believe in my departure for France and prepared for my silence Suspicion might not have been excited for a year after my death and then would never in all probability have pointed to Bartram as the scene of the crime The weeds would have grown over me and I should have lain in that deep grave where the corpse of Madame de la Rougierre was unearthed in the darksome quadrangle of Bartram Haugh It was more than two years after that I heard what had befallen at Bartram after my flight Old Wyat who went early to Uncle Silas s room to her surprise for he had told her that he was that night to accompany his son who had to meet the mailtrain to Derby at five o clock in the morning saw her old master lying on the sofa much in his usual position There was nout much strange about him old Wyat said but that his scent bottle was spilt on its side over on the table and he dead She thought he was not quite cold when she found him and she sent the old butler for Doctor Jolks who said he died of too much loddlum Of my wretched uncle s religion what am I to say Was it utter hypocrisy or had it at any time a vein of sincerity in it I cannot say I don t believe that he had any heart left for religion which is the highest form of affection to take hold of Perhaps he was a sceptic with misgivings about the future but past the time for finding anything reliable in it The devil approached the citadel of his heart by stealth with many zigzags and parallels The idea of marrying me to his son by fair means then by foul and when that wicked chance was gone then the design of seizing all by murder supervened I dare say that Uncle Silas thought for a while that he was a righteous man He wished to have heaven and to escape hell if there were such places But there were other things whose existence was not speculative of which some he coveted and some he dreaded more and temptation came Now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble every man s work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man s work of what sort it is There comes with old age a time when the heart is no longer fusible or malleable and must retain the form in which it has cooled down He that is unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still Dudley had disappeared but in one of her letters Meg writing from her Australian farm says There s a fella in toon as calls hisself Colbroke wi a good hoose o wood fifteen foot length and as by bout as silling o the pearler o Bartram only lots o rats they do say my lady a bying and sellin of goold back and forred wi the diggin foke and the marchants His chick and mouth be wry wi scar o burns or vitterel an no wiskers bless you but my Tom ee toll him he knowed him for Master Doodley I ant seed him but he sade ad shute Tom soon is look at im an denide it wi mouthful o curses and oaf Tom baint right shure if I seed un wons i d no for sartin but appen twil best be let be This was all Old Hawkes stood his ground relying on the profound cunning with which their actual proceedings had been concealed even from the suspicions of the two inmates of the house and on the mystery that habitually shrouded Bartram Haugh and all its belongings from the eyes of the outer world Strangely enough he fancied that I had made my escape long before the room was entered and even if he were arrested there was no evidence he was certain to connect him with the murder all knowledge of which he would stoutly deny There was an inquest on the body of my uncle and doctor Jolks was the chief witness They found that his death was caused by an excessive dose of laudanum accidentally administered by himself It was not until nearly a year after the dreadful occurrences at Bartram that Dickon Hawkes was arrested on a very awful charge and placed in gaol It was an old crime committed in Lancashire that had found him out After his conviction as a last chance he tried a disclosure of all the circumstances of the unsuspected death of the Frenchwoman Her body was discovered buried where he indicated in the inner court of Bartram Haugh and after due legal enquiry was interred in the churchyard of Feltram Thus I escaped the horrors of the witness box or the far worse torture of a dreadful secret Doctor Bryerly shortly after Lady Knollys had described to him the manner in which Dudley entered my room visited the house of Bartram Haugh and minutely examined the windows of the room in which mister Charke had slept on the night of his murder One of these he found provided with powerful steel hinges very craftily sunk and concealed in the timber of the window frame which was secured by an iron pin outside and swung open on its removal This was the room in which they had placed me and this the contrivance by means of which the room had been entered The problem of mister Charke s murder was solved I have penned it I sit for a moment breathless My hands are cold and damp I rise with a great sigh and look out on the sweet green landscape and pastoral hills and see the flowers and birds and the waving boughs of glorious trees all images of liberty and safety and as the tremendous nightmare of my youth melts into air I lift my eyes in boundless gratitude to the God of all comfort whose mighty hand and outstretched arm delivered me When I lower my eyes and unclasp my hands my cheeks are wet with tears A tiny voice is calling me Mamma and a beloved smiling face with his dear father s silken brown tresses peeps in Yes darling our walk Come away I am Lady Ilbury happy in the affection of a beloved and noblehearted husband The shy useless girl you have known is now a mother trying to be a good one and this the last pledge has lived I am not going to tell of sorrows how brief has been my pride of early maternity or how beloved were those whom the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away But sometimes as smiling on my little boy the tears gather in my eyes and he wonders I can see why they come I am thinking and trembling while I smile to think how strong is love how frail is life and rejoicing while I tremble that in the deathless love of those who mourn the Lord of Life who never gave a pang in vain conveys the sweet and ennobling promise of a compensation by eternal reunion So through my sorrows I have heard a voice from heaven say Write from hencefore blessed are the dead that die in the Lord This world is a parable the habitation of symbols the phantoms of spiritual things immortal shown in material shape May the blessed second sight be mine to recognise under these beautiful forms of earth the ANGELS who wear them for I am sure we may walk with them if we will
