Illustrated by WALTER BOBBETT Chicago A C McClurg company nineteen oh one TO MY READERS Thirty years ago Central Africa was what people who are fond of airing their learning would call a terra incognita To day its general characteristics are pretty well known Then as now the little island of Zanzibar situated just south of the equator on the east coast was the starting place of all expeditions into the interior and Unguja pronounced Oon goo jah the big town of that island the place where the preparations for plunging into the unknown were made At that period these expeditions consisted almost without exception of caravans loaded with beads and cotton cloth which were exchanged among the inland tribes for elephants tusks and slaves for Unguja boasted the only and the last open slave market in the world then The few exceptions were a would be discoverer now and then or a party of rich white men going to hunt big game that is travelling hundreds aye thousands of miles and enduring many hardships for the momentary pleasure of holding a gun in such a position that when they pulled the trigger the bullet hit such a prominent mark as an elephant or a lion which was living in its natural surroundings and interfering with no one Between you and me I don t mind remarking that many of their expeditions ended on their return to Unguja in the purchase of a few elephants tusks and wild animal skins in the bazaars of that thriving city after the method pursued by unsuccessful anglers in civilized countries But even the most successful of these hunters by reason of having followed the few beaten paths known to their guides never came within miles of such wonderful animals as those described by the tribesmen from the very center of the dark continent If you have read any accounts of adventure in Africa you will know that travelers never mention animals of any kind that are gifted with the faculty of speech or gazelles that are overseers for native princes or hares that eat flesh No indeed only the native born know of these and judging by the immense and rapid strides civilization is making in those parts it will not be long before such wonderful specimens of zoology will be as extinct as the ichthyosaurus dinornis and other poor creatures who never dreamed of the awful names that would be applied to them when they were too long dead to show their resentment As to the truth of these tales I can only say that they were told to me in Zanzibar by negroes whose ancestors told them to them who had received them from their ancestors and so back so that the praise for their accuracy or the blame for their falsity lies with the first ancestor who set them going You may think uncivilized negroes are pretty ignorant people but the white man who is supposed to have first told the story of The House that Jack Built was a mighty poor genius compared with the unknown originator of Goso the Teacher who found even inanimate things that were endowed with speech which the pupils readily understood and were not astonished to hear while Puss in Boots was not one half so clever as the gazelle that ran things for Haamdaanee It would be a severe task to rattle off Goso as you do The House that Jack Built Don t stumble over the names in these tales they are very easy Every one is pronounced exactly as it is spelled and the accent is always on the last syllable but one as Poon dah the donkey Haam daa nee et cetera Finally if the perusal of these tales interests you as much as their narration and translation interested me

time Kee ma the monkey and Pa pa the shark became great friends The monkey lived in an immense mkooyoo tree which grew by the margin of the sea half of its branches being over the water and half over the land Every morning when the monkey was breakfasting on the kooyoo nuts the shark would put in an appearance under the tree and call out Throw me some food my friend with which request the monkey complied most willingly This continued for many months until one day Papa said Keema you have done me many kindnesses I would like you to go with me to my home that I may repay you How can I go said the monkey we land beasts can not go about in the water Don t trouble yourself about that replied the shark I will carry you Not a drop of water shall get to you Oh all right then said mister Keema let s go When they had gone about half way the shark stopped and said You are my friend I will tell you the truth Why what is there to tell asked the monkey with surprise Well you see the fact is that our sultan is very sick and we have been told that the only medicine that will do him any good is a monkey s heart Well exclaimed Keema you were very foolish not to tell me that before we started How so asked Papa But the monkey was busy thinking up some means of saving himself and made no reply Well said the shark anxiously why don t you speak Oh I ve nothing to say now It s too late But if you had told me this before we started I might have brought my heart with me What haven t you your heart here Huh ejaculated Keema don t you know about us When we go out we leave our hearts in the trees and go about with only our bodies But I see you don t believe me You think I m scared Come on let s go to your home where you can kill me and search for my heart in vain The shark did believe him though and exclaimed Oh no let s 
7594_101832_000038_000001	train-clean-360	go back 
none	none	and get your heart Indeed no protested Keema let us go on to your home But the shark insisted that they should go back get the heart and start afresh At last with great apparent reluctance the monkey consented grumbling sulkily at the unnecessary trouble he was being put to When they got back to the tree he climbed up in a great hurry calling out Wait there Papa my friend while I get my heart and we ll start off properly next time When he had got well up among the branches he sat down and kept quite still After waiting what he considered a reasonable length of time the shark called Come along Keema But Keema just kept still and said nothing In a little while he called again Oh Keema let s be going At this the monkey poked his head out from among the upper branches and asked in great surprise Going Where To my home of course Are you mad queried Keema Mad Why what do you mean cried Papa What s the matter with you said the monkey Do you take me for a washerman s donkey What peculiarity is there about a washerman s donkey It is a creature that has neither heart nor ears The shark his curiosity overcoming his haste thereupon begged to be told the story of the washerman s donkey which the monkey related as follows A washerman owned a donkey of which he was very fond One day however it ran away and took up its abode in the forest where it led a lazy life and consequently grew very fat At length Soongoo ra the hare by chance passed that way and saw Poon da the donkey Now the hare is the most cunning of all beasts if you look at his mouth you will see that he is always talking to himself about everything So when Soongoora saw Poonda he said to himself My this donkey is fat Then he went and told Sim ba the lion As Simba was just recovering from a severe illness he was still so weak that he could not go hunting He was consequently pretty hungry Said mister Soongoora I ll bring enough meat to morrow for both of us to have a great feast but you ll have to do the killing All right good friend exclaimed Simba joyfully you re very kind So the hare scampered off to the forest found the donkey and said to her in his most courtly manner Miss Poonda I am sent to ask your hand in marriage By whom simpered the donkey By Simba the lion The donkey was greatly elated at this and exclaimed Let s go at once This is a first class offer They soon arrived at the lion s home were cordially invited in and sat down Soongoora gave Simba a signal with his eyebrow to the effect that this was the promised feast and that he would wait outside Then he said to Poonda I must leave you for a while to attend to some private business You stay here and converse with your husband that is to be As soon as Soongoora got outside the lion sprang at Poonda and they had a great fight Simba was kicked very hard and he struck with his claws as well as his weak health would permit him At last the donkey threw the lion down and ran away to her home in the forest Shortly after the hare came back and called Haya Simba have you got it I have not got it growled the lion she kicked me and ran away but I warrant you I made her feel pretty sore though I m not strong Oh well remarked Soongoora don t put yourself out of the way about it Then Soongoora waited many days until the lion and the donkey were both well and strong when he said What do you think now Simba Shall I bring you your meat Ay growled the lion fiercely bring it to me I ll tear it in two pieces So the hare went off to the forest where the donkey welcomed him and asked the news You are invited to call again and see your lover said Soongoora Oh dear cried Poonda that day you took me to him he scratched me awfully I m afraid to go near him now Ah pshaw said Soongoora that s nothing That s only Simba s way of caressing Oh well said the donkey let s go So off they started again but as soon as the lion caught sight of Poonda he sprang upon her and tore her in two pieces When the hare came up Simba said to him Take this meat and roast it As for myself all I want is the heart and ears Thanks said Soongoora Then he went away and roasted the meat in a place where the lion could not see him and he took the heart and ears and hid them Then he ate all the meat he needed and put the rest away Presently the lion came to him and said Bring me the heart and ears Where are they said the hare What does this mean growled Simba Why didn t you know this was a washerman s donkey Well what s that to do with there being no heart or ears For goodness sake Simba aren t you old enough to know that if this beast had possessed a heart and ears it wouldn t have come back the second time Of course the lion had to admit that what Soongoora the hare said was true And now said Keema to the shark you want to make a washerman s donkey of me Get out of there and go home by yourself You are not going to get me again and our friendship is ended Good bye Papa II THE HARE AND THE LION One day Soongoo ra the hare roaming through the forest in search of food glanced up through the boughs of a very large calabash tree and saw that a great hole in the upper part of the trunk was inhabited by bees thereupon he returned to town in search of some one to go with him and help to get the honey 
7594_101832_000005_000000	train-clean-360	As he was passing the house of Boo koo the big rat that worthy gentleman invited him in 
7594_101832_000005_000001	train-clean-360	So he went in sat down and remarked My father has died and has left me a hive of honey 
7594_101832_000005_000002	train-clean-360	I would like you to come and help me to eat it 
7594_101832_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Of course Bookoo jumped at the offer and he and the hare started off immediately 
none	none	When they arrived at the great calabash tree Soongoora pointed out the bees nest and said Go on climb up So taking some straw with them they climbed up to the nest lit the straw smoked out the bees put out the fire and set to work eating the honey 
7594_101832_000008_000000	train-clean-360	In the midst of the feast who should appear at the foot of the tree but Sim ba the lion 
7594_101832_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Looking up and seeing them eating he asked Who are you 
none	none	Then Soongoora whispered to Bookoo Hold your tongue that old fellow is crazy But in a very little while Simba roared out angrily Who are you I say 
7594_101832_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Speak I tell you 
7594_101832_000009_000002	train-clean-360	This made Bookoo so scared that he blurted out It s only us 
7594_101832_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Upon this the hare said to him You just wrap me up in this straw call to the lion to keep out of the way and then throw me down 
none	none	Then you ll see what will happen So Bookoo the big rat wrapped Soongoora the hare in the straw and then called to Simba the lion Stand back I m going to throw this straw down and then I ll come down myself When Simba stepped back out of the way Bookoo threw down the straw and as it lay on the ground Soongoora crept out and ran away while the lion was looking up 
7594_101832_000012_000000	train-clean-360	After waiting a minute or two Simba roared out Well come down I say and there being no help for it the big rat came down 
7594_101832_000013_000000	train-clean-360	As soon as he was within reach the lion caught hold of him and asked Who was up there with you 
none	none	Why said Bookoo Soongoora the hare 
7594_101832_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Didn t you see him when I threw him down 
7594_101832_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course I didn t see him replied the lion in an incredulous tone and without wasting further time he ate the big rat and then searched around for the hare but could not find him 
none	none	Three days later Soongoora called on his acquaintance Ko bay the tortoise and said to him Let us go and eat some honey
7594_101832_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Whose honey inquired Kobay cautiously 
none	none	My father s Soongoora replied
7594_101832_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh all right I m with you said the tortoise eagerly and away they went 
7594_101832_000020_000000	train-clean-360	When they arrived at the great calabash tree they climbed up with their straw smoked out the bees sat down and began to eat 
7594_101832_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Just then mister Simba who owned the honey came out again and looking up inquired Who are you up there 
none	none	Soongoora whispered to Kobay Keep quiet but when the lion repeated his question angrily Kobay became suspicious and said I will speak 
7594_101832_000022_000001	train-clean-360	You told me this honey was yours am I right in suspecting that it belongs to Simba 
7594_101832_000023_000000	train-clean-360	So when the lion asked again Who are you he answered It s only us The lion said Come down then and the tortoise answered We re coming 
none	none	Now Simba had been keeping an eye open for Soongoora since the day he caught Bookoo the big rat and suspecting that he was up there with Kobay he said to himself I ve got him this time sure Seeing that they were caught again Soongoora said to the tortoise Wrap me up in the straw tell Simba to stand out of the way and then throw me down 
7594_101832_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I ll wait for you below 
7594_101832_000025_000002	train-clean-360	He can t hurt you you know 
7594_101832_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 All right said Kobay but while he was wrapping the hare up he said to himself This fellow wants to run away and leave me to bear the lion s anger 
none	none	He shall get caught first Therefore when he had bundled him up he called out Soongoora is coming and threw him down So Simba caught the hare and holding him with his paw said Now what shall I do with you The hare replied It s of no use for you to try to eat me I m awfully tough What would be the best thing to do with you then asked Simba I think said Soongoora you should take me by the tail whirl me around and knock me against the ground Then you may be able to eat me 
7594_101832_000029_000000	train-clean-360	So the lion being deceived took him by the tail and whirled him around but just as he was going to knock him on the ground he slipped out of his grasp and ran away and Simba had the mortification of losing him again 
7594_101832_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Angry and disappointed he turned to the tree and called to Kobay You come down too 
7594_101832_000031_000000	train-clean-360	When the tortoise reached the ground the lion said You re pretty hard what can I do to make you eatable 
7594_101832_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s easy laughed Kobay just put me in the mud and rub my back with your paw until my shell comes off 
7594_101832_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Immediately on hearing this Simba carried Kobay to the water placed him in the mud and began as he supposed to rub his back but the tortoise had slipped away and the lion continued rubbing on a piece of rock until his paws were raw 
7594_101832_000033_000001	train-clean-360	When he glanced down at them he saw they were bleeding and realizing that he had again been outwitted he said Well the hare has done me to day but I ll go hunting now until I find him 
none	none	So Simba the lion set out immediately in search of Soongoora the hare and as he went along he inquired of every one he met Where is the house of Soongoora But each person he asked answered I do not know For the hare had said to his wife Let us remove from this house Therefore the folks in that neighborhood had no knowledge of his whereabouts Simba however went along continuing his inquiries until presently one answered That is his house on the top of the mountain 
7594_101832_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Without loss of time the lion climbed the mountain and soon arrived at the place indicated only to find that there was no one at home 
none	none	This however did not trouble him on the contrary saying to himself I ll hide myself inside and when Soongoora and his wife come home I ll eat them both he entered the house and lay down awaiting their arrival Pretty soon along came the hare with his wife not thinking of any danger but he very soon discovered the marks of the lion s paws on the steep path 
7594_101832_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Stopping at once he said to missus Soongoora You go back my dear 
7594_101832_000036_000002	train-clean-360	Simba the lion has passed this way and I think he must be looking for me 
7594_101832_000037_000000	train-clean-360	But she replied I will not go back I will follow you my husband 
none	none	Although greatly pleased at this proof of his wife s affection Soongoora said firmly No no you have friends to go to Go back 
7594_101832_000039_000000	train-clean-360	So he persuaded her and she went back but he kept on following the footmarks and saw as he had suspected that they went into his house 
none	none	Ah said he to himself mister 
7594_101832_000040_000001	train-clean-360	Lion is inside is he Then cautiously going back a little way he called out How d ye do house 
none	none	How d ye do Waiting a moment he remarked loudly Well this is very strange Every day as I pass this place I say How d ye do house and the house always answers How d ye do There must be some one inside to day When the lion heard this he called out How d ye do 
7594_101832_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Then Soongoora burst out laughing and shouted Oho mister Simba 
none	none	You re inside and I ll bet you want to eat me but first tell me where you ever heard of a house talking Upon this the lion seeing how he had been fooled replied angrily You wait until I get hold of you that s all
7594_101832_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I think you ll have to do the waiting cried the hare and then he ran away the lion following 
none	none	But it was of no use Soongoora completely tired out old Simba who saying That rascal has beaten me I don t want to have anything more to do with him returned to his home under the great calabash tree III THE LION THE HYENA AND THE RABBIT Once upon a time Sim ba the lion Fee see the hyena and Keetee tee the rabbit made up their minds to go in for a little farming So they went into the country made a garden planted all kinds of seeds and then came home and rested quite a while Then when the time came when their crops should be about ripe and ready for harvesting they began to say to each other Let s go over to the farm and see how our crops are coming along So one morning early they started and as the garden was a long way off Keeteetee the rabbit made this proposition While we are going to the farm let us not stop on the road and if any one does stop let him be eaten His companions not being so cunning as he and knowing they could outwalk him readily consented to this arrangement Well off they went but they had not gone very far when the rabbit stopped Hullo said Feesee the hyena Keeteetee has stopped He must be eaten That s the bargain agreed Simba the lion Well said the rabbit I happened to be thinking What about cried his partners with great curiosity I m thinking said he with a grave philosophical air about those two stones one big and one little the little one does not go up nor does the big one go down The lion and the hyena having stopped to look at the stones could only say Why really it s singular but it s just as you say and they all resumed their journey the rabbit being by this time well rested When they had gone some distance the rabbit stopped again Aha said Feesee Keeteetee has stopped again Now he must be eaten I rather think so assented Simba Well said the rabbit I was thinking again Their curiosity once more aroused his comrades begged him to tell them his think Why said he I was thinking this When people like us put on new coats where do the old ones go to Both Simba and Feesee having stopped a moment to consider the matter exclaimed together Well I wonder and the three went on the rabbit having again had a good rest After a little while the hyena thinking it about time to show off a little of his philosophy suddenly stopped Here growled Simba this won t do I guess we ll have to eat you Feesee Oh no said the hyena I m thinking What are you thinking about they inquired I m thinking about nothing at all said he imagining himself very smart and witty Ah pshaw cried Keeteetee we won t be fooled that way So he and Simba ate the hyena When they had finished eating their friend the lion and the rabbit proceeded on their way and presently came to a place where there was a cave and here the rabbit stopped H m ejaculated Simba I m not so hungry as I was this morning but I guess I ll have to find room for you little Keeteetee Oh I believe not replied Keeteetee I m thinking again Well said the lion what is it this time Said the rabbit I m thinking about that cave In olden times our ancestors used to go in here and go out there and I think I ll try and follow in their footsteps So he went in at one end and out at the other end several times Then he said to the lion Simba old fellow let s see you try to do that and the lion went into the cave but he stuck fast and could neither go forward nor back out In a moment Keeteetee was on Simba s back and began eating him After a little time the lion cried Oh brother be impartial come and eat some of the front part of me But the rabbit replied Indeed I can t come around in front I m ashamed to look you in the face So having eaten all he was able to he left the lion there and went and became sole owner of the farm and its crops IV THE KITES AND THE CROWS One day Koongoo roo sultan of the crows sent a letter to Mway way sultan of the kites containing these few words I want you folks to be my soldiers To this brief message Mwayway at once wrote this short reply I should say not Thereupon thinking to scare Mwayway the sultan of the crows sent him word If you refuse to obey me I ll make war upon you To which the sultan of the kites replied That suits me let us fight and if you beat us we will obey you but if we are victors you shall be our servants So they gathered their forces and engaged in a great battle and in a little while it became evident that the crows were being badly beaten As it appeared certain that if something were not done pretty quickly they would all be killed one old crow named Jeeoo see suddenly proposed that they should fly away Directly the suggestion was made it was acted upon and the crows left their homes and flew far away where they set up another town So when the kites entered the place they found no one there and they took up their residence in Crowtown One day when the crows had gathered in council Koongooroo stood up and said My people do as I command you and all will be well Pluck out some of my feathers and throw me into the town of the kites then come back and stay here until you hear from me Without argument or questioning the crows obeyed their sultan s command Koongooroo had lain in the street but a short time when some passing kites saw him and inquired threateningly What are you doing here in our town With many a moan he replied My companions have beaten me and turned me out of their town because I advised them to obey Mwayway sultan of the kites When they heard this they picked him up and took him before the sultan to whom they said We found this fellow lying in the street and he attributes his involuntary presence in our town to so singular a circumstance that we thought you should hear his story Koongooroo was then bidden to repeat his statement which he did adding the remark that much as he had suffered he still held to his opinion that Mwayway was his rightful sultan This of course made a very favorable impression and the sultan said You have more sense than all the rest of your tribe put together I guess you can stay here and live with us So Koongooroo expressing much gratitude settled down apparently to spend the remainder of his life with the kites One day his neighbors took him to church with them and when they returned home they asked him Who have the best kind of religion the kites or the crows To which crafty old Koongooroo replied with great enthusiasm Oh the kites by long odds This answer tickled the kites like anything and Koongooroo was looked upon as a bird of remarkable discernment When almost another week had passed the sultan of the crows slipped away in the night went to his own town and called his people together To morrow said he is the great annual religious festival of the kites and they will all go to church in the morning Go now and get some wood and some fire and wait near their town until I call you then come quickly and set fire to the church Then he hurried back to Mwayway s town The crows were very busy indeed all that night and by dawn they had an abundance of wood and fire at hand and were lying in wait near the town of their victorious enemies So in the morning every kite went to church There was not one person left at home except old Koongooroo When his neighbors called for him they found him lying down Why they exclaimed with surprise are you not going to church to day Oh said he I wish I could but my stomach aches so badly I can t move And he groaned dreadfully Ah poor fellow said they you will be better in bed and they left him to himself As soon as everybody was out of sight he flew swiftly to his soldiers and cried Come on they re all in the church Then they all crept quickly but quietly to the church and while some piled wood about the door others applied fire The wood caught readily and the fire was burning fiercely before the kites were aware of their danger but when the church began to fill with smoke and tongues of flame shot through the cracks they tried to escape through the windows The greater part of them however were suffocated or having their wings singed could not fly away and so were burned to death among them their sultan Mwayway and Koongooroo and his crows got their old town back again From that day to this the kites fly away from the crows V GOSO THE TEACHER Once there was a man named Go so who taught children to read not in a schoolhouse but under a calabash tree One evening while Goso was sitting under the tree deep in the study of the next day s lessons Paa the gazelle climbed up the tree very quietly to steal some fruit and in so doing shook off a calabash which in falling struck the teacher on the head and killed him When his scholars came in the morning and found their teacher lying dead they were filled with grief so after giving him a decent burial they agreed among themselves to find the one who had killed Goso and put him to death After talking the matter over they came to the conclusion that the south wind was the offender So they caught the south wind and beat it But the south wind cried Here I am Koo see the south wind Why are you beating me What have I done And they said Yes we know you are Koosee it was you who threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso You should not have done it But Koosee said If I were so powerful would I be stopped by a mud wall So they went to the mud wall and beat it But the mud wall cried Here I am Keeyambaa za the mud wall Why are you beating me What have I done And they said Yes we know you are Keeyambaaza it was you who stopped Koosee the south wind and Koosee the south wind threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso You should not have done it But Keeyambaaza said If I were so powerful would I be bored through by the rat So they went and caught the rat and beat it But the rat cried Here I am Paan ya the rat Why are you beating me What have I done And they said Yes we know you are Paanya it was you who bored through Keeyambaaza the mud wall which stopped Koosee the south wind and Koosee the south wind threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso You should not have done it But Paanya said If I were so powerful would I be eaten by a cat

the scholars said Ah he hasn t a word to say for himself This is the fellow who threw down the calabash that struck our teacher Goso We will kill him So they killed Paa the gazelle and avenged the death of their teacher VI THE APE THE SNAKE AND THE LION Long long ago there lived in a village called Keejee jee a woman whose husband died leaving her with a little baby boy She worked hard all day to get food for herself and child but they lived very poorly and were most of the time half starved When the boy whose name was Mvoo Laa na began to get big he said to his mother one day Mother we are always hungry 
4848_101836_000003_000001	train-clean-360	What work did my father do to support us 
4848_101836_000004_000000	train-clean-360	His mother replied Your father was a hunter 
4848_101836_000004_000001	train-clean-360	He set traps and we ate what he caught in them 
none	none	Oho said Mvoo Laana that s not work that s fun 
4848_101836_000005_000001	train-clean-360	I too will set traps and see if we can t get enough to eat 
none	none	The next day he went into the forest and cut branches from the trees and returned home in the evening The second day he spent making the branches into traps 
4848_101836_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The third day he twisted cocoanut fiber into ropes 
4848_101836_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The fourth day he set up as many traps as time would permit 
4848_101836_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The fifth day he set up the remainder of the traps 
none	none	The sixth day he went to examine the traps and they had caught so much game beside what they needed for themselves that he took a great quantity to the big town of Oongoo ja where he sold it and bought corn and other things and the house was full of food and as this good fortune continued he and his mother lived very comfortably But after a while when he went to his traps he found nothing in them day after day One morning however he found that an ape had been caught in one of the traps and he was about to kill it when it said Son of Adam I am Neea nee the ape do not kill me 
4848_101836_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Take me out of this trap and let me go 
none	none	Save me from the rain that I may come and save you from the sun some day So Mvoo Laana took him out of the trap and let him go When Neeanee had climbed up in a tree he sat on a branch and said to the youth For your kindness I will give you a piece of advice Believe me men are all bad Never do a good turn for a man if you do he will do you harm at the first opportunity The second day Mvoo Laana found a snake in the same trap 
4848_101836_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He started to the village to give the alarm but the snake shouted Come back son of Adam don t call the people from the village to come and kill me 
4848_101836_000016_000002	train-clean-360	I am Neeo ka the snake 
4848_101836_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Let me out of this trap I pray you 
4848_101836_000016_000004	train-clean-360	Save me from the rain to day that I may be able to save you from the sun to morrow if you should be in need of help 
none	none	So the youth let him go and as he went he said I will return your kindness if I can but do not trust any man if you do him a kindness he will do you an injury in return at the first opportunity The third day Mvoo Laana found a lion in the same trap that had caught the ape and the snake and he was afraid to go near it But the lion said Don t run away I am Sim ba Kong way the very old lion Let me out of this trap and I will not hurt you Save me from the rain that I may save you from the sun if you should need help So Mvoo Laana believed him and let him out of the trap and Simba Kongway before going his way said Son of Adam you have been kind to me and I will repay you with kindness if I can but never do a kindness to a man or he will pay you back with unkindness The next day a man was caught in the same trap and when the youth released him he repeatedly assured him that he would never forget the service he had done him in restoring his liberty and saving his life Well it seemed that he had caught all the game that could be taken in traps and Mvoo Laana and his mother were hungry every day with nothing to satisfy them as they had been before At last he said to his mother one day Mother make me seven cakes of the little meal we have left and I will go hunting with my bow and arrows So she baked him the cakes and he took them and his bow and arrows and went into the forest The youth walked and walked but could see no game and finally he found that he had lost his way and had eaten all his cakes but one And he went on and on not knowing whether he was going away from his home or toward it until he came to the wildest and most desolate looking wood he had ever seen 
4848_101836_000023_000001	train-clean-360	He was so wretched and tired that he felt he must lie down and die when suddenly he heard some one calling him and looking up he saw Neeanee the ape who said Son of Adam where are you going 
none	none	I don t know replied Mvoo Laana sadly I m lost
4848_101836_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well said the ape don t worry 
none	none	Just sit down here and rest yourself until I come back and I will repay with kindness the kindness you once showed me Then Neeanee went away off to some gardens and stole a whole lot of ripe paw paws and bananas and brought them to Mvoo Laana and said Here s plenty of food for you 
4848_101836_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Is there anything else you want 
none	none	Would you like a drink And before the youth could answer he ran off with a calabash and brought it back full of water So the youth ate heartily and drank all the water he needed and then each said to the other Good bye till we meet again and went their separate ways When Mvoo Laana had walked a great deal farther without finding which way he should go he met Simba Kongway who asked Where are you going son of Adam 
4848_101836_000028_000000	train-clean-360	And the youth answered as dolefully as before I don t know I m lost 
4848_101836_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Come cheer up said the very old lion and rest yourself here a little 
4848_101836_000029_000001	train-clean-360	I want to repay with kindness to day the kindness you showed me on a former day 
none	none	So Mvoo Laana sat down 
4848_101836_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Simba Kongway went away but soon returned with some game he had caught and then he brought some fire and the young man cooked the game and ate it 
none	none	When he had finished he felt a great deal better and they bade each other good bye for the present and each went his way After he had traveled another very long distance the youth came to a farm and was met by a very very old woman who said to him Stranger my husband has been taken very sick and I am looking for some one to make him some medicine 
4848_101836_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Won t you make it But he answered My good woman I am not a doctor I am a hunter and never used medicine in my life 
4848_101836_000031_000002	train-clean-360	I can not help you 
4848_101836_000032_000000	train-clean-360	When he came to the road leading to the principal city he saw a well with a bucket standing near it and he said to himself That s just what I want 
4848_101836_000032_000001	train-clean-360	I ll take a drink of nice well water 
4848_101836_000032_000002	train-clean-360	Let me see if the water can be reached 
4848_101836_000033_000000	train-clean-360	As he peeped over the edge of the well to see if the water was high enough what should he behold but a great big snake which directly it saw him said Son of Adam wait a moment Then it came out of the well and said How 
4848_101836_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Don t you know me 
none	none	I certainly do not said the youth stepping back a little
4848_101836_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well said the snake I could never forget you 
4848_101836_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I am Neeoka whom you released from the trap 
none	none	You know I said Save me from the rain and I will save you from the sun Now you are a stranger in the town to which you are going therefore hand me your little bag and I will place in it the things that will be of use to you when you arrive there So Mvoo Laana gave Neeoka the little bag and he filled it with chains of gold and silver and told him to use them freely for his own benefit 
4848_101836_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Then they parted very cordially 
none	none	When the youth reached the city the first man he met was he whom he had released from the trap who invited him to go home with him which he did and the man s wife made him supper As soon as he could get away unobserved the man went to the sultan and said There is a stranger come to my house with a bag full of chains of silver and gold which he says he got from a snake that lives in a well 
4848_101836_000038_000001	train-clean-360	But although he pretends to be a man I know that he is a snake who has power to look like a man 
none	none	When the sultan heard this he sent some soldiers who brought Mvoo Laana and his little bag before him When they opened the little bag the man who was released from the trap persuaded the people that some evil would come out of it and affect the children of the sultan and the children of the vizir Then the people became excited and tied the hands of Mvoo Laana behind him But the great snake had come out of the well and arrived at the town just about this time and he went and lay at the feet of the man who had said all those bad things about Mvoo Laana and when the people saw this they said to that man How is this 
4848_101836_000041_000001	train-clean-360	There is the great snake that lives in the well and he stays by you 
4848_101836_000041_000002	train-clean-360	Tell him to go away 
4848_101836_000042_000000	train-clean-360	But Neeoka would not stir 
none	none	So they untied the young man s hands and tried in every way to make amends for having suspected him of being a wizard 
4848_101836_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Then the sultan asked him Why should this man invite you to his home and then speak ill of you 
none	none	And Mvoo Laana related all that had happened to him and how the ape the snake and the lion had cautioned him about the results of doing any kindness for a man 
4848_101836_000045_000000	train-clean-360	And the sultan said Although men are often ungrateful they are not always so only the bad ones 
4848_101836_000045_000001	train-clean-360	As for this fellow he deserves to be put in a sack and drowned in the sea 
none	none	He was treated kindly and returned evil for good VII HAAMDAANEE Once there was a very poor man named Haamdaa nee who begged from door to door for his living sometimes taking things before they were offered him After a while people became suspicious of him and stopped giving him anything in order to keep him away from their houses So at last he was reduced to the necessity of going every morning to the village dust heap and picking up and eating the few grains of the tiny little millet seed that he might find there One day as he was scratching and turning over the heap he found a dime which he tied up in a corner of his ragged dress and continued to hunt for millet grains but could not find one Oh well said he I ve got a dime now I m pretty well fixed I ll go home and take a nap instead of a meal So he went to his hut took a drink of water put some tobacco in his mouth and went to sleep The next morning as he scratched in the dust heap he saw a countryman going along carrying a basket made of twigs and he called to him Hi there countryman What have you in that cage The countryman whose name was Moohaad eem replied Gazelles And Haamdaanee called Bring them here Let me see them Now there were three well to do men standing near and when they saw the countryman coming to Haamdaanee they smiled and said You re taking lots of trouble for nothing Moohaadeem How s that gentlemen he inquired Why said they that poor fellow has nothing at all Not a cent Oh I don t know that said the countryman he may have plenty for all I know Not he said they Don t you see for yourself continued one of them that he is on the dust heap Every day he scratches there like a hen trying to get enough grains of millet to keep himself alive If he had any money wouldn t he buy a square meal for once in his life Do you think he would want to buy a gazelle What would he do with it He can t find enough food for himself without looking for any for a gazelle But Moohaadeem said Gentlemen I have brought some goods here to sell I answer all who call me and if any one says Come I go to him I don t favor one and slight another therefore as this man called me I m going to him All right said the first man you don t believe us Well we know where he lives and all about him and we know that he can t buy anything That s so said the second man Perhaps however you will see that we were right after you have a talk with him To which the third man added Clouds are a sign of rain but we have seen no signs of his being about to spend any money All right gentlemen said Moohaadeem many better looking people than he call me and when I show them my gazelles they say Oh yes they re very beautiful but awfully dear take them away So I shall not be disappointed if this man says the same thing I shall go to him anyhow Then one of the three men said Let us go with this man and see what the beggar will buy Pshaw said another buy You talk foolishly He has not had a good meal in three years to my knowledge and a man in his condition doesn t have money to buy gazelles However let s go and if he makes this poor countryman carry his load over there just for the fun of looking at the gazelles let each of us give him a good hard whack with our walking sticks to teach him how to behave toward honest merchants So when they came near him one of those three men said Well here are the gazelles now buy one Here they are you old hypocrite you ll feast your eyes on them but you can t buy them But Haamdaanee paying no attention to the men said to Moohaadeem How much for one of your gazelles Then another of those men broke in You re very innocent aren t you You know as well as I do that gazelles are sold every day at two for a quarter Still taking no notice of these outsiders Haamdaanee continued I d like to buy one for a dime One for a dime laughed the men of course you d like to buy one for a dime Perhaps you d also like to have the dime to buy with Then one of them gave him a push on the cheek At this Haamdaanee turned and said Why do you push me on the cheek when I ve done nothing to you I do not know you I call this man to transact some business with him and you who are strangers step in to spoil our trade He then untied the knot in the corner of his ragged coat produced the dime and handing it to Moohaadeem said Please good man let me have a gazelle for that At this the countryman took a small gazelle out of the cage and handed it to him saying Here master take this one I call it Keejee paa Then turning to those three men he laughed and said Ehe How s this You with your white robes and turbans and swords and daggers and sandals on your feet you gentlemen of property and no mistake you told me this man was too poor to buy anything yet he has bought a gazelle for a dime while you fine fellows I think haven t enough money among you to buy half a gazelle if they were five cents each Then Moohaadeem and the three men went their several ways As for Haamdaanee he stayed at the dust heap until he found a few grains of millet for himself and a few for Keejeepaa the gazelle and then went to his hut spread his sleeping mat and he and the gazelle slept together This going to the dust heap for a few grains of millet and then going home to bed continued for about a week Then one night Haamdaanee was awakened by some one calling Master Sitting up he answered Here I am Who calls The gazelle answered I do Upon this the beggar man became so scared that he did not know whether he should faint or get up and run away Seeing him so overcome Keejeepaa asked Why master what s the matter Oh gracious he gasped what a wonder I see A wonder said the gazelle looking all around why what is this wonder that makes you act as if you were all broken up Why it s so wonderful I can hardly believe I m awake said his master Who in the world ever before knew of a gazelle that could speak Oho laughed Keejeepaa is that all There are many more wonderful things than that But now listen while I tell you why I called you Certainly I ll listen to every word said the man I can t help listening Well you see it s just this way said Keejeepaa I ve allowed you to become my master and I can not run away from you so I want you to make an agreement with me and I will make you a promise and keep it Say on said his master Now continued the gazelle one doesn t have to be acquainted with you long in order to discover that you are very poor This scratching a few grains of millet from the dust heap every day and managing to subsist upon them is all very well for you you re used to it because it s a matter of necessity with you but if I keep it up much longer you won t have any gazelle Keejeepaa will die of starvation Therefore I want to go away every day and feed on my own kind of food and I promise you I will return every evening Well I guess I ll have to give my consent said the man in no very cheerful tone As it was now dawn Keejeepaa jumped up and ran out of the door Haamdaanee following him The gazelle ran very fast and his master stood watching him until he disappeared Then tears started in the man s eyes and raising his hands he cried Oh my mother Then he cried Oh my father Then he cried Oh my gazelle It has run away Some of his neighbors who heard him carrying on in this manner took the opportunity to inform him that he was a fool an idiot and a dissipated fellow Said one of them You hung around that dust heap goodness knows how long scratching like a hen till fortune gave you a dime You hadn t sense enough to go and buy some decent food you had to buy a gazelle Now you ve let the creature run away What are you crying about You brought all your trouble on yourself All this of course was very comforting to Haamdaanee who slunk off to the dust heap got a few grains of millet and came back to his hut which now seemed meaner and more desolate than ever At sunset however Keejeepaa came trotting in and the beggar was happy again and said Ah my friend you have returned to me Of course said the gazelle didn t I promise you You see I feel that when you bought me you gave all the money you had in the world even though it was only a dime Why then should I grieve you I couldn t do it If I go and get myself some food I ll always come back evenings When the neighbors saw the gazelle come home every evening and run off every morning they were greatly surprised and began to suspect that Haamdaanee was a wizard Well this coming and going continued for five days the gazelle telling its master each night what fine places it had been to and what lots of food it had eaten On the sixth day it was feeding among some thorn bushes in a thick wood when scratching away some bitter grass at the foot of a big tree it saw an immense diamond of intense brightness Oho said Keejeepaa in great astonishment here s property and no mistake This is worth a kingdom If I take it to my master he will be killed for being a poor man if they say to him Where did you get it and he answers I picked it up they will not believe him if he says It was given to me they will not believe him either It will not do for me to get my master into difficulties I know what I ll do I ll seek some powerful person he will use it properly So Keejeepaa started off through the forest holding the diamond in his mouth and ran and ran but saw no town that day so he slept in the forest and arose at dawn and pursued his way And the second day passed like the first On the third day the gazelle had traveled from dawn until between eight and nine o clock when he began to see scattered houses getting larger in size and knew he was approaching a town In due time he found himself in the main street of a large city leading direct to the sultan s palace and began to run as fast as he could People passing along stopped to look at the strange sight of a gazelle running swiftly along the main street with something wrapped in green leaves between its teeth The sultan was sitting at the door of his palace when Keejeepaa stopping a little way off dropped the diamond from its mouth and lying down beside it panting called out Ho there Ho there which is a cry every one makes in that part of the world when wishing to enter a house remaining outside until the cry is answered After the cry had been repeated several times the sultan said to his attendants Who is doing all that calling And one answered Master it s a gazelle that s calling Ho there Ho ho said the sultan Ho ho Invite the gazelle to come near Then three attendants ran to Keejeepaa and said Come get up The sultan commands you to come near So the gazelle arose picked up the diamond and approaching the sultan laid the jewel at his feet saying Master good afternoon To which the sultan replied May God make it good Come near The sultan ordered his attendants to bring a carpet and a large cushion and desired the gazelle to rest upon them When it protested that it was comfortable as it was he insisted and Keejeepaa had to allow himself to be made a very honored guest Then they brought milk and rice and the sultan would hear nothing until the gazelle had fed and rested At last when everything had been disposed of the sultan said Well now my friend tell me what news you bring And Keejeepaa said Master I don t exactly know how you will like the news I bring The fact is I m sent here to insult you I ve come to try and pick a quarrel with you In fact I m here to propose a family alliance with you At this the sultan exclaimed Oh come for a gazelle you certainly know how to talk Now the fact of it is I m looking for some one to insult me I m just aching to have some one pick a quarrel with me I m impatient for a family alliance Go on with your message Then Keejeepaa said You don t bear any ill will against me who am only a messenger And the sultan said None at all Well said Keejeepaa look at this pledge I bring dropping the diamond wrapped in leaves into the sultan s lap When the sultan opened the leaves and saw the great sparkling jewel he was overcome with astonishment At last he said Well I have brought this pledge said the gazelle from my master Sultan Daaraa ee He has heard that you have a daughter so he sent you this jewel hoping you will forgive him for not sending something more worthy of your acceptance than this trifle Goodness said the sultan to himself he calls this a trifle Then to the gazelle Oh that s all right that s all right I m satisfied The Sultan Daaraaee has my consent to marry my daughter and I don t want a single thing from him Let him come empty handed If he has more of these trifles let him leave them at home This is my message and I hope you will make it perfectly clear to your master The gazelle assured him that he would explain everything satisfactorily adding And now master I take my leave I go straight to our own town and hope that in about eleven days we shall return to be your guests So with mutual compliments they parted In the meantime Haamdaanee was having an exceedingly tough time Keejeepaa having disappeared he wandered about the town moaning Oh my poor gazelle my poor gazelle while the neighbors laughed and jeered at him until between them and his loss he was nearly out of his mind But one evening when he had gone to bed Keejeepaa walked in Up he jumped and began to embrace the gazelle and weep over it and carry on at a great rate When he thought there had been about enough of this kind of thing the gazelle said Come come keep quiet my master I ve brought you good news But the beggar man continued to cry and fondle and declare that he had thought his gazelle was dead At last Keejeepaa said Oh well master you see I m all right You must brace up and prepare to hear my news and do as I advise you Go on go on replied his master explain what you will I ll do whatever you require me to do If you were to say Lie down on your back that I may roll you over the side of the hill I would lie down Well said the gazelle there is not much to explain just now but I ll tell you this I ve seen many kinds of food food that is desirable and food that is objectionable but this food I m about to offer you is very sweet indeed What said Haamdaanee Is it possible that in this world there is anything that is positively good There must be good and bad in everything Food that is both sweet and bitter is good food but if food were nothing but sweetness would it not be injurious H m yawned the gazelle I m too tired to talk philosophy Let s go to sleep now and when I call you in the morning all you have to do is to get up and follow me So at dawn they set forth the gazelle leading the way and for five days they journeyed through the forest On the fifth day they came to a stream and Keejeepaa said to his master Lie down here When he had done so the gazelle set to and beat him so soundly that he cried out Oh let up I beg of you Now said the gazelle I m going away and when I return I expect to find you right here so don t you leave this spot on any account Then he ran away and about ten o clock that morning he arrived at the house of the sultan Now ever since the day Keejeepaa left the town soldiers had been placed along the road to watch for and announce the approach of Sultan Daaraaee so one of them when he saw the gazelle in the distance rushed up and cried to the sultan Sultan Daaraaee is coming I ve seen the gazelle running as fast as it can in this direction The sultan and his attendants immediately set out to meet his guests but when they had gone a little way beyond the town they met the gazelle coming along alone who on reaching the sultan said Good day my master The sultan replied in kind and asked the news but Keejeepaa said Ah do not ask me I can scarcely walk and my news is bad Why how is that asked the sultan Oh dear sighed the gazelle such misfortune and misery You see Sultan Daaraaee and I started alone to come here and we got along all right until we came to the thick part of the forest yonder when we were met by robbers who seized my master bound him beat him and took everything he had even stripping off every stitch of his clothing Oh dear oh dear Dear me said the sultan we must attend to this at once So hurrying back with his attendants to his house he called a groom to whom he said Saddle the best horse in my stable and put on him my finest harness Then he directed a woman servant to open the big inlaid chest and bring him a bag of clothes When she brought it he picked out a loin cloth and a long white robe and a black overjacket and a shawl for the waist and a turban cloth all of the very finest Then he sent for a curved sword with a gold hilt and a curved dagger with gold filigree and a pair of elegant sandals and a fine walking cane Then the sultan said to Keejeepaa Take some of my soldiers and let them convey these things to Sultan Daaraaee that he may dress himself and come to me But the gazelle answered Ah my master can I take these soldiers with me and put Sultan Daaraaee to shame There he lies beaten and robbed and I would not have any one see him I can take everything by myself Why exclaimed the sultan here is a horse and there are clothes and arms I don t see how a little gazelle can manage all those things But the gazelle had them fasten everything on the horse s back and tie the end of the bridle around his own neck and then he set off alone amidst the wonder and admiration of the people of that city high and low When he arrived at the place where he had left the beggar man he found him lying waiting for him and overjoyed at his return Now said he I have brought you the sweet food I promised Come get up and bathe yourself With the hesitation of a person long unaccustomed to such a thing the man stepped into the stream and began to wet himself a little Oh said the gazelle impatiently a little water like that won t do you much good get out into the deep pool Dear me said the man timidly there is so much water there and where there is much water there are sure to be horrible animals Animals What kind of animals Well crocodiles water lizards snakes and at any rate frogs and they bite people and I m terribly afraid of all of them Oh well said Keejeepaa do the best you can in the stream but rub yourself well with earth and for goodness sake scrub your teeth well with sand they are awfully dirty So the man obeyed and soon made quite a change in his appearance Then the gazelle said Here hurry up and put on these things The sun has gone down and we ought to have started before this So the man dressed himself in the fine clothes the sultan had sent and then he mounted the horse and they started the gazelle trotting on ahead When they had gone some distance the gazelle stopped and said See here nobody who sees you now would suspect that you are the man who scratched in the dust heap yesterday Even if we were to go back to our town the neighbors would not recognize you if it were only for the fact that your face is clean and your teeth are white Your appearance is all right but I have a caution to give you Over there where we are going I have procured for you the sultan s daughter for a wife with all the usual wedding gifts Now you must keep quiet Say nothing except How d ye do and What s the news Let me do the talking All right said the man that suits me exactly Do you know what your name is Of course I do Indeed Well what is it Why my name is Haamdaanee Not much laughed Keejeepaa your name is Sultan Daaraaee Oh is it said his master That s good So they started forward again and in a little while they saw soldiers running in every direction and fourteen of these joined them to escort them Then they saw ahead of them the sultan and the vizirs and the emirs and the judges and the great men of the city coming to meet them Now then said Keejeepaa get off your horse and salute your father in law That s him in the middle wearing the sky blue jacket All right said the man jumping off his horse which was then led by a soldier So the two met and the sultans shook hands and kissed each other and walked up to the palace together Then they had a great feast and made merry and talked until night at which time Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle were put into an inner room with three soldiers at the door to guard and attend upon them When the morning came Keejeepaa went to the sultan and said Master we wish to attend to the business which brought us here We want to marry your daughter and the sooner the ceremony takes place the better it will please the Sultan Daaraaee Why that s all right said the sultan the bride is ready Let some one call the teacher Mwaalee moo and tell him to come at once When Mwaaleemoo arrived the sultan said See here we want you to marry this gentleman to my daughter right away All right I m ready said the teacher So they were married Early the next morning the gazelle said to his master Now I m off on a journey I shall be gone about a week but however long I am gone don t you leave the house till I return Good bye Then he went to the real sultan and said Good master Sultan Daaraaee has ordered me to return to our town and put his house in order he commands me to be here again in a week if I do not return by that time he will stay here until I come The sultan asked him if he would not like to have some soldiers go with him but the gazelle replied that he was quite competent to take care of himself as his previous journeys had proved and he preferred to go alone so with mutual good wishes they parted But Keejeepaa did not go in the direction of the old village He struck off by another road through the forest and after a time came to a very fine town of large handsome houses As he went through the principal street right to the far end he was greatly astonished to observe that the town seemed to have no inhabitants for he saw neither man woman nor child in all the place At the end of the main street he came upon the largest and most beautiful house he had ever seen built of sapphire and turquoise and costly marbles Oh my said the gazelle this house would just suit my master I ll have to pluck up my courage and see whether this is deserted like the other houses in this mysterious town So Keejeepaa knocked at the door and called Hullo there several times but no one answered And he said to himself This is strange If there were no one inside the door would be fastened on the outside Perhaps they are in another part of the house or asleep I ll call again louder So he called again very loud and long Hul lo th e re Hul lo And directly an old woman inside answered Who is that calling so loudly It is I your grandchild good mistress said Keejeepaa If you are my grandchild replied the old woman go back to your home at once don t come and die here and bring me to my death also Oh come said he open the door mistress I have just a few words I wish to say to you My dear grandson she replied the only reason why I do not open the door is because I fear to endanger both your life and my own Oh don t worry about that I guess your life and mine are safe enough for a while Open the door anyhow and hear the little I have to say So the old woman opened the door Then they exchanged salutations and compliments after which she asked the gazelle What s the news from your place grandson Oh everything is going along pretty well said he what s the news around here Ah sighed the old creature the news here is very bad If you re looking for a place to die in you ve struck it here I ve not the slightest doubt you ll see all you want of death this very day Huh replied Keejeepaa lightly for a fly to die in honey is not bad for the fly and doesn t injure the honey It may be all very well for you to be easy about it persisted the old person but if people with swords and shields did not escape how can a little thing like you avoid danger I must again beg of you to go back to the place you came from Your safety seems of more interest to me than it is to you Well you see I can t go back just now and besides I want to find out more about this place Who owns it Ah grandson in this house are enormous wealth numbers of people hundreds of horses and the owner is Neeo ka Mkoo the wonderfully big snake He owns this whole town also Oho Is that so said Keejeepaa Look here old lady can t you put me on to some plan of getting near this big snake that I may kill him Mercy cried the old woman in affright don t talk like that You ve put my life in danger already for I m sure Neeoka Mkoo can hear what is said in this house wherever he is You see I m a poor old woman and I have been placed here with those pots and pans to cook for him Well when the big snake is coming the wind begins to blow and the dust flies as it would do in a great storm Then when he arrives in the courtyard he eats until he is full and after that goes inside there to drink water When he has finished he goes away again This occurs every other day just when the sun is overhead I may add that Neeoka Mkoo has seven heads Now then do you think yourself a match for him Look here mother said the gazelle don t you worry about me Has this big snake a sword He has This is it said she taking from its peg a very keen and beautiful blade and handing it to him but what s the use in bothering about it We are dead already We shall see about that said Keejeepaa Just at that moment the wind began to blow and the dust to fly as if a great storm were approaching Do you hear the great one coming cried the old woman Pshaw said the gazelle I m a great one also and I have the advantage of being on the inside Two bulls can t live in one cattle pen Either he will live in this house or I will Notwithstanding the terror the old lady was in she had to smile at the assurance of this little undersized gazelle and repeated over again her account of the people with swords and shields who had been killed by the big snake Ah stop your gabbling said the gazelle you can t always judge a banana by its color or size Wait and see grandma In a very little while the big snake Neeoka Mkoo came into the courtyard and went around to all the pots and ate their contents Then he came to the door Hullo old lady said he how is it I smell a new kind of odor inside there Oh that s nothing good master replied the old woman I ve been so busy around here lately I haven t had time to look after myself but this morning I used some perfume and that s what you smell Now Keejeepaa had drawn the sword and was standing just inside the doorway so when the big snake put his head in it was cut off so quickly that its owner did not know it was gone When he put in his second head it was cut off with the same quickness and feeling a little irritation he exclaimed Who s inside there scratching me He then thrust in his third head and that was cut off also This continued until six heads had been disposed of when Neeoka Mkoo unfolded his rings and lashed around so that the gazelle and the old woman could not see one another through the dust Then the snake thrust in his seventh head and the gazelle crying Now your time has come you ve climbed many trees but this you can not climb severed it and immediately fell down in a fainting fit Well that old woman although she was seventy five years of age jumped and shouted and laughed like a girl of nine Then she ran and got water and sprinkled the gazelle and turned him this way and that way until at last he sneezed which greatly pleased the old person who fanned him and tended him until he was quite recovered Oh my said she who would have thought you could be a match for him my grandson Well well said Keejeepaa that s all over Now show me everything around this place So she showed him everything from top to bottom store rooms full of goods chambers full of expensive foods rooms containing handsome people who had been kept prisoners for a long time slaves and everything Next he asked her if there was any person who was likely to lay claim to the place or make any trouble and she answered No one everything here belongs to you Very well then said he you stay here and take care of these things until I bring my master This place belongs to him now Keejeepaa stayed three days examining the house and said to himself Well when my master comes here he will be much pleased with what I have done for him and he ll appreciate it after the life he s been accustomed to As to his father in law there is not a house in his town that can compare with this On the fourth day he departed and in due time arrived at the town where the sultan and his master lived Then there were great rejoicings the sultan being particularly pleased at his return while his master felt as if he had received a new lease of life After everything had settled down a little Keejeepaa told his master he must be ready to go with his wife to his new home after four days Then he went and told the sultan that Sultan Daaraaee desired to take his wife to his own town in four days to which the sultan strongly objected but the gazelle said it was his master s wish and at last everything was arranged On the day of the departure a great company assembled to escort Sultan Daaraaee and his bride There were the bride s ladies in waiting and slaves and horsemen and Keejeepaa leading them all So they traveled three days resting when the sun was overhead and stopping each evening about five o clock to eat and sleep arising next morning at day break eating and going forward again And all this time the gazelle took very little rest going all through the company from the ladies to the slaves and seeing that every one was well supplied with food and quite comfortable therefore the entire company loved him and valued him like the apples of their eyes On the fourth day during the afternoon many houses came into view and some of the folks called Keejeepaa s attention to them Certainly said he that is our town and that house you see yonder is the palace of Sultan Daaraaee So they went on and all the company filed into the courtyard while the gazelle and his master went into the house When the old woman saw Keejeepaa she began to dance and shout and carry on just as she did when he killed Neeoka Mkoo and taking up his foot she kissed it but Keejeepaa said Old lady let me alone the one to be made much of is this my master Sultan Daaraaee Kiss his feet he has the first honors whenever he is present The old woman excused herself for not knowing the master and then Sultan Daaraaee and the gazelle went around on a tour of inspection The sultan ordered all the prisoners to be released the horses to be sent out to pasture all the rooms to be swept the furniture to be dusted and in the meantime servants were busy preparing food Then every one had apartments assigned to him and all were satisfied After they had remained there some time the ladies who had accompanied the bride expressed a desire to return to their own homes Keejeepaa begged them not to hurry away but after a while they departed each loaded with gifts by the gazelle for whom they had a thousand times more affection than for his master Then things settled down to their regular routine One day the gazelle said to the old woman I think the conduct of my master is very singular I have done nothing but good for him all the time I have been with him I came to this town and braved many dangers for him and when all was over I gave everything to him Yet he has never asked How did you get this house How did you get this town Who is the owner of this house Have you rented all these things or have they been given you What has become of the inhabitants of the place I don t understand him And further although I have done nothing but good for him he has never done one good thing for me Nothing here is really his He never saw such a house or town as this since the day he was born and he doesn t own anything of it I believe the old folks were right when they said If you want to do any person good don t do too much do him a little harm occasionally and he ll think more of you However I ve done all I can now and I d like to see him make some little return Next morning the old woman was awakened early by the gazelle calling Mother Mother When she went to him she found he was sick in his stomach feverish and all his legs ached Go said he and tell my master I am very ill So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting on a marble couch covered with a striped silk scarf from India Well said the master what do you want old woman Oh my master cried she Keejeepaa is sick The mistress started and said Dear me What is the matter with him All his body pains him He is sick all over Oh well said the master what can I do Go and get some of that red millet that is too common for our use and make him some gruel Gracious exclaimed his wife staring at him in amazement do you wish her to feed our friend with stuff that a horse would not eat if he were ever so hungry This is not right of you Ah get out said he you re crazy We eat rice isn t red millet good enough for a gazelle that cost only a dime Oh but he is no ordinary gazelle He should be as dear to you as the apple of your eye If sand got in your eye it would trouble you You talk too much returned her husband then turning to the old woman he said Go and do as I told you So the old woman went downstairs and when she saw the gazelle she began to cry and say Oh dear oh dear It was a long while before the gazelle could persuade her to tell him what had passed upstairs but at last she told him all When he had heard it he said Did he really tell you to make me red millet gruel Ah cried she do you think I would say such a thing if it were not so Well said Keejeepaa I believe what the old folks said was right However we ll give him another chance Go up to him again and tell him I am very sick and that I can t eat that gruel So she went upstairs and found the master and mistress sitting by the window drinking coffee The master looking around and seeing her said What s the matter now old woman And she said Master I am sent by Keejeepaa He is very sick indeed and has not taken the gruel you told me to make for him Oh bother he exclaimed Hold your tongue and keep your feet still and shut your eyes and stop your ears with wax then if that gazelle tells you to come up here say that your legs are stiff and if he tells you to listen say your ears are deaf and if he tells you to look say your sight has failed you and if he wants you to talk tell him your tongue is paralyzed When the old woman heard these words she stood and stared and was unable to move As for his wife her face became sad and the tears began to start from her eyes observing which her husband said sharply What s the matter with you sultan s daughter The lady replied A man s madness is his undoing Why do you say that mistress he inquired Ah said she I am grieved my husband at your treatment of Keejeepaa Whenever I say a good word for the gazelle you dislike to hear it I pity you that your understanding is gone What do you mean by talking in that manner to me he blustered Why advice is a blessing if properly taken A husband should advise with his wife and a wife with her husband then they are both blessed Oh stop said her husband impatiently it s evident you ve lost your senses You should be chained up Then he said to the old woman Never mind her talk and as to this gazelle tell him to stop bothering me and putting on style as if he were the sultan I can t eat I can t drink I can t sleep because of that gazelle worrying me with his messages First the gazelle is sick then the gazelle doesn t like what he gets to eat Confound it If he likes to eat let him eat if he doesn t like to eat let him die and be out of the way My mother is dead and my father is dead and I still live and eat shall I be put out of my way by a gazelle that I bought for a dime telling me he wants this thing or that thing Go and tell him to learn how to behave himself toward his superiors When the old woman went downstairs she found the gazelle was bleeding at the mouth and in a very bad way All she could say was My son the good you did is all lost but be patient And the gazelle wept with the old woman when she told him all that had passed and he said Mother I am dying not only from sickness but from shame and anger at this man s ingratitude After a while Keejeepaa told the old woman to go and tell the master that he believed he was dying When she went upstairs she found Daaraaee chewing sugar cane and she said to him Master the gazelle is worse we think him nearer to dying than getting well To which he answered Haven t I told you often enough not to bother me Then his wife said Oh husband won t you go down and see the poor gazelle If you don t like to go let me go and see him He never gets a single good thing from you But he turned to the old woman and said Go and tell that nuisance of a gazelle to die eleven times if he chooses to Now husband persisted the lady what has Keejeepaa done to you Has he done you any wrong Such words as yours people use to their enemies only Surely the gazelle is not your enemy All the people who know him great and lowly love him dearly and they will think it very wrong of you if you neglect him Now do be kind to him Sultan Daaraaee But he only repeated his assertion that she had lost her wits and would have nothing further of argument So the old woman went down and found the gazelle worse than ever In the meantime Sultan Daaraaee s wife managed to give some rice to a servant to cook for the gazelle and also sent him a soft shawl to cover him and a pillow to lie upon She also sent him a message that if he wished she would have her father s best physicians attend him All this was too late however for just as these good things arrived Keejeepaa died When the people heard he was dead they went running around crying and having an awful time and when Sultan Daaraaee found out what all the commotion was about he was very indignant remarking Why you are making as much fuss as if I were dead and all over a gazelle that I bought for a dime But his wife said Husband it was this gazelle that came to ask me of my father it was he who brought me from my father s and it was to him I was given by my father He gave you everything good and you do not possess a thing that he did not procure for you He did everything he could to help you and you not only returned him unkindness but now he is dead you have ordered people to throw him into the well Let us alone that we may weep But the gazelle was taken and thrown into the well Then the lady wrote a letter telling her father to come to her directly and despatched it by trusty messengers upon the receipt of which the sultan and his attendants started hurriedly to visit his daughter When they arrived and heard that the gazelle was dead and had been thrown into the well they wept very much and the sultan and the vizir and the judges and the rich chief men all went down into the well and brought up the body of Keejeepaa and took it away with them and buried it Now that night the lady dreamt that she was at home at her father s house and when dawn came she awoke and found she was in her own bed in her own town again And her husband dreamed that he was on the dust heap scratching and when he awoke there he was with both hands full of dust looking for grains of millet Staring wildly he looked around to the right and left saying Oh who has played this trick on me How did I get back here I wonder Just then the children going along and seeing him laughed and hooted at him calling out Hullo Haamdaanee where have you been Where do you come from We thought you were dead long ago So the sultan s daughter lived in happiness with her people until the end and that beggar man continued to scratch for grains of millet in the dust heap until he died If this story is good the goodness belongs to all if it is bad the badness belongs only to him who told it VIII MKAAAH JEECHONEE THE BOY HUNTER Sultan Maaj noon had seven sons and a big cat of all of whom he was very proud Everything went well until one day the cat went and caught a calf When they told the sultan he said Well the cat is mine and the calf is mine So they said Oh all right master and let the matter drop A few days later the cat caught a goat and when they told the sultan he said The cat is mine and the goat is mine and so that settled it again Two days more passed and the cat caught a cow They told the sultan and he shut them up with My cat and my cow After another two days the cat caught a donkey same result Next it caught a horse same result The next victim was a camel and when they told the sultan he said What s the matter with you folks It was my cat and my camel I believe you don t like my cat and want it killed bringing me tales about it every day Let it eat whatever it wants to In a very short time it caught a child and then a full grown man but each time the sultan remarked that both the cat and its victim were his and thought no more of it Meantime the cat grew bolder and hung around a low open place near the town pouncing on people going for water or animals out at pasture and eating them At last some of the people plucked up courage and going to the sultan said How is this master As you are our sultan you are our protector or ought to be yet you have allowed this cat to do as it pleases and now it lives just out of town there and kills everything living that goes that way while at night it comes into town and does the same thing Now what on earth are we to do But Maajnoon only replied I really believe you hate my cat I suppose you want me to kill it but I shall do no such thing Everything it eats is mine Of course the folks were astonished at this result of the interview and as no one dared to kill the cat they all had to remove from the vicinity where it lived But this did not mend matters because when it found no one came that way it shifted its quarters likewise So complaints continued to pour in until at last Sultan Maajnoon gave orders that if any one came to make accusations against the cat he was to be informed that the master could not be seen When things got so that people neither let their animals out nor went out themselves the cat went farther into the country killing and eating cattle and fowls and everything that came its way One day the sultan said to six of his sons I m going to look at the country to day come along with me The seventh son was considered too young to go around anywhere and was always left at home with the women folk being called by his brothers Mkaa ah Jeecho nee which means mister Sit in the kitchen Well they went and presently came to a thicket The father was in front and the six sons following him when the cat jumped out and killed three of the latter The attendants shouted The cat the cat and the soldiers asked permission to search for and kill it which the sultan readily granted saying This is not a cat it is a noon dah It has taken from me my own sons Now nobody had ever seen a noondah but they all knew it was a terrible beast that could kill and eat all other living things When the sultan began to bemoan the loss of his sons some of those who heard him said Ah master this noondah does not select his prey He doesn t say This is my master s son I ll leave him alone or This is my master s wife I won t eat her When we told you what the cat had done you always said it was your cat and what it ate was yours and now it has killed your sons and we don t believe it would hesitate to eat even you And he said I fear you are right As for the soldiers who tried to get the cat some were killed and the remainder ran away and the sultan and his living sons took the dead bodies home and buried them Now when Mkaaah Jeechonee the seventh son heard that his brothers had been killed by the noondah he said to his mother I too will go that it may kill me as well as my brothers or I will kill it But his mother said My son I do not like to have you go Those three are already dead and if you are killed also will not that be one wound upon another to my heart Nevertheless said he I can not help going but do not tell my father So his mother made him some cakes and sent some attendants with him and he took a great spear as sharp as a razor and a sword bade her farewell and departed As he had always been left at home he had no very clear idea what he was going to hunt for so he had not gone far beyond the suburbs when seeing a very large dog he concluded that this was the animal he was after so he killed it tied a rope to it and dragged it home singing Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people When his mother who was upstairs heard him she looked out of the window and seeing what he had brought said My son this is not the noondah eater of the people So he left the carcass outside and went in to talk about it and his mother said My dear boy the noondah is a much larger animal than that but if I were you I d give the business up and stay at home No indeed he exclaimed no staying at home for me until I have met and fought the noondah So he set out again and went a great deal farther than he had gone on the former day Presently he saw a civet cat and believing it to be the animal he was in search of he killed it bound it and dragged it home singing Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people When his mother saw the civet cat she said My son this is not the noondah eater of the people And he threw it away Again his mother entreated him to stay at home but he would not listen to her and started off again This time he went away off into the forest and seeing a bigger cat than the last one he killed it bound it and dragged it home singing Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people But directly his mother saw it she had to tell him as before My son this is not the noondah eater of the people He was of course very much troubled at this and his mother said Now where do you expect to find this noondah You don t know where it is and you don t know what it looks like You ll get sick over this you re not looking so well now as you did Come stay at home But he said There are three things one of which I shall do I shall die I shall find the noondah and kill it or I shall return home unsuccessful In any case I m off again This time he went farther than before saw a zebra killed it bound it and dragged it home singing Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people Of course his mother had to tell him once again My son this is not the noondah eater of the people After a good deal of argument in which his mother s persuasion as usual was of no avail he went off again going farther than ever when he caught a giraffe and when he had killed it he said Well this time I ve been successful This must be the noondah So he dragged it home singing Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people Again his mother had to assure him My son this is not the noondah eater of the people She then pointed out to him that his brothers were not running about hunting for the noondah but staying at home attending to their own business But remarking that all brothers were not alike he expressed his determination to stick to his task until it came to a successful termination and went off again a still greater distance than before While going through the wilderness he espied a rhinoceros asleep under a tree and turning to his attendants he exclaimed At last I see the noondah Where master they all cried eagerly There under the tree Oh h What shall we do they asked And he answered First of all let us eat our fill then we will attack it We have found it in a good place though if it kills us we can t help it So they all took out their arrowroot cakes and ate till they were satisfied Then Mkaaah Jeechonee said Each of you take two guns lay one beside you and take the other in your hands and at the proper time let us all fire at once And they said All right master So they crept cautiously through the bushes and got around to the other side of the tree at the back of the rhinoceros then they closed up till they were quite near it and all fired together The beast jumped up ran a little way and then fell down dead They bound it and dragged it for two whole days until they reached the town when Mkaaah Jeechonee began singing Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people But he received the same answer from his mother My son this is not the noondah eater of the people And many persons came and looked at the rhinoceros and felt very sorry for the young man As for his father and mother they both begged of him to give up his father offering to give him anything he possessed if he would only stay at home But he said I don t hear what you are saying good bye and was off again This time he still further increased the distance from his home and at last he saw an elephant asleep at noon in the forest Thereupon he said to his attendants Now we have found the noondah Ah where is he said they Yonder in the shade Do you see it Oh yes master shall we march up to it If we march up to it and it is looking this way it will come at us and if it does that some of us will be killed I think we had best let one man steal up close and see which way its face is turned As every one thought this was a good idea a slave named Keerobo to crept on his hands and knees and had a good look at it When he returned in the same manner his master asked Well what s the news Is it the noondah I do not know replied Keeroboto but I think there is very little doubt that it is It is broad with a very big head and goodness I never saw such large ears All right said Mkaaah Jeechonee let us eat and then go for it So they took their arrowroot cakes and their molasses cakes and ate until they were quite full Then the youth said to them My people to day is perhaps the last we shall ever see so we will take leave of each other Those who are to escape will escape and those who are to die will die but if I die let those who escape tell my mother and father not to grieve for me But his attendants said Oh come along master none of us will die please God So they went on their hands and knees till they were close up and then they said to Mkaaah Jeechonee Give us your plan master but he said There is no plan only let all fire at once Well they fired all at once and immediately the elephant jumped up and charged at them Then such a helter skelter flight as there was They threw away their guns and everything they carried and made for the trees which they climbed with surprising alacrity As to the elephant he kept straight ahead until he fell down some distance away They all remained in the trees from three until six o clock in the morning without food and without clothing The young man sat in his tree and wept bitterly saying I don t exactly know what death is but it seems to me this must be very like it As no one could see any one else he did not know where his attendants were and though he wished to come down from the tree he thought Maybe the noondah is down below there and will eat me Each attendant was in exactly the same fix wishing to come down but afraid the noondah was waiting to eat him Keeroboto had seen the elephant fall but was afraid to get down by himself saying Perhaps though it has fallen down it is not dead But presently he saw a dog go up to it and smell it and then he was sure it was dead Then he got down from the tree as fast as he could and gave a signal cry which was answered but not being sure from whence the answer came he repeated the cry listening intently When it was answered he went straight to the place from which the sound proceeded and found two of his companions in one tree To them he said Come on get down the noondah is dead So they got down quickly and hunted around until they found their master When they told him the news he came down also and after a little the attendants had all gathered together and had picked up their guns and their clothes and were all right again But they were all weak and hungry so they rested and ate some food after which they went to examine their prize As soon as Mkaaah Jeechonee saw it he said Ah this is the noondah This is it This is it And they all agreed that it was it So they dragged the elephant three days to their town and then the youth began singing Oh mother this is he The noondah eater of the people He was naturally quite upset when his mother replied My son this is not the noondah eater of the people She further said Poor boy what trouble you have been through All the people are astonished that one so young should have such a great understanding Then his father and mother began their entreaties again and finally it was agreed that this next trip should be his last whatever the result might be Well they started off again and went on and on past the forest until they came to a very high mountain at the foot of which they camped for the night In the morning they cooked their rice and ate it and then Mkaaah Jeechonee said Let us now climb the mountain and look all over the country from its peak And they went and they went until after a long weary while they reached the top where they sat down to rest and form their plans Now one of the attendants named Shindaa no while walking about cast his eyes down the side of the mountain and suddenly saw a great beast about half way down but he could not make out its appearance distinctly on account of the distance and the trees Calling his master he pointed it out to him and something in Mkaaah Jeechonee s heart told him that it was the noondah To make sure however he took his gun and his spear and went partly down the mountain to get a better view Ah said he this must be the noondah My mother told me its ears were small and those are small she told me the noondah is broad and short and so is this she said it has two blotches like a civet cat and there are the blotches she told me the tail is thick and there is a thick tail It must be the noondah Then he went back to his attendants and bade them eat heartily which they did Next he told them to leave every unnecessary thing behind because if they had to run they would be better without encumbrance and if they were victorious they could return for their goods When they had made all their arrangements they started down the mountain but when they had got about half way down Keeroboto and Shindaano were afraid Then the youth said to them Oh let s go on don t be afraid We all have to live and die What are you frightened about So thus encouraged they went on When they came near the place Mkaaah Jeechonee ordered them to take off all their clothing except one piece and to place that tightly on their bodies so that if they had to run they would not be caught by thorns or branches So when they came close to the beast they saw that it was asleep and all agreed that it was the noondah Then the young man said Now the sun is setting shall we fire at it or let be till morning And they all wished to fire at once and see what the result would be without further tax on their nerves therefore they arranged that they should all fire together They all crept up close and when the master gave the word they discharged their guns together The noondah did not move that one dose had been sufficient Nevertheless they all turned and scampered up to the top of the mountain There they ate and rested for the night In the morning they ate their rice and then went down to see how matters were when they found the beast lying dead After resting and eating they started homeward dragging the dead beast with them On the fourth day it began to give indications of decay and the attendants wished to abandon it but Mkaaah Jeechonee said they would continue to drag it if there was only one bone left When they came near the town he began to sing Mother mother I have come From the evil spirits home Mother listen while I sing While I tell you what I bring Oh mother I have killed The noondah eater of the people And when his mother looked out she cried My son this is the noondah eater of the people Then all the people came out to welcome him and his father was overcome with joy and loaded him with honors and procured him a rich and beautiful wife and when he died Mkaaah Jeechonee became sultan and lived long and happily beloved by all the people IX THE MAGICIAN AND THE SULTAN S SON There was once a sultan who had three little sons and no one seemed to be able to teach them anything which greatly grieved both the sultan and his wife One day a magician came to the sultan and said If I take your three boys and teach them to read and write and make great scholars of them what will you give me And the sultan said I will give you half of my property No said the magician that won t do I ll give you half of the towns I own No that will not satisfy me What do you want then When I have made them scholars and bring them back to you choose two of them for yourself and give me the third for I want to have a companion of my own Agreed said the sultan So the magician took them away and in a remarkably short time taught them to read and to make letters and made them quite good scholars Then he took them back to the sultan and said Here are the children They are all equally good scholars Choose So the sultan took the two he preferred and the magician went away with the third whose name was Keejaa naa to his own house which was a very large one When they arrived Mchaa wee the magician gave the youth all the keys saying Open whatever you wish to Then he told him that he was his father and that he was going away for a month When he was gone Keejaanaa took the keys and went to examine the house He opened one door and saw a room full of liquid gold He put his finger in and the gold stuck to it and wipe and rub as he would the gold would not come off so he wrapped a piece of rag around it and when his supposed father came home and saw the rag and asked him what he had been doing to his finger he was afraid to tell him the truth so he said that he had cut it Not very long after Mchaawee went away again and the youth took the keys and continued his investigations The first room he opened was filled with the bones of goats the next with sheep s bones the next with the bones of oxen the fourth with the bones of donkeys the fifth with those of horses the sixth contained men s skulls and in the seventh was a live horse Hullo said the horse where do you come from you son of Adam This is my father s house said Keejaanaa Oh indeed was the reply Well you ve got a pretty nice parent Do you know that he occupies himself with eating people and donkeys and horses and oxen and goats and everything he can lay his hands on You and I are the only living things left This scared the youth pretty badly and he faltered What are we to do What s your name said the horse Keejaanaa Well I m Faaraa see Now Keejaanaa first of all come and unfasten me The youth did so at once Now then open the door of the room with the gold in it and I will swallow it all then I ll go and wait for you under the big tree down the road a little way When the magician comes home he will say to you Let us go for firewood then you answer I don t understand that work and he will go by himself When he comes back he will put a great big pot on the hook and will tell you to make a fire under it Tell him you don t know how to make a fire and he will make it himself Then he will bring a large quantity of butter and while it is getting hot he will put up a swing and say to you Get up there and I ll swing you But you tell him you never played at that game and ask him to swing first that you may see how it is done Then he will get up to show you and you must push him into the big pot and then come to me as quickly as you can Then the horse went away Now Mchaawee had invited some of his friends to a feast at his house that evening so returning home early he said to Keejaanaa Let us go for firewood but the youth answered I don t understand that work So he went by himself and brought the wood Then he hung up the big pot and said Light the fire but the youth said I don t know how to do it So the magician laid the wood under the pot and lighted it himself Then he said Put all that butter in the pot but the youth answered I can t lift it I m not strong enough So he put in the butter himself Next Mchaawee said Have you seen our country game And Keejaanaa answered I think not Well said the magician let s play at it while the butter is getting hot So he tied up the swing and said to Keejaanaa Get up here and learn the game But the youth said You get up first and show me I ll learn quicker that way The magician got into the swing and just as he got started Keejaanaa gave him a push right into the big pot and as the butter was by this time boiling it not only killed him but cooked him also As soon as the youth had pushed the magician into the big pot he ran as fast as he could to the big tree where the horse was waiting for him Come on said Faaraasee jump on my back and let s be going So he mounted and they started off When the magician s guests arrived they looked everywhere for him but of course could not find him Then after waiting a while they began to be very hungry so looking around for something to eat they saw that the stew in the big pot was done and saying to each other Let s begin anyway they started in and ate the entire contents of the pot After they had finished they searched for Mchaawee again and finding lots of provisions in the house they thought they would stay there until he came but after they had waited a couple of days and eaten all the food in the place they gave him up and returned to their homes Meanwhile Keejaanaa and the horse continued on their way until they had gone a great distance and at last they stopped near a large town Let us stay here said the youth and build a house As Faaraasee was agreeable they did so The horse coughed up all the gold he had swallowed with which they purchased slaves and cattle and everything they needed When the people of the town saw the beautiful new house and all the slaves and cattle and riches it contained they went and told their sultan who at once made up his mind that the owner of such a place must be of sufficient importance to be visited and taken notice of as an acquisition to the neighborhood So he called on Keejaanaa and inquired who he was Oh I m just an ordinary being like other people Are you a traveler Well I have been but I like this place and think I ll settle down here Why don t you come and walk in our town I should like to very much but I need some one to show me around Oh I ll show you around said the sultan eagerly for he was quite taken with the young man After this Keejaanaa and the sultan became great friends and in the course of time the young man married the sultan s daughter and they had one son They lived very happily together and Keejaanaa loved Faaraasee as his own soul X THE PHYSICIAN S SON AND THE KING OF THE SNAKES Once there was a very learned physician who died leaving his wife with a little baby boy whom when he was old enough she named according to his father s wish Hassee boo Kareem Ed Deen When the boy had been to school and had learned to read his mother sent him to a tailor to learn his trade but he could not learn it Then he was sent to a silversmith but he could not learn his trade either After that he tried many trades but could learn none of them At last his mother said Well stay at home for a while and that seemed to suit him One day he asked his mother what his father s business had been and she told him he was a very great physician Where are his books he asked Well it s a long time since I saw them replied his mother but I think they are behind there Look and see So he hunted around a little and at last found them but they were almost ruined by insects and he gained little from them At last four of the neighbors came to his mother and said Let your boy go along with us and cut wood in the forest It was their business to cut wood load it on donkeys and sell it in the town for making fires All right said she to morrow I ll buy him a donkey and he can start fair with you So the next day Hasseeboo with his donkey went off with those four persons and they worked very hard and made a lot of money that day This continued for six days but on the seventh day it rained heavily and they had to get under the rocks to keep dry Now Hasseeboo sat in a place by himself and having nothing else to do he picked up a stone and began knocking on the ground with it To his surprise the ground gave forth a hollow sound and he called to his companions saying There seems to be a hole under here Upon hearing him knock again they decided to dig and see what was the cause of the hollow sound and they had not gone very deep before they broke into a large pit like a well which was filled to the top with honey They didn t do any firewood chopping after that but devoted their entire attention to the collection and sale of the honey With a view to getting it all out as quickly as possible they told Hasseeboo to go down into the pit and dip out the honey while they put it in vessels and took it to town for sale They worked for three days making a great deal of money At last there was only a little honey left at the very bottom of the pit and they told the boy to scrape that together while they went to get a rope to haul him out But instead of getting the rope they decided to let him remain in the pit and divide the money among themselves So when he had gathered the remainder of the honey together and called for the rope he received no answer and after he had been alone in the pit for three days he became convinced that his companions had deserted him Then those four persons went to his mother and told her that they had become separated in the forest that they had heard a lion roaring and that they could find no trace of either her son or his donkey His mother of course cried very much and the four neighbors pocketed her son s share of the money To return to Hasseeboo He passed the time walking about the pit wondering what the end would be eating scraps of honey sleeping a little and sitting down to think While engaged in the last occupation on the fourth day he saw a scorpion fall to the ground a large one too and he killed it Then suddenly he thought to himself Where did that scorpion come from There must be a hole somewhere I ll search anyhow So he searched around until he saw light through a tiny crack and he took his knife and scooped and scooped until he had made a hole big enough to pass through then he went out and came upon a place he had never seen before Seeing a path he followed it until he came to a very large house the door of which was not fastened So he went inside and saw golden doors with golden locks and keys of pearl and beautiful chairs inlaid with jewels and precious stones and in a reception room he saw a couch covered with a splendid spread upon which he lay down Presently he found himself being lifted off the couch and put in a chair and heard some one saying Do not hurt him wake him gently and on opening his eyes he found himself surrounded by numbers of snakes one of them wearing beautiful royal colors Hullo he cried who are you I am Sulta nee Waa Neeo ka king of the snakes and this is my house Who are you I am Hasseeboo Kareem Ed Deen Where do you come from I don t know where I come from or where I m going Well don t bother yourself just now Let s eat I guess you are hungry and I know I am Then the king gave orders and some of the other snakes brought the finest fruits and they ate and drank and conversed When the repast was ended the king desired to hear Hasseeboo s story so he told him all that had happened and then asked to hear the story of his host Well said the king of the snakes mine is rather a long story but you shall hear it A long time ago I left this place to go and live in the mountains of Al Kaaf for the change of air One day I saw a stranger coming along and I said to him Where are you from and he said I am wandering in the wilderness Whose son are you I asked My name is Bolookee a My father was a sultan and when he died I opened a small chest inside of which I found a bag which contained a small brass box when I had opened this I found some writing tied up in a woolen cloth and it was all in praise of a prophet He was described as such a good and wonderful man that I longed to see him but when I made inquiries concerning him I was told he was not yet born Then I vowed I would wander until I should see him So I left our town and all my property and I am wandering but I have not yet seen that prophet Then I said to him Where do you expect to find him if he s not yet born Perhaps if you had some serpent s water you might keep on living until you find him But it s of no use talking about that the serpent s water is too far away Well he said good bye I must wander on So I bade him farewell and he went his way Now when that man had wandered until he reached Egypt he met another man who asked him Who are you I am Bolookeea Who are you My name is Al Faan Where are you going I have left my home and my property and I am seeking the prophet H m said Al Faan I can tell you of a better occupation than looking for a man that is not born yet Let us go and find the king of the snakes and get him to give us a charm medicine then we will go to King Solomon and get his rings and we shall be able to make slaves of the genii and order them to do whatever we wish And Bolookeea said I have seen the king of the snakes in the mountain of Al Kaaf All right said Al Faan let s go Now Al Faan wanted the ring of Solomon that he might be a great magician and control the genii and the birds while all Bolookeea wanted was to see the great prophet As they went along Al Faan said to Bolookeea Let us make a cage and entice the king of the snakes into it then we will shut the door and carry him off All right said Bolookeea So they made a cage and put therein a cup of milk and a cup of wine and brought it to Al Kaaf and I like a fool went in drank up all the wine and became drunk Then they fastened the door and took me away with them When I came to my senses I found myself in the cage and Bolookeea carrying me and I said The sons of Adam are no good What do you want from me And they answered We want some medicine to put on our feet so that we may walk upon the water whenever it is necessary in the course of our journey Well said I go along We went on until we came to a place where there were a great number and variety of trees and when those trees saw me they said I am medicine for this I am medicine for that I am medicine for the head I am medicine for the feet and presently one tree said If any one puts my medicine upon his feet he can walk on water When I told that to those men they said That is what we want and they took a great deal of it Then they took me back to the mountain and set me free and we said good bye and parted When they left me they went on their way until they reached the sea when they put the medicine on their feet and walked over Thus they went many days until they came near to the place of King Solomon where they waited while Al Faan prepared his medicines When they arrived at King Solomon s place he was sleeping and was being watched by genii and his hand lay on his chest with the ring on his finger As Bolookeea drew near one of the genii said to him Where are you going And he answered I m here with Al Faan he s going to take that ring Go back said the genie keep out of the way That man is going to die When Al Faan had finished his preparations he said to Bolookeea Wait here for me Then he went forward to take the ring when a great cry arose and he was thrown by some unseen force a considerable distance Picking himself up and still believing in the power of his medicines he approached the ring again when a strong breath blew upon him and he was burnt to ashes in a moment While Bolookeea was looking at all this a voice said Go your way this wretched being is dead So he returned and when he got to the sea again he put the medicine upon his feet and passed over and continued to wander for many years One morning he saw a man sitting down and said Good morning to which the man replied Then Bolookeea asked him Who are you and he answered My name is Jan Shah Who are you So Bolookeea told him who he was and asked him to tell him his history The man who was weeping and smiling by turns insisted upon hearing Bolookeea s story first After he had heard it he said Well sit down and I ll tell you my story from beginning to end My name is Jan Shah and my father is Tooeegha mus a great sultan He used to go every day into the forest to shoot game so one day I said to him Father let me go with you into the forest to day but he said Stay at home You are better there Then I cried bitterly and as I was his only child whom he loved dearly he couldn t stand my tears so he said Very well you shall go Don t cry Thus we went to the forest and took many attendants with us and when we reached the place we ate and drank and then every one set out to hunt I and my seven slaves went on until we saw a beautiful gazelle which we chased as far as the sea without capturing it When the gazelle took to the water I and four of my slaves took a boat the other three returning to my father and we chased that gazelle until we lost sight of the shore but we caught it and killed it Just then a great wind began to blow and we lost our way When the other three slaves came to my father he asked them Where is your master and they told him about the gazelle and the boat Then he cried My son is lost My son is lost and returned to the town and mourned for me as one dead After a time we came to an island where there were a great many birds We found fruit and water we ate and drank and at night we climbed into a tree and slept till morning Then we rowed to a second island and seeing no one around we gathered fruit ate and drank and climbed a tree as before During the night we heard many savage beasts howling and roaring near us In the morning we got away as soon as possible and came to a third island Looking around for food we saw a tree full of fruit like red streaked apples but as we were about to pick some we heard a voice say Don t touch this tree it belongs to the king Toward night a number of monkeys came who seemed much pleased to see us and they brought us all the fruit we could eat Presently I heard one of them say Let us make this man our sultan Then another one said What s the use They ll all run away in the morning But a third one said Not if we smash their boat Sure enough when we started to leave in the morning our boat was broken in pieces So there was nothing for it but to stay there and be entertained by the monkeys who seemed to like us very much One day while strolling about I came upon a great stone house having an inscription on the door which said When any man comes to this island he will find it difficult to leave because the monkeys desire to have a man for their king If he looks for a way to escape he will think there is none but there is one outlet which lies to the north If you go in that direction you will come to a great plain which is infested with lions leopards and snakes You must fight all of them and if you overcome them you can go forward You will then come to another great plain inhabited by ants as big as dogs their teeth are like those of dogs and they are very fierce You must fight these also and if you overcome them the rest of the way is clear I consulted with my attendants over this information and we came to the conclusion that as we could only die anyhow we might as well risk death to gain our freedom As we all had weapons we set forth and when we came to the first plain we fought and two of my slaves were killed Then we went on to the second plain fought again my other two slaves were killed and I alone escaped After that I wandered on for many days living on whatever I could find until at last I came to a town where I stayed for some time looking for employment but finding none One day a man came up to me and said Are you looking for work I am said I Come with me then said he and we went to his house When we got there he produced a camel s skin and said I shall put you in this skin and a great bird will carry you to the top of yonder mountain When he gets you there he will tear this skin off you You must then drive him away and push down the precious stones you will find there When they are all down I will get you down So he put me in the skin the bird carried me to the top of the mountain and was about to eat me when I jumped up scared him away and then pushed down many precious stones Then I called out to the man to take me down but he never answered me and went away I gave myself up for a dead man but went wandering about until at last after passing many days in a great forest I came to a house all by itself the old man who lived in it gave me food and drink and I was revived I remained there a long time and that old man loved me as if I were his own son One day he went away and giving me the keys told me I could open the door of every room except one which he pointed out to me Of course when he was gone this was the first door I opened I saw a large garden through which a stream flowed Just then three birds came and alighted by the side of the stream Immediately they changed to three most beautiful women When they had finished bathing they put on their clothes and as I stood watching them they changed into birds again and flew away I locked the door and went away but my appetite was gone and I wandered about aimlessly When the old man came back he saw there was something wrong with me and asked me what was the matter Then I told him I had seen those beautiful maidens that I loved one of them very much and that if I could not marry her I should die The old man told me I could not possibly have my wish He said the three lovely beings were the daughters of the sultan of the genii and that their home was a journey of three years from where we then were I told him I couldn t help that He must get her for my wife or I should die At last he said Well wait till they come again then hide yourself and steal the clothes of the one you love so dearly So I waited and when they came again I stole the clothes of the youngest whose name was Sayadaa tee Shems When they came out of the water this one could not find her clothes Then I stepped forward and said I have them Ah she begged give them to me their owner I want to go away But I said to her I love you very much I want to marry you I want to go to my father she replied You cannot go said I Then her sisters flew away and I took her into the house where the old man married us He told me not to give her those clothes I had taken but to hide them because if she ever got them she would fly away to her old home So I dug a hole in the ground and buried them But one day when I was away from home she dug them up and put them on then saying to the slave I had given her for an attendant When your master returns tell him I have gone home if he really loves me he will follow me she flew away When I came home they told me this and I wandered searching for her many years At last I came to a town where one asked me Who are you and I answered I am Jan Shah What was your father s name Taaeeghamus Are you the man who married our mistress Who is your mistress Sayadaatee Shems I am he I cried with delight They took me to their mistress and she brought me to her father and told him I was her husband and everybody was happy Then we thought we should like to visit our old home and her father s genii carried us there in three days We stayed there a year and then returned but in a short time my wife died Her father tried to comfort me and wanted me to marry another of his daughters but I refused to be comforted and have mourned to this day That is my story Then Bolookeea went on his way and wandered till he died Next Sultaanee Waa Neeoka said to Hasseeboo Now when you go home you will do me injury Hasseeboo was very indignant at the idea and said I could not be induced to do you an injury Pray send me home I will send you home said the king but I am sure that you will come back and kill me Why I dare not be so ungrateful exclaimed Hasseeboo I swear I could not hurt you Well said the king of the snakes bear this in mind when you go home do not go to bathe where there are many people And he said I will remember So the king sent him home and he went to his mother s house and she was overjoyed to find that he was not dead Now the sultan of the town was very sick and it was decided that the only thing that could cure him would be to kill the king of the snakes boil him and give the soup to the sultan For a reason known only to himself the vizir had placed men at the public baths with this instruction If any one who comes to bathe here has a mark on his stomach seize him and bring him to me When Hasseeboo had been home three days he forgot the warning of Sultaanee Waa Neeoka and went to bathe with the other people All of a sudden he was seized by some soldiers and brought before the vizir who said Take us to the home of the king of the snakes I don t know where it is said Hasseeboo Tie him up commanded the vizir So they tied him up and beat him until his back was all raw and being unable to stand the pain he cried Let up I will show you the place So he led them to the house of the king of the snakes who when he saw him said Didn t I tell you you would come back to kill me How could I help it cried Hasseeboo Look at my back Who has beaten you so dreadfully asked the king The vizir Then there s no hope for me But you must carry me yourself As they went along the king said to Hasseeboo When we get to your town I shall be killed and cooked The first skimming the vizir will offer to you but don t you drink it put it in a bottle and keep it The second skimming you must drink and you will become a great physician The third skimming is the medicine that will cure your sultan When the vizir asks you if you drank that first skimming say I did Then produce the bottle containing the first and say This is the second and it is for you The vizir will take it and as soon as he drinks it he will die and both of us will have our revenge Everything happened as the king had said The vizir died the sultan recovered and Hasseeboo was loved by all as a great physician End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Zanzibar Tales by Various END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG
