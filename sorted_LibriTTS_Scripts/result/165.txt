Norris CHAPTER one It was Sunday and according to his custom on that day McTeague took his dinner at two in the afternoon at the car conductors coffee joint on Polk Street He had a thick gray soup heavy underdone meat very hot on a cold plate two kinds of vegetables and a sort of suet pudding full of strong butter and sugar On his way back to his office one block above he stopped at Joe Frenna s saloon and bought a pitcher of steam beer It was his habit to leave the pitcher there on his way to dinner Once in his office or as he called it on his signboard Dental Parlors he took off his coat and shoes unbuttoned his vest and having crammed his little stove full of coke lay back in his operating chair at the bay window reading the paper drinking his beer and smoking his huge porcelain pipe while his food digested crop full stupid and warm By and by gorged with steam beer and overcome by the heat of the room the cheap tobacco and the effects of his heavy meal he dropped off to sleep Late in the afternoon his canary bird in its gilt cage just over his head began to sing He woke slowly finished the rest of his beer very flat and stale by this time and taking down his concertina from the bookcase where in week days it kept the company of seven volumes of Allen s Practical Dentist played upon it some half dozen very mournful airs McTeague looked forward to these Sunday afternoons as a period of relaxation and enjoyment He invariably spent them in the same fashion These were his only pleasures to eat to smoke to sleep and to play upon his concertina The six lugubrious airs that he knew always carried him back to the time when he was a car boy at the Big Dipper Mine in Placer County ten years before He remembered the years he had spent there trundling the heavy cars of ore in and out of the tunnel under the direction of his father For thirteen days of each fortnight his father was a steady hard working shift boss of the mine Every other Sunday he became an irresponsible animal a beast a brute crazy with alcohol McTeague remembered his mother too who with the help of the Chinaman cooked for forty miners She was an overworked drudge fiery and energetic for all that filled with the one idea of having her son rise in life and enter a profession The chance had come at last when the father died corroded with alcohol collapsing in a few hours Two or three years later a travelling dentist visited the mine and put up his tent near the bunk house He was more or less of a charlatan but he fired missus McTeague s ambition and young McTeague went away with him to learn his profession He had learnt it after a fashion mostly by watching the charlatan operate He had read many of the necessary books but he was too hopelessly stupid to get much benefit from them Then one day at San Francisco had come the news of his mother s death she had left him some money not much but enough to set him up in business so he had cut loose from the charlatan and had opened his Dental Parlors on Polk Street an accommodation street of small shops in the residence quarter of the town Here he had slowly collected a clientele of butcher boys shop girls drug clerks and car conductors He made but few acquaintances Polk Street called him the Doctor and spoke of his enormous strength For McTeague was a young giant carrying his huge shock of blond hair six feet three inches from the ground moving his immense limbs heavy with ropes of muscle slowly ponderously His hands were enormous red and covered with a fell of stiff yellow hair they were hard as wooden mallets strong as vises the hands of the old time car boy Often he dispensed with forceps and extracted a refractory tooth with his thumb and finger His head was square cut angular the jaw salient like that of the carnivora McTeague s mind was as his body heavy slow to act sluggish Yet there was nothing vicious about the man Altogether he suggested the draught horse immensely strong stupid docile obedient When he opened his Dental Parlors he felt that his life was a success that he could hope for nothing better In spite of the name there was but one room It was a corner room on the second floor over the branch post office and faced the street McTeague made it do for a bedroom as well sleeping on the big bed lounge against the wall opposite the window There was a washstand behind the screen in the corner where he manufactured his moulds In the round bay window were his operating chair his dental engine and the movable rack on which he laid out his instruments Three chairs a bargain at the second hand store ranged themselves against the wall with military precision underneath a steel engraving of the court of Lorenzo de Medici which he had bought because there were a great many figures in it for the money Over the bed lounge hung a rifle manufacturer s advertisement calendar which he never used The other ornaments were a small marble topped centre table covered with back numbers of The American System of Dentistry a stone pug dog sitting before the little stove and a thermometer A stand of shelves occupied one corner filled with the seven volumes of Allen s Practical Dentist On the top shelf McTeague kept his concertina and a bag of bird seed for the canary The whole place exhaled a mingled odor of bedding creosote and ether But for one thing McTeague would have been perfectly contented Just outside his window was his signboard a modest affair that read Doctor McTeague Dental Parlors Gas Given but that was all It was his ambition his dream to have projecting from that corner window a huge gilded tooth a molar with enormous prongs something gorgeous and attractive He would have it some day on that he was resolved but as yet such a thing was far beyond his means When he had finished the last of his beer McTeague slowly wiped his lips and huge yellow mustache with the side of his hand Bull like he heaved himself laboriously up and going to the window stood looking down into the street The street never failed to interest him It was one of those cross streets peculiar to Western cities situated in the heart of the residence quarter but occupied by small tradespeople who lived in the rooms above their shops There were corner drug stores with huge jars of red yellow and green liquids in their windows very brave and gay stationers stores where illustrated weeklies were tacked upon bulletin boards barber shops with cigar stands in their vestibules sad looking plumbers offices cheap restaurants in whose windows one saw piles of unopened oysters weighted down by cubes of ice and china pigs and cows knee deep in layers of white beans At one end of the street McTeague could see the huge power house of the cable line Immediately opposite him was a great market while farther on over the chimney stacks of the intervening houses the glass roof of some huge public baths glittered like crystal in the afternoon sun Underneath him the branch post office was opening its doors as was its custom between two and three o clock on Sunday afternoons An acrid odor of ink rose upward to him Occasionally a cable car passed trundling heavily with a strident whirring of jostled glass windows On week days the street was very lively It woke to its work about seven o clock at the time when the newsboys made their appearance together with the day laborers The laborers went trudging past in a straggling file plumbers apprentices their pockets stuffed with sections of lead pipe tweezers and pliers carpenters carrying nothing but their little pasteboard lunch baskets painted to imitate leather gangs of street workers their overalls soiled with yellow clay their picks and long handled shovels over their shoulders plasterers spotted with lime from head to foot This little army of workers tramping steadily in one direction met and mingled with other toilers of a different description conductors and swing men of the cable company going on duty heavy eyed night clerks from the drug stores on their way home to sleep roundsmen returning to the precinct police station to make their night report and Chinese market gardeners teetering past under their heavy baskets The cable cars began to fill up all along the street could be seen the shopkeepers taking down their shutters Between seven and eight the street breakfasted Now and then a waiter from one of the cheap restaurants crossed from one sidewalk to the other balancing on one palm a tray covered with a napkin Everywhere was the smell of coffee and of frying steaks A little later following in the path of the day laborers came the clerks and shop girls dressed with a certain cheap smartness always in a hurry glancing apprehensively at the power house clock Their employers followed an hour or so later on the cable cars for the most part whiskered gentlemen with huge stomachs reading the morning papers with great gravity bank cashiers and insurance clerks with flowers in their buttonholes At the same time the school children invaded the street filling the air with a clamor of shrill voices stopping at the stationers shops or idling a moment in the doorways of the candy stores For over half an hour they held possession of the sidewalks then suddenly disappeared leaving behind one or two stragglers who hurried along with great strides of their little thin legs very anxious and preoccupied Towards eleven o clock the ladies from the great avenue a block above Polk Street made their appearance promenading the sidewalks leisurely deliberately They were at their morning s marketing They were handsome women beautifully dressed They knew by name their butchers and grocers and vegetable men From his window McTeague saw them in front of the stalls gloved and veiled and daintily shod the subservient provision men at their elbows scribbling hastily in the order books They all seemed to know one another these grand ladies from the fashionable avenue Meetings took place here and there a conversation was begun others arrived groups were formed little impromptu receptions were held before the chopping blocks of butchers stalls or on the sidewalk around boxes of berries and fruit From noon to evening the population of the street was of a mixed character The street was busiest at that time a vast and prolonged murmur arose the mingled shuffling of feet the rattle of wheels the heavy trundling of cable cars At four o clock the school children once more swarmed the sidewalks again disappearing with surprising suddenness At six the great homeward march commenced the cars were crowded the laborers thronged the sidewalks the newsboys chanted the evening papers Then all at once the street fell quiet hardly a soul was in sight the sidewalks were deserted It was supper hour Evening began and one by one a multitude of lights from the demoniac glare of the druggists windows to the dazzling blue whiteness of the electric globes grew thick from street corner to street corner Once more the street was crowded Now there was no thought but for amusement The cable cars were loaded with theatre goers men in high hats and young girls in furred opera cloaks On the sidewalks were groups and couples the plumbers apprentices the girls of the ribbon counters the little families that lived on the second stories over their shops the dressmakers the small doctors the harness makers all the various inhabitants of the street were abroad strolling idly from shop window to shop window taking the air after the day s work Groups of girls collected on the corners talking and laughing very loud making remarks upon the young men that passed them The tamale men appeared A band of Salvationists began to sing before a saloon Then little by little Polk Street dropped back to solitude Eleven o clock struck from the power house clock Lights were extinguished At one o clock the cable stopped leaving an abrupt silence in the air All at once it seemed very still The ugly noises were the occasional footfalls of a policeman and the persistent calling of ducks and geese in the closed market The street was asleep Day after day McTeague saw the same panorama unroll itself The bay window of his Dental Parlors was for him a point of vantage from which he watched the world go past On Sundays however all was changed As he stood in the bay window after finishing his beer wiping his lips and looking out into the street McTeague was conscious of the difference Nearly all the stores were closed No wagons passed A few people hurried up and down the sidewalks dressed in cheap Sunday finery A cable car went by on the outside seats were a party of returning picnickers The mother the father a young man and a young girl and three children The two older people held empty lunch baskets in their laps while the bands of the children s hats were stuck full of oak leaves The girl carried a huge bunch of wilting poppies and wild flowers As the car approached McTeague s window the young man got up and swung himself off the platform waving goodby to the party Suddenly McTeague recognized him There s Marcus Schouler he muttered behind his mustache Marcus Schouler was the dentist s one intimate friend The acquaintance had begun at the car conductors coffee joint where the two occupied the same table and met at every meal Then they made the discovery that they both lived in the same flat Marcus occupying a room on the floor above McTeague On different occasions McTeague had treated Marcus for an ulcerated tooth and had refused to accept payment Soon it came to be an understood thing between them They were pals McTeague listening heard Marcus go up stairs to his room above In a few minutes his door opened again McTeague knew that he had come out into the hall and was leaning over the banisters Oh Mac he called McTeague came to his door Hullo sthat you Mark Sure answered Marcus Come on up You come on down No come on up Oh you come on down Oh you lazy duck retorted Marcus coming down the stairs Been out to the Cliff House on a picnic he explained as he sat down on the bed lounge with my uncle and his people the Sieppes you know By damn it was hot he suddenly vociferated Just look at that Just look at that he cried dragging at his limp collar That s the third one since morning it is it is for a fact and you got your stove going He began to tell about the picnic talking very loud and fast gesturing furiously very excited over trivial details Marcus could not talk without getting excited You ought t have seen y ought t have seen I tell you it was outa sight It was it was for a fact Yes yes answered McTeague bewildered trying to follow Yes that s so In recounting a certain dispute with an awkward bicyclist in which it appeared he had become involved Marcus quivered with rage Say that again says I to um Just say that once more and here a rolling explosion of oaths you ll go back to the city in the Morgue wagon Ain t I got a right to cross a street even I d like to know without being run down what I say it s outrageous I d a knifed him in another minute It was an outrage I say it was an OUTRAGE Sure it was McTeague hastened to reply Sure sure Oh and we had an accident shouted the other suddenly off on another tack It was awful Trina was in the swing there that s my cousin Trina you know who I mean and she fell out By damn I thought she d killed herself struck her face on a rock and knocked out a front tooth It s a wonder she didn t kill herself It IS a wonder it is for a fact Ain t it now Huh Ain t it Y ought t have seen McTeague had a vague idea that Marcus Schouler was stuck on his cousin Trina They kept company a good deal Marcus took dinner with the Sieppes every Saturday evening at their home at B Street station across the bay and Sunday afternoons he and the family usually made little excursions into the suburbs McTeague began to wonder dimly how it was that on this occasion Marcus had not gone home with his cousin As sometimes happens Marcus furnished the explanation upon the instant I promised a duck up here on the avenue I d call for his dog at four this afternoon Marcus was Old Grannis s assistant in a little dog hospital that the latter had opened in a sort of alley just off Polk Street some four blocks above Old Grannis lived in one of the back rooms of McTeague s flat He was an Englishman and an expert dog surgeon but Marcus Schouler was a bungler in the profession His father had been a veterinary surgeon who had kept a livery stable near by on California Street and Marcus s knowledge of the diseases of domestic animals had been picked up in a haphazard way much after the manner of McTeague s education Somehow he managed to impress Old Grannis a gentle simple minded old man with a sense of his fitness bewildering him with a torrent of empty phrases that he delivered with fierce gestures and with a manner of the greatest conviction You d better come along with me Mac observed Marcus We ll get the duck s dog and then we ll take a little walk huh You got nothun to do Come along McTeague went out with him and the two friends proceeded up to the avenue to the house where the dog was to be found It was a huge mansion like place set in an enormous garden that occupied a whole third of the block and while Marcus tramped up the front steps and rang the doorbell boldly to show his independence McTeague remained below on the sidewalk gazing stupidly at the curtained windows the marble steps and the bronze griffins troubled and a little confused by all this massive luxury After they had taken the dog to the hospital and had left him to whimper behind the wire netting they returned to Polk Street and had a glass of beer in the back room of Joe Frenna s corner grocery Ever since they had left the huge mansion on the avenue Marcus had been attacking the capitalists a class which he pretended to execrate It was a pose which he often assumed certain of impressing the dentist Marcus had picked up a few half truths of political economy it was impossible to say where and as soon as the two had settled themselves to their beer in Frenna s back room he took up the theme of the labor question He discussed it at the top of his voice vociferating shaking his fists exciting himself with his own noise He was continually making use of the stock phrases of the professional politician phrases he had caught at some of the ward rallies and ratification meetings These rolled off his tongue with incredible emphasis appearing at every turn of his conversation Outraged constituencies cause of labor wage earners opinions biased by personal interests eyes blinded by party prejudice McTeague listened to him awestruck There s where the evil lies Marcus would cry The masses must learn self control it stands to reason Look at the figures look at the figures Decrease the number of wage earners and you increase wages don t you don t you Absolutely stupid and understanding never a word McTeague would answer Yes yes that s it self control that s the word It s the capitalists that s ruining the cause of labor shouted Marcus banging the table with his fist till the beer glasses danced white livered drones traitors with their livers white as snow eatun the bread of widows and orphuns there s where the evil lies Stupefied with his clamor McTeague answered wagging his head Yes that s it I think it s their livers Suddenly Marcus fell calm again forgetting his pose all in an instant Say Mac I told my cousin Trina to come round and see you about that tooth of her s She ll be in to morrow I guess CHAPTER two After his breakfast the following Monday morning McTeague looked over the appointments he had written down in the book slate that hung against the screen His writing was immense very clumsy and very round with huge full bellied l s and h s He saw that he had made an appointment at one o clock for Miss Baker the retired dressmaker a little old maid who had a tiny room a few doors down the hall It adjoined that of Old Grannis Quite an affair had arisen from this circumstance Miss Baker and Old Grannis were both over sixty and yet it was current talk amongst the lodgers of the flat that the two were in love with each other Singularly enough they were not even acquaintances never a word had passed between them At intervals they met on the stairway he on his way to his little dog hospital she returning from a bit of marketing in the street At such times they passed each other with averted eyes pretending a certain preoccupation suddenly seized with a great embarrassment the timidity of a second childhood He went on about his business disturbed and thoughtful She hurried up to her tiny room her curious little false curls shaking with her agitation the faintest suggestion of a flush coming and going in her withered cheeks The emotion of one of these chance meetings remained with them during all the rest of the day Was it the first romance in the lives of each Did Old Grannis ever remember a certain face amongst those that he had known when he was young Grannis the face of some pale haired girl such as one sees in the old cathedral towns of England Did Miss Baker still treasure up in a seldom opened drawer or box some faded daguerreotype some strange old fashioned likeness with its curling hair and high stock It was impossible to say Maria Macapa the Mexican woman who took care of the lodgers rooms had been the first to call the flat s attention to the affair spreading the news of it from room to room from floor to floor Of late she had made a great discovery all the women folk of the flat were yet vibrant with it Old Grannis came home from his work at four o clock and between that time and six Miss Baker would sit in her room her hands idle in her lap doing nothing listening waiting Old Grannis did the same drawing his arm chair near to the wall knowing that Miss Baker was upon the other side conscious perhaps that she was thinking of him and there the two would sit through the hours of the afternoon listening and waiting they did not know exactly for what but near to each other separated only by the thin partition of their rooms They had come to know each other s habits Old Grannis knew that at quarter of five precisely Miss Baker made a cup of tea over the oil stove on the stand between the bureau and the window Miss Baker felt instinctively the exact moment when Old Grannis took down his little binding apparatus from the second shelf of his clothes closet and began his favorite occupation of binding pamphlets pamphlets that he never read for all that In his Parlors McTeague began his week s work He glanced in the glass saucer in which he kept his sponge gold and noticing that he had used up all his pellets set about making some more In examining Miss Baker s teeth at the preliminary sitting he had found a cavity in one of the incisors Miss Baker had decided to have it filled with gold McTeague remembered now that it was what is called a proximate case where there is not sufficient room to fill with large pieces of gold He told himself that he should have to use mats in the filling He made some dozen of these mats from his tape of non cohesive gold cutting it transversely into small pieces that could be inserted edgewise between the teeth and consolidated by packing After he had made his mats he continued with the other kind of gold fillings such as he would have occasion to use during the week blocks to be used in large proximal cavities made by folding the tape on itself a number of times and then shaping it with the soldering pliers cylinders for commencing fillings which he formed by rolling the tape around a needle called a broach cutting it afterwards into different lengths He worked slowly mechanically turning the foil between his fingers with the manual dexterity that one sometimes sees in stupid persons His head was quite empty of all thought and he did not whistle over his work as another man might have done The canary made up for his silence trilling and chittering continually splashing about in its morning bath keeping up an incessant noise and movement that would have been maddening to any one but McTeague who seemed to have no nerves at all After he had finished his fillings he made a hook broach from a bit of piano wire to replace an old one that he had lost It was time for his dinner then and when he returned from the car conductors coffee joint he found Miss Baker waiting for him The ancient little dressmaker was at all times willing to talk of Old Grannis to anybody that would listen quite unconscious of the gossip of the flat McTeague found her all a flutter with excitement Something extraordinary had happened She had found out that the wall paper in Old Grannis s room was the same as that in hers It has led me to thinking Doctor McTeague she exclaimed shaking her little false curls at him You know my room is so small anyhow and the wall paper being the same the pattern from my room continues right into his I declare I believe at one time that was all one room Think of it do you suppose it was It almost amounts to our occupying the same room I don t know why really do you think I should speak to the landlady about it He bound pamphlets last night until half past nine They say that he s the younger son of a baronet that there are reasons for his not coming to the title his stepfather wronged him cruelly No one had ever said such a thing It was preposterous to imagine any mystery connected with Old Grannis Miss Baker had chosen to invent the little fiction had created the title and the unjust stepfather from some dim memories of the novels of her girlhood She took her place in the operating chair McTeague began the filling There was a long silence It was impossible for McTeague to work and talk at the same time He was just burnishing the last mat in Miss Baker s tooth when the door of the Parlors opened jangling the bell which he had hung over it and which was absolutely unnecessary McTeague turned one foot on the pedal of his dental engine the corundum disk whirling between his fingers It was Marcus Schouler who came in ushering a young girl of about twenty Hello Mac exclaimed Marcus busy Brought my cousin round about that broken tooth McTeague nodded his head gravely In a minute he answered Marcus and his cousin Trina sat down in the rigid chairs underneath the steel engraving of the Court of Lorenzo de Medici They began talking in low tones The girl looked about the room noticing the stone pug dog the rifle manufacturer s calendar the canary in its little gilt prison and the tumbled blankets on the unmade bed lounge against the wall Marcus began telling her about McTeague We re pals he explained just above a whisper Ah Mac s all right you bet Say Trina he s the strongest duck you ever saw What do you suppose He can pull out your teeth with his fingers yes he can What do you think of that With his fingers mind you he can for a fact Get on to the size of him anyhow Ah Mac s all right Maria Macapa had come into the room while he had been speaking She was making up McTeague s bed Suddenly Marcus exclaimed under his breath Now we ll have some fun It s the girl that takes care of the rooms She s a greaser and she s queer in the head She ain t regularly crazy but I don t know she s queer Y ought to hear her go on about a gold dinner service she says her folks used to own Ask her what her name is and see what she ll say Trina shrank back a little frightened No you ask she whispered Ah go on what you fraid of urged Marcus Trina shook her head energetically shutting her lips together Well listen here answered Marcus nudging her then raising his voice he said How do Maria Maria nodded to him over her shoulder as she bent over the lounge Workun hard nowadays Maria Pretty hard Didunt always have to work for your living though did you when you ate offa gold dishes Maria didn t answer except by putting her chin in the air and shutting her eyes as though to say she knew a long story about that if she had a mind to talk All Marcus s efforts to draw her out on the subject were unavailing She only responded by movements of her head Can t always start her going Marcus told his cousin What does she do though when you ask her about her name Oh sure said Marcus who had forgotten Say Maria what s your name Huh asked Maria straightening up her hands on he hips Tell us your name repeated Marcus Name is Maria Miranda Macapa Then after a pause she added as though she had but that moment thought of it Had a flying squirrel an let him go Invariably Maria Macapa made this answer It was not always she would talk about the famous service of gold plate but a question as to her name never failed to elicit the same strange answer delivered in a rapid undertone Name is Maria Miranda Macapa Then as if struck with an after thought Had a flying squirrel an let him go Why Maria should associate the release of the mythical squirrel with her name could not be said About Maria the flat knew absolutely nothing further than that she was Spanish American Miss Baker was the oldest lodger in the flat and Maria was a fixture there as maid of all work when she had come There was a legend to the effect that Maria s people had been at one time immensely wealthy in Central America Maria turned again to her work Trina and Marcus watched her curiously There was a silence The corundum burr in McTeague s engine hummed in a prolonged monotone The canary bird chittered occasionally The room was warm and the breathing of the five people in the narrow space made the air close and thick At long intervals an acrid odor of ink floated up from the branch post office immediately below Maria Macapa finished her work and started to leave As she passed near Marcus and his cousin she stopped and drew a bunch of blue tickets furtively from her pocket Buy a ticket in the lottery she inquired looking at the girl Just a dollar Go along with you Maria said Marcus who had but thirty cents in his pocket Go along it s against the law Buy a ticket urged Maria thrusting the bundle toward Trina Try your luck The butcher on the next block won twenty dollars the last drawing Very uneasy Trina bought a ticket for the sake of being rid of her Maria disappeared Ain t she a queer bird muttered Marcus He was much embarrassed and disturbed because he had not bought the ticket for Trina But there was a sudden movement McTeague had just finished with Miss Baker You should notice the dressmaker said to the dentist in a low voice he always leaves the door a little ajar in the afternoon When she had gone out Marcus Schouler brought Trina forward Say Mac this is my cousin Trina Sieppe The two shook hands dumbly McTeague slowly nodding his huge head with its great shock of yellow hair Trina was very small and prettily made Her face was round and rather pale her eyes long and narrow and blue like the half open eyes of a little baby her lips and the lobes of her tiny ears were pale a little suggestive of anaemia while across the bridge of her nose ran an adorable little line of freckles But it was to her hair that one s attention was most attracted Heaps and heaps of blue black coils and braids a royal crown of swarthy bands a veritable sable tiara heavy abundant odorous All the vitality that should have given color to her face seemed to have been absorbed by this marvellous hair It was the coiffure of a queen that shadowed the pale temples of this little bourgeoise So heavy was it that it tipped her head backward and the position thrust her chin out a little It was a charming poise innocent confiding almost infantile She was dressed all in black very modest and plain The effect of her pale face in all this contrasting black was almost monastic Well exclaimed Marcus suddenly I got to go Must get back to work Don t hurt her too much Mac S long Trina McTeague and Trina were left alone He was embarrassed troubled These young girls disturbed and perplexed him He did not like them obstinately cherishing that intuitive suspicion of all things feminine the perverse dislike of an overgrown boy On the other hand she was perfectly at her ease doubtless the woman in her was not yet awakened she was yet as one might say without sex She was almost like a boy frank candid unreserved She took her place in the operating chair and told him what was the matter looking squarely into his face She had fallen out of a swing the afternoon of the preceding day one of her teeth had been knocked loose and the other altogether broken out McTeague listened to her with apparent stolidity nodding his head from time to time as she spoke The keenness of his dislike of her as a woman began to be blunted He thought she was rather pretty that he even liked her because she was so small so prettily made so good natured and straightforward Let s have a look at your teeth he said picking up his mirror You better take your hat off She leaned back in her chair and opened her mouth showing the rows of little round teeth as white and even as the kernels on an ear of green corn except where an ugly gap came at the side McTeague put the mirror into her mouth touching one and another of her teeth with the handle of an excavator By and by he straightened up wiping the moisture from the mirror on his coat sleeve Well Doctor said the girl anxiously it s a dreadful disfigurement isn t it adding What can you do about it Well answered McTeague slowly looking vaguely about on the floor of the room the roots of the broken tooth are still in the gum they ll have to come out and I guess I ll have to pull that other bicuspid Let me look again Yes he went on in a moment peering into her mouth with the mirror I guess that ll have to come out too The tooth was loose discolored and evidently dead It s a curious case McTeague went on I don t know as I ever had a tooth like that before It s what s called necrosis It don t often happen It ll have to come out sure Then a discussion was opened on the subject Trina sitting up in the chair holding her hat in her lap McTeague leaning against the window frame his hands in his pockets his eyes wandering about on the floor Trina did not want the other tooth removed one hole like that was bad enough but two ah no it was not to be thought of But McTeague reasoned with her tried in vain to make her understand that there was no vascular connection between the root and the gum Trina was blindly persistent with the persistency of a girl who has made up her mind McTeague began to like her better and better and after a while commenced himself to feel that it would be a pity to disfigure such a pretty mouth He became interested perhaps he could do something something in the way of a crown or bridge Let s look at that again he said picking up his mirror He began to study the situation very carefully really desiring to remedy the blemish It was the first bicuspid that was missing and though part of the root of the second the loose one would remain after its extraction he was sure it would not be strong enough to sustain a crown All at once he grew obstinate resolving with all the strength of a crude and primitive man to conquer the difficulty in spite of everything He turned over in his mind the technicalities of the case No evidently the root was not strong enough to sustain a crown besides that it was placed a little irregularly in the arch But fortunately there were cavities in the two teeth on either side of the gap one in the first molar and one in the palatine surface of the cuspid might he not drill a socket in the remaining root and sockets in the molar and cuspid and partly by bridging partly by crowning fill in the gap He made up his mind to do it Why he should pledge himself to this hazardous case McTeague was puzzled to know With most of his clients he would have contented himself with the extraction of the loose tooth and the roots of the broken one Why should he risk his reputation in this case He could not say why It was the most difficult operation he had ever performed He bungled it considerably but in the end he succeeded passably well He extracted the loose tooth with his bayonet forceps and prepared the roots of the broken one as if for filling fitting into them a flattened piece of platinum wire to serve as a dowel But this was only the beginning altogether it was a fortnight s work Trina came nearly every other day and passed two and even three hours in the chair By degrees McTeague s first awkwardness and suspicion vanished entirely The two became good friends McTeague even arrived at that point where he could work and talk to her at the same time a thing that had never before been possible for him Never until then had McTeague become so well acquainted with a girl of Trina s age The younger women of Polk Street the shop girls the young women of the soda fountains the waitresses in the cheap restaurants preferred another dentist a young fellow just graduated from the college a poser a rider of bicycles a man about town who wore astonishing waistcoats and bet money on greyhound coursing Trina was McTeague s first experience With her the feminine element suddenly entered his little world It was not only her that he saw and felt it was the woman the whole sex an entire new humanity strange and alluring that he seemed to have discovered How had he ignored it so long It was dazzling delicious charming beyond all words His narrow point of view was at once enlarged and confused and all at once he saw that there was something else in life besides concertinas and steam beer Everything had to be made over again His whole rude idea of life had to be changed The male virile desire in him tardily awakened aroused itself strong and brutal It was resistless untrained a thing not to be held in leash an instant Little by little by gradual almost imperceptible degrees the thought of Trina Sieppe occupied his mind from day to day from hour to hour He found himself thinking of her constantly at every instant he saw her round pale face her narrow milk blue eyes her little out thrust chin her heavy huge tiara of black hair At night he lay awake for hours under the thick blankets of the bed lounge staring upward into the darkness tormented with the idea of her exasperated at the delicate subtle mesh in which he found himself entangled During the forenoons while he went about his work he thought of her As he made his plaster of paris moulds at the washstand in the corner behind the screen he turned over in his mind all that had happened all that had been said at the previous sitting Her little tooth that he had extracted he kept wrapped in a bit of newspaper in his vest pocket Often he took it out and held it in the palm of his immense horny hand seized with some strange elephantine sentiment wagging his head at it heaving tremendous sighs What a folly At two o clock on Tuesdays Thursdays and Saturdays Trina arrived and took her place in the operating chair While at his work McTeague was every minute obliged to bend closely over her his hands touched her face her cheeks her adorable little chin her lips pressed against his fingers She breathed warmly on his forehead and on his eyelids while the odor of her hair a charming feminine perfume sweet heavy enervating came to his nostrils so penetrating so delicious that his flesh pricked and tingled with it a veritable sensation of faintness passed over this huge callous fellow with his enormous bones and corded muscles He drew a short breath through his nose his jaws suddenly gripped together vise like But this was only at times a strange vexing spasm that subsided almost immediately For the most part McTeague enjoyed the pleasure of these sittings with Trina with a certain strong calmness blindly happy that she was there This poor crude dentist of Polk Street stupid ignorant vulgar with his sham education and plebeian tastes whose only relaxations were to eat to drink steam beer and to play upon his concertina was living through his first romance his first idyl It was delightful The long hours he passed alone with Trina in the Dental Parlors silent only for the scraping of the instruments and the pouring of bud burrs in the engine in the foul atmosphere overheated by the little stove and heavy with the smell of ether creosote and stale bedding had all the charm of secret appointments and stolen meetings under the moon By degrees the operation progressed One day just after McTeague had put in the temporary gutta percha fillings and nothing more could be done at that sitting Trina asked him to examine the rest of her teeth They were perfect with one exception a spot of white caries on the lateral surface of an incisor McTeague filled it with gold enlarging the cavity with hard bits and hoe excavators and burring in afterward with half cone burrs The cavity was deep and Trina began to wince and moan To hurt Trina was a positive anguish for McTeague yet an anguish which he was obliged to endure at every hour of the sitting It was harrowing he sweated under it to be forced to torture her of all women in the world could anything be worse than that Hurt he inquired anxiously She answered by frowning with a sharp intake of breath putting her fingers over her closed lips and nodding her head McTeague sprayed the tooth with glycerite of tannin but without effect Rather than hurt her he found himself forced to the use of anaesthesia which he hated He had a notion that the nitrous oxide gas was dangerous so on this occasion as on all others used ether He put the sponge a half dozen times to Trina s face more nervous than he had ever been before watching the symptoms closely Her breathing became short and irregular there was a slight twitching of the muscles When her thumbs turned inward toward the palms he took the sponge away She passed off very quickly and with a long sigh sank back into the chair McTeague straightened up putting the sponge upon the rack behind him his eyes fixed upon Trina s face For some time he stood watching her as she lay there unconscious and helpless and very pretty He was alone with her and she was absolutely without defense Suddenly the animal in the man stirred and woke the evil instincts that in him were so close to the surface leaped to life shouting and clamoring It was a crisis a crisis that had arisen all in an instant a crisis for which he was totally unprepared Blindly and without knowing why McTeague fought against it moved by an unreasoned instinct of resistance Within him a certain second self another better McTeague rose with the brute both were strong with the huge crude strength of the man himself The two were at grapples There in that cheap and shabby Dental Parlor a dreaded struggle began It was the old battle old as the world wide as the world the sudden panther leap of the animal lips drawn fangs aflash hideous monstrous not to be resisted and the simultaneous arousing of the other man the better self that cries Down down without knowing why that grips the monster that fights to strangle it to thrust it down and back Dizzied and bewildered with the shock the like of which he had never known before McTeague turned from Trina gazing bewilderedly about the room The struggle was bitter his teeth ground themselves together with a little rasping sound the blood sang in his ears his face flushed scarlet his hands twisted themselves together like the knotting of cables The fury in him was as the fury of a young bull in the heat of high summer But for all that he shook his huge head from time to time muttering No by God No by God Dimly he seemed to realize that should he yield now he would never be able to care for Trina again She would never be the same to him never so radiant so sweet so adorable her charm for him would vanish in an instant Across her forehead her little pale forehead under the shadow of her royal hair he would surely see the smudge of a foul ordure the footprint of the monster It would be a sacrilege an abomination He recoiled from it banding all his strength to the issue No by God No by God He turned to his work as if seeking a refuge in it But as he drew near to her again the charm of her innocence and helplessness came over him afresh It was a final protest against his resolution Suddenly he leaned over and kissed her grossly full on the mouth The thing was done before he knew it Terrified at his weakness at the very moment he believed himself strong he threw himself once more into his work with desperate energy By the time he was fastening the sheet of rubber upon the tooth he had himself once more in hand He was disturbed still trembling still vibrating with the throes of the crisis but he was the master the animal was downed was cowed for this time at least But for all that the brute was there Long dormant it was now at last alive awake From now on he would feel its presence continually would feel it tugging at its chain watching its opportunity Ah the pity of it Why could he not always love her purely cleanly What was this perverse vicious thing that lived within him knitted to his flesh Below the fine fabric of all that was good in him ran the foul stream of hereditary evil like a sewer The vices and sins of his father and of his father s father to the third and fourth and five hundredth generation tainted him The evil of an entire race flowed in his veins Why should it be He did not desire it Was he to blame But McTeague could not understand this thing It had faced him as sooner or later it faces every child of man but its significance was not for him To reason with it was beyond him He could only oppose to it an instinctive stubborn resistance blind inert McTeague went on with his work As he was rapping in the little blocks and cylinders with the mallet Trina slowly came back to herself with a long sigh She still felt a little confused and lay quiet in the chair There was a long silence broken only by the uneven tapping of the hardwood mallet By and by she said I never felt a thing and then she smiled at him very prettily beneath the rubber dam McTeague turned to her suddenly his mallet in one hand his pliers holding a pellet of sponge gold in the other All at once he said with the unreasoned simplicity and directness of a child Listen here Miss Trina I like you better than any one else what s the matter with us getting married Trina sat up in the chair quickly and then drew back from him frightened and bewildered Will you Will you said McTeague Say Miss Trina will you What is it What do you mean she cried confusedly her words muffled beneath the rubber Will you repeated McTeague No no she exclaimed refusing without knowing why suddenly seized with a fear of him the intuitive feminine fear of the male McTeague could only repeat the same thing over and over again Trina more and more frightened at his huge hands the hands of the old time car boy his immense square cut head and his enormous brute strength cried out No no behind the rubber dam shaking her head violently holding out her hands and shrinking down before him in the operating chair McTeague came nearer to her repeating the same question No no she cried terrified Then as she exclaimed Oh I am sick was suddenly taken with a fit of vomiting It was the not unusual after effect of the ether aided now by her excitement and nervousness McTeague was checked He poured some bromide of potassium into a graduated glass and held it to her lips Here swallow this he said CHAPTER three Once every two months Maria Macapa set the entire flat in commotion She roamed the building from garret to cellar searching each corner ferreting through every old box and trunk and barrel groping about on the top shelves of closets peering into rag bags exasperating the lodgers with her persistence and importunity She was collecting junks bits of iron stone jugs glass bottles old sacks and cast off garments It was one of her perquisites She sold the junk to Zerkow the rags bottles sacks man who lived in a filthy den in the alley just back of the flat and who sometimes paid her as much as three cents a pound The stone jugs however were worth a nickel The money that Zerkow paid her Maria spent on shirt waists and dotted blue neckties trying to dress like the girls who tended the soda water fountain in the candy store on the corner She was sick with envy of these young women They were in the world they were elegant they were debonair they had their young men On this occasion she presented herself at the door of Old Grannis s room late in the afternoon His door stood a little open That of Miss Baker was ajar a few inches The two old people were keeping company after their fashion Got any junk Mister Grannis inquired Maria standing in the door a very dirty half filled pillowcase over one arm No nothing nothing that I can think of Maria replied Old Grannis terribly vexed at the interruption yet not wishing to be unkind Nothing I think of Yet however perhaps if you wish to look He sat in the middle of the room before a small pine table His little binding apparatus was before him In his fingers was a huge upholsterer s needle threaded with twine a brad awl lay at his elbow on the floor beside him was a great pile of pamphlets the pages uncut Old Grannis bought the Nation and the Breeder and Sportsman In the latter he occasionally found articles on dogs which interested him The former he seldom read He could not afford to subscribe regularly to either of the publications but purchased their back numbers by the score almost solely for the pleasure he took in binding them What you alus sewing up them books for Mister Grannis asked Maria as she began rummaging about in Old Grannis s closet shelves There s just hundreds of em in here on yer shelves they ain t no good to you Well well answered Old Grannis timidly rubbing his chin I I m sure I can t quite say a little habit you know a diversion a a it occupies one you know I don t smoke it takes the place of a pipe perhaps Here s this old yellow pitcher said Maria coming out of the closet with it in her hand The handle s cracked you don t want it better give me it Old Grannis did want the pitcher true he never used it now but he had kept it a long time and somehow he held to it as old people hold to trivial worthless things that they have had for many years Oh that pitcher well Maria I I don t know I m afraid you see that pitcher Ah go long interrupted Maria Macapa what s the good of it If you insist Maria but I would much rather he rubbed his chin perplexed and annoyed hating to refuse and wishing that Maria were gone Why what s the good of it persisted Maria He could give no sufficient answer That s all right she asserted carrying the pitcher out Ah Maria I say you you might leave the door ah don t quite shut it it s a bit close in here at times Maria grinned and swung the door wide Old Grannis was horribly embarrassed positively Maria was becoming unbearable Got any junk cried Maria at Miss Baker s door The little old lady was sitting close to the wall in her rocking chair her hands resting idly in her lap Now Maria she said plaintively you are always after junk you know I never have anything laying round like that It was true The retired dressmaker s tiny room was a marvel of neatness from the little red table with its three Gorham spoons laid in exact parallels to the decorous geraniums and mignonettes growing in the starch box at the window underneath the fish globe with its one venerable gold fish That day Miss Baker had been doing a bit of washing two pocket handkerchiefs still moist adhered to the window panes drying in the sun Oh I guess you got something you don t want Maria went on peering into the corners of the room Look a here what Mister Grannis gi me and she held out the yellow pitcher Instantly Miss Baker was in a quiver of confusion Every word spoken aloud could be perfectly heard in the next room What a stupid drab was this Maria Could anything be more trying than this position Ain t that right Mister Grannis called Maria didn t you gi me this pitcher Old Grannis affected not to hear perspiration stood on his forehead his timidity overcame him as if he were a ten year old schoolboy He half rose from his chair his fingers dancing nervously upon his chin Maria opened Miss Baker s closet unconcernedly What s the matter with these old shoes she exclaimed turning about with a pair of half worn silk gaiters in her hand They were by no means old enough to throw away but Miss Baker was almost beside herself There was no telling what might happen next Her only thought was to be rid of Maria Yes yes anything You can have them but go go There s nothing else not a thing Maria went out into the hall leaving Miss Baker s door wide open as if maliciously She had left the dirty pillow case on the floor in the hall and she stood outside between the two open doors stowing away the old pitcher and the half worn silk shoes She made remarks at the top of her voice calling now to Miss Baker now to Old Grannis In a way she brought the two old people face to face Each time they were forced to answer her questions it was as if they were talking directly to each other These here are first rate shoes Miss Baker Look here Mister Grannis get on to the shoes Miss Baker gi me You ain t got a pair you don t want have you You two people have less junk than any one else in the flat How do you manage Mister Grannis You old bachelors are just like old maids just as neat as pins You two are just alike you and Mister Grannis ain t you Miss Baker Nothing could have been more horribly constrained more awkward The two old people suffered veritable torture When Maria had gone each heaved a sigh of unspeakable relief Softly they pushed to their doors leaving open a space of half a dozen inches Old Grannis went back to his binding Miss Baker brewed a cup of tea to quiet her nerves Each tried to regain their composure but in vain Old Grannis s fingers trembled so that he pricked them with his needle Miss Baker dropped her spoon twice Their nervousness would not wear off They were perturbed upset In a word the afternoon was spoiled Maria went on about the flat from room to room She had already paid Marcus Schouler a visit early that morning before he had gone out Marcus had sworn at her excitedly vociferating No by damn No he hadn t a thing for her he hadn t for a fact It was a positive persecution Every day his privacy was invaded He would complain to the landlady he would He d move out of the place In the end he had given Maria seven empty whiskey flasks an iron grate and ten cents the latter because he said she wore her hair like a girl he used to know After coming from Miss Baker s room Maria knocked at McTeague s door The dentist was lying on the bed lounge in his stocking feet doing nothing apparently gazing up at the ceiling lost in thought Since he had spoken to Trina Sieppe asking her so abruptly to marry him McTeague had passed a week of torment For him there was no going back It was Trina now and none other It was all one with him that his best friend Marcus might be in love with the same girl He must have Trina in spite of everything he would have her even in spite of herself He did not stop to reflect about the matter he followed his desire blindly recklessly furious and raging at every obstacle And she had cried No no back at him he could not forget that She so small and pale and delicate had held him at bay who was so huge so immensely strong Besides that all the charm of their intimacy was gone After that unhappy sitting Trina was no longer frank and straight forward Now she was circumspect reserved distant He could no longer open his mouth words failed him At one sitting in particular they had said but good day and good by to each other He felt that he was clumsy and ungainly He told himself that she despised him But the memory of her was with him constantly Night after night he lay broad awake thinking of Trina wondering about her racked with the infinite desire of her His head burnt and throbbed The palms of his hands were dry He dozed and woke and walked aimlessly about the dark room bruising himself against the three chairs drawn up at attention under the steel engraving and stumbling over the stone pug dog that sat in front of the little stove Besides this the jealousy of Marcus Schouler harassed him Maria Macapa coming into his Parlor to ask for junk found him flung at length upon the bed lounge gnawing at his fingers in an excess of silent fury At lunch that day Marcus had told him of an excursion that was planned for the next Sunday afternoon mister Sieppe Trina s father belonged to a rifle club that was to hold a meet at Schuetzen Park across the bay All the Sieppes were going there was to be a basket picnic Marcus as usual was invited to be one of the party McTeague was in agony It was his first experience and he suffered all the worse for it because he was totally unprepared What miserable complication was this in which he found himself involved It seemed so simple to him since he loved Trina to take her straight to himself stopping at nothing asking no questions to have her and by main strength to carry her far away somewhere he did not know exactly where to some vague country some undiscovered place where every day was Sunday Got any junk Huh What What is it exclaimed McTeague suddenly rousing up from the lounge Often Maria did very well in the Dental Parlors McTeague was continually breaking things which he was too stupid to have mended for him anything that was broken was lost Now it was a cuspidor now a fire shovel for the little stove now a China shaving mug Got any junk I don t know I don t remember muttered McTeague Maria roamed about the room McTeague following her in his huge stockinged feet All at once she pounced upon a sheaf of old hand instruments in a coverless cigar box pluggers hard bits and excavators Maria had long coveted such a find in McTeague s Parlor knowing it should be somewhere about The instruments were of the finest tempered steel and really valuable Say Doctor I can have these can t I exclaimed Maria You got no more use for them McTeague was not at all sure of this There were many in the sheaf that might be repaired reshaped No no he said wagging his head But Maria Macapa knowing with whom she had to deal at once let loose a torrent of words She made the dentist believe that he had no right to withhold them that he had promised to save them for her She affected a great indignation pursing her lips and putting her chin in the air as though wounded in some finer sense changing so rapidly from one mood to another filling the room with such shrill clamor that McTeague was dazed and benumbed Yes all right all right he said trying to make himself heard It WOULD be mean I don t want em As he turned from her to pick up the box Maria took advantage of the moment to steal three mats of sponge gold out of the glass saucer Often she stole McTeague s gold almost under his very eyes indeed it was so easy to do so that there was but little pleasure in the theft Then Maria took herself off McTeague returned to the sofa and flung himself upon it face downward A little before supper time Maria completed her search The flat was cleaned of its junk from top to bottom The dirty pillow case was full to bursting She took advantage of the supper hour to carry her bundle around the corner and up into the alley where Zerkow lived When Maria entered his shop Zerkow had just come in from his daily rounds His decrepit wagon stood in front of his door like a stranded wreck the miserable horse with its lamentable swollen joints fed greedily upon an armful of spoiled hay in a shed at the back The interior of the junk shop was dark and damp and foul with all manner of choking odors On the walls on the floor and hanging from the rafters was a world of debris dust blackened rust corroded Everything was there every trade was represented every class of society things of iron and cloth and wood all the detritus that a great city sloughs off in its daily life Zerkow s junk shop was the last abiding place the almshouse of such articles as had outlived their usefulness Maria found Zerkow himself in the back room cooking some sort of a meal over an alcohol stove Zerkow was a Polish Jew curiously enough his hair was fiery red He was a dry shrivelled old man of sixty odd He had the thin eager cat like lips of the covetous eyes that had grown keen as those of a lynx from long searching amidst muck and debris and claw like prehensile fingers the fingers of a man who accumulates but never disburses It was impossible to look at Zerkow and not know instantly that greed inordinate insatiable greed was the dominant passion of the man He was the Man with the Rake groping hourly in the muck heap of the city for gold for gold for gold It was his dream his passion at every instant he seemed to feel the generous solid weight of the crude fat metal in his palms The glint of it was constantly in his eyes the jangle of it sang forever in his ears as the jangling of cymbals Who is it Who is it exclaimed Zerkow as he heard Maria s footsteps in the outer room His voice was faint husky reduced almost to a whisper by his prolonged habit of street crying Oh it s you again is it he added peering through the gloom of the shop Let s see you ve been here before ain t you You re the Mexican woman from Polk Street Macapa s your name hey Maria nodded Had a flying squirrel an let him go she muttered absently Zerkow was puzzled he looked at her sharply for a moment then dismissed the matter with a movement of his head Well what you got for me he said He left his supper to grow cold absorbed at once in the affair Then a long wrangle began Every bit of junk in Maria s pillow case was discussed and weighed and disputed They clamored into each other s faces over Old Grannis s cracked pitcher over Miss Baker s silk gaiters over Marcus Schouler s whiskey flasks reaching the climax of disagreement when it came to McTeague s instruments Ah no no shouted Maria Fifteen cents for the lot I might as well make you a Christmas present Besides I got some gold fillings off him look at um Zerkow drew a quick breath as the three pellets suddenly flashed in Maria s palm There it was the virgin metal the pure unalloyed ore his dream his consuming desire His fingers twitched and hooked themselves into his palms his thin lips drew tight across his teeth Ah you got some gold he muttered reaching for it Maria shut her fist over the pellets The gold goes with the others she declared You ll gi me a fair price for the lot or I ll take um back In the end a bargain was struck that satisfied Maria Zerkow was not one who would let gold go out of his house He counted out to her the price of all her junk grudging each piece of money as if it had been the blood of his veins The affair was concluded But Zerkow still had something to say As Maria folded up the pillow case and rose to go the old Jew said Well see here a minute we ll you ll have a drink before you go won t you Just to show that it s all right between us Maria sat down again Yes I guess I ll have a drink she answered Zerkow took down a whiskey bottle and a red glass tumbler with a broken base from a cupboard on the wall The two drank together Zerkow from the bottle Maria from the broken tumbler They wiped their lips slowly drawing breath again There was a moment s silence Say said Zerkow at last how about those gold dishes you told me about the last time you were here What gold dishes inquired Maria puzzled Ah you know returned the other The plate your father owned in Central America a long time ago Don t you know it rang like so many bells Red gold you know like oranges Ah said Maria putting her chin in the air as if she knew a long story about that if she had a mind to tell it Ah yes that gold service Tell us about it again said Zerkow his bloodless lower lip moving against the upper his claw like fingers feeling about his mouth and chin Tell us about it go on He was breathing short his limbs trembled a little It was as if some hungry beast of prey had scented a quarry Maria still refused putting up her head insisting that she had to be going Let s have it insisted the Jew Take another drink Maria took another swallow of the whiskey Now go on repeated Zerkow let s have the story Maria squared her elbows on the deal table looking straight in front of her with eyes that saw nothing Well it was this way she began It was when I was little My folks must have been rich oh rich into the millions coffee I guess and there was a large house but I can only remember the plate Oh that service of plate It was wonderful There were more than a hundred pieces and every one of them gold You should have seen the sight when the leather trunk was opened It fair dazzled your eyes It was a yellow blaze like a fire like a sunset such a glory all piled up together one piece over the other Why if the room was dark you d think you could see just the same with all that glitter there There wa n t a piece that was so much as scratched every one was like a mirror smooth and bright just like a little pool when the sun shines into it There was dinner dishes and soup tureens and pitchers and great big platters as long as that and wide too and cream jugs and bowls with carved handles all vines and things and drinking mugs every one a different shape and dishes for gravy and sauces and then a great big punch bowl with a ladle and the bowl was all carved out with figures and bunches of grapes Why just only that punch bowl was worth a fortune I guess When all that plate was set out on a table it was a sight for a king to look at Such a service as that was Each piece was heavy oh so heavy and thick you know thick fat gold nothing but gold red shining pure gold orange red and when you struck it with your knuckle ah you should have heard No church bell ever rang sweeter or clearer It was soft gold too you could bite into it and leave the dent of your teeth Oh that gold plate I can see it just as plain solid solid heavy rich pure gold nothing but gold gold heaps and heaps of it What a service that was Maria paused shaking her head thinking over the vanished splendor Illiterate enough unimaginative enough on all other subjects her distorted wits called up this picture with marvellous distinctness It was plain she saw the plate clearly Her description was accurate was almost eloquent Did that wonderful service of gold plate ever exist outside of her diseased imagination Was Maria actually remembering some reality of a childhood of barbaric luxury Were her parents at one time possessed of an incalculable fortune derived from some Central American coffee plantation a fortune long since confiscated by armies of insurrectionists or squandered in the support of revolutionary governments It was not impossible Of Maria Macapa s past prior to the time of her appearance at the flat absolutely nothing could be learned She suddenly appeared from the unknown a strange woman of a mixed race sane on all subjects but that of the famous service of gold plate but unusual complex mysterious even at her best But what misery Zerkow endured as he listened to her tale For he chose to believe it forced himself to believe it lashed and harassed by a pitiless greed that checked at no tale of treasure however preposterous The story ravished him with delight He was near someone who had possessed this wealth He saw someone who had seen this pile of gold He seemed near it it was there somewhere close by under his eyes under his fingers it was red gleaming ponderous He gazed about him wildly nothing nothing but the sordid junk shop and the rust corroded tins What exasperation what positive misery to be so near to it and yet to know that it was irrevocably irretrievably lost A spasm of anguish passed through him He gnawed at his bloodless lips at the hopelessness of it the rage the fury of it Go on go on he whispered let s have it all over again Polished like a mirror hey and heavy Yes I know I know A punch bowl worth a fortune Ah and you saw it you had it all Maria rose to go Zerkow accompanied her to the door urging another drink upon her Come again come again he croaked Don t wait till you ve got junk come any time you feel like it and tell me more about the plate He followed her a step down the alley How much do you think it was worth he inquired anxiously Oh a million dollars answered Maria vaguely When Maria had gone Zerkow returned to the back room of the shop and stood in front of the alcohol stove looking down into his cold dinner preoccupied thoughtful A million dollars he muttered in his rasping guttural whisper his finger tips wandering over his thin cat like lips A golden service worth a million dollars a punchbowl worth a fortune red gold plates heaps and piles God CHAPTER four The days passed McTeague had finished the operation on Trina s teeth She did not come any more to the Parlors Matters had readjusted themselves a little between the two during the last sittings Trina yet stood upon her reserve and McTeague still felt himself shambling and ungainly in her presence but that constraint and embarrassment that had followed upon McTeague s blundering declaration broke up little by little In spite of themselves they were gradually resuming the same relative positions they had occupied when they had first met But McTeague suffered miserably for all that He never would have Trina he saw that clearly She was too good for him too delicate too refined too prettily made for him who was so coarse so enormous so stupid She was for someone else Marcus no doubt or at least for some finer grained man She should have gone to some other dentist the young fellow on the corner for instance the poser the rider of bicycles the courser of grey hounds McTeague began to loathe and to envy this fellow He spied upon him going in and out of his office and noted his salmon pink neckties and his astonishing waistcoats One Sunday a few days after Trina s last sitting McTeague met Marcus Schouler at his table in the car conductors coffee joint next to the harness shop What you got to do this afternoon Mac inquired the other as they ate their suet pudding Nothing nothing replied McTeague shaking his head His mouth was full of pudding It made him warm to eat and little beads of perspiration stood across the bridge of his nose He looked forward to an afternoon passed in his operating chair as usual On leaving his Parlors he had put ten cents into his pitcher and had left it at Frenna s to be filled What do you say we take a walk huh said Marcus Ah that s the thing a walk a long walk by damn It ll be outa sight I got to take three or four of the dogs out for exercise anyhow Old Grannis thinks they need ut We ll walk out to the Presidio Of late it had become the custom of the two friends to take long walks from time to time On holidays and on those Sunday afternoons when Marcus was not absent with the Sieppes they went out together sometimes to the park sometimes to the Presidio sometimes even across the bay They took a great pleasure in each other s company but silently and with reservation having the masculine horror of any demonstration of friendship They walked for upwards of five hours that afternoon out the length of California Street and across the Presidio Reservation to the Golden Gate Then they turned and following the line of the shore brought up at the Cliff House Here they halted for beer Marcus swearing that his mouth was as dry as a hay bin Before starting on their walk they had gone around to the little dog hospital and Marcus had let out four of the convalescents crazed with joy at the release Look at that dog he cried to McTeague showing him a finely bred Irish setter That s the dog that belonged to the duck on the avenue the dog we called for that day I ve bought um The duck thought he had the distemper and just threw um away Nothun wrong with um but a little catarrh Ain t he a bird Say ain t he a bird Look at his flag it s perfect and see how he carries his tail on a line with his back See how stiff and white his whiskers are Oh by damn you can t fool me on a dog That dog s a winner At the Cliff House the two sat down to their beer in a quiet corner of the billiard room There were but two players Somewhere in another part of the building a mammoth music box was jangling out a quickstep From outside came the long rhythmical rush of the surf and the sonorous barking of the seals upon the seal rocks The four dogs curled themselves down upon the sanded floor Here s how said Marcus half emptying his glass Ah h he added with a long breath that s good it is for a fact For the last hour of their walk Marcus had done nearly all the talking McTeague merely answering him by uncertain movements of the head For that matter the dentist had been silent and preoccupied throughout the whole afternoon At length Marcus noticed it As he set down his glass with a bang he suddenly exclaimed What s the matter with you these days Mac You got a bean about somethun hey Spit ut out No no replied McTeague looking about on the floor rolling his eyes nothing no no Ah rats returned the other McTeague kept silence The two billiard players departed The huge music box struck into a fresh tune Huh exclaimed Marcus with a short laugh guess you re in love McTeague gasped and shuffled his enormous feet under the table Well somethun s bitun you anyhow pursued Marcus Maybe I can help you We re pals you know Better tell me what s up guess we can straighten ut out Ah go on spit ut out The situation was abominable McTeague could not rise to it Marcus was his best friend his only friend They were pals and McTeague was very fond of him Yet they were both in love presumably with the same girl and now Marcus would try and force the secret out of him would rush blindly at the rock upon which the two must split stirred by the very best of motives wishing only to be of service Besides this there was nobody to whom McTeague would have better preferred to tell his troubles than to Marcus and yet about this trouble the greatest trouble of his life he must keep silent must refrain from speaking of it to Marcus above everybody McTeague began dimly to feel that life was too much for him How had it all come about A month ago he was perfectly content he was calm and peaceful taking his little pleasures as he found them His life had shaped itself was no doubt to continue always along these same lines A woman had entered his small world and instantly there was discord The disturbing element had appeared Wherever the woman had put her foot a score of distressing complications had sprung up like the sudden growth of strange and puzzling flowers Say Mac go on let s have ut straight urged Marcus leaning toward him Has any duck been doing you dirt he cried his face crimson on the instant No said McTeague helplessly Come along old man persisted Marcus let s have ut What is the row I ll do all I can to help you It was more than McTeague could bear The situation had got beyond him Stupidly he spoke his hands deep in his pockets his head rolled forward It s it s Miss Sieppe he said Trina my cousin How do you mean inquired Marcus sharply I I I don know stammered McTeague hopelessly confounded You mean cried Marcus suddenly enlightened that you are that you too McTeague stirred in his chair looking at the walls of the room avoiding the other s glance He nodded his head then suddenly broke out I can t help it It ain t my fault is it Marcus was struck dumb he dropped back in his chair breathless Suddenly McTeague found his tongue I tell you Mark I can t help it I don t know how it happened It came on so slow that I was that that that it was done before I knew it before I could help myself I know we re pals us two and I knew how how you and Miss Sieppe were I know now I knew then but that wouldn t have made any difference Before I knew it it it there I was I can t help it I wouldn t a had ut happen for anything if I could a stopped it but I don know it s something that s just stronger than you are that s all She came there Miss Sieppe came to the parlors there three or four times a week and she was the first girl I had ever known and you don know Why I was so close to her I touched her face every minute and her mouth and smelt her hair and her breath oh you don t know anything about it I can t give you any idea I don know exactly myself I only know how I m fixed I I it s been done it s too late there s no going back Why I can t think of anything else night and day It s everything It s it s oh it s everything I I why Mark it s everything I can t explain He made a helpless movement with both hands Never had McTeague been so excited never had he made so long a speech His arms moved in fierce uncertain gestures his face flushed his enormous jaws shut together with a sharp click at every pause It was like some colossal brute trapped in a delicate invisible mesh raging exasperated powerless to extricate himself Marcus Schouler said nothing There was a long silence Marcus got up and walked to the window and stood looking out but seeing nothing Well who would have thought of this he muttered under his breath Here was a fix Marcus cared for Trina There was no doubt in his mind about that He looked forward eagerly to the Sunday afternoon excursions He liked to be with Trina He too felt the charm of the little girl the charm of the small pale forehead the little chin thrust out as if in confidence and innocence the heavy odorous crown of black hair He liked her immensely Some day he would speak he would ask her to marry him Marcus put off this matter of marriage to some future period it would be some time a year perhaps or two The thing did not take definite shape in his mind Marcus kept company with his cousin Trina but he knew plenty of other girls For the matter of that he liked all girls pretty well Just now the singleness and strength of McTeague s passion startled him McTeague would marry Trina that very afternoon if she would have him but would he Marcus No he would not if it came to that no he would not Yet he knew he liked Trina He could say yes he could say he loved her She was his girl The Sieppes acknowledged him as Trina s young man Marcus came back to the table and sat down sideways upon it Well what are we going to do about it Mac he said I don know answered McTeague in great distress I don want anything to to come between us Mark Well nothun will you bet vociferated the other No sir you bet not Mac Marcus was thinking hard He could see very clearly that McTeague loved Trina more than he did that in some strange way this huge brutal fellow was capable of a greater passion than himself who was twice as clever Suddenly Marcus jumped impetuously to a resolution Well say Mac he cried striking the table with his fist go ahead I guess you you want her pretty bad I ll pull out yes I will I ll give her up to you old man The sense of his own magnanimity all at once overcame Marcus He saw himself as another man very noble self sacrificing he stood apart and watched this second self with boundless admiration and with infinite pity He was so good so magnificent so heroic that he almost sobbed Marcus made a sweeping gesture of resignation throwing out both his arms crying Mac I ll give her up to you I won t stand between you There were actually tears in Marcus s eyes as he spoke There was no doubt he thought himself sincere At that moment he almost believed he loved Trina conscientiously that he was sacrificing himself for the sake of his friend The two stood up and faced each other gripping hands It was a great moment even McTeague felt the drama of it What a fine thing was this friendship between men the dentist treats his friend for an ulcerated tooth and refuses payment the friend reciprocates by giving up his girl This was nobility Their mutual affection and esteem suddenly increased enormously It was Damon and Pythias it was David and Jonathan nothing could ever estrange them Now it was for life or death I m much obliged murmured McTeague He could think of nothing better to say I m much obliged he repeated much obliged Mark That s all right that s all right returned Marcus Schouler bravely and it occurred to him to add You ll be happy together Tell her for me tell her tell her Marcus could not go on He wrung the dentist s hand silently It had not appeared to either of them that Trina might refuse McTeague McTeague s spirits rose at once In Marcus s withdrawal he fancied he saw an end to all his difficulties Everything would come right after all The strained exalted state of Marcus s nerves ended by putting him into fine humor as well His grief suddenly changed to an excess of gaiety The afternoon was a success They slapped each other on the back with great blows of the open palms and they drank each other s health in a third round of beer Ten minutes after his renunciation of Trina Sieppe Marcus astounded McTeague with a tremendous feat Looka here Mac I know somethun you can t do I ll bet you two bits I ll stump you They each put a quarter on the table Now watch me cried Marcus He caught up a billiard ball from the rack poised it a moment in front of his face then with a sudden horrifying distension of his jaws crammed it into his mouth and shut his lips over it For an instant McTeague was stupefied his eyes bulging Then an enormous laugh shook him He roared and shouted swaying in his chair slapping his knee What a josher was this Marcus Sure you never could tell what he would do next Marcus slipped the ball out wiped it on the tablecloth and passed it to McTeague Now let s see you do it McTeague fell suddenly grave The matter was serious He parted his thick mustaches and opened his enormous jaws like an anaconda The ball disappeared inside his mouth Marcus applauded vociferously shouting Good work McTeague reached for the money and put it in his vest pocket nodding his head with a knowing air Then suddenly his face grew purple his jaws moved convulsively he pawed at his cheeks with both hands The billiard ball had slipped into his mouth easily enough now however he could not get it out again It was terrible The dentist rose to his feet stumbling about among the dogs his face working his eyes starting Try as he would he could not stretch his jaws wide enough to slip the ball out Marcus lost his wits swearing at the top of his voice McTeague sweated with terror inarticulate sounds came from his crammed mouth he waved his arms wildly all the four dogs caught the excitement and began to bark A waiter rushed in the two billiard players returned a little crowd formed There was a veritable scene All at once the ball slipped out of McTeague s jaws as easily as it had gone in What a relief He dropped into a chair wiping his forehead gasping for breath On the strength of the occasion Marcus Schouler invited the entire group to drink with him By the time the affair was over and the group dispersed it was after five Marcus and McTeague decided they would ride home on the cars But they soon found this impossible The dogs would not follow Only Alexander Marcus s new setter kept his place at the rear of the car The other three lost their senses immediately running wildly about the streets with their heads in the air or suddenly starting off at a furious gallop directly away from the car Marcus whistled and shouted and lathered with rage in vain The two friends were obliged to walk When they finally reached Polk Street Marcus shut up the three dogs in the hospital Alexander he brought back to the flat with him There was a minute back yard in the rear where Marcus had made a kennel for Alexander out of an old water barrel Before he thought of his own supper Marcus put Alexander to bed and fed him a couple of dog biscuits McTeague had followed him to the yard to keep him company Alexander settled to his supper at once chewing vigorously at the biscuit his head on one side What you going to do about this about that about about my cousin now Mac inquired Marcus McTeague shook his head helplessly It was dark by now and cold The little back yard was grimy and full of odors McTeague was tired with their long walk All his uneasiness about his affair with Trina had returned No surely she was not for him Marcus or some other man would win her in the end What could she ever see to desire in him in him a clumsy giant with hands like wooden mallets She had told him once that she would not marry him Was that not final I don know what to do Mark he said Well you must make up to her now answered Marcus Go and call on her McTeague started He had not thought of calling on her The idea frightened him a little Of course persisted Marcus that s the proper caper What did you expect Did you think you was never going to see her again I don know I don know responded the dentist looking stupidly at the dog You know where they live continued Marcus Schouler Over at B Street station across the bay I ll take you over there whenever you want to go I tell you what we ll go over there Washington s Birthday That s this next Wednesday sure they ll be glad to see you It was good of Marcus All at once McTeague rose to an appreciation of what his friend was doing for him He stammered Say Mark you re you re all right anyhow Why pshaw said Marcus That s all right old man I d like to see you two fixed that s all We ll go over Wednesday sure They turned back to the house Alexander left off eating and watched them go away first with one eye then with the other But he was too self respecting to whimper However by the time the two friends had reached the second landing on the back stairs a terrible commotion was under way in the little yard They rushed to an open window at the end of the hall and looked down A thin board fence separated the flat s back yard from that used by the branch post office In the latter place lived a collie dog He and Alexander had smelt each other out blowing through the cracks of the fence at each other Suddenly the quarrel had exploded on either side of the fence The dogs raged at each other snarling and barking frantic with hate Their teeth gleamed They tore at the fence with their front paws They filled the whole night with their clamor By damn cried Marcus they don t love each other Just listen wouldn t that make a fight if the two got together Have to try it some day CHAPTER five Wednesday morning Washington s Birthday McTeague rose very early and shaved himself Besides the six mournful concertina airs the dentist knew one song Whenever he shaved he sung this song never at any other time His voice was a bellowing roar enough to make the window sashes rattle Just now he woke up all the lodgers in his hall with it It was a lamentable wail No one to love none to caress Left all alone in this world s wilderness As he paused to strop his razor Marcus came into his room half dressed a startling phantom in red flannels Marcus often ran back and forth between his room and the dentist s Parlors in all sorts of undress Old Miss Baker had seen him thus several times through her half open door as she sat in her room listening and waiting The old dressmaker was shocked out of all expression She was outraged offended pursing her lips putting up her head She talked of complaining to the landlady And mister Grannis right next door too You can understand how trying it is for both of us She would come out in the hall after one of these apparitions her little false curls shaking talking loud and shrill to any one in reach of her voice Well Marcus would shout shut your door then if you don t want to see Look out now here I come again Not even a porous plaster on me this time On this Wednesday morning Marcus called McTeague out into the hall to the head of the stairs that led down to the street door Come and listen to Maria Mac said he Maria sat on the next to the lowest step her chin propped by her two fists The red headed Polish Jew the ragman Zerkow stood in the doorway He was talking eagerly Now just once more Maria he was saying Tell it to us just once more Maria s voice came up the stairway in a monotone Marcus and McTeague caught a phrase from time to time There were more than a hundred pieces and every one of them gold just that punch bowl was worth a fortune thick fat red gold Get onto to that will you observed Marcus The old skin has got her started on the plate Ain t they a pair for you And it rang like bells didn t it prompted Zerkow Sweeter n church bells and clearer Ah sweeter n bells Wasn t that punch bowl awful heavy All you could do to lift it I know Oh I know answered Zerkow clawing at his lips Where did it all go to Where did it go Maria shook her head It s gone anyhow Ah gone gone Think of it The punch bowl gone and the engraved ladle and the plates and goblets What a sight it must have been all heaped together It was a wonderful sight Yes wonderful it must have been On the lower steps of that cheap flat the Mexican woman and the red haired Polish Jew mused long over that vanished half mythical gold plate Marcus and the dentist spent Washington s Birthday across the bay The journey over was one long agony to McTeague He shook with a formless uncertain dread a dozen times he would have turned back had not Marcus been with him The stolid giant was as nervous as a schoolboy He fancied that his call upon Miss Sieppe was an outrageous affront She would freeze him with a stare he would be shown the door would be ejected disgraced As they got off the local train at B Street station they suddenly collided with the whole tribe of Sieppes the mother father three children and Trina equipped for one of their eternal picnics They were to go to Schuetzen Park within walking distance of the station They were grouped about four lunch baskets One of the children a little boy held a black greyhound by a rope around its neck Trina wore a blue cloth skirt a striped shirt waist and a white sailor about her round waist was a belt of imitation alligator skin At once missus Sieppe began to talk to Marcus He had written of their coming but the picnic had been decided upon after the arrival of his letter missus Sieppe explained this to him She was an immense old lady with a pink face and wonderful hair absolutely white The Sieppes were a German Swiss family We go to der park Schuetzen Park mit alle dem childern a little eggs kursion eh not soh We breathe der freshes air a celubration a pignic bei der seashore on Ach dot wull be soh gay ah You bet it will It ll be outa sight cried Marcus enthusiastic in an instant This is m friend Doctor McTeague I wrote you about missus Sieppe Ach der doktor cried missus Sieppe McTeague was presented shaking hands gravely as Marcus shouldered him from one to the other mister Sieppe was a little man of a military aspect full of importance taking himself very seriously He was a member of a rifle team Over his shoulder was slung a Springfield rifle while his breast was decorated by five bronze medals Trina was delighted McTeague was dumfounded She appeared positively glad to see him How do you do Doctor McTeague she said smiling at him and shaking his hand It s nice to see you again Look see how fine my filling is She lifted a corner of her lip and showed him the clumsy gold bridge Meanwhile mister Sieppe toiled and perspired Upon him devolved the responsibility of the excursion He seemed to consider it a matter of vast importance a veritable expedition Owgooste he shouted to the little boy with the black greyhound you will der hound und basket number three carry Der tervins he added calling to the two smallest boys who were dressed exactly alike will releef one unudder mit der camp stuhl und basket number four Dat is comprehend hay When we make der start you childern will in der advance march Dat is your orders But we do not start he exclaimed excitedly we remain Ach Gott Selina who does not arrive Selina it appeared was a niece of missus Sieppe s They were on the point of starting without her when she suddenly arrived very much out of breath She was a slender unhealthy looking girl who overworked herself giving lessons in hand painting at twenty five cents an hour McTeague was presented They all began to talk at once filling the little station house with a confusion of tongues Attention cried mister Sieppe his gold headed cane in one hand his Springfield in the other Attention We depart The four little boys moved off ahead the greyhound suddenly began to bark and tug at his leash The others picked up their bundles Vorwarts shouted mister Sieppe waving his rifle and assuming the attitude of a lieutenant of infantry leading a charge The party set off down the railroad track missus Sieppe walked with her husband who constantly left her side to shout an order up and down the line Marcus followed with Selina McTeague found himself with Trina at the end of the procession We go off on these picnics almost every week said Trina by way of a beginning and almost every holiday too It is a custom Yes yes a custom answered McTeague nodding a custom that s the word Don t you think picnics are fine fun Doctor McTeague she continued You take your lunch you leave the dirty city all day you race about in the open air and when lunchtime comes oh aren t you hungry And the woods and the grass smell so fine I don know Miss Sieppe he answered keeping his eyes fixed on the ground between the rails I never went on a picnic Never went on a picnic she cried astonished Oh you ll see what fun we ll have In the morning father and the children dig clams in the mud by the shore an we bake them and oh there s thousands of things to do Once I went sailing on the bay said McTeague It was in a tugboat we fished off the heads I caught three codfishes I m afraid to go out on the bay answered Trina shaking her head sailboats tip over so easy A cousin of mine Selina s brother was drowned one Decoration Day They never found his body Can you swim Doctor McTeague I used to at the mine At the mine Oh yes I remember Marcus told me you were a miner once I was a car boy all the car boys used to swim in the reservoir by the ditch every Thursday evening One of them was bit by a rattlesnake once while he was dressing He was a Frenchman named Andrew He swelled up and began to twitch Oh how I hate snakes They re so crawly and graceful but just the same I like to watch them You know that drug store over in town that has a showcase full of live ones We killed the rattler with a cart whip How far do you think you could swim Did you ever try D you think you could swim a mile A mile I don t know I never tried I guess I could I can swim a little Sometimes we all go out to the Crystal Baths The Crystal Baths huh Can you swim across the tank Oh I can swim all right as long as papa holds my chin up Soon as he takes his hand away down I go Don t you hate to get water in your ears Bathing s good for you If the water s too warm it isn t It weakens you mister Sieppe came running down the tracks waving his cane To one side he shouted motioning them off the track der drain gomes A local passenger train was just passing B Street station some quarter of a mile behind them The party stood to one side to let it pass Marcus put a nickel and two crossed pins upon the rail and waved his hat to the passengers as the train roared past The children shouted shrilly When the train was gone they all rushed to see the nickel and the crossed pins The nickel had been jolted off but the pins had been flattened out so that they bore a faint resemblance to opened scissors A great contention arose among the children for the possession of these scissors mister Sieppe was obliged to intervene He reflected gravely It was a matter of tremendous moment The whole party halted awaiting his decision Attend now he suddenly exclaimed It will not be soh soon At der end of der day ven we shall have home gecommen den wull it pe adjudge eh A REward of merit to him who der bes pehaves It is an order Vorwarts That was a Sacramento train said Marcus to Selina as they started off it was for a fact I know a girl in Sacramento Trina told McTeague She s forewoman in a glove store and she s got consumption I was in Sacramento once observed McTeague nearly eight years ago Is it a nice place as nice as San Francisco It s hot I practised there for a while I like San Francisco said Trina looking across the bay to where the city piled itself upon its hills So do I answered McTeague Do you like it better than living over here Oh sure I wish we lived in the city If you want to go across for anything it takes up the whole day Yes yes the whole day almost Do you know many people in the city Do you know anybody named Oelbermann That s my uncle He has a wholesale toy store in the Mission They say he s awful rich No I don know him His stepdaughter wants to be a nun Just fancy And mister Oelbermann won t have it He says it would be just like burying his child Yes she wants to enter the convent of the Sacred Heart Are you a Catholic Doctor McTeague No No I Papa is a Catholic He goes to Mass on the feast days once in a while But mamma s Lutheran The Catholics are trying to get control of the schools observed McTeague suddenly remembering one of Marcus s political tirades That s what cousin Mark says We are going to send the twins to the kindergarten next month What s the kindergarten Oh they teach them to make things out of straw and toothpicks kind of a play place to keep them off the street There s one up on Sacramento Street not far from Polk Street I saw the sign I know where Why Selina used to play the piano there Does she play the piano Oh you ought

You ll see what fun we ll have Fine day for a picnic ain t it There ain t a cloud That s so exclaimed Trina looking up not a single cloud Oh yes there is one just over Telegraph Hill That s smoke No it s a cloud Smoke isn t white that way Tis a cloud I knew I was right I never say a thing unless I m pretty sure It looks like a dog s head Don t it Isn t Marcus fond of dogs He got a new dog last week a setter Did he Yes He and I took a lot of dogs from his hospital out for a walk to the Cliff House last Sunday but we had to walk all the way home because they wouldn t follow You ve been out to the Cliff House Not for a long time We had a picnic there one Fourth of July but it rained Don t you love the ocean Yes yes I like it pretty well Oh I d like to go off in one of those big sailing ships Just away and away and away anywhere They re different from a little yacht I d love to travel Sure so would I Papa and mamma came over in a sailing ship They were twenty one days Mamma s uncle used to be a sailor He was captain of a steamer on Lake Geneva in Switzerland Halt shouted mister Sieppe brandishing his rifle They had arrived at the gates of the park All at once McTeague turned cold He had only a quarter in his pocket What was he expected to do pay for the whole party or for Trina and himself or merely buy his own ticket And even in this latter case would a quarter be enough He lost his wits rolling his eyes helplessly Then it occurred to him to feign a great abstraction pretending not to know that the time was come to pay He looked intently up and down the tracks perhaps a train was coming Here we are cried Trina as they came up to the rest of the party crowded about the entrance Yes yes observed McTeague his head in the air Gi me four bits Mac said Marcus coming up Here s where we shell out I I I only got a quarter mumbled the dentist miserably He felt that he had ruined himself forever with Trina What was the use of trying to win her Destiny was against him I only got a quarter he stammered He was on the point of adding that he would not go in the park That seemed to be the only alternative Oh all right said Marcus easily I ll pay for you and you can square with me when we go home They filed into the park mister Sieppe counting them off as they entered Ah said Trina with a long breath as she and McTeague pushed through the wicket here we are once more Doctor She had not appeared to notice McTeague s embarrassment The difficulty had been tided over somehow Once more McTeague felt himself saved To der beach shouted mister Sieppe They had checked their baskets at the peanut stand The whole party trooped down to the seashore The greyhound was turned loose The children raced on ahead From one of the larger parcels missus Sieppe had drawn forth a small tin steamboat August s birthday present a gaudy little toy which could be steamed up and navigated by means of an alcohol lamp Her trial trip was to be made this morning Gi me it gi me it shouted August dancing around his father Not soh not soh cried mister Sieppe bearing it aloft I must first der eggsperimunt make No no wailed August I want to play with ut Obey thundered mister Sieppe August subsided A little jetty ran part of the way into the water Here after a careful study of the directions printed on the cover of the box mister Sieppe began to fire the little boat I want to put ut in the wa ater cried August Stand back shouted his parent You do not know so well as me dere is dandger Mitout attention he will eggsplode I want to play with ut protested August beginning to cry Ach soh you cry bube vociferated mister Sieppe Mommer addressing missus Sieppe he will soh soon be ge whipt eh I want my boa wut screamed August dancing Silence roared mister Sieppe The little boat began to hiss and smoke Soh observed the father he gommence Attention I put him in der water He was very excited The perspiration dripped from the back of his neck The little boat was launched It hissed more furiously than ever Clouds of steam rolled from it but it refused to move You don t know how she wo rks sobbed August I know more soh mudge as der grossest liddle fool as you cried mister Sieppe fiercely his face purple You must give it sh shove exclaimed the boy Den he eggsplode idiot shouted his father All at once the boiler of the steamer blew up with a sharp crack The little tin toy turned over and sank out of sight before any one could interfere Ah h Yah Yah yelled August It s go one Instantly mister Sieppe boxed his ears There was a lamentable scene August rent the air with his outcries his father shook him till his boots danced on the jetty shouting into his face Ach idiot Ach imbecile Ach miserable I tol you he eggsplode Stop your cry Stop It is an order Do you wish I drow you in der water eh Speak Silence bube Mommer where ist mein stick He will der grossest whippun ever of his life receive Little by little the boy subsided swallowing his sobs knuckling his eyes gazing ruefully at the spot where the boat had sunk Dot is better soh commented mister Sieppe finally releasing him Next dime berhaps you will your fat er better pelief Now no more We will der glams ge dig Mommer a fire Ach himmel we have der pfeffer forgotten The work of clam digging began at once the little boys taking off their shoes and stockings At first August refused to be comforted and it was not until his father drove him into the water with his gold headed cane that he consented to join the others What a day that was for McTeague What a never to be forgotten day He was with Trina constantly They laughed together she demurely her lips closed tight her little chin thrust out her small pale nose with its adorable little freckles wrinkling he roared with all the force of his lungs his enormous mouth distended striking sledge hammer blows upon his knee with his clenched fist The lunch was delicious Trina and her mother made a clam chowder that melted in one s mouth The lunch baskets were emptied The party were fully two hours eating There were huge loaves of rye bread full of grains of chickweed There were weiner wurst and frankfurter sausages There was unsalted butter There were pretzels There was cold underdone chicken which one ate in slices plastered with a wonderful kind of mustard that did not sting There were dried apples that gave mister Sieppe the hiccoughs There were a dozen bottles of beer and last of all a crowning achievement a marvellous Gotha truffle After lunch came tobacco Stuffed to the eyes McTeague drowsed over his pipe prone on his back in the sun while Trina missus Sieppe and Selina washed the dishes In the afternoon mister Sieppe disappeared They heard the reports of his rifle on the range The others swarmed over the park now around the swings now in the Casino now in the museum now invading the merry go round At half past five o clock mister Sieppe marshalled the party together It was time to return home The family insisted that Marcus and McTeague should take supper with them at their home and should stay over night missus Sieppe argued they could get no decent supper if they went back to the city at that hour that they could catch an early morning boat and reach their business in good time The two friends accepted The Sieppes lived in a little box of a house at the foot of B Street the first house to the right as one went up from the station It was two stories high with a funny red mansard roof of oval slates The interior was cut up into innumerable tiny rooms some of them so small as to be hardly better than sleeping closets In the back yard was a contrivance for pumping water from the cistern that interested McTeague at once It was a dog wheel a huge revolving box in which the unhappy black greyhound spent most of his waking hours It was his kennel he slept in it From time to time during the day missus Sieppe appeared on the back doorstep crying shrilly Hoop hoop She threw lumps of coal at him waking him to his work They were all very tired and went to bed early After great discussion it was decided that Marcus would sleep upon the lounge in the front parlor Trina would sleep with August giving up her room to McTeague Selina went to her home a block or so above the Sieppes s At nine o clock mister Sieppe showed McTeague to his room and left him to himself with a newly lighted candle For a long time after mister Sieppe had gone McTeague stood motionless in the middle of the room his elbows pressed close to his sides looking obliquely from the corners of his eyes He hardly dared to move He was in Trina s room It was an ordinary little room A clean white matting was on the floor gray paper spotted with pink and green flowers covered the walls In one corner under a white netting was a little bed the woodwork gayly painted with knots of bright flowers Near it against the wall was a black walnut bureau A work table with spiral legs stood by the window which was hung with a green and gold window curtain Opposite the window the closet door stood ajar while in the corner across from the bed was a tiny washstand with two clean towels And that was all But it was Trina s room McTeague was in his lady s bower it seemed to him a little nest intimate discreet He felt hideously out of place He was an intruder he with his enormous feet his colossal bones his crude brutal gestures The mere weight of his limbs he was sure would crush the little bed stead like an eggshell Then as this first sensation wore off he began to feel the charm of the little chamber It was as though Trina were close by but invisible McTeague felt all the delight of her presence without the embarrassment that usually accompanied it He was near to her nearer than he had ever been before He saw into her daily life her little ways and manners her habits her very thoughts And was there not in the air of that room a certain faint perfume that he knew that recalled her to his mind with marvellous vividness As he put the candle down upon the bureau he saw her hairbrush lying there Instantly he picked it up and without knowing why held it to his face With what a delicious odor was it redolent That heavy enervating odor of her hair her wonderful royal hair The smell of that little hairbrush was talismanic He had but to close his eyes to see her as distinctly as in a mirror He saw her tiny round figure dressed all in black for curiously enough it was his very first impression of Trina that came back to him now not the Trina of the later occasions not the Trina of the blue cloth skirt and white sailor He saw her as he had seen her the day that Marcus had introduced them saw her pale round face her narrow half open eyes blue like the eyes of a baby her tiny pale ears suggestive of anaemia the freckles across the bridge of her nose her pale lips the tiara of royal black hair and above all the delicious poise of the head tipped back as though by the weight of all that hair the poise that thrust out her chin a little with the movement that was so confiding so innocent so nearly infantile McTeague went softly about the room from one object to another beholding Trina in everything he touched or looked at He came at last to the closet door It was ajar He opened it wide and paused upon the threshold Trina s clothes were hanging there skirts and waists jackets and stiff white petticoats What a vision For an instant McTeague caught his breath spellbound If he had suddenly discovered Trina herself there smiling at him holding out her hands he could hardly have been more overcome Instantly he recognized the black dress she had worn on that famous first day There it was the little jacket she had carried over her arm the day he had terrified her with his blundering declaration and still others and others a whole group of Trinas faced him there He went farther into the closet touching the clothes gingerly stroking them softly with his huge leathern palms As he stirred them a delicate perfume disengaged itself from the folds Ah that exquisite feminine odor It was not only her hair now it was Trina herself her mouth her hands her neck the indescribably sweet fleshly aroma that was a part of her pure and clean and redolent of youth and freshness All at once seized with an unreasoned impulse McTeague opened his huge arms and gathered the little garments close to him plunging his face deep amongst them savoring their delicious odor with long breaths of luxury and supreme content The picnic at Schuetzen Park decided matters McTeague began to call on Trina regularly Sunday and Wednesday afternoons He took Marcus Schouler s place Sometimes Marcus accompanied him but it was generally to meet Selina by appointment at the Sieppes s house But Marcus made the most of his renunciation of his cousin He remembered his pose from time to time He made McTeague unhappy and bewildered by wringing his hand by venting sighs that seemed to tear his heart out or by giving evidences of an infinite melancholy What is my life he would exclaim What is left for me Nothing by damn And when McTeague would attempt remonstrance he would cry Never mind old man Never mind me Go be happy I forgive you Forgive what McTeague was all at sea was harassed with the thought of some shadowy irreparable injury he had done his friend Oh don t think of me Marcus would exclaim at other times even when Trina was by Don t think of me I don t count any more I ain t in it Marcus seemed to take great pleasure in contemplating the wreck of his life There is no doubt he enjoyed himself hugely during these days The Sieppes were at first puzzled as well over this change of front Trina has den a new younge man cried mister Sieppe First Schouler now der doktor eh What die tevil I say Weeks passed February went March came in very rainy putting a stop to all their picnics and Sunday excursions One Wednesday afternoon in the second week in March McTeague came over to call on Trina bringing his concertina with him as was his custom nowadays As he got off the train at the station he was surprised to find Trina waiting for him This is the first day it hasn t rained in weeks she explained an I thought it would be nice to walk Sure sure assented McTeague B Street station was nothing more than a little shed There was no ticket office nothing but a couple of whittled and carven benches It was built close to the railroad tracks just across which was the dirty muddy shore of San Francisco Bay About a quarter of a mile back from the station was the edge of the town of Oakland Between the station and the first houses of the town lay immense salt flats here and there broken by winding streams of black water They were covered with a growth of wiry grass strangely discolored in places by enormous stains of orange yellow Near the station a bit of fence painted with a cigar advertisement reeled over into the mud while under its lee lay an abandoned gravel wagon with dished wheels The station was connected with the town by the extension of B Street which struck across the flats geometrically straight a file of tall poles with intervening wires marching along with it At the station these were headed by an iron electric light pole that with its supports and outriggers looked for all the world like an immense grasshopper on its hind legs Across the flats at the fringe of the town were the dump heaps the figures of a few Chinese rag pickers moving over them Far to the left the view was shut off by the immense red brown drum of the gas works to the right it was bounded by the chimneys and workshops of an iron foundry Across the railroad tracks to seaward one saw the long stretch of black mud bank left bare by the tide which was far out nearly half a mile Clouds of sea gulls were forever rising and settling upon this mud bank a wrecked and abandoned wharf crawled over it on tottering legs close in an old sailboat lay canted on her bilge But farther on across the yellow waters of the bay beyond Goat Island lay San Francisco a blue line of hills rugged with roofs and spires Far to the westward opened the Golden Gate a bleak cutting in the sand hills through which one caught a glimpse of the open Pacific The station at B Street was solitary no trains passed at this hour except the distant rag pickers not a soul was in sight The wind blew strong carrying with it the mingled smell of salt of tar of dead seaweed and of bilge The sky hung low and brown at long intervals a few drops of rain fell Near the station Trina and McTeague sat on the roadbed of the tracks at the edge of the mud bank making the most out of the landscape enjoying the open air the salt marshes and the sight of the distant water From time to time McTeague played his six mournful airs upon his concertina After a while they began walking up and down the tracks McTeague talking about his profession Trina listening very interested and absorbed trying to understand For pulling the roots of the upper molars we use the cowhorn forceps continued the dentist monotonously We get the inside beak over the palatal roots and the cow horn beak over the buccal roots that s the roots on the outside you see Then we close the forceps and that breaks right through the alveolus that s the part of the socket in the jaw you understand At another moment he told her of his one unsatisfied desire Some day I m going to have a big gilded tooth outside my window for a sign Those big gold teeth are beautiful beautiful only they cost so much I can t afford one just now Oh it s raining suddenly exclaimed Trina holding out her palm They turned back and reached the station in a drizzle The afternoon was closing in dark and rainy The tide was coming back talking and lapping for miles along the mud bank Far off across the flats at the edge of the town an electric car went by stringing out a long row of diamond sparks on the overhead wires Say Miss Trina said McTeague after a while what s the good of waiting any longer Why can t us two get married Trina still shook her head saying No instinctively in spite of herself Why not persisted McTeague Don t you like me well enough Yes Then why not Because Ah come on he said but Trina still shook her head Ah come on urged McTeague He could think of nothing else to say repeating the same phrase over and over again to all her refusals Ah come on Ah come on Suddenly he took her in his enormous arms crushing down her struggle with his immense strength Then Trina gave up all in an instant turning her head to his They kissed each other grossly full in the mouth A roar and a jarring of the earth suddenly grew near and passed them in a reek of steam and hot air It was the Overland with its flaming headlight on its way across the continent The passage of the train startled them both Trina struggled to free herself from McTeague Oh please please she pleaded on the point of tears McTeague released her but in that moment a slight a barely perceptible revulsion of feeling had taken place in him The instant that Trina gave up the instant she allowed him to kiss her he thought less of her She was not so desirable after all But this reaction was so faint so subtle so intangible that in another moment he had doubted its occurrence Yet afterward it returned Was there not something gone from Trina now Was he not disappointed in her for doing that very thing for which he had longed Was Trina the submissive the compliant the attainable just the same just as delicate and adorable as Trina the inaccessible Perhaps he dimly saw that this must be so that it belonged to the changeless order of things the man desiring the woman only for what she withholds the woman worshipping the man for that which she yields up to him With each concession gained the man s desire cools with every surrender made the woman s adoration increases But why should it be so Trina wrenched herself free and drew back from McTeague her little chin quivering her face even to the lobes of her pale ears flushed scarlet her narrow blue eyes brimming Suddenly she put her head between her hands and began to sob Say say Miss Trina listen listen here Miss Trina cried McTeague coming forward a step Oh don t she gasped shrinking I must go home she cried springing to her feet It s late I must I must Don t come with me please Oh I m so so she could not find any words Let me go alone she went on You may you come Sunday Good by Good by said McTeague his head in a whirl at this sudden unaccountable change Can t I kiss you again But Trina was firm now When it came to his pleading a mere matter of words she was strong enough No no you must not she exclaimed with energy She was gone in another instant The dentist stunned bewildered gazed stupidly after her as she ran up the extension of B Street through the rain But suddenly a great joy took possession of him He had won her Trina was to be for him after all An enormous smile distended his thick lips his eyes grew wide and flashed and he drew his breath quickly striking his mallet like fist upon his knee and exclaiming under his breath I got her by God I got her by God At the same time he thought better of himself his self respect increased enormously The man that could win Trina Sieppe was a man of extraordinary ability Trina burst in upon her mother while the latter was setting a mousetrap in the kitchen Oh mamma Eh Trina Ach what has happun Trina told her in a breath Soh soon was missus Sieppe s first comment Eh well what you cry for then I don t know wailed Trina plucking at the end of her handkerchief You loaf der younge doktor I don t know Well what for you kiss him I don t know You don know you don know Where haf your sensus gone Trina You kiss der doktor You cry and you don know Is ut Marcus den No it s not Cousin Mark Den ut must be der doktor Trina made no answer Eh I I guess so You loaf him I don t know missus Sieppe set down the mousetrap with such violence that it sprung with a sharp snap CHAPTER six No Trina did not know Do I love him Do I love him A thousand times she put the question to herself during the next two or three days At night she hardly slept but lay broad awake for hours in her little gayly painted bed with its white netting torturing herself with doubts and questions At times she remembered the scene in the station with a veritable agony of shame and at other times she was ashamed to recall it with a thrill of joy Nothing could have been more sudden more unexpected than that surrender of herself For over a year she had thought that Marcus would some day be her husband They would be married she supposed some time in the future she did not know exactly when the matter did not take definite shape in her mind She liked Cousin Mark very well And then suddenly this cross current had set in this blond giant had appeared this huge stolid fellow with his immense crude strength She had not loved him at first that was certain The day he had spoken to her in his Parlors she had only been terrified If he had confined himself to merely speaking as did Marcus to pleading with her to wooing her at a distance forestalling her wishes showing her little attentions sending her boxes of candy she could have easily withstood him But he had only to take her in his arms to crush down her struggle with his enormous strength to subdue her conquer her by sheer brute force and she gave up in an instant But why why had she done so Why did she feel the desire the necessity of being conquered by a superior strength Why did it please her Why had it suddenly thrilled her from head to foot with a quick terrifying gust of passion the like of which she had never known Never at his best had Marcus made her feel like that and yet she had always thought she cared for Cousin Mark more than for any one else When McTeague had all at once caught her in his huge arms something had leaped to life in her something that had hitherto lain dormant something strong and overpowering It frightened her now as she thought of it this second self that had wakened within her and that shouted and clamored for recognition And yet was it to be feared Was it something to be ashamed of Was it not after all natural clean spontaneous Trina knew that she was a pure girl knew that this sudden commotion within her carried with it no suggestion of vice Dimly as figures seen in a waking dream these ideas floated through Trina s mind It was quite beyond her to realize them clearly she could not know what they meant Until that rainy day by the shore of the bay Trina had lived her life with as little self consciousness as a tree She was frank straightforward a healthy natural human being without sex as yet She was almost like a boy At once there had been a mysterious disturbance The woman within her suddenly awoke Did she love McTeague Difficult question Did she choose him for better or for worse deliberately of her own free will or was Trina herself allowed even a choice in the taking of that step that was to make or mar her life The Woman is awakened and starting from her sleep catches blindly at what first her newly opened eyes light upon It is a spell a witchery ruled by chance alone inexplicable a fairy queen enamored of a clown with ass s ears McTeague had awakened the Woman and whether she would or no she was his now irrevocably struggle against it as she would she belonged to him body and soul for life or for death She had not sought it she had not desired it The spell was laid upon her Was it a blessing Was it a curse It was all one she was his indissolubly for evil or for good And he The very act of submission that bound the woman to him forever had made her seem less desirable in his eyes Their undoing had already begun Yet neither of them was to blame From the first they had not sought each other Chance had brought them face to face and mysterious instincts as ungovernable as the winds of heaven were at work knitting their lives together Neither of them had asked that this thing should be that their destinies their very souls should be the sport of chance If they could have known they would have shunned the fearful risk But they were allowed no voice in the matter Why should it all be It had been on a Wednesday that the scene in the B Street station had taken place Throughout the rest of the week at every hour of the day Trina asked herself the same question Do I love him Do I really love him Is this what love is like As she recalled McTeague recalled his huge square cut head his salient jaw his shock of yellow hair his heavy lumbering body his slow wits she found little to admire in him beyond his physical strength and at such moments she shook her head decisively No surely she did not love him Sunday afternoon however McTeague called Trina had prepared a little speech for him She was to tell him that she did not know what had been the matter with her that Wednesday afternoon that she had acted like a bad girl that she did not love him well enough to marry him that she had told him as much once before McTeague saw her alone in the little front parlor The instant she appeared he came straight towards her She saw what he was bent upon doing Wait a minute she cried putting out her hands Wait You don t understand I have got something to say to you She might as well have talked to the wind McTeague put aside her hands with a single gesture and gripped her to him in a bearlike embrace that all but smothered her Trina was but a reed before that giant strength McTeague turned her face to his and kissed her again upon the mouth Where was all Trina s resolve then Where was her carefully prepared little speech Where was all her hesitation and torturing doubts of the last few days She clasped McTeague s huge red neck with both her slender arms she raised her adorable little chin and kissed him in return exclaiming Oh I do love you I do love you Never afterward were the two so happy as at that moment A little later in that same week when Marcus and McTeague were taking lunch at the car conductors coffee joint the former suddenly exclaimed Say Mac now that you ve got Trina you ought to do more for her By damn you ought to for a fact Why don t you take her out somewhere to the theatre or somewhere You ain t on to your job Naturally McTeague had told Marcus of his success with Trina Marcus had taken on a grand air You ve got her have you Well I m glad of it old man I am for a fact I know you ll be happy with her I know how I would have been I forgive you yes I forgive you freely McTeague had not thought of taking Trina to the theatre You think I ought to Mark he inquired hesitating Marcus answered with his mouth full of suet pudding Why of course That s the proper caper Well well that s so The theatre that s the word Take her to the variety show at the Orpheum There s a good show there this week you ll have to take missus Sieppe too of course he added Marcus was not sure of himself as regarded certain proprieties nor for that matter were any of the people of the little world of Polk Street The shop girls the plumbers apprentices the small tradespeople and their like whose social position was not clearly defined could never be sure how far they could go and yet preserve their respectability When they wished to be proper they invariably overdid the thing It was not as if they belonged to the tough element who had no appearances to keep up Polk Street rubbed elbows with the avenue one block above There were certain limits which its dwellers could not overstep but unfortunately for them these limits were poorly defined They could never be sure of themselves At an unguarded moment they might be taken for toughs so they generally erred in the other direction and were absurdly formal No people have a keener eye for the amenities than those whose social position is not assured Oh sure you ll have to take her mother insisted Marcus It wouldn t be the proper racket if you didn t McTeague undertook the affair It was an ordeal Never in his life had he been so perturbed so horribly anxious He called upon Trina the following Wednesday and made arrangements missus Sieppe asked if little August might be included It would console him for the loss of his steamboat Sure sure said McTeague August too everybody he added vaguely We always have to leave so early complained Trina in order to catch the last boat Just when it s becoming interesting At this McTeague acting upon a suggestion of Marcus Schouler s insisted they should stay at the flat over night Marcus and the dentist would give up their rooms to them and sleep at the dog hospital There was a bed there in the sick ward that old Grannis sometimes occupied when a bad case needed watching All at once McTeague had an idea a veritable inspiration And we ll we ll we ll have what s the matter with having something to eat afterward in my Parlors Vairy goot commented missus Sieppe Bier eh And some damales Oh I love tamales exclaimed Trina clasping her hands McTeague returned to the city rehearsing his instructions over and over The theatre party began to assume tremendous proportions First of all he was to get the seats the third or fourth row from the front on the left hand side so as to be out of the hearing of the drums in the orchestra he must make arrangements about the rooms with Marcus must get in the beer but not the tamales must buy for himself a white lawn tie so Marcus directed must look to it that Maria Macapa put his room in perfect order and finally must meet the Sieppes at the ferry slip at half past seven the following Monday night The real labor of the affair began with the buying of the tickets At the theatre McTeague got into wrong entrances was sent from one wicket to another was bewildered confused misunderstood directions was at one moment suddenly convinced that he had not enough money with him and started to return home Finally he found himself at the box office wicket Is it here you buy your seats How many Is it here What night do you want em Yes sir here s the place McTeague gravely delivered himself of the formula he had been reciting for the last dozen hours I want four seats for Monday night in the fourth row from the front and on the right hand side Right hand as you face the house or as you face the stage McTeague was dumfounded I want to be on the right hand side he insisted stolidly adding in order to be away from the drums Well the drums are on the right of the orchestra as you face the stage shouted the other impatiently you want to the left then as you face the house I want to be on the right hand side persisted the dentist Without a word the seller threw out four tickets with a magnificent supercilious gesture There s four seats on the right hand side then and you re right up against the drums But I don t want to be near the drums protested McTeague beginning to perspire Do you know what you want at all said the ticket seller with calmness thrusting his head at McTeague The dentist knew that he had hurt this young man s feelings I want I want he stammered The seller slammed down a plan of the house in front of him and began to explain excitedly It was the one thing lacking to complete McTeague s confusion There are your seats finished the seller shoving the tickets into McTeague s hands They are the fourth row from the front and away from the drums Now are you satisfied Are they on the right hand side I want on the right no I want on the left I want I don know I don know The seller roared McTeague moved slowly away gazing stupidly at the blue slips of pasteboard Two girls took his place at the wicket In another moment McTeague came back peering over the girls shoulders and calling to the seller Are these for Monday night The other disdained reply McTeague retreated again timidly thrusting the tickets into his immense wallet For a moment he stood thoughtful on the steps of the entrance Then all at once he became enraged he did not know exactly why somehow he felt himself slighted Once more he came back to the wicket You can t make small of me he shouted over the girls shoulders you you can t make small of me I ll thump you in the head you little you little you little little little pup The ticket seller shrugged his shoulders wearily A dollar and a half he said to the two girls McTeague glared at him and breathed loudly Finally he decided to let the matter drop He moved away but on the steps was once more seized with a sense of injury and outraged dignity You can t make small of me he called back a last time wagging his head and shaking his fist I will I will I will yes I will He went off muttering At last Monday night came McTeague met the Sieppes at the ferry dressed in a black Prince Albert coat and his best slate blue trousers and wearing the made up lawn necktie that Marcus had selected for him Trina was very pretty in the black dress that McTeague knew so well She wore a pair of new gloves missus Sieppe had on lisle thread mits and carried two bananas and an orange in a net reticule For Owgooste she confided to him Owgooste was in a Fauntleroy costume very much too small for him Already he had been crying Woult you pelief Doktor dot bube has torn his stockun alreatty Walk in der front you stop cryun Where is dot berliceman At the door of the theatre McTeague was suddenly seized with a panic terror He had lost the tickets He tore through his pockets ransacked his wallet They were nowhere to be found All at once he remembered and with a gasp of relief removed his hat and took them out from beneath the sweatband The party entered and took their places It was absurdly early The lights were all darkened the ushers stood under the galleries in groups the empty auditorium echoing with their noisy talk Occasionally a waiter with his tray and clean white apron sauntered up and doun the aisle Directly in front of them was the great iron curtain of the stage painted with all manner of advertisements From behind this came a noise of hammering and of occasional loud voices While waiting they studied their programmes First was an overture by the orchestra after which came The Gleasons in their mirth moving musical farce entitled McMonnigal s Court ship This was to be followed by The Lamont Sisters Winnie and Violet serio comiques and skirt dancers And after this came a great array of other artists and specialty performers musical wonders acrobats lightning artists ventriloquists and last of all The feature of the evening the crowning scientific achievement of the nineteenth century the kinetoscope McTeague was excited dazzled In five years he had not been twice to the theatre Now he beheld himself inviting his girl and her mother to accompany him He began to feel that he was a man of the world He ordered a cigar Meanwhile the house was filling up A few side brackets were turned on The ushers ran up and down the aisles stubs of tickets between their thumb and finger and from every part of the auditorium could be heard the sharp clap clapping of the seats as the ushers flipped them down A buzz of talk arose In the gallery a street gamin whistled shrilly and called to some friends on the other side of the house Are they go wun to begin pretty soon ma whined Owgooste for the fifth or sixth time adding Say ma can t I have some candy A cadaverous little boy had appeared in their aisle chanting Candies French mixed candies popcorn peanuts and candy The orchestra entered each man crawling out from an opening under the stage hardly larger than the gate of a rabbit hutch At every instant now the crowd increased there were but few seats that were not taken The waiters hurried up and down the aisles their trays laden with beer glasses A smell of cigar smoke filled the air and soon a faint blue haze rose from all corners of the house Ma when are they go wun to begin cried Owgooste As he spoke the iron advertisement curtain rose disclosing the curtain proper underneath This latter curtain was quite an affair Upon it was painted a wonderful picture A flight of marble steps led down to a stream of water two white swans their necks arched like the capital letter S floated about At the head of the marble steps were two vases filled with red and yellow flowers while at the foot was moored a gondola This gondola was full of red velvet rugs that hung over the side and trailed in the water In the prow of the gondola a young man in vermilion tights held a mandolin in his left hand and gave his right to a girl in white satin A King Charles spaniel dragging a leading string in the shape of a huge pink sash followed the girl Seven scarlet roses were scattered upon the two lowest steps and eight floated in the water Ain t that pretty Mac exclaimed Trina turning to the dentist Ma ain t they go wun to begin now wow whined Owgooste Suddenly the lights all over the house blazed up Ah said everybody all at once Ain t ut crowdut murmured mister Sieppe Every seat was taken many were even standing up I always like it better when there is a crowd said Trina She was in great spirits that evening Her round pale face was positively pink The orchestra banged away at the overture suddenly finishing with a great flourish of violins A short pause followed Then the orchestra played a quick step strain and the curtain rose on an interior furnished with two red chairs and a green sofa A girl in a short blue dress and black stockings entered in a hurry and began to dust the two chairs She was in a great temper talking very fast disclaiming against the new lodger It appeared that this latter never paid his rent that he was given to late hours Then she came down to the footlights and began to sing in a tremendous voice hoarse and flat almost like a man s The chorus of a feeble originality ran Oh how happy I will be When my darling s face I ll see Oh tell him for to meet me in the moonlight Down where the golden lilies bloom The orchestra played the tune of this chorus a second time with certain variations while the girl danced to it She sidled to one side of the stage and kicked then sidled to the other and kicked again As she finished with the song a man evidently the lodger in question came in Instantly McTeague exploded in a roar of laughter The man was intoxicated his hat was knocked in one end of his collar was unfastened and stuck up into his face his watch chain dangled from his pocket and a yellow satin slipper was tied to a button hole of his vest his nose was vermilion one eye was black and blue After a short dialogue with the girl a third actor appeared He was dressed like a little boy the girl s younger brother He wore an immense turned down collar and was continually doing hand springs and wonderful back somersaults The act devolved upon these three people the lodger making love to the girl in the short blue dress the boy playing all manner of tricks upon him giving him tremendous digs in the ribs or slaps upon the back that made him cough pulling chairs from under him running on all fours between his legs and upsetting him knocking him over at inopportune moments Every one of his falls was accentuated by a bang upon the bass drum The whole humor of the act seemed to consist in the tripping up of the intoxicated lodger This horse play delighted McTeague beyond measure He roared and shouted every time the lodger went down slapping his knee wagging his head Owgooste crowed shrilly clapping his hands and continually asking What did he say ma What did he say missus Sieppe laughed immoderately her huge fat body shaking like a mountain of jelly She exclaimed from time to time Ach Gott dot fool Even Trina was moved laughing demurely her lips closed putting one hand with its new glove to her mouth The performance went on Now it was the musical marvels two men extravagantly made up as negro minstrels with immense shoes and plaid vests They seemed to be able to wrestle a tune out of almost anything glass bottles cigar box fiddles strings of sleigh bells even graduated brass tubes which they rubbed with resined fingers McTeague was stupefied with admiration That s what you call musicians he announced gravely Home Sweet Home played upon a trombone Think of that Art could go no farther The acrobats left him breathless They were dazzling young men with beautifully parted hair continually making graceful gestures to the audience In one of them the dentist fancied he saw a strong resemblance to the boy who had tormented the intoxicated lodger and who had turned such marvellous somersaults Trina could not bear to watch their antics She turned away her head with a little shudder It always makes me sick she explained The beautiful young lady The Society Contralto in evening dress who sang the sentimental songs and carried the sheets of music at which she never looked pleased McTeague less Trina however was captivated She grew pensive over You do not love me no Bid me good by and go and split her new gloves in her enthusiasm when it was finished Don t you love sad music Mac she murmured Then came the two comedians They talked with fearful rapidity their wit and repartee seemed inexhaustible As I was going down the street yesterday Ah as YOU were going down the street all right I saw a girl at a window YOU saw a girl at a window And this girl she was a corker Ah as YOU were going down the street yesterday YOU saw a girl at a window and this girl she was a corker All right go on The other comedian went on The joke was suddenly evolved A certain phrase led to a song which was sung with lightning rapidity each performer making precisely the same gestures at precisely the same instant They were irresistible McTeague though he caught but a third of the jokes could have listened all night After the comedians had gone out the iron advertisement curtain was let down What comes now said McTeague bewildered It s the intermission of fifteen minutes now The musicians disappeared through the rabbit hutch and the audience stirred and stretched itself Most of the young men left their seats During this intermission McTeague and his party had refreshments missus Sieppe and Trina had Queen Charlottes McTeague drank a glass of beer Owgooste ate the orange and one of the bananas He begged for a glass of lemonade which was finally given him Joost to geep um quiet observed missus Sieppe But almost immediately after drinking his lemonade Owgooste was seized with a sudden restlessness He twisted and wriggled in his seat swinging his legs violently looking about him with eyes full of a vague distress At length just as the musicians were returning he stood up and whispered energetically in his mother s ear missus Sieppe was exasperated at once No no she cried reseating him brusquely The performance was resumed A lightning artist appeared drawing caricatures and portraits with incredible swiftness He even went so far as to ask for subjects from the audience and the names of prominent men were shouted to him from the gallery He drew portraits of the President of Grant of Washington of Napoleon Bonaparte of Bismarck of Garibaldi of P T Barnum And so the evening passed The hall grew very hot and the smoke of innumerable cigars made the eyes smart A thick blue mist hung low over the heads of the audience The air was full of varied smells the smell of stale cigars of flat beer of orange peel of gas of sachet powders and of cheap perfumery One artist after another came upon the stage McTeague s attention never wandered for a minute Trina and her mother enjoyed themselves hugely At every moment they made comments to one another their eyes never leaving the stage Ain t dot fool joost too funny That s a pretty song Don t you like that kind of a song Wonderful It s wonderful Yes yes wonderful That s the word Owgooste however lost interest He stood up in his place his back to the stage chewing a piece of orange peel and watching a little girl in her father s lap across the aisle his eyes fixed in a glassy ox like stare But he was uneasy He danced from one foot to the other and at intervals appealed in hoarse whispers to his mother who disdained an answer Ma say ma ah he whined abstractedly chewing his orange peel staring at the little girl Ma ah say ma At times his monotonous plaint reached his mother s consciousness She suddenly realized what this was that was annoying her Owgooste will you sit down She caught him up all at once and jammed him down into his place Be quiet den loog listun at der yunge girls Three young women and a young man who played a zither occupied the stage They were dressed in Tyrolese costume they were yodlers and sang in German about mountain tops and bold hunters and the like The yodling chorus was a marvel of flute like modulations The girls were really pretty and were not made up in the least Their turn had a great success missus Sieppe was entranced Instantly she remembered her girlhood and her native Swiss village Ach dot is heavunly joost like der old country Mein gran mutter used to be one of der mos famous yodlers When I was leedle I haf seen dem joost like dat Ma ah began Owgooste fretfully as soon as the yodlers had departed He could not keep still an instant he twisted from side to side swinging his legs with incredible swiftness Ma ah I want to go ho ome Pehave exclaimed his mother shaking him by the arm loog der leedle girl is watchun you Dis is der last dime I take you to der blay you see I don t ca are I m sleepy At length to their great relief he went to sleep his head against his mother s arm The kinetoscope fairly took their breaths away What will they do next observed Trina in amazement Ain t that wonderful Mac McTeague was awe struck Look at that horse move his head he cried excitedly quite carried away Look at that cable car coming and the man going across the street See here comes a truck Well I never in all my life What would Marcus say to this It s all a drick exclaimed missus Sieppe with sudden conviction I ain t no fool dot s nothun but a drick Well of course mamma exclaimed Trina it s But missus Sieppe put her head in the air I m too old to be fooled she persisted It s a drick Nothing more could be got out of her than this The party stayed to the very end of the show though the kinetoscope was the last number but one on the programme and fully half the audience left immediately afterward However while the unfortunate Irish comedian went through his act to the backs of the departing people missus Sieppe woke Owgooste very cross and sleepy and began getting her things together As soon as he was awake Owgooste began fidgeting again Save der brogramme Trina whispered missus Sieppe Take ut home to popper Where is der hat of Owgooste Haf you got mein handkerchief Trina But at this moment a dreadful accident happened to Owgooste his distress reached its climax his fortitude collapsed What a misery It was a veritable catastrophe deplorable lamentable a thing beyond words For a moment he gazed wildly about him helpless and petrified with astonishment and terror Then his grief found utterance and the closing strains of the orchestra were mingled with a prolonged wail of infinite sadness Owgooste what is ut cried his mother eyeing him with dawning suspicion then suddenly What haf you done You haf ruin your new Vauntleroy gostume Her face blazed without more ado she smacked him soundly Then it was that Owgooste touched the limit of his misery his unhappiness his horrible discomfort his utter wretchedness was complete He filled the air with his doleful outcries The more he was smacked and shaken the louder he wept What what is the matter inquired McTeague Trina s face was scarlet Nothing nothing she exclaimed hastily looking away Come we must be going It s about over The end of the show and the breaking up of the audience tided over the embarrassment of the moment The party filed out at the tail end of the audience Already the lights were being extinguished and the ushers spreading druggeting over the upholstered seats McTeague and the Sieppes took an uptown car that would bring them near Polk Street The car was crowded McTeague and Owgooste were obliged to stand The little boy fretted to be taken in his mother s lap but missus Sieppe emphatically refused On their way home they discussed the performance I I like best der yodlers Ah the soloist was the best the lady who sang those sad songs Wasn t wasn t that magic lantern wonderful where the figures moved Wonderful ah wonderful And wasn t that first act funny where the fellow fell down all the time And that musical act and the fellow with the burnt cork face who played Nearer My God to Thee on the beer bottles They got off at Polk Street and walked up a block to the flat The street was dark and empty opposite the flat in the back of the deserted market the ducks and geese were calling persistently As they were buying their tamales from the half breed Mexican at the street corner McTeague observed Marcus ain t gone to bed yet See there s a light in his window There he exclaimed at once I forgot the doorkey Well Marcus can let us in Hardly had he rung the bell at the street door of the flat when the bolt was shot back In the hall at the top of the long narrow staircase there was the sound of a great scurrying Maria Macapa stood there her hand upon the rope that drew the bolt Marcus was at her side Old Grannis was in the background looking over their shoulders while little Miss Baker leant over the banisters a strange man in a drab overcoat at her side As McTeague s party stepped into the doorway a half dozen voices cried Yes it s them Is that you Mac Is that you Miss Sieppe Is your name Trina Sieppe Then shriller than all the rest Maria Macapa screamed Oh Miss Sieppe come up here quick Your lottery ticket has won five thousand dollars CHAPTER seven What nonsense answered Trina Ach Gott What is ut cried missus Sieppe misunderstanding supposing a calamity What what what stammered the dentist confused by the lights the crowded stairway the medley of voices The party reached the landing The others surrounded them Marcus alone seemed to rise to the occasion Le me be the first to congratulate you he cried catching Trina s hand Every one was talking at once Miss Sieppe Miss Sieppe your ticket has won five thousand dollars cried Maria Don t you remember the lottery ticket I sold you in Doctor McTeague s office Trina almost screamed her mother Five tausend thalers five tausend thalers If popper were only here What is it what is it exclaimed McTeague rolling his eyes What are you going to do with it Trina inquired Marcus You re a rich woman my dear said Miss Baker her little false curls quivering with excitement and I m glad for your sake Let me kiss you To think I was in the room when you bought the ticket Oh oh interrupted Trina shaking her head there is a mistake There must be Why why should I win five thousand dollars It s nonsense No mistake no mistake screamed Maria Your number was four hundred thousand twelve Here it is in the paper this evening I remember it well because I keep an account But I know you re wrong answered Trina beginning to tremble in spite of herself Why should I win Eh Why shouldn t you cried her mother In fact why shouldn t she The idea suddenly occurred to Trina After all it was not a question of effort or merit on her part Why should she suppose a mistake What if it were true this wonderful fillip of fortune striking in there like some chance driven bolt Oh do you think so she gasped The stranger in the drab overcoat came forward It s the agent cried two or three voices simultaneously I guess you re one of the lucky ones Miss Sieppe he said I suppose you have kept your ticket Yes yes four three oughts twelve I remember That s right admitted the other Present your ticket at the local branch office as soon as possible the address is printed on the back of the ticket and you ll receive a check on our bank for five thousand dollars Your number will have to be verified on our official list but there s hardly a chance of a mistake I congratulate you All at once a great shrill of gladness surged up in Trina She was to possess five thousand dollars She was carried away with the joy of her good fortune a natural spontaneous joy the gaiety of a child with a new and wonderful toy Oh I ve won I ve won I ve won she cried clapping her hands Mamma think of it I ve won five thousand dollars just by buying a ticket Mac what do you say to that I ve got five thousand dollars August do you hear what s happened to sister Kiss your mommer Trina suddenly commanded missus Sieppe What efer will you do mit all dose money eh Trina Huh exclaimed Marcus Get married on it for one thing Thereat they all shouted with laughter McTeague grinned and looked about sheepishly Talk about luck muttered Marcus shaking his head at the dentist then suddenly he added Well are we going to stay talking out here in the hall all night Can t we all come into your Parlors Mac Sure sure exclaimed McTeague hastily unlocking his door Efery botty gome cried missus Sieppe genially Ain t ut so Doktor Everybody repeated the dentist There s there s some beer We ll celebrate by damn exclaimed Marcus It ain t every day you win five thousand dollars It s only Sundays and legal holidays Again he set the company off into a gale of laughter Anything was funny at a time like this In some way every one of them felt elated The wheel of fortune had come spinning close to them They were near to this great sum of money It was as though they too had won Here s right where I sat when I bought that ticket cried Trina after they had come into the Parlors and Marcus had lit the gas Right here in this chair She sat down in one of the rigid chairs under the steel engraving And Marcus you sat here And I was just getting out of the operating chair interposed Miss Baker Yes yes That s so and you continued Trina pointing to Maria came up and said Buy a ticket in the lottery just a dollar Oh I remember it just as plain as though it was yesterday and I wasn t going to at first And don t you know I told Maria it was against the law Yes I remember and then I gave her a dollar and put the ticket in my pocketbook It s in my pocketbook now at home in the top drawer of my bureau oh suppose it should be stolen now she suddenly exclaimed It s worth big money now asserted Marcus Five thousand dollars Who would have thought it It s wonderful Everybody started and turned It was McTeague He stood in the middle of the floor wagging his huge head He seemed to have just realized what had happened Yes sir five thousand dollars exclaimed Marcus with a sudden unaccountable mirthlessness Five thousand dollars Do you get on to that Cousin Trina and you will be rich people At six per cent that s twenty five dollars a month hazarded the agent Think of it Think of it muttered McTeague He went aimlessly about the room his eyes wide his enormous hands dangling A cousin of mine won forty dollars once observed Miss Baker But he spent every cent of it buying more tickets and never won anything Then the reminiscences began Maria told about the butcher on the next block who had won twenty dollars the last drawing missus Sieppe knew a gasfitter in Oakland who had won several times once a hundred dollars Little Miss Baker announced that she had always believed that lotteries were wrong but just the same five thousand was five thousand It s all right when you win ain t it Miss Baker observed Marcus with a certain sarcasm What was the matter with Marcus At moments he seemed singularly out of temper But the agent was full of stories He told his experiences the legends and myths that had grown up around the history of the lottery he told of the poor newsboy with a dying mother to support who had drawn a prize of fifteen thousand of the man who was driven to suicide through want but who held had he but known it the number that two days after his death drew the capital prize of thirty thousand dollars of the little milliner who for ten years had played the lottery without success and who had one day declared that she would buy but one more ticket and then give up trying and of how this last ticket had brought her a fortune upon which she could retire of tickets that had been lost or destroyed and whose numbers had won fabulous sums at the drawing of criminals driven to vice by poverty and who had reformed after winning competencies of gamblers who played the lottery as they would play a faro bank turning in their winnings again as soon as made buying thousands of tickets all over the country of superstitions as to terminal and initial numbers and as to lucky days of purchase of marvellous coincidences three capital prizes drawn consecutively by the same town a ticket bought by a millionaire and given to his boot black who won a thousand dollars upon it the same number winning the same amount an indefinite number of times and so on to infinity Invariably it was the needy who won the destitute and starving woke to wealth and plenty the virtuous toiler suddenly found his reward in a ticket bought at a hazard the lottery was a great charity the friend of the people a vast beneficent machine that recognized neither rank nor wealth nor station The company began to be very gay Chairs and tables were brought in from the adjoining rooms and Maria was sent out for more beer and tamales and also commissioned to buy a bottle of wine and some cake for Miss Baker who abhorred beer The Dental Parlors were in great confusion Empty beer bottles stood on the movable rack where the instruments were kept plates and napkins were upon the seat of the operating chair and upon the stand of shelves in the corner side by side with the concertina and the volumes of Allen s Practical Dentist The canary woke and chittered crossly his feathers puffed out the husks of tamales littered the floor the stone pug dog sitting before the little stove stared at the unusual scene his glass eyes starting from their sockets They drank and feasted in impromptu fashion Marcus Schouler assumed the office of master of ceremonies he was in a lather of excitement rushing about here and there opening beer bottles serving the tamales slapping McTeague upon the back laughing and joking continually He made McTeague sit at the head of the table with Trina at his right and the agent at his left he when he sat down at all occupied the foot Maria Macapa at his left while next to her was missus Sieppe opposite Miss Baker Owgooste had been put to bed upon the bed lounge Where s Old Grannis suddenly exclaimed Marcus Sure enough where had the old Englishman gone He had been there at first I called him down with everybody else cried Maria Macapa as soon as I saw in the paper that Miss Sieppe had won We all came down to mister Schouler s room and waited for you to come home I think he must have gone back to his room I ll bet you ll find him sewing up his books No no observed Miss Baker not at this hour Evidently the timid old gentleman had taken advantage of the confusion to slip unobtrusively away I ll go bring him down shouted Marcus he s got to join us Miss Baker was in great agitation I I hardly think you d better she murmured he he I don t think he drinks beer He takes his amusement in sewin up books cried Maria Marcus brought him down nevertheless having found him just preparing for bed I I must apologize stammered Old Grannis as he stood in the doorway I had not quite expected I find find myself a little unprepared He was without collar and cravat owing to Marcus Schouler s precipitate haste He was annoyed beyond words that Miss Baker saw him thus Could anything be more embarrassing Old Grannis was introduced to missus Sieppe and to Trina as Marcus s employer They shook hands solemnly I don t believe that he an Miss Baker have ever been introduced cried Maria Macapa shrilly an they ve been livin side by side for years The two old people were speechless avoiding each other s gaze 
816_2301_000043_000002	train-clean-360	It had come at last 
none	none	they were to know each other to talk together to touch each other s hands Marcus brought Old Grannis around the table to little Miss Baker dragging him by the coat sleeve exclaiming Well I thought you two people knew each other long ago Miss Baker this is mister Grannis mister Grannis this is Miss Baker Neither spoke Like two little children they faced each other awkward constrained tongue tied with embarrassment Then Miss Baker put out her hand shyly Old Grannis touched it for an instant and let it fall Now you know each other cried Marcus and it s about time For the first time their eyes met Old Grannis trembled a little putting his hand uncertainly to his chin Miss Baker flushed ever so slightly but Maria Macapa passed suddenly between them carrying a half empty beer bottle The two old people fell back from one another Miss Baker resuming her seat Here s a place for you over here mister Grannis cried Marcus making room for him at his side Old Grannis slipped into the chair withdrawing at once from the company s notice He stared fixedly at his plate and did not speak again Old Miss Baker began to talk volubly across the table to missus Sieppe about hot house flowers and medicated flannels It was in the midst of this little impromptu supper that the engagement of Trina and the dentist was announced In a pause in the chatter of conversation missus Sieppe leaned forward and speaking to the agent said Vell you know also my daughter Trina get married bretty soon She and der dentist Doktor McTeague eh yes There was a general exclamation I thought so all along cried Miss Baker excitedly The first time I saw them together I said What a pair Delightful exclaimed the agent to be married and win a snug little fortune at the same time So So murmured Old Grannis nodding at his plate Good luck to you cried Maria He s lucky enough already growled Marcus under his breath relapsing for a moment into one of those strange moods of sullenness which had marked him throughout the evening Trina flushed crimson drawing shyly nearer her mother McTeague grinned from ear to ear looking around from one to another exclaiming Huh Huh But the agent rose to his feet a newly filled beer glass in his hand He was a man of the world this agent He knew life He was suave and easy A diamond was on his little finger Ladies and gentlemen he began There was an instant silence This is indeed a happy occasion I I am glad to be here to night to be a witness to such good fortune to partake in these in this celebration Why I feel almost as glad as if I had held four three oughts twelve myself as if the five thousand were mine instead of belonging to our charming hostess The good wishes of my humble self go out to Miss Sieppe in this moment of her good fortune and I think in fact I am sure I can speak for the great institution the great company I represent The company congratulates Miss Sieppe We they ah They wish her every happiness her new fortune can procure her It has been my duty my ah cheerful duty to call upon the winners of large prizes and to offer the felicitation of the company I have in my experience called upon many such but never have I seen fortune so happily bestowed as in this case The company have dowered the prospective bride I am sure I but echo the sentiments of this assembly when I wish all joy and happiness to this happy pair happy in the possession of a snug little fortune and happy happy in he finished with a sudden inspiration in the possession of each other I drink to the health wealth and happiness of the future bride and groom Let us drink standing up They drank with enthusiasm Marcus was carried away with the excitement of the moment Outa sight outa sight he vociferated clapping his hands Very well said To the health of the bride McTeague McTeague speech speech In an instant the whole table was clamoring for the dentist to speak McTeague was terrified he gripped the table with both hands looking wildly about him Speech speech shouted Marcus running around the table and endeavoring to drag McTeague up No no no muttered the other No speech The company rattled upon the table with their beer glasses insisting upon a speech McTeague settled obstinately into his chair very red in the face shaking his head energetically Ah go on he exclaimed no speech Ah get up and say somethun anyhow persisted Marcus you ought to do it It s the proper caper McTeague heaved himself up there was a burst of applause he looked slowly about him then suddenly sat down again shaking his head hopelessly Oh go on Mac cried Trina Get up say somethun anyhow cried Marcus tugging at his arm you GOT to Once more McTeague rose to his feet Huh he exclaimed looking steadily at the table Then he began I don know what to say I I I ain t never made a speech before I I ain t never made a speech before But I m glad Trina s won the prize Yes I ll bet you are muttered Marcus I I I m glad Trina s won and I I want to I want to I want to want to say that you re all welcome an drink hearty an I m much obliged to the agent Trina and I are goin to be married an I m glad everybody s here to night an you re all welcome an drink hearty an I hope you ll come again an you re always welcome an I an an That s about all I gotta say He sat down wiping his forehead amidst tremendous applause Soon after that the company pushed back from the table and relaxed into couples and groups The men with the exception of Old Grannis began to smoke the smell of their tobacco mingling with the odors of ether creosote and stale bedding which pervaded the Parlors Soon the windows had to be lowered from the top missus Sieppe and old Miss Baker sat together in the bay window exchanging confidences Miss Baker had turned back the overskirt of her dress a plate of cake was in her lap from time to time she sipped her wine with the delicacy of a white cat The two women were much interested in each other Miss Baker told missus Sieppe all about Old Grannis not forgetting the fiction of the title and the unjust stepfather He s quite a personage really said Miss Baker missus Sieppe led the conversation around to her children Ach Trina is sudge a goote girl she said always gay yes und sing from morgen to night Und Owgooste he is soh smart also yes eh He has der genius for machines always making somethun mit wheels und sbrings Ah if if I had children murmured the little old maid a trifle wistfully one would have been a sailor he would have begun as a midshipman on my brother s ship in time he would have been an officer The other would have been a landscape gardener Oh Mac exclaimed Trina looking up into the dentist s face think of all this money coming to us just at this very moment Isn t it wonderful Don t it kind of scare you Wonderful wonderful muttered McTeague shaking his head Let s buy a lot of tickets he added struck with an idea Now that s how you can always tell a good cigar observed the agent to Marcus as the two sat smoking at the end of the table The light end should be rolled to a point Ah the Chinese cigar makers cried Marcus in a passion brandishing his fist It s them as is ruining the cause of white labor They are they are for a FACT Ah the rat eaters Ah the white livered curs Over in the corner by the stand of shelves Old Grannis was listening to Maria Macapa The Mexican woman had been violently stirred over Trina s sudden wealth Maria s mind had gone back to her younger days She leaned forward her elbows on her knees her chin in her hands her eyes wide and fixed Old Grannis listened to her attentively There wa n t a piece that was so much as scratched Maria was saying Every piece was just like a mirror smooth and bright oh bright as a little sun Such a service as that was platters and soup tureens and an immense big punchbowl Five thousand dollars what does that amount to Why that punch bowl alone was worth a fortune What a wonderful story exclaimed Old Grannis never for an instant doubting its truth And it s all lost now you say Lost lost repeated Maria Tut tut What a pity What a pity Suddenly the agent rose and broke out with Well I must be going if I m to get any car He shook hands with everybody offered a parting cigar to Marcus congratulated McTeague and Trina a last time and bowed himself out What an elegant gentleman commented Miss Baker Ah said Marcus nodding his head there s a man of the world for you Right on to himself by damn The company broke up Come along Mac cried Marcus we re to sleep with the dogs to night you know The two friends said Good night all around and departed for the little dog hospital Old Grannis hurried to his room furtively terrified lest he should again be brought face to face with Miss Baker He bolted himself in and listened until he heard her foot in the hall and the soft closing of her door She was there close beside him as one might say in the same room for he too had made the discovery as to the similarity of the wallpaper At long intervals he could hear a faint rustling as she moved about What an evening that had been for him He had met her had spoken to her had touched her hand he was in a tremor of excitement In a like manner the little old dressmaker listened and quivered HE was there in that same room which they shared in common separated only by the thinnest board partition He was thinking of her she was almost sure of it They were strangers no longer they were acquaintances friends What an event that evening had been in their lives Late as it was Miss Baker brewed a cup of tea and sat down in her rocking chair close to the partition she rocked gently sipping her tea calming herself after the emotions of that wonderful evening Old Grannis heard the clinking of the tea things and smelt the faint odor of the tea It seemed to him a signal an invitation He drew his chair close to his side of the partition before his work table A pile of half bound Nations was in the little binding apparatus he threaded his huge upholsterer s needle with stout twine and set to work It was their tete a tete Instinctively they felt each other s presence felt each other s thought coming to them through the thin partition It was charming they were perfectly happy There in the stillness that settled over the flat in the half hour after midnight the two old people kept company enjoying after their fashion their little romance that had come so late into the lives of each On the way to her room in the garret Maria Macapa paused under the single gas jet that burned at the top of the well of the staircase she assured herself that she was alone and then drew from her pocket one of McTeague s tapes of non cohesive gold It was the most valuable steal she had ever yet made in the dentist s Parlors She told herself that it was worth at least a couple of dollars Suddenly an idea occurred to her and she went hastily to a window at the end of the hall and shading her face with both hands looked down into the little alley just back of the flat On some nights Zerkow the red headed Polish Jew sat up late taking account of the week s ragpicking There was a dim light in his window now Maria went to her room threw a shawl around her head and descended into the little back yard of the flat by the back stairs As she let herself out of the back gate into the alley Alexander Marcus s Irish setter woke suddenly with a gruff bark The collie who lived on the other side of the fence in the back yard of the branch post office answered with a snarl Then in an instant the endless feud between the two dogs was resumed They dragged their respective kennels to the fence and through the cracks raged at each other in a frenzy of hate their teeth snapped and gleamed the hackles on their backs rose and stiffened Their hideous clamor could have been heard for blocks around What a massacre should the two ever meet Meanwhile Maria was knocking at Zerkow s miserable hovel Who is it Who is it cried the rag picker from within in his hoarse voice that was half whisper starting nervously and sweeping a handful of silver into his drawer It s me Maria Macapa then in a lower voice and as if speaking to herself had a flying squirrel an let him go Ah Maria cried Zerkow obsequiously opening the door Come in come in my girl you re always welcome even as late as this No junk hey But you re welcome for all that You ll have a drink won t you He led her into his back room and got down the whiskey bottle and the broken red tumbler After the two had drunk together Maria produced the gold tape Zerkow s eyes glittered on the instant The sight of gold invariably sent a qualm all through him try as he would he could not repress it His fingers trembled and clawed at his mouth his breath grew short Ah ah ah he exclaimed give it here give it here give it to me Maria That s a good girl come give it to me They haggled as usual over the price but to night Maria was too excited over other matters to spend much time in bickering over a few cents Look here Zerkow she said as soon as the transfer was made I got something to tell you A little while ago I sold a lottery ticket to a girl at the flat the drawing was in this evening s papers How much do you suppose that girl has won I don t know How much How much Five thousand dollars It was as though a knife had been run through the Jew a spasm of an almost physical pain twisted his face his entire body He raised his clenched fists into the air his eyes shut his teeth gnawing his lip Five thousand dollars he whispered five thousand dollars For what For nothing for simply buying a ticket and I have worked so hard for it so hard so hard Five thousand dollars five thousand dollars Oh why couldn t it have come to me he cried his voice choking the tears starting to his eyes why couldn t it have come to me To come so close so close and yet to miss me me who have worked for it fought for it starved for it am dying for it every day Think of it Maria five thousand dollars all bright heavy pieces Bright as a sunset interrupted Maria her chin propped on her hands Such a glory and heavy Yes every piece was heavy and it was all you could do to lift the punch bowl Why that punch bowl was worth a fortune alone And it rang when you hit it with your knuckles didn t it prompted Zerkow eagerly his lips trembling his fingers hooking themselves into claws Sweeter n any church bell continued Maria Go on go on go on cried Zerkow drawing his chair closer and shutting his eyes in ecstasy There were more than a hundred pieces and every one of them gold Ah every one of them gold You should have seen the sight when the leather trunk was opened There wa n t a piece that was so much as scratched every one was like a mirror smooth and bright polished so that it looked black you know how I mean Oh I know I know cried Zerkow moistening his lips Then he plied her with questions questions that covered every detail of that service of plate It was soft wasn t it You could bite into a plate and leave a dent The handles of the knives now were they gold too All the knife was made from one piece of gold was it And the forks the same The interior of the trunk was quilted of course Did Maria ever polish the plates herself When the company ate off this service it must have made a fine noise these gold knives and forks clinking together upon these gold plates Now let s have it all over again Maria pleaded Zerkow Begin now with There were more than a hundred pieces and every one of them gold Go on begin begin begin The red headed Pole was in a fever of excitement Maria s recital had become a veritable mania with him As he listened with closed eyes and trembling lips he fancied he could see that wonderful plate before him there on the table under his eyes under his hand ponderous massive gleaming He tormented Maria into a second repetition of the story into a third The more his mind dwelt upon it the sharper grew his desire Then with Maria s refusal to continue the tale came the reaction Zerkow awoke as from some ravishing dream The plate was gone was irretrievably lost There was nothing in that miserable room but grimy rags and rust corroded iron What torment what agony to be so near so near to see it in one s distorted fancy as plain as in a mirror To know every individual piece as an old friend to feel its weight to be dazzled by its glitter to call it one s own own to have it to oneself hugged to the breast and then to start to wake to come down to the horrible reality And you YOU had it once gasped Zerkow clawing at her arm you had it once all your own Think of it and now it s gone Gone for good and all Perhaps it s buried near your old place somewhere It s gone gone gone chanted Maria in a monotone Zerkow dug his nails into his scalp tearing at his red hair Yes yes it s gone it s gone lost forever Lost forever Marcus and the dentist walked up the silent street and reached the little dog hospital They had hardly spoken on the way McTeague s brain was in a whirl speech failed him He was busy thinking of the great thing that had happened that night and was trying to realize what its effect would be upon his life his life and Trina s As soon as they had found themselves in the street Marcus had relapsed at once to a sullen silence which McTeague was too abstracted to notice They entered the tiny office of the hospital with its red carpet its gas stove and its colored prints of famous dogs hanging against the walls In one corner stood the iron bed which they were to occupy You go on an get to bed Mac observed Marcus I ll take a look at the dogs before I turn in He went outside and passed along into the yard that was bounded on three sides by pens where the dogs were kept A bull terrier dying of gastritis recognized him and began to whimper feebly Marcus paid no attention to the dogs For the first time that evening he was alone and could give vent to his thoughts He took a couple of turns up and down the yard then suddenly in a low voice exclaimed You fool you fool Marcus Schouler If you d kept Trina you d have had that money You might have had it yourself You ve thrown away your chance in life to give up the girl yes but this he stamped his foot with rage to throw five thousand dollars out of the window to stuff it into the pockets of someone else when it might have been yours when you might have had Trina AND the money and all for what Because we were pals Oh pals is all right but five thousand dollars to have played it right into his hands God DAMN the luck CHAPTER eight The next two months were delightful Trina and McTeague saw each other regularly three times a week The dentist went over to B Street Sunday and Wednesday afternoons as usual but on Fridays it was Trina who came to the city She spent the morning between nine and twelve o clock down town for the most part in the cheap department stores doing the weekly shopping for herself and the family At noon she took an uptown car and met McTeague at the corner of Polk Street The two lunched together at a small uptown hotel just around the corner on Sutter Street They were given a little room to themselves Nothing could have been more delicious They had but to close the sliding door to shut themselves off from the whole world Trina would arrive breathless from her raids upon the bargain counters her pale cheeks flushed her hair blown about her face and into the corners of her lips her mother s net reticule stuffed to bursting Once in their tiny private room she would drop into her chair with a little groan Oh MAC I am so tired I ve just been all OVER town Oh it s good to sit down Just think I had to stand up in the car all the way after being on my feet the whole blessed morning Look here what I ve bought Just things and things Look there s some dotted veiling I got for myself see now do you think it looks pretty she spread it over her face and I got a box of writing paper and a roll of crepe paper to make a lamp shade for the front parlor and what do you suppose I saw a pair of Nottingham lace curtains for FORTY NINE CENTS isn t that cheap and some chenille portieres for two and a half Now what have YOU been doing since I last saw you Did mister Heise finally get up enough courage to have his tooth pulled yet Trina took off her hat and veil and rearranged her hair before the looking glass No no not yet I went down to the sign painter s yesterday afternoon to see about that big gold tooth for a sign It costs too much I can t get it yet a while There s two kinds one German gilt and the other French gilt but the German gilt is no good McTeague sighed and wagged his head Even Trina and the five thousand dollars could not make him forget this one unsatisfied longing At other times they would talk at length over their plans while Trina sipped her chocolate and McTeague devoured huge chunks of butterless bread They were to be married at the end of May and the dentist already had his eye on a couple of rooms part of the suite of a bankrupt photographer They were situated in the flat just back of his Parlors and he believed the photographer would sublet them furnished McTeague and Trina had no apprehensions as to their finances They could be sure in fact of a tidy little income The dentist s practice was fairly good and they could count upon the interest of Trina s five thousand dollars To McTeague s mind this interest seemed woefully small He had had uncertain ideas about that five thousand dollars had imagined that they would spend it in some lavish fashion would buy a house perhaps or would furnish their new rooms with overwhelming luxury luxury that implied red velvet carpets and continued feasting The oldtime miner s idea of wealth easily gained and quickly spent persisted in his mind But when Trina had begun to talk of investments and interests and per cents he was troubled and not a little disappointed The lump sum of five thousand dollars was one thing a miserable little twenty or twenty five a month was quite another and then someone else had the money But don t you see Mac explained Trina it s ours just the same We could get it back whenever we wanted it and then it s the reasonable way to do We mustn t let it turn our heads Mac dear like that man that spent all he won in buying more tickets How foolish we d feel after we d spent it all We ought to go on just the same as before as if we hadn t won We must be sensible about it mustn t we Well well I guess perhaps that s right the dentist would answer looking slowly about on the floor Just what should ultimately be done with the money was the subject of endless discussion in the Sieppe family The savings bank would allow only three per cent but Trina s parents believed that something better could be got There s Uncle Oelbermann Trina had suggested remembering the rich relative who had the wholesale toy store in the Mission mister Sieppe struck his hand to his forehead Ah an idea he cried In the end an agreement was made The money was invested in mister Oelbermann s business He gave Trina six per cent Invested in this fashion Trina s winning would bring in twenty five dollars a month But besides this Trina had her own little trade She made Noah s ark animals for Uncle Oelbermann s store Trina s ancestors on both sides were German Swiss and some long forgotten forefather of the sixteenth century some worsted leggined wood carver of the Tyrol had handed down the talent of the national industry to reappear in this strangely distorted guise She made Noah s ark animals whittling them out of a block of soft wood with a sharp jack knife the only instrument she used Trina was very proud to explain her work to McTeague as he had already explained his own to her You see I take a block of straight grained pine and cut out the shape roughly at first with the big blade then I go over it a second time with the little blade more carefully then I put in the ears and tail with a drop of glue and paint it with a non poisonous paint Vandyke brown for the horses foxes and cows slate gray for the elephants and camels burnt umber for the chickens zebras and so on then last a dot of Chinese white for the eyes and there you are all finished They sell for nine cents a dozen Only I can t make the manikins The manikins The little figures you know Noah and his wife and Shem and all the others It was true Trina could not whittle them fast enough and cheap enough to compete with the turning lathe that could throw off whole tribes and peoples of manikins while she was fashioning one family Everything else however she made the ark itself all windows and no door the box in which the whole was packed even down to pasting on the label which read Made in France She earned from three to four dollars a week The income from these three sources McTeague s profession the interest of the five thousand dollars and Trina s whittling made a respectable little sum taken altogether Trina declared they could even lay by something adding to the five thousand dollars little by little It soon became apparent that Trina would be an extraordinarily good housekeeper Economy was her strong point A good deal of peasant blood still ran undiluted in her veins and she had all the instinct of a hardy and penurious mountain race the instinct which saves without any thought without idea of consequence saving for the sake of saving hoarding without knowing why Even McTeague did not know how closely Trina held to her new found wealth But they did not always pass their luncheon hour in this discussion of incomes and economies As the dentist came to know his little woman better she grew to be more and more of a puzzle and a joy to him She would suddenly interrupt a grave discourse upon the rents of rooms and the cost of light and fuel with a brusque outburst of affection that set him all a tremble with delight All at once she would set down her chocolate and leaning across the narrow table would exclaim Never mind all that Oh Mac do you truly really love me love me BIG McTeague would stammer something gasping and wagging his head beside himself for the lack of words Old bear Trina would answer grasping him by both huge ears and swaying his head from side to side Kiss me then Tell me Mac did you think any less of me that first time I let you kiss me there in the station Oh Mac dear what a funny nose you ve got all full of hairs inside and Mac do you know you ve got a bald spot she dragged his head down towards her right on the top of your head Then she would seriously kiss the bald spot in question declaring That ll make the hair grow Trina took an infinite enjoyment in playing with McTeague s great square cut head rumpling his hair till it stood on end putting her fingers in his eyes or stretching his ears out straight and watching the effect with her head on one side It was like a little child playing with some gigantic good natured Saint Bernard One particular amusement they never wearied of The two would lean across the table towards each other McTeague folding his arms under his breast Then Trina resting on her elbows would part his mustache the great blond mustache of a viking with her two hands pushing it up from his lips causing his face to assume the appearance of a Greek mask She would curl it around either forefinger drawing it to a fine end Then all at once McTeague would make a fearful snorting noise through his nose Invariably though she was expecting this though it was part of the game Trina would jump with a stifled shriek McTeague would bellow with laughter till his eyes watered Then they would recommence upon the instant Trina protesting with a nervous tremulousness Now now now Mac DON T you SCARE me so But these delicious tete a tetes with Trina were offset by a certain coolness that Marcus Schouler began to affect towards the dentist At first McTeague was unaware of it but by this time even his slow wits began to perceive that his best friend his pal was not the same to him as formerly They continued to meet at lunch nearly every day but Friday at the car conductors coffee joint But Marcus was sulky there could be no doubt about that He avoided talking to McTeague read the paper continually answering the dentist s timid efforts at conversation in gruff monosyllables Sometimes even he turned sideways to the table and talked at great length to Heise the harness maker whose table was next to theirs They took no more long walks together when Marcus went out to exercise the dogs Nor did Marcus ever again recur to his generosity in renouncing Trina One Tuesday as McTeague took his place at the table in the coffee joint he found Marcus already there Hello Mark said the dentist you here already Hello returned the other indifferently helping himself to tomato catsup There was a silence After a long while Marcus suddenly looked up Say Mac he exclaimed when you going to pay me that money you owe me McTeague was astonished Huh What I don t do I owe you any money Mark Well you owe me four bits returned Marcus doggedly I paid for you and Trina that day at the picnic and you never gave it back Oh oh answered McTeague in distress That s so that s so I you ought to have told me before Here s your money and I m obliged to you It ain t much observed Marcus sullenly But I need all I can get now a days Are you are you broke inquired McTeague And I ain t saying anything about your sleeping at the hospital that night either muttered Marcus as he pocketed the coin Well well do you mean should I have paid for that Well you d a had to sleep SOMEWHERES wouldn t you flashed out Marcus You a had to pay half a dollar for a bed at the flat All right all right cried the dentist hastily feeling in his pockets I don t want you should be out anything on my account old man Here will four bits do I don t WANT your damn money shouted Marcus in a sudden rage throwing back the coin I ain t no beggar McTeague was miserable How had he offended his pal Well I want you should take it Mark he said pushing it towards him I tell you I won t touch your money exclaimed the other through his clenched teeth white with passion I ve been played for a sucker long enough What s the matter with you lately Mark remonstrated McTeague You ve got a grouch about something Is there anything I ve done Well that s all right that s all right returned Marcus as he rose from the table That s all right I ve been played for a sucker long enough that s all I ve been played for a sucker long enough He went away with a parting malevolent glance At the corner of Polk Street between the flat and the car conductors coffee joint was Frenna s It was a corner grocery advertisements for cheap butter and eggs painted in green marking ink upon wrapping paper stood about on the sidewalk outside The doorway was decorated with a huge Milwaukee beer sign Back of the store proper was a bar where white sand covered the floor A few tables and chairs were scattered here and there The walls were hung with gorgeously colored tobacco advertisements and colored lithographs of trotting horses On the wall behind the bar was a model of a full rigged ship enclosed in a bottle It was at this place that the dentist used to leave his pitcher to be filled on Sunday afternoons Since his engagement to Trina he had discontinued this habit However he still dropped into Frenna s one or two nights in the week He spent a pleasant hour there smoking his huge porcelain pipe and drinking his beer He never joined any of the groups of piquet players around the tables In fact he hardly spoke to anyone but the bartender and Marcus For Frenna s was one of Marcus Schouler s haunts a great deal of his time was spent there He involved himself in fearful political and social discussions with Heise the harness maker and with one or two old German habitues of the place These discussions Marcus carried on as was his custom at the top of his voice gesticulating fiercely banging the table with his fists brandishing the plates and glasses exciting himself with his own clamor On a certain Saturday evening a few days after the scene at the coffee joint the dentist bethought him to spend a quiet evening at Frenna s He had not been there for some time and besides that it occurred to him that the day was his birthday He would permit himself an extra pipe and a few glasses of beer When McTeague entered Frenna s back room by the street door he found Marcus and Heise already installed at one of the tables Two or three of the old Germans sat opposite them gulping their beer from time to time Heise was smoking a cigar but Marcus had before him his fourth whiskey cocktail At the moment of McTeague s entrance Marcus had the floor It can t be proven he was yelling I defy any sane politician whose eyes are not blinded by party prejudices whose opinions are not warped by a personal bias to substantiate such a statement Look at your facts look at your figures I am a free American citizen ain t I I pay my taxes to support a good government don t I It s a contract between me and the government ain t it Well then by damn if the authorities do not or will not afford me protection for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness then my obligations are at an end I withhold my taxes I do I do I say I do What He glared about him seeking opposition That s nonsense observed Heise quietly Try it once you ll get jugged But this observation of the harness maker s roused Marcus to the last pitch of frenzy Yes ah yes he shouted rising to his feet shaking his finger in the other s face Yes I d go to jail but because I I am crushed by a tyranny does that make the tyranny right Does might make right You must make less noise in here Mister Schouler said Frenna from behind the bar Well it makes me mad answered Marcus subsiding into a growl and resuming his chair Hullo Mac Hullo Mark But McTeague s presence made Marcus uneasy rousing in him at once a sense of wrong He twisted to and fro in his chair shrugging first one shoulder and then another Quarrelsome at all times the heat of the previous discussion had awakened within him all his natural combativeness Besides this he was drinking his fourth cocktail McTeague began filling his big porcelain pipe He lit it blew a great cloud of smoke into the room and settled himself comfortably in his chair The smoke of his cheap tobacco drifted into the faces of the group at the adjoining table and Marcus strangled and coughed Instantly his eyes flamed Say for God s sake he vociferated choke off on that pipe If you ve got to smoke rope like that smoke it in a crowd of muckers don t come here amongst gentlemen Shut up Schouler observed Heise in a low voice McTeague was stunned by the suddenness of the attack He took his pipe from his mouth and stared blankly at Marcus his lips moved but he said no word Marcus turned his back on him and the dentist resumed his pipe But Marcus was far from being appeased McTeague could not hear the talk that followed between him and the harnessmaker but it seemed to him that Marcus was telling Heise of some injury some grievance and that the latter was trying to pacify him All at once their talk grew louder Heise laid a retaining hand upon his companion s coat sleeve but Marcus swung himself around in his chair and fixing his eyes on McTeague cried as if in answer to some protestation on the part of Heise All I know is that I ve been soldiered out of five thousand dollars McTeague gaped at him bewildered He removed his pipe from his mouth a second time and stared at Marcus with eyes full of trouble and perplexity If I had my rights cried Marcus bitterly I d have part of that money It s my due it s only justice The dentist still kept silence If it hadn t been for me Marcus continued addressing himself directly to McTeague you wouldn t have had a cent of it no not a cent Where s my share I d like to know Where do I come in No I ain t in it any more I ve been played for a sucker an now that you ve got all you can out of me now that you ve done me out of my girl and out of my money you give me the go by Why where would you have been TO DAY if it hadn t been for me Marcus shouted in a sudden exasperation You d a been plugging teeth at two bits an hour Ain t you got any gratitude Ain t you got any sense of decency Ah hold up Schouler grumbled Heise You don t want to get into a row No I don t Heise returned Marcus with a plaintive aggrieved air But it s too much sometimes when you think of it He stole away my girl s affections and now that he s rich and prosperous and has got five thousand dollars that I might have had he gives me the go by he s played me for a sucker Look here he cried turning again to McTeague do I get any of that money It ain t mine to give answered McTeague You re drunk that s what you are Do I get any of that money cried Marcus persistently The dentist shook his head No you don t get any of it Now NOW clamored the other turning to the harnessmaker as though this explained everything Look at that look at that Well I ve done with you from now on Marcus had risen to his feet by this time and made as if to leave but at every instant he came back shouting his phrases into McTeague s face moving off again as he spoke the last words in order to give them better effect This settles it right here I ve done with you Don t you ever dare speak to me again his voice was shaking with fury and don t you sit at my table in the restaurant again I m sorry I ever lowered myself to keep company with such dirt Ah one horse dentist Ah ten cent zinc plugger hoodlum MUCKER Get your damn smoke outa my face Then matters reached a sudden climax In his agitation the dentist had been pulling hard on his pipe and as Marcus for the last time thrust his face close to his own McTeague in opening his lips to reply blew a stifling acrid cloud directly in Marcus Schouler s eyes Marcus knocked the pipe from his fingers with a sudden flash of his hand it spun across the room and broke into a dozen fragments in a far corner McTeague rose to his feet his eyes wide But as yet he was not angry only surprised taken all aback by the suddenness of Marcus Schouler s outbreak as well as by its unreasonableness Why had Marcus broken his pipe What did it all mean anyway As he rose the dentist made a vague motion with his right hand Did Marcus misinterpret it as a gesture of menace He sprang back as though avoiding a blow All at once there was a cry Marcus had made a quick peculiar motion swinging his arm upward with a wide and sweeping gesture his jack knife lay open in his palm it shot forward as he flung it glinted sharply by McTeague s head and struck quivering into the wall behind A sudden chill ran through the room the others stood transfixed as at the swift passage of some cold and deadly wind Death had stooped there for an instant had stooped and past leaving a trail of terror and confusion Then the door leading to the street slammed Marcus had disappeared Thereon a great babel of exclamation arose The tension of that all but fatal instant snapped and speech became once more possible He would have knifed you Narrow escape What kind of a man do you call THAT Tain t his fault he ain t a murderer I d have him up for it And they two have been the greatest kind of friends He didn t touch you did he No no no What a what a devil What treachery A regular greaser trick Look out he don t stab you in the back If that s the kind of man he is you never can tell Frenna drew the knife from the wall Guess I ll keep this toad stabber he observed That fellow won t come round for it in a hurry goodsized blade too The group examined it with intense interest Big enough to let the life out of any man observed Heise What what what did he do it for stammered McTeague I got no quarrel with him He was puzzled and harassed by the strangeness of it all Marcus would have killed him had thrown his knife at him in the true uncanny greaser style It was inexplicable McTeague sat down again looking stupidly about on the floor In a corner of the room his eye encountered his broken pipe a dozen little fragments of painted porcelain and the stem of cherry wood and amber At that sight his tardy wrath ever lagging behind the original affront suddenly blazed up Instantly his huge jaws clicked together He can t make small of ME he exclaimed suddenly I ll show Marcus Schouler I ll show him I ll He got up and clapped on his hat Now Doctor remonstrated Heise standing between him and the door don t go make a fool of yourself Let um alone joined in Frenna catching the dentist by the arm he s full anyhow He broke my pipe answered McTeague It was this that had roused him The thrown knife the attempt on his life was beyond his solution but the breaking of his pipe he understood clearly enough I ll show him he exclaimed As though they had been little children McTeague set Frenna and the harness maker aside and strode out at the door like a raging elephant Heise stood rubbing his shoulder Might as well try to stop a locomotive he muttered The man s made of iron Meanwhile McTeague went storming up the street toward the flat wagging his head and grumbling to himself Ah Marcus would break his pipe would he Ah he was a zinc plugger was he He d show Marcus Schouler No one should make small of him He tramped up the stairs to Marcus s room The door was locked The dentist put one enormous hand on the knob and pushed the door in snapping the wood work tearing off the lock Nobody the room was dark and empty Never mind Marcus would have to come home some time that night McTeague would go down and wait for him in his Parlors He was bound to hear him as he came up the stairs As McTeague reached his room he stumbled over in the darkness a big packing box that stood in the hallway just outside his door Puzzled he stepped over it and lighting the gas in his room dragged it inside and examined it It was addressed to him What could it mean He was expecting nothing Never since he had first furnished his room had packing cases been left for him in this fashion No mistake was possible There were his name and address unmistakably doctor McTeague dentist Polk Street San Francisco Cal and the red Wells Fargo tag Seized with the joyful curiosity of an overgrown boy he pried off the boards with the corner of his fireshovel The case was stuffed full of excelsior On the top lay an envelope addressed to him in Trina s handwriting He opened it and read For my dear Mac s birthday from Trina and below in a kind of post script The man will be round to morrow to put it in place McTeague tore away the excelsior Suddenly he uttered an exclamation It was the Tooth the famous golden molar with its huge prongs his sign his ambition the one unrealized dream of his life and it was French gilt too not the cheap German gilt that was no good Ah what a dear little woman was this Trina to keep so quiet to remember his birthday Ain t she ain t she just a just a JEWEL exclaimed McTeague under his breath a JEWEL yes just a JEWEL that s the word Very carefully he removed the rest of the excelsior and lifting the ponderous Tooth from its box set it upon the marble top centre table How immense it looked in that little room The thing was tremendous overpowering the tooth of a gigantic fossil golden and dazzling Beside it everything seemed dwarfed Even McTeague himself big boned and enormous as he was shrank and dwindled in the presence of the monster As for an instant he bore it in his hands it was like a puny Gulliver struggling with the molar of some vast Brobdingnag The dentist circled about that golden wonder gasping with delight and stupefaction touching it gingerly with his hands as if it were something sacred At every moment his thought returned to Trina No never was there such a little woman as his the very thing he wanted how had she remembered And the money where had that come from No one knew better than he how expensive were these signs not another dentist on Polk Street could afford one Where then had Trina found the money It came out of her five thousand dollars no doubt But what a wonderful beautiful tooth it was to be sure bright as a mirror shining there in its coat of French gilt as if with a light of its own No danger of that tooth turning black with the weather as did the cheap German gilt impostures What would that other dentist that poser that rider of bicycles that courser of greyhounds say when he should see this marvellous molar run out from McTeague s bay window like a flag of defiance No doubt he would suffer veritable convulsions of envy would be positively sick with jealousy If McTeague could only see his face at the moment For a whole hour the dentist sat there in his little Parlor gazing ecstatically at his treasure dazzled supremely content The whole room took on a different aspect because of it The stone pug dog before the little stove reflected it in his protruding eyes the canary woke and chittered feebly at this new gilt so much brighter than the bars of its little prison Lorenzo de Medici in the steel engraving sitting in the heart of his court seemed to ogle the thing out of the corner of one eye while the brilliant colors of the unused rifle manufacturer s calendar seemed to fade and pale in the brilliance of this greater glory At length long after midnight the dentist started to go to bed undressing himself with his eyes still fixed on the great tooth All at once he heard Marcus Schouler s foot on the stairs he started up with his fists clenched but immediately dropped back upon the bed lounge with a gesture of indifference He was in no truculent state of mind now He could not reinstate himself in that mood of wrath wherein he had left the corner grocery The tooth had changed all that What was Marcus Schouler s hatred to him who had Trina s affection What did he care about a broken pipe now that he had the tooth Let him go As Frenna said he was not worth it He heard Marcus come out into the hall shouting aggrievedly to anyone within sound of his voice An now he breaks into my room into my room by damn How do I know how many things he s stolen It s come to stealing from me now has it He went into his room banging his splintered door McTeague looked upward at the ceiling in the direction of the voice muttering Ah go to bed you He went to bed himself turning out the gas but leaving the window curtains up so that he could see the tooth the last thing before he went to sleep and the first thing as he arose in the morning But he was restless during the night Every now and then he was awakened by noises to which he had long since become accustomed Now it was the cackling of the geese in the deserted market across the street now it was the stoppage of the cable the sudden silence coming almost like a shock and now it was the infuriated barking of the dogs in the back yard Alec the Irish setter and the collie that belonged to the branch post office raging at each other through the fence snarling their endless hatred into each other s faces As often as he woke McTeague turned and looked for the tooth with a sudden suspicion that he had only that moment dreamed the whole business But he always found it Trina s gift his birthday from his little woman a huge vague bulk looming there through the half darkness in the centre of the room shining dimly out as if with some mysterious light of its own CHAPTER nine Trina and McTeague were married on the first day of June in the photographer s rooms that the dentist had rented All through May the Sieppe household had been turned upside down The little box of a house vibrated with excitement and confusion for not only were the preparations for Trina s marriage to be made but also the preliminaries were to be arranged for the hegira of the entire Sieppe family They were to move to the southern part of the State the day after Trina s marriage mister Sieppe having bought a third interest in an upholstering business in the suburbs of Los Angeles It was possible that Marcus Schouler would go with them Not Stanley penetrating for the first time into the Dark Continent not Napoleon leading his army across the Alps was more weighted with responsibility more burdened with care more overcome with the sense of the importance of his undertaking than was mister Sieppe during this period of preparation From dawn to dark from dark to early dawn he toiled and planned and fretted organizing and reorganizing projecting and devising The trunks were lettered A B and C the packages and smaller bundles numbered Each member of the family had his especial duty to perform his particular bundles to oversee Not a detail was forgotten fares prices and tips were calculated to two places of decimals Even the amount of food that it would be necessary to carry for the black greyhound was determined missus Sieppe was to look after the lunch der gomisariat mister Sieppe would assume charge of the checks the money the tickets and of course general supervision The twins would be under the command of Owgooste who in turn would report for orders to his father Day in and day out these minutiae were rehearsed The children were drilled in their parts with a military exactitude obedience and punctuality became cardinal virtues The vast importance of the undertaking was insisted upon with scrupulous iteration It was a manoeuvre an army changing its base of operations a veritable tribal migration On the other hand Trina s little room was the centre around which revolved another and different order of things The dressmaker came and went congratulatory visitors invaded the little front parlor the chatter of unfamiliar voices resounded from the front steps bonnet boxes and yards of dress goods littered the beds and chairs wrapping paper tissue paper and bits of string strewed the floor a pair of white satin slippers stood on a corner of the toilet table lengths of white veiling like a snow flurry buried the little work table and a mislaid box of artificial orange blossoms was finally discovered behind the bureau The two systems of operation often clashed and tangled missus Sieppe was found by her harassed husband helping Trina with the waist of her gown when she should have been slicing cold chicken in the kitchen mister Sieppe packed his frock coat which he would have to wear at the wedding at the very bottom of Trunk C The minister who called to offer his congratulations and to make arrangements was mistaken for the expressman McTeague came and went furtively dizzied and made uneasy by all this bustle He got in the way he trod upon and tore breadths of silk he tried to help carry the packing boxes and broke the hall gas fixture he came in upon Trina and the dress maker at an ill timed moment and retiring precipitately overturned the piles of pictures stacked in the hall There was an incessant going and coming at every moment of the day a great calling up and down stairs a shouting from room to room an opening and shutting of doors and an intermittent sound of hammering from the laundry where mister Sieppe in his shirt sleeves labored among the packing boxes The twins clattered about on the carpetless floors of the denuded rooms Owgooste was smacked from hour to hour and wept upon the front stairs the dressmaker called over the banisters for a hot flatiron expressmen tramped up and down the stairway missus Sieppe stopped in the preparation of the lunches to call Hoop Hoop to the greyhound throwing lumps of coal The dog wheel creaked the front door bell rang delivery wagons rumbled away windows rattled the little house was in a positive uproar Almost every day of the week now Trina was obliged to run over to town and meet McTeague No more philandering over their lunch now a days It was business now They haunted the house furnishing floors of the great department houses inspecting and pricing ranges hardware china and the like They rented the photographer s rooms furnished and fortunately only the kitchen and dining room utensils had to be bought The money for this as well as for her trousseau came out of Trina s five thousand dollars For it had been finally decided that two hundred dollars of this amount should be devoted to the establishment of the new household Now that Trina had made her great winning mister Sieppe no longer saw the necessity of dowering her further especially when he considered the enormous expense to which he would be put by the voyage of his own family It had been a dreadful wrench for Trina to break in upon her precious five thousand She clung to this sum with a tenacity that was surprising it had become for her a thing miraculous a god from the machine suddenly descending upon the stage of her humble little life she regarded it as something almost sacred and inviolable Never never should a penny of it be spent Before she could be induced to part with two hundred dollars of it more than one scene had been enacted between her and her parents Did Trina pay for the golden tooth out of this two hundred Later on the dentist often asked her about it but Trina invariably laughed in his face declaring that it was her secret McTeague never found out One day during this period McTeague told Trina about his affair with Marcus Instantly she was aroused He threw his knife at you The coward He wouldn t of dared stand up to you like a man Oh Mac suppose he HAD hit you Came within an inch of my head put in McTeague proudly Think of it she gasped and he wanted part of my money Well I do like his cheek part of my five thousand Why it s mine every single penny of it Marcus hasn t the least bit of right to it It s mine mine I mean it s ours Mac dear The elder Sieppes however made excuses for Marcus He had probably been drinking a good deal and didn t know what he was about He had a dreadful temper anyhow Maybe he only wanted to scare McTeague The week before the marriage the two men were reconciled missus Sieppe brought them together in the front parlor of the B Street house Now you two fellers don t be dot foolish Schake hands und maig ut oop soh Marcus muttered an apology McTeague miserably embarrassed rolled his eyes about the room murmuring That s all right that s all right that s all right However when it was proposed that Marcus should be McTeague s best man he flashed out again with renewed violence Ah no ah NO He d make up with the dentist now that he was going away but he d be damned yes he would before he d be his best man That was rubbing it in Let him get Old Grannis I m friends with um all right vociferated Marcus but I ll not stand up with um I ll not be ANYBODY S best man I won t The wedding was to be very quiet Trina preferred it that way McTeague would invite only Miss Baker and Heise the harness maker The Sieppes sent cards to Selina who was counted on to furnish the music to Marcus of course and to Uncle Oelbermann At last the great day the first of June arrived The Sieppes had packed their last box and had strapped the last trunk Trina s two trunks had already been sent to her new home the remodelled photographer s rooms The B Street house was deserted the whole family came over to the city on the last day of May and stopped over night at one of the cheap downtown hotels Trina would be married the following evening and immediately after the wedding supper the Sieppes would leave for the South McTeague spent the day in a fever of agitation frightened out of his wits each time that Old Grannis left his elbow Old Grannis was delighted beyond measure at the prospect of acting the part of best man in the ceremony This wedding in which he was to figure filled his mind with vague ideas and half formed thoughts He found himself continually wondering what Miss Baker would think of it During all that day he was in a reflective mood Marriage is a a noble institution is it not Doctor he observed to McTeague The the foundation of society It is not good that man should be alone No no he added pensively it is not good Huh Yes yes McTeague answered his eyes in the air hardly hearing him Do you think the rooms are all right Let s go in and look at them again They went down the hall to where the new rooms were situated and the dentist inspected them for the twentieth time The rooms were three in number first the sitting room which was also the dining room then the bedroom and back of this the tiny kitchen The sitting room was particularly charming Clean matting covered the floor and two or three bright colored rugs were scattered here and there The backs of the chairs were hung with knitted worsted tidies very gay The bay window should have been occupied by Trina s sewing machine but this had been moved to the other side of the room to give place to a little black walnut table with spiral legs before which the pair were to be married In one corner stood the parlor melodeon a family possession of the Sieppes but given now to Trina as one of her parents wedding presents Three pictures hung upon the walls Two were companion pieces One of these represented a little boy wearing huge spectacles and trying to smoke an enormous pipe This was called I m Grandpa the title being printed in large black letters the companion picture was entitled I m Grandma a little girl in cap and specs wearing mitts and knitting These pictures were hung on either side of the mantelpiece The other picture was quite an affair very large and striking It was a colored lithograph of two little golden haired girls in their nightgowns They were kneeling down and saying their prayers their eyes very large and very blue rolled upward This picture had for name Faith and was bordered with a red plush mat and a frame of imitation beaten brass A door hung with chenille portieres a bargain at two dollars and a half admitted one to the bedroom The bedroom could boast a carpet three ply ingrain the design being bunches of red and green flowers in yellow baskets on a white ground The wall paper was admirable hundreds and hundreds of tiny Japanese mandarins all identically alike helping hundreds of almond eyed ladies into hundreds of impossible junks while hundreds of bamboo palms overshadowed the pair and hundreds of long legged storks trailed contemptuously away from the scene This room was prolific in pictures Most of them were framed colored prints from Christmas editions of the London Graphic and Illustrated News the subject of each picture inevitably involving very alert fox terriers and very pretty moon faced little girls Back of the bedroom was the kitchen a creation of Trina s a dream of a kitchen with its range its porcelain lined sink its copper boiler and its overpowering array of flashing tinware Everything was new everything was complete Maria Macapa and a waiter from one of the restaurants in the street were to prepare the wedding supper here Maria had already put in an appearance The fire was crackling in the new stove that smoked badly a smell of cooking was in the air She drove McTeague and Old Grannis from the room with great gestures of her bare arms This kitchen was the only one of the three rooms they had been obliged to furnish throughout Most of the sitting room and bedroom furniture went with the suite a few pieces they had bought the remainder Trina had brought over from the B Street house The presents had been set out on the extension table in the sitting room Besides the parlor melodeon Trina s parents had given her an ice water set and a carving knife and fork with elk horn handles Selina had painted a view of the Golden Gate upon a polished slice of redwood that answered the purposes of a paper weight Marcus Schouler after impressing upon Trina that his gift was to HER and not to McTeague had sent a chatelaine watch of German silver Uncle Oelbermann s present however had been awaited with a good deal of curiosity What would he send He was very rich in a sense Trina was his protege A couple of days before that upon which the wedding was to take place two boxes arrived with his card Trina and McTeague assisted by Old Grannis had opened them The first was a box of all sorts of toys But what what I don t make it out McTeague had exclaimed Why should he send us toys We have no need of toys Scarlet to her hair Trina dropped into a chair and laughed till she cried behind her handkerchief We ve no use of toys muttered McTeague looking at her in perplexity Old Grannis smiled discreetly raising a tremulous hand to his chin The other box was heavy bound with withes at the edges the letters and stamps burnt in I think I really think it s champagne said Old Grannis in a whisper So it was A full case of Monopole What a wonder None of them had seen the like before Ah this Uncle Oelbermann That s what it was to be rich Not one of the other presents produced so deep an impression as this After Old Grannis and the dentist had gone through the rooms giving a last look around to see that everything was ready they returned to McTeague s Parlors At the door Old Grannis excused himself At four o clock McTeague began to dress shaving himself first before the hand glass that was hung against the woodwork of the bay window While he shaved he sang with strange inappropriateness No one to love none to Caress Left all alone in this world s wilderness But as he stood before the mirror intent upon his shaving there came a roll of wheels over the cobbles in front of the house He rushed to the window Trina had arrived with her father and mother He saw her get out and as she glanced upward at his window their eyes met Ah there she was There she was his little woman looking up at him her adorable little chin thrust upward with that familiar movement of innocence and confidence The dentist saw again as if for the first time her small pale face looking out from beneath her royal tiara of black hair he saw again her long narrow blue eyes her lips nose and tiny ears pale and bloodless and suggestive of anaemia as if all the vitality that should have lent them color had been sucked up into the strands and coils of that wonderful hair As their eyes met they waved their hands gayly to each other then McTeague heard Trina and her mother come up the stairs and go into the bedroom of the photographer s suite where Trina was to dress No no surely there could be no longer any hesitation He knew that he loved her What was the matter with him that he should have doubted it for an instant The great difficulty was that she was too good too adorable too sweet too delicate for him who was so huge so clumsy so brutal There was a knock at the door It was Old Grannis He was dressed in his one black suit of broadcloth much wrinkled his hair was carefully brushed over his bald forehead Miss Trina has come he announced and the minister You have an hour yet The dentist finished dressing He wore a suit bought for the occasion a ready made Prince Albert coat too short in the sleeves striped blue trousers and new patent leather shoes veritable instruments of torture Around his collar was a wonderful necktie that Trina had given him it was of salmon pink satin in its centre Selina had painted a knot of blue forget me nots At length after an interminable period of waiting mister Sieppe appeared at the door Are you reatty he asked in a sepulchral whisper Gome den It was like King Charles summoned to execution mister Sieppe preceded them into the hall moving at a funereal pace He paused Suddenly in the direction of the sitting room came the strains of the parlor melodeon mister Sieppe flung his arm in the air Vowaarts he cried He left them at the door of the sitting room he himself going into the bedroom where Trina was waiting entering by the hall door He was in a tremendous state of nervous tension fearful lest something should go wrong He had employed the period of waiting in going through his part for the fiftieth time repeating what he had to say in a low voice He had even made chalk marks on the matting in the places where he was to take positions The dentist and Old Grannis entered the sitting room the minister stood behind the little table in the bay window holding a book one finger marking the place he was rigid erect impassive On either side of him in a semi circle stood the invited guests A little pock marked gentleman in glasses no doubt the famous Uncle Oelbermann Miss Baker in her black grenadine false curls and coral brooch Marcus Schouler his arms folded his brows bent grand and gloomy Heise the harness maker in yellow gloves intently studying the pattern of the matting and Owgooste in his Fauntleroy costume stupefied and a little frightened rolling his eyes from face to face Selina sat at the parlor melodeon fingering the keys her glance wandering to the chenille portieres She stopped playing as McTeague and Old Grannis entered and took their places A profound silence ensued Uncle Oelbermann s shirt front could be heard creaking as he breathed The most solemn expression pervaded every face All at once the portieres were shaken violently It was a signal Selina pulled open the stops and swung into the wedding march Trina entered She was dressed in white silk a crown of orange blossoms was around her swarthy hair dressed high for the first time her veil reached to the floor Her face was pink but otherwise she was calm She looked quietly around the room as she crossed it until her glance rested on McTeague smiling at him then very prettily and with perfect self possession She was on her father s arm The twins dressed exactly alike walked in front each carrying an enormous bouquet of cut flowers in a lace paper holder missus Sieppe followed in the rear She was crying her handkerchief was rolled into a wad From time to time she looked at the train of Trina s dress through her tears mister Sieppe marched his daughter to the exact middle of the floor wheeled at right angles and brought her up to the minister He stepped back three paces and stood planted upon one of his chalk marks his face glistening with perspiration Then Trina and the dentist were married The guests stood in constrained attitudes looking furtively out of the corners of their eyes mister Sieppe never moved a muscle missus Sieppe cried into her handkerchief all the time At the melodeon Selina played Call Me Thine Own very softly the tremulo stop pulled out She looked over her shoulder from time to time Between the pauses of the music one could hear the low tones of the minister the responses of the participants and the suppressed sounds of missus Sieppe s weeping Outside the noises of the street rose to the windows in muffled undertones a cable car rumbled past a newsboy went by chanting the evening papers from somewhere in the building itself came a persistent noise of sawing Trina and McTeague knelt The dentist s knees thudded on the floor and he presented to view the soles of his shoes painfully new and unworn the leather still yellow the brass nail heads still glittering Trina sank at his side very gracefully setting her dress and train with a little gesture of her free hand The company bowed their heads mister Sieppe shutting his eyes tight But missus Sieppe took advantage of the moment to stop crying and make furtive gestures towards Owgooste signing him to pull down his coat But Owgooste gave no heed his eyes were starting from their sockets his chin had dropped upon his lace collar and his head turned vaguely from side to side with a continued and maniacal motion All at once the ceremony was over before any one expected it The guests kept their positions for a moment eyeing one another each fearing to make the first move not quite certain as to whether or not everything were finished But the couple faced the room Trina throwing back her veil She perhaps McTeague as well felt that there was a certain inadequateness about the ceremony Was that all there was to it Did just those few muttered phrases make them man and wife It had been over in a few moments but it had bound them for life Had not something been left out Was not the whole affair cursory superficial It was disappointing But Trina had no time to dwell upon this Marcus Schouler in the manner of a man of the world who knew how to act in every situation stepped forward and even before mister or missus Sieppe took Trina s hand Let me be the first to congratulate missus McTeague he said feeling very noble and heroic The strain of the previous moments was relaxed immediately the guests crowded around the pair shaking hands a babel of talk arose Owgooste WILL you pull down your goat den Well my dear now you re married and happy When I first saw you two together I said What a pair We re to be neighbors now you must come up and see me very often and we ll have tea together Did you hear that sawing going on all the time I declare it regularly got on my nerves Trina kissed her father and mother crying a little herself as she saw the tears in missus Sieppe s eyes Marcus came forward a second time and with an air of great gravity kissed his cousin upon the forehead Heise was introduced to Trina and Uncle Oelbermann to the dentist For upwards of half an hour the guests stood about in groups filling the little sitting room with a great chatter of talk Then it was time to make ready for supper This was a tremendous task in which nearly all the guests were obliged to assist The sitting room was transformed into a dining room The presents were removed from the extension table and the table drawn out to its full length The cloth was laid the chairs rented from the dancing academy hard by drawn up the dishes set out and the two bouquets of cut flowers taken from the twins under their shrill protests and arranged in vases at either end of the table There was a great coming and going between the kitchen and the sitting room Trina who was allowed to do nothing sat in the bay window and fretted calling to her mother from time to time The napkins are in the right hand drawer of the pantry Yes yes I got um Where do you geep der zoup blates The soup plates are here already Say Cousin Trina is there a corkscrew What is home without a corkscrew In the kitchen table drawer in the left hand corner Are these the forks you want to use missus McTeague No no there s some silver forks Mamma knows where They were all very gay laughing over their mistakes getting in one another s way rushing into the sitting room their hands full of plates or knives or glasses and darting out again after more Marcus and mister Sieppe took their coats off Old Grannis and Miss Baker passed each other in the hall in a constrained silence her grenadine brushing against the elbow of his wrinkled frock coat Uncle Oelbermann superintended Heise opening the case of champagne with the gravity of a magistrate Owgooste was assigned the task of filling the new salt and pepper canisters of red and blue glass In a wonderfully short time everything was ready Marcus Schouler resumed his coat wiping his forehead and remarking I tell you I ve been doing CHORES for MY board To der table commanded mister Sieppe The company sat down with a great clatter Trina at the foot the dentist at the head the others arranged themselves in haphazard fashion But it happened that Marcus Schouler crowded into the seat beside Selina towards which Old Grannis was directing himself There was but one other chair vacant and that at the side of Miss Baker Old Grannis hesitated putting his hand to his chin However there was no escape In great trepidation he sat down beside the retired dressmaker Neither of them spoke Old Grannis dared not move but sat rigid his eyes riveted on his empty soup plate All at once there was a report like a pistol The men started in their places missus Sieppe uttered a muffled shriek The waiter from the cheap restaurant hired as Maria s assistant rose from a bending posture a champagne bottle frothing in his hand he was grinning from ear to ear Don t get scairt he said reassuringly it ain t loaded When all their glasses had been filled Marcus proposed the health of the bride standing up The guests rose and drank Hardly one of them had ever tasted champagne before The moment s silence after the toast was broken by McTeague exclaiming with a long breath of satisfaction That s the best beer I ever drank There was a roar of laughter Especially was Marcus tickled over the dentist s blunder he went off in a very spasm of mirth banging the table with his fist laughing until his eyes watered All through the meal he kept breaking out into cackling imitations of McTeague s words That s the best BEER I ever drank Oh Lord ain t that a break What a wonderful supper that was There was oyster soup there were sea bass and barracuda there was a gigantic roast goose stuffed with chestnuts there were egg plant and sweet potatoes Miss Baker called them yams There was calf s head in oil over which mister Sieppe went into ecstasies there was lobster salad there were rice pudding and strawberry ice cream and wine jelly and stewed prunes and cocoanuts and mixed nuts and raisins and fruit and tea and coffee and mineral waters and lemonade For two hours the guests ate their faces red their elbows wide the perspiration beading their foreheads All around the table one saw the same incessant movement of jaws and heard the same uninterrupted sound of chewing Three times Heise passed his plate for more roast goose mister Sieppe devoured the calf s head with long breaths of contentment McTeague ate for the sake of eating without choice everything within reach of his hands found its way into his enormous mouth There was but little conversation and that only of the food one exchanged opinions with one s neighbor as to the soup the egg plant or the stewed prunes Soon the room became very warm a faint moisture appeared upon the windows the air was heavy with the smell of cooked food At every moment Trina or missus Sieppe urged some one of the company to have his or her plate refilled They were constantly employed in dishing potatoes or carving the goose or ladling gravy The hired waiter circled around the room his limp napkin over his arm his hands full of plates and dishes He was a great joker he had names of his own for different articles of food that sent gales of laughter around the table When he spoke of a bunch of parsley as scenery Heise all but strangled himself over a mouthful of potato Out in the kitchen Maria Macapa did the work of three her face scarlet her sleeves rolled up every now and then she uttered shrill but unintelligible outcries supposedly addressed to the waiter Uncle Oelbermann said Trina let me give you another helping of prunes The Sieppes paid great deference to Uncle Oelbermann as indeed did the whole company Even Marcus Schouler lowered his voice when he addressed him At the beginning of the meal he had nudged the harness maker and had whispered behind his hand nodding his head toward the wholesale toy dealer Got thirty thousand dollars in the bank has for a fact Don t have much to say observed Heise No no That s his way never opens his face As the evening wore on the gas and two lamps were lit The company were still eating The men gorged with food had unbuttoned their vests McTeague s cheeks were distended his eyes wide his huge salient jaw moved with a machine like regularity at intervals he drew a series of short breaths through his nose missus Sieppe wiped her forehead with her napkin Hey dere poy gif me some more oaf dat what you call bubble water That was how the waiter had spoken of the champagne bubble water The guests had shouted applause Outa sight He was a heavy josher was that waiter Bottle after bottle was opened the women stopping their ears as the corks were drawn All of a sudden the dentist uttered an exclamation clapping his hand to his nose his face twisting sharply Mac what is it cried Trina in alarm That champagne came to my nose he cried his eyes watering It stings like everything Great BEER ain t ut shouted Marcus Now Mark remonstrated Trina in a low voice Now Mark you just shut up that isn t funny any more I don t want you should make fun of Mac He called it beer on purpose I guess HE knows Throughout the meal old Miss Baker had occupied herself largely with Owgooste and the twins who had been given a table by themselves the black walnut table before which the ceremony had taken place The little dressmaker was continually turning about in her place inquiring of the children if they wanted for anything inquiries they rarely answered other than by stare fixed ox like expressionless Suddenly the little dressmaker turned to Old Grannis and exclaimed I m so very fond of little children Yes yes they re very interesting I m very fond of them too The next instant both of the old people were overwhelmed with confusion What They had spoken to each other after all these years of silence they had for the first time addressed remarks to each other The old dressmaker was in a torment of embarrassment How was it she had come to speak She had neither planned nor wished it Suddenly the words had escaped her he had answered and it was all over over before they knew it Old Grannis s fingers trembled on the table ledge his heart beat heavily his breath fell short He had actually talked to the little dressmaker That possibility to which he had looked forward it seemed to him for years that companionship that intimacy with his fellow lodger that delightful acquaintance which was only to ripen at some far distant time he could not exactly say when behold it had suddenly come to a head here in this over crowded over heated room in the midst of all this feeding surrounded by odors of hot dishes accompanied by the sounds of incessant mastication How different he had imagined it would be They were to be alone he and Miss Baker in the evening somewhere withdrawn from the world very quiet very calm and peaceful Their talk was to be of their lives their lost illusions not of other people s children The two old people did not speak again They sat there side by side nearer than they had ever been before motionless abstracted their thoughts far away from that scene of feasting They were thinking of each other and they were conscious of it Timid with the timidity of their second childhood constrained and embarrassed by each other s presence they were nevertheless in a little Elysium of their own creating They walked hand in hand in a delicious garden where it was always autumn together and alone they entered upon the long retarded romance of their commonplace and uneventful lives At last that great supper was over everything had been eaten the enormous roast goose had dwindled to a very skeleton mister Sieppe had reduced the calf s head to a mere skull a row of empty champagne bottles dead soldiers as the facetious waiter had called them lined the mantelpiece Nothing of the stewed prunes remained but the juice which was given to Owgooste and the twins The platters were as clean as if they had been washed crumbs of bread potato parings nutshells and bits of cake littered the table coffee and ice cream stains and spots of congealed gravy marked the position of each plate It was a devastation a pillage the table presented the appearance of an abandoned battlefield Ouf cried missus Sieppe pushing back I haf eatun und eatun ach Gott how I haf eatun Ah dot kaf s het murmured her husband passing his tongue over his lips The facetious waiter had disappeared He and Maria Macapa foregathered in the kitchen They drew up to the washboard of the sink feasting off the remnants of the supper slices of goose the remains of the lobster salad and half a bottle of champagne They were obliged to drink the latter from teacups Here s how said the waiter gallantly as he raised his tea cup bowing to Maria across the sink Hark he added they re singing inside The company had left the table and had assembled about the melodeon where Selina was seated At first they attempted some of the popular songs of the day but were obliged to give over as none of them knew any of the words beyond the first line of the chorus Finally they pitched upon Nearer My God to Thee as the only song which they all knew Selina sang the alto very much off the key Marcus intoned the bass scowling fiercely his chin drawn into his collar They sang in very slow time The song became a dirge a lamentable prolonged wail of distress Nee rah my Gahd to Thee Nee rah to Thee ah At the end of the song Uncle Oelbermann put on his hat without a word of warning Instantly there was a hush The guests rose Not going so soon Uncle Oelbermann protested Trina politely He only nodded Marcus sprang forward to help him with his overcoat mister Sieppe came up and the two men shook hands Then Uncle Oelbermann delivered himself of an oracular phrase No doubt he had been meditating it during the supper Addressing mister Sieppe he said You have not lost a daughter but have gained a son These were the only words he had spoken the entire evening He departed the company was profoundly impressed About twenty minutes later when Marcus Schouler was entertaining the guests by eating almonds shells and all mister Sieppe started to his feet watch in hand Haf bast elevun he shouted Attention Der dime haf arrive shtop eferyting We depart This was a signal for tremendous confusion mister Sieppe immediately threw off his previous air of relaxation the calf s head was forgotten he was once again the leader of vast enterprises To me to me he cried Mommer der tervins Owgooste He marshalled his tribe together with tremendous commanding gestures The sleeping twins were suddenly shaken into a dazed consciousness Owgooste whom the almond eating of Marcus Schouler had petrified with admiration was smacked to a realization of his surroundings Old Grannis with a certain delicacy that was one of his characteristics felt instinctively that the guests the mere outsiders should depart before the family began its leave taking of Trina He withdrew unobtrusively after a hasty good night to the bride and groom The rest followed almost immediately Well mister Sieppe exclaimed Marcus we won t see each other for some time Marcus had given up his first intention of joining in the Sieppe migration He spoke in a large way of certain affairs that would keep him in San Francisco till the fall Of late he had entertained ambitions of a ranch life he would breed cattle he had a little money and was only looking for some one to go in with He dreamed of a cowboy s life and saw himself in an entrancing vision involving silver spurs and untamed bronchos He told himself that Trina had cast him off that his best friend had played him for a sucker that the proper caper was to withdraw from the world entirely If you hear of anybody down there he went on speaking to mister Sieppe that wants to go in for ranching why just let me know Soh soh answered mister Sieppe abstractedly peering about for Owgooste s cap Marcus bade the Sieppes farewell He and Heise went out together One heard them as they descended the stairs discussing the possibility of Frenna s place being still open Then Miss Baker departed after kissing Trina on both cheeks Selina went with her There was only the family left Trina watched them go one by one with an increasing feeling of uneasiness and vague apprehension Soon they would all be gone Well Trina exclaimed mister Sieppe goot py perhaps you gome visit us somedime missus Sieppe began crying again Ach Trina ven shall I efer see you again Tears came to Trina s eyes in spite of herself She put her arms around her mother Oh sometime sometime she cried The twins and Owgooste clung to Trina s skirts fretting and whimpering McTeague was miserable He stood apart from the group in a corner None of them seemed to think of him he was not of them Write to me very often mamma and tell me about everything about August and the twins It is dime cried mister Sieppe nervously Goot py Trina Mommer Owgooste say goot py den we must go Goot py Trina He kissed her Owgooste and the twins were lifted up Gome gome insisted mister Sieppe moving toward the door Goot py Trina exclaimed missus Sieppe crying harder than ever Doktor where is der doktor Doktor pe goot to her eh pe vairy goot eh won t you Zum day Dokter you vill haf a daughter den you know berhaps how I feel yes They were standing at the door by this time mister Sieppe half way down the stairs kept calling Gome gome we miss der drain missus Sieppe released Trina and started down the hall the twins and Owgooste following Trina stood in the doorway looking after them through her tears They were going going When would she ever see them again She was to be left alone with this man to whom she had just been married A sudden vague terror seized her she left McTeague and ran down the hall and caught her mother around the neck I don t WANT you to go she whispered in her mother s ear sobbing Oh mamma I I m fraid Ach Trina you preak my heart Don t gry poor leetle girl She rocked Trina in her arms as though she were a child again Poor leetle scairt girl don gry soh soh soh dere s nuttun to pe fraid oaf Dere go to your hoasban Listen popper s galling again go den goot by She loosened Trina s arms and started down the stairs Trina leaned over the banisters straining her eyes after her mother What is ut Trina Oh good by good by Gome gome we miss der drain Mamma oh mamma What is ut Trina Good by Goot py leetle daughter Good by good by good by The street door closed The silence was profound For another moment Trina stood leaning over the banisters looking down into the empty stairway It was dark There was nobody They her father her mother the children had left her left her alone She faced about toward the rooms faced her husband faced her new home the new life that was to begin now The hall was empty and deserted The great flat around her seemed new and huge and strange she felt horribly alone Even Maria and the hired waiter were gone On one of the floors above she heard a baby crying She stood there an instant in the dark hall in her wedding finery looking about her listening From the open door of the sitting room streamed a gold bar of light She went down the hall by the open door of the sitting room going on toward the hall door of the bedroom As she softly passed the sitting room she glanced hastily in The lamps and the gas were burning brightly the chairs were pushed back from the table just as the guests had left them and the table itself abandoned deserted presented to view the vague confusion of its dishes its knives and forks its empty platters and crumpled napkins The dentist sat there leaning on his elbows his back toward her against the white blur of the table he looked colossal Above his giant shoulders rose his thick red neck and mane of yellow hair The light shone pink through the gristle of his enormous ears Trina entered the bedroom closing the door after her At the sound she heard McTeague start and rise Is that you Trina She did not answer but paused in the middle of the room holding her breath trembling The dentist crossed the outside room parted the chenille portieres and came in He came toward her quickly making as if to take her in his arms His eyes were alight No no cried Trina shrinking from him Suddenly seized with the fear of him the intuitive feminine fear of the male her whole being quailed before him She was terrified at his huge square cut head his powerful salient jaw his huge red hands his enormous resistless strength No no I m afraid she cried drawing back from him to the other side of the room Afraid answered the dentist in perplexity What are you afraid of Trina I m not going to hurt you What are you afraid of What indeed was Trina afraid of She could not tell But what did she know of McTeague after all Who was this man that had come into her life who had taken her from her home and from her parents and with whom she was now left alone here in this strange vast flat Oh I m afraid I m afraid she cried McTeague came nearer sat down beside her and put one arm around her What are you afraid of Trina he said reassuringly I don t want to frighten you She looked at him wildly her adorable little chin quivering the tears brimming in her narrow blue eyes Then her glance took on a certain intentness and she peered curiously into his face saying almost in a whisper I m afraid of YOU But the dentist did not heed her An immense joy seized upon him the joy of possession Trina was his very own now She lay there in the hollow of his arm helpless and very pretty Those instincts that in him were so close to the surface suddenly leaped to life shouting and clamoring not to be resisted He loved her Ah did he not love her The smell of her hair of her neck rose to him Suddenly he caught her in both his huge arms crushing down her struggle with his immense strength kissing her full upon the mouth Then her great love for McTeague suddenly flashed up in Trina s breast she gave up to him as she had done before yielding all at once to that strange desire of being conquered and subdued She clung to him her hands clasped behind his neck whispering in his ear Oh you must be good to me very very good to me dear for you re all that I have in the world now CHAPTER ten That summer passed then the winter The wet season began in the last days of September and continued all through October November and December At long intervals would come a week of perfect days the sky without a cloud the air motionless but touched with a certain nimbleness a faint effervescence that was exhilarating Then without warning during a night when a south wind blew a gray scroll of cloud would unroll and hang high over the city and the rain would come pattering down again at first in scattered showers then in an uninterrupted drizzle All day long Trina sat in the bay window of the sitting room that commanded a view of a small section of Polk Street As often as she raised her head she could see the big market a confectionery store a bell hanger s shop and farther on above the roofs the glass skylights and water tanks of the big public baths In the nearer foreground ran the street itself the cable cars trundled up and down thumping heavily over the joints of the rails market carts by the score came and went driven at a great rate by preoccupied young men in their shirt sleeves with pencils behind their ears or by reckless boys in blood stained butcher s aprons Upon the sidewalks the little world of Polk Street swarmed and jostled through its daily round of life On fine days the great ladies from the avenue one block above invaded the street appearing before the butcher stalls intent upon their day s marketing On rainy days their servants the Chinese cooks or the second girls took their places These servants gave themselves great airs carrying their big cotton umbrellas as they had seen their mistresses carry their parasols and haggling in supercilious fashion with the market men their chins in the air The rain persisted Everything in the range of Trina s vision from the tarpaulins on the market cart horses to the panes of glass in the roof of the public baths looked glazed and varnished The asphalt of the sidewalks shone like the surface of a patent leather boot every hollow in the street held its little puddle that winked like an eye each time a drop of rain struck into it Trina still continued to work for Uncle Oelbermann In the mornings she busied herself about the kitchen the bedroom and the sitting room but in the afternoon for two or three hours after lunch she was occupied with the Noah s ark animals She took her work to the bay window spreading out a great square of canvas underneath her chair to catch the chips and shavings which she used afterwards for lighting fires One after another she caught up the little blocks of straight grained pine the knife flashed between her fingers the little figure grew rapidly under her touch was finished and ready for painting in a wonderfully short time and was tossed into the basket that stood at her elbow But very often during that rainy winter after her marriage Trina would pause in her work her hands falling idly into her lap her eyes her narrow pale blue eyes growing wide and thoughtful as she gazed unseeing out into the rain washed street She loved McTeague now with a blind unreasoning love that admitted of no doubt or hesitancy Indeed it seemed to her that it was only AFTER her marriage with the dentist that she had really begun to love him With the absolute final surrender of herself the irrevocable ultimate submission had come an affection the like of which she had never dreamed in the old B Street days But Trina loved her husband not because she fancied she saw in him any of those noble and generous qualities that inspire affection The dentist might or might not possess them it was all one with Trina She loved him because she had given herself to him freely unreservedly had merged her individuality into his she was his she belonged to him forever and forever Nothing that he could do so she told herself nothing that she herself could do could change her in this respect McTeague might cease to love her might leave her might even die it would be all the same SHE WAS HIS But it had not been so at first During those long rainy days of the fall days when Trina was left alone for hours at that time when the excitement and novelty of the honeymoon were dying down when the new household was settling into its grooves she passed through many an hour of misgiving of doubt and even of actual regret Never would she forget one Sunday afternoon in particular She had been married but three weeks After dinner she and little Miss Baker had gone for a bit of a walk to take advantage of an hour s sunshine and to look at some wonderful geraniums in a florist s window on Sutter Street They had been caught in a shower and on returning to the flat the little dressmaker had insisted on fetching Trina up to her tiny room and brewing her a cup of strong tea to take the chill off The two women had chatted over their teacups the better part of the afternoon then Trina had returned to her rooms For nearly three hours McTeague had been out of her thoughts and as she came through their little suite singing softly to herself she suddenly came upon him quite unexpectedly Her husband was in the Dental Parlors lying back in his operating chair fast asleep The little stove was crammed with coke the room was overheated the air thick and foul with the odors of ether of coke gas of stale beer and cheap tobacco The dentist sprawled his gigantic limbs over the worn velvet of the operating chair his coat and vest and shoes were off and his huge feet in their thick gray socks dangled over the edge of the foot rest his pipe fallen from his half open mouth had spilled the ashes into his lap while on the floor at his side stood the half empty pitcher of steam beer His head had rolled limply upon one shoulder his face was red with sleep and from his open mouth came a terrific sound of snoring For a moment Trina stood looking at him as he lay thus prone inert half dressed and stupefied with the heat of the room the steam beer and the fumes of the cheap tobacco Then her little chin quivered and a sob rose to her throat she fled from the Parlors and locking herself in her bedroom flung herself on the bed and burst into an agony of weeping Ah no ah no she could not love him It had all been a dreadful mistake and now it was irrevocable she was bound to this man for life If it was as bad as this now only three weeks after her marriage how would it be in the years to come Year after year month after month hour after hour she was to see this same face with its salient jaw was to feel the touch of those enormous red hands was to hear the heavy elephantine tread of those huge feet in thick gray socks Year after year day after day there would be no change and it would last all her life Either it would be one long continued revulsion or else worse than all she would come to be content with him would come to be like him would sink to the level of steam beer and cheap tobacco and all her pretty ways her clean trim little habits would be forgotten since they would be thrown away upon her stupid brutish husband Her husband THAT was her husband in there she could yet hear his snores for life for life A great despair seized upon her She buried her face in the pillow and thought of her mother with an infinite longing Aroused at length by the chittering of the canary McTeague had awakened slowly After a while he had taken down his concertina and played upon it the six very mournful airs that he knew Face downward upon the bed Trina still wept Throughout that little suite could be heard but two sounds the lugubrious strains of the concertina and the noise of stifled weeping That her husband should be ignorant of her distress seemed to Trina an additional grievance With perverse inconsistency she began to wish him to come to her to comfort her He ought to know that she was in trouble that she was lonely and unhappy Oh Mac she called in a trembling voice But the concertina still continued to wail and lament Then Trina wished she were dead and on the instant jumped up and ran into the Dental Parlors and threw herself into her husband s arms crying Oh Mac dear love me love me big I m so unhappy What what what the dentist exclaimed starting up bewildered a little frightened Nothing nothing only LOVE me love me always and always But this first crisis this momentary revolt as much a matter of high strung feminine nerves as of anything else passed and in the end Trina s affection for her old bear grew in spite of herself She began to love him more and more not for what he was but for what she had given up to him Only once again did Trina undergo a reaction against her husband and then it was but the matter of an instant brought on curiously enough by the sight of a bit of egg on McTeague s heavy mustache one morning just after breakfast Then too the pair had learned to make concessions little by little and all unconsciously they adapted their modes of life to suit each other Instead of sinking to McTeague s level as she had feared Trina found that she could make McTeague rise to hers and in this saw a solution of many a difficult and gloomy complication For one thing the dentist began to dress a little better Trina even succeeding in inducing him to wear a high silk hat and a frock coat of a Sunday Next he relinquished his Sunday afternoon s nap and beer in favor of three or four hours spent in the park with her the weather permitting So that gradually Trina s misgivings ceased or when they did assail her she could at last meet them with a shrug of the shoulders saying to herself meanwhile Well it s done now and it can t be helped one must make the best of it During the first months of their married life these nervous relapses of hers had alternated with brusque outbursts of affection when her only fear was that her husband s love did not equal her own Without an instant s warning she would clasp him about the neck rubbing her cheek against his murmuring Dear old Mac I love you so I love you so Oh aren t we happy together Mac just us two and no one else You love me as much as I love you don t you Mac Oh if you shouldn t if you SHOULDN T But by the middle of the winter Trina s emotions oscillating at first from one extreme to another commenced to settle themselves to an equilibrium of calmness and placid quietude Her household duties began more and more to absorb her attention for she was an admirable housekeeper keeping the little suite in marvellous good order and regulating the schedule of expenditure with an economy that often bordered on positive niggardliness It was a passion with her to save money In the bottom of her trunk in the bedroom she hid a brass match safe that answered the purposes of a savings bank Each time she added a quarter or a half dollar to the little store she laughed and sang with a veritable childish delight whereas if the butcher or milkman compelled her to pay an overcharge she was unhappy for the rest of the day She did not save this money for any ulterior purpose she hoarded instinctively without knowing why responding to the dentist s remonstrances with Yes yes I know I m a little miser I know it Trina had always been an economical little body but it was only since her great winning in the lottery that she had become especially penurious No doubt in her fear lest their great good luck should demoralize them and lead to habits of extravagance she had recoiled too far in the other direction Never never never should a penny of that miraculous fortune be spent rather should it be added to It was a nest egg a monstrous roc like nest egg not so large however but that it could be made larger Already by the end of that winter Trina had begun to make up the deficit of two hundred dollars that she had been forced to expend on the preparations for her marriage McTeague on his part never asked himself now a days whether he loved Trina the wife as much as he had loved Trina the young girl There had been a time when to kiss Trina to take her in his arms had thrilled him from head to heel with a happiness that was beyond words even the smell of her wonderful odorous hair had sent a sensation of faintness all through him That time was long past now Those sudden outbursts of affection on the part of his little woman outbursts that only increased in vehemence the longer they lived together puzzled rather than pleased him He had come to submit to them good naturedly answering her passionate inquiries with a Sure sure Trina sure I love you What what s the matter with you There was no passion in the dentist s regard for his wife He dearly liked to have her near him he took an enormous pleasure in watching her as she moved about their rooms very much at home gay and singing from morning till night and it was his great delight to call her into the Dental Parlors when a patient was in the chair and while he held the plugger to have her rap in the gold fillings with the little box wood mallet as he had taught her But that tempest of passion that overpowering desire that had suddenly taken possession of him that day when he had given her ether again when he had caught her in his arms in the B Street station and again and again during the early days of their married life rarely stirred him now On the other hand he was never assailed with doubts as to the wisdom of his marriage McTeague had relapsed to his wonted stolidity He never questioned himself never looked for motives never went to the bottom of things The year following upon the summer of his marriage was a time of great contentment for him after the novelty of the honeymoon had passed he slipped easily into the new order of things without a question Thus his life would be for years to come Trina was there he was married and settled He accepted the situation The little animal comforts which for him constituted the enjoyment of life were ministered to at every turn or when they were interfered with as in the case of his Sunday afternoon s nap and beer some agreeable substitute was found In her attempts to improve McTeague to raise him from the stupid animal life to which he had been accustomed in his bachelor days Trina was tactful enough to move so cautiously and with such slowness that the dentist was unconscious of any process of change In the matter of the high silk hat it seemed to him that the initiative had come from himself Gradually the dentist improved under the influence of his little wife He no longer went abroad with frayed cuffs about his huge red wrists or worse without any cuffs at all Trina kept his linen clean and mended doing most of his washing herself and insisting that he should change his flannels thick red flannels they were with enormous bone buttons once a week his linen shirts twice a week and his collars and cuffs every second day She broke him of the habit of eating with his knife she caused him to substitute bottled beer in the place of steam beer and she induced him to take off his hat to Miss Baker to Heise s wife and to the other women of his acquaintance McTeague no longer spent an evening at Frenna s Instead of this he brought a couple of bottles of beer up to the rooms and shared it with Trina In his Parlors he was no longer gruff and indifferent to his female patients he arrived at that stage where he could work and talk to them at the same time he even accompanied them to the door and held it open for them when the operation was finished bowing them out with great nods of his huge square cut head Besides all this he began to observe the broader larger interests of life interests that affected him not as an individual but as a member of a class a profession or a political party He read the papers he subscribed to a dental magazine on Easter Christmas and New Year s he went to church with Trina He commenced to have opinions convictions it was not fair to deprive tax paying women of the privilege to vote a university education should not be a prerequisite for admission to a dental college the Catholic priests were to be restrained in their efforts to gain control of the public schools But most wonderful of all McTeague began to have ambitions very vague very confused ideas of something better ideas for the most part borrowed from Trina Some day perhaps he and his wife would have a house of their own What a dream A little home all to themselves with six rooms and a bath with a grass plat in front and calla lilies Then there would be children He would have a son whose name would be Daniel who would go to High School and perhaps turn out to be a prosperous plumber or house painter Then this son Daniel would marry a wife and they would all live together in that six room and bath house Daniel would have little children McTeague would grow old among them all The dentist saw himself as a venerable patriarch surrounded by children and grandchildren So the winter passed It was a season of great happiness for the McTeagues the new life jostled itself into its grooves A routine began On weekdays they rose at half past six being awakened by the boy who brought the bottled milk and who had instructions to pound upon the bedroom door in passing Trina made breakfast coffee bacon and eggs and a roll of Vienna bread from the bakery The breakfast was eaten in the kitchen on the round deal table covered with the shiny oilcloth table spread tacked on After breakfast the dentist immediately betook himself to his Parlors to meet his early morning appointments those made with the clerks and shop girls who stopped in for half an hour on their way to their work Trina meanwhile busied herself about the suite clearing away the breakfast sponging off the oilcloth table spread making the bed pottering about with a broom or duster or cleaning rag Towards ten o clock she opened the windows to air the rooms then put on her drab jacket her little round turban with its red wing took the butcher s and grocer s books from the knife basket in the drawer of the kitchen table and descended to the street where she spent a delicious hour now in the huge market across the way now in the grocer s store with its fragrant aroma of coffee and spices and now before the counters of the haberdasher s intent on a bit of shopping turning over ends of veiling strips of elastic or slivers of whalebone On the street she rubbed elbows with the great ladies of the avenue in their beautiful dresses or at intervals she met an acquaintance or two Miss Baker or Heise s lame wife or missus Ryer At times she passed the flat and looked up at the windows of her home marked by the huge golden molar that projected flashing from the bay window of the Parlors She saw the open windows of the sitting room the Nottingham lace curtains stirring and billowing in the draft and she caught sight of Maria Macapa s towelled head as the Mexican maid of all work went to and fro in the suite sweeping or carrying away the ashes Occasionally in the windows of the Parlors she beheld McTeague s rounded back as he bent to his work Sometimes even they saw each other and waved their hands gayly in recognition By eleven o clock Trina returned to the flat her brown net reticule once her mother s full of parcels At once she set about getting lunch sausages perhaps with mashed potatoes or last evening s joint warmed over or made into a stew chocolate which Trina adored and a side dish or two a salted herring or a couple of artichokes or a salad At half past twelve the dentist came in from the Parlors bringing with him the smell of creosote and of ether They sat down to lunch in the sitting room They told each other of their doings throughout the forenoon Trina showed her purchases McTeague recounted the progress of an operation At one o clock they separated the dentist returning to the Parlors Trina settling to her work on the Noah s ark animals At about three o clock she put this work away and for the rest of the afternoon was variously occupied sometimes it was the mending sometimes the wash sometimes new curtains to be put up or a bit of carpet to be tacked down or a letter to be written or a visit generally to Miss Baker to be returned Towards five o clock the old woman whom they had hired for that purpose came to cook supper for even Trina was not equal to the task of preparing three meals a day This woman was French and was known to the flat as Augustine no one taking enough interest in her to inquire for her last name all that was known of her was that she was a decayed French laundress miserably poor her trade long since ruined by Chinese competition Augustine cooked well but she was otherwise undesirable and Trina lost patience with her at every moment The old French woman s most marked characteristic was her timidity Trina could scarcely address her a simple direction without Augustine quailing and shrinking a reproof however gentle threw her into an agony of confusion while Trina s anger promptly reduced her to a state of nervous collapse wherein she lost all power of speech while her head began to bob and nod with an incontrollable twitching of the muscles much like the oscillations of the head of a toy donkey Her timidity was exasperating her very presence in the room unstrung the nerves while her morbid eagerness to avoid offence only served to develop in her a clumsiness that was at times beyond belief More than once Trina had decided that she could no longer put up with Augustine but each time she had retained her as she reflected upon her admirably cooked cabbage soups and tapioca puddings and which in Trina s eyes was her chiefest recommendation the pittance for which she was contented to work Augustine had a husband He was a spirit medium a professor At times he held seances in the larger rooms of the flat playing vigorously upon a mouth organ and invoking a familiar whom he called Edna and whom he asserted was an Indian maiden The evening was a period of relaxation for Trina and McTeague They had supper at six after which McTeague smoked his pipe and read the papers for half an hour while Trina and Augustine cleared away the table and washed the dishes Then as often as not they went out together One of their amusements was to go down town after dark and promenade Market and Kearney Streets It was very gay a great many others were promenading there also All of the stores were brilliantly lighted and many of them still open They walked about aimlessly looking into the shop windows Trina would take McTeague s arm and he very much embarrassed at that would thrust both hands into his pockets and pretend not to notice They stopped before the jewellers and milliners windows finding a great delight in picking out things for each other saying how they would choose this and that if they were rich Trina did most of the talking McTeague merely approving by a growl or a movement of the head or shoulders she was interested in the displays of some of the cheaper stores but he found an irresistible charm in an enormous golden molar with four prongs that hung at a corner of Kearney Street Sometimes they would look at Mars or at the moon through the street telescopes or sit for a time in the rotunda of a vast department store where a band played every evening Occasionally they met Heise the harness maker and his wife with whom they had become acquainted Then the evening was concluded by a four cornered party in the Luxembourg a quiet German restaurant under a theatre Trina had a tamale and a glass of beer missus Heise who was a decayed writing teacher ate salads with glasses of grenadine and currant syrups Heise drank cocktails and whiskey straight and urged the dentist to join him But McTeague was obstinate shaking his head I can t drink that stuff he said It don t agree with me somehow I go kinda crazy after two glasses So he gorged himself with beer and frankfurter sausages plastered with German mustard When the annual Mechanic s Fair opened McTeague and Trina often spent their evenings there studying the exhibits carefully since in Trina s estimation education meant knowing things and being able to talk about them Wearying of this they would go up into the gallery and leaning over look down into the huge amphitheatre full of light and color and movement There rose to them the vast shuffling noise of thousands of feet and a subdued roar of conversation like the sound of a great mill Mingled with this was the purring of distant machinery the splashing of a temporary fountain and the rhythmic jangling of a brass band while in the piano exhibit a hired performer was playing upon a concert grand with a great flourish Nearer at hand they could catch ends of conversation and notes of laughter the noise of moving dresses and the rustle of stiffly starched skirts Here and there school children elbowed their way through the crowd crying shrilly their hands full of advertisement pamphlets fans picture cards and toy whips while the air itself was full of the smell of fresh popcorn They even spent some time in the art gallery Trina s cousin Selina who gave lessons in hand painting at two bits an hour generally had an exhibit on the walls which they were interested to find It usually was a bunch of yellow poppies painted on black velvet and framed in gilt They stood before it some little time hazarding their opinions and then moved on slowly from one picture to another Trina had McTeague buy a catalogue and made a duty of finding the title of every picture This too she told McTeague as a kind of education one ought to cultivate Trina professed to be fond of art having perhaps acquired a taste for painting and sculpture from her experience with the Noah s ark animals Of course she told the dentist I m no critic I only know what I like She knew that she liked the Ideal Heads lovely girls with flowing straw colored hair and immense upturned eyes These always had for title Reverie or An Idyll or Dreams of Love I think those are lovely don t you Mac she said Yes yes answered McTeague nodding his head bewildered trying to understand Yes yes lovely that s the word Are you dead sure now Trina that all that s hand painted just like the poppies Thus the winter passed a year went by then two The little life of Polk Street the life of small traders drug clerks grocers stationers plumbers dentists doctors spirit mediums and the like ran on monotonously in its accustomed grooves The first three years of their married life wrought little change in the fortunes of the McTeagues In the third summer the branch post office was moved from the ground floor of the flat to a corner farther up the street in order to be near the cable line that ran mail cars Its place was taken by a German saloon called a Wein Stube in the face of the protests of every female lodger A few months later quite a little flurry of excitement ran through the street on the occasion of The Polk Street Open Air Festival organized to celebrate the introduction there of electric lights The festival lasted three days and was quite an affair The street was garlanded with yellow and white bunting there were processions and floats and brass bands Marcus Schouler was in his element during the whole time of the celebration He was one of the marshals of the parade and was to be seen at every hour of the day wearing a borrowed high hat and cotton gloves and galloping a broken down cab horse over the cobbles He carried a baton covered with yellow and white calico with which he made furious passes and gestures His voice was soon reduced to a whisper by continued shouting and he raged and fretted over trifles till he wore himself thin McTeague was disgusted with him As often as Marcus passed the window of the flat the dentist would mutter Ah you think you re smart don t you The result of the festival was the organizing of a body known as the Polk Street Improvement Club of which Marcus was elected secretary McTeague and Trina often heard of him in this capacity through Heise the harness maker Marcus had evidently come to have political aspirations It appeared that he was gaining a reputation as a maker of speeches delivered with fiery emphasis and occasionally reprinted in the Progress the organ of the club outraged constituencies opinions warped by personal bias eyes blinded by party prejudice et cetera Of her family Trina heard every fortnight in letters from her mother The upholstery business which mister Sieppe had bought was doing poorly and missus Sieppe bewailed the day she had ever left B Street mister Sieppe was losing money every month Owgooste who was to have gone to school had been forced to go to work in the store picking waste missus Sieppe was obliged to take a lodger or two Affairs were in a very bad way Occasionally she spoke of Marcus mister Sieppe had not forgotten him despite his own troubles but still had an eye out for some one whom Marcus could go in with on a ranch It was toward the end of this period of three years that Trina and McTeague had their first serious quarrel Trina had talked so much about having a little house of their own at some future day that McTeague had at length come to regard the affair as the end and object of all their labors For a long time they had had their eyes upon one house in particular It was situated on a cross street close by between Polk Street and the great avenue one block above and hardly a Sunday afternoon passed that Trina and McTeague did not go and look at it They stood for fully half an hour upon the other side of the street examining every detail of its exterior hazarding guesses as to the arrangement of the rooms commenting upon its immediate neighborhood which was rather sordid The house was a wooden two story arrangement built by a misguided contractor in a sort of hideous Queen Anne style all scrolls and meaningless mill work with a cheap imitation of stained glass in the light over the door There was a microscopic front yard full of dusty calla lilies The front door boasted an electric bell But for the McTeagues it was an ideal home Their idea was to live in this little house the dentist retaining merely his office in the flat The two places were but around the corner from each other so that McTeague could lunch with his wife as usual and could even keep his early morning appointments and return to breakfast if he so desired However the house was occupied A Hungarian family lived in it The father kept a stationery and notion bazaar next to Heise s harness shop on Polk Street while the oldest son played a third violin in the orchestra of a theatre The family rented the house unfurnished for thirty five dollars paying extra for the water But one Sunday as Trina and McTeague on their way home from their usual walk turned into the cross street on which the little house was situated they became promptly aware of an unwonted bustle going on upon the sidewalk in front of it A dray was back against the curb an express wagon drove away loaded with furniture bedsteads looking glasses and washbowls littered the sidewalks The Hungarian family were moving out Oh Mac look gasped Trina Sure sure muttered the dentist 
816_2301_000043_000000	train-clean-360	After that they spoke but little 
none	none	For upwards of an hour the two stood upon the sidewalk opposite watching intently all that went forward absorbed excited On the evening of the next day they returned and visited the house finding a great delight in going from room to room and imagining themselves installed therein Here would be the bedroom here the dining room here a charming little parlor As they came out upon the front steps once more they met the owner an enormous red faced fellow so fat that his walking seemed merely a certain movement of his feet by which he pushed his stomach along in front of him Trina talked with him a few moments but arrived at no understanding and the two went away after giving him their address At supper that night McTeague said Huh what do you think Trina Trina put her chin in the air tilting back her heavy tiara of swarthy hair I am not so sure yet Thirty five dollars and the water extra I don t think we can afford it Mac Ah pshaw growled the dentist sure we can It isn t only that said Trina but it ll cost so much to make the change Ah you talk s though we were paupers Ain t we got five thousand dollars Trina flushed on the instant even to the lobes of her tiny pale ears and put her lips together Now Mac you know I don t want you should talk like that That money s never never to be touched And you ve been savun up a good deal besides went on McTeague exasperated at Trina s persistent economies How much money have you got in that little brass match safe in the bottom of your trunk Pretty near a hundred dollars I guess ah sure He shut his eyes and nodded his great head in a knowing way Trina had more than that in the brass match safe in question but her instinct of hoarding had led her to keep it a secret from her husband Now she lied to him with prompt fluency A hundred dollars What are you talking of Mac I ve not got fifty I ve not got THIRTY Oh let s take that little house broke in McTeague We got the chance now and it may never come again Come on Trina shall we Say come on shall we huh We d have to be awful saving if we did Mac Well sure I say let s take it I don t know said Trina hesitating Wouldn t it be lovely to have a house all to ourselves But let s not decide until to morrow The next day the owner of the house called Trina was out at her morning s marketing and the dentist who had no one in the chair at the time received him in the Parlors Before he was well aware of it McTeague had concluded the bargain The owner bewildered him with a world of phrases made him believe that it would be a great saving to move into the little house and finally offered it to him water free All right all right said McTeague I ll take it The other immediately produced a paper Well then suppose you sign for the first month s rent and we ll call it a bargain That s business you know and McTeague hesitating signed I d like to have talked more with my wife about it first he said dubiously Oh that s all right answered the owner easily I guess if the head of the family wants a thing that s enough McTeague could not wait until lunch time to tell the news to Trina As soon as he heard her come in he laid down the plaster of paris mould he was making and went out into the kitchen and found her chopping up onions Well Trina he said we got that house I ve taken it What do you mean she answered quickly The dentist told her And you signed a paper for the first month s rent Sure sure That s business you know Well why did you DO it cried Trina You might have asked ME something about it Now what have you done I was talking with missus Ryer about that house while I was out this morning and she said the Hungarians moved out because it was absolutely unhealthy there s water been standing in the basement for months And she told me too Trina went on indignantly that she knew the owner and she was sure we could get the house for thirty if we d bargain for it Now what have you gone and done I hadn t made up my mind about taking the house at all And now I WON T take it with the water in the basement and all Well well stammered McTeague helplessly we needn t go in if it s unhealthy But you ve signed a PAPER cried Trina exasperated You ve got to pay that first month s rent anyhow to forfeit it Oh you are so stupid There s thirty five dollars just thrown away I SHAN T go into that house we won t move a FOOT out of here I ve changed my mind about it and there s water in the basement besides Well I guess we can stand thirty five dollars mumbled the dentist if we ve got to Thirty five dollars just thrown out of the window cried Trina her teeth clicking every instinct of her parsimony aroused Oh you the thick wittedest man that I ever knew Do you think we re millionaires Oh to think of losing thirty five dollars like that Tears were in her eyes tears of grief as well as of anger Never had McTeague seen his little woman so aroused Suddenly she rose to her feet and slammed the chopping bowl down upon the table Well I won t pay a nickel of it she exclaimed Huh What what stammered the dentist taken all aback by her outburst I say that you will find that money that thirty five dollars yourself Why why It s your stupidity got us into this fix and you ll be the one that ll suffer by it I can t do it I WON T do it We ll we ll share and share alike Why you said you told me you d take the house if the water was free I NEVER did I NEVER did How can you stand there and say such a thing You did tell me that vociferated McTeague beginning to get angry in his turn Mac I didn t and you know it And what s more I won t pay a nickel mister Heise pays his bill next week it s forty three dollars and you can just pay the thirty five out of that Why you got a whole hundred dollars saved up in your match safe shouted the dentist throwing out an arm with an awkward gesture You pay half and I ll pay half that s only fair No no NO exclaimed Trina It s not a hundred dollars You won t touch it you won t touch my money I tell you Ah how does it happen to be yours I d like to know It s mine It s mine It s mine cried Trina her face scarlet her teeth clicking like the snap of a closing purse It ain t any more yours than it is mine Every penny of it is mine Ah what a fine fix you d get me into growled the dentist I ve signed the paper with the owner that s business you know that s business you know and now you go back on me Suppose we d taken the house we d a shared the rent wouldn t we just as we do here Trina shrugged her shoulders with a great affectation of indifference and began chopping the onions again You settle it with the owner she said It s your affair you ve got the money She pretended to assume a certain calmness as though the matter was something that no longer affected her Her manner exasperated McTeague all the more No I won t no I won t I won t either he shouted I ll pay my half and he can come to you for the other half Trina put a hand over her ear to shut out his clamor Ah don t try and be smart cried McTeague Come now yes or no will you pay your half You heard what I said Will you pay it No Miser shouted McTeague Miser you re worse than old Zerkow All right all right keep your money I ll pay the whole thirty five I d rather lose it than be such a miser as you Haven t you got anything to do returned Trina instead of staying here and abusing me Well then for the last time will you help me out Trina cut the heads of a fresh bunch of onions and gave no answer Huh will you I d like to have my kitchen to myself please she said in a mincing way irritating to a last degree The dentist stamped out of the room banging the door behind him For nearly a week the breach between them remained unhealed Trina only spoke to the dentist in monosyllables while he exasperated at her calmness and frigid reserve sulked in his Dental Parlors muttering terrible things beneath his mustache or finding solace in his concertina playing his six lugubrious airs over and over again or swearing frightful oaths at his canary When Heise paid his bill McTeague in a fury sent the amount to the owner of the little house There was no formal reconciliation between the dentist and his little woman Their relations readjusted themselves inevitably By the end of the week they were as amicable as ever but it was long before they spoke of the little house again Nor did they ever revisit it of a Sunday afternoon A month or so later the Ryers told them that the owner himself had moved in The McTeagues never occupied that little house But Trina suffered a reaction after the quarrel She began to be sorry she had refused to help her husband sorry she had brought matters to such an issue One afternoon as she was at work on the Noah s ark animals she surprised herself crying over the affair She loved her old bear too much to do him an injustice and perhaps after all she had been in the wrong Then it occurred to her how pretty it would be to come up behind him unexpectedly and slip the money thirty five dollars into his hand and pull his huge head down to her and kiss his bald spot as she used to do in the days before they were married Then she hesitated pausing in her work her knife dropping into her lap a half whittled figure between her fingers If not thirty five dollars then at least fifteen or sixteen her share of it But a feeling of reluctance a sudden revolt against this intended generosity arose in her No no she said to herself I ll give him ten dollars I ll tell him it s all I can afford It IS all I can afford She hastened to finish the figure of the animal she was then at work upon putting in the ears and tail with a drop of glue and tossing it into the basket at her side Then she rose and went into the bedroom and opened her trunk taking the key from under a corner of the carpet where she kept it hid At the very bottom of her trunk under her bridal dress she kept her savings It was all in change half dollars and dollars for the most part with here and there a gold piece Long since the little brass match box had overflowed Trina kept the surplus in a chamois skin sack she had made from an old chest protector Just now yielding to an impulse which often seized her she drew out the match box and the chamois sack and emptying the contents on the bed counted them carefully It came to one hundred and sixty five dollars all told She counted it and recounted it and made little piles of it and rubbed the gold pieces between the folds of her apron until they shone Ah yes ten dollars is all I can afford to give Mac said Trina and even then think of it ten dollars it will be four or five months before I can save that again But dear old Mac I know it would make him feel glad and perhaps she added suddenly taken with an idea perhaps Mac will refuse to take it She took a ten dollar piece from the heap and put the rest away Then she paused No not the gold piece she said to herself It s too pretty He can have the silver She made the change and counted out ten silver dollars into her palm But what a difference it made in the appearance and weight of the little chamois bag The bag was shrunken and withered long wrinkles appeared running downward from the draw string It was a lamentable sight Trina looked longingly at the ten broad pieces in her hand Then suddenly all her intuitive desire of saving her instinct of hoarding her love of money for the money s sake rose strong within her No no no she said I can t do it It may be mean but I can t help it It s stronger than I She returned the money to the bag and locked it and the brass match box in her trunk turning the key with a long breath of satisfaction She was a little troubled however as she went back into the sitting room and took up her work I didn t use to be so stingy she told herself Since I won in the lottery I ve become a regular little miser It s growing on me but never mind it s a good fault and anyhow I can t help it CHAPTER eleven On that particular morning the McTeagues had risen a half hour earlier than usual and taken a hurried breakfast in the kitchen on the deal table with its oilcloth cover Trina was house cleaning that week and had a presentiment of a hard day s work ahead of her while McTeague remembered a seven o clock appointment with a little German shoemaker At about eight o clock when the dentist had been in his office for over an hour Trina descended upon the bedroom a towel about her head and the roller sweeper in her hand She covered the bureau and sewing machine with sheets and unhooked the chenille portieres between the bedroom and the sitting room As she was tying the Nottingham lace curtains at the window into great knots she saw old Miss Baker on the opposite sidewalk in the street below and raising the sash called down to her Oh it s you missus McTeague cried the retired dressmaker facing about her head in the air Then a long conversation was begun Trina her arms folded under her breast her elbows resting on the window ledge willing to be idle for a moment old Miss Baker her market basket on her arm her hands wrapped in the ends of her worsted shawl against the cold of the early morning They exchanged phrases calling to each other from window to curb their breath coming from their lips in faint puffs of vapor their voices shrill and raised to dominate the clamor of the waking street The newsboys had made their appearance on the street together with the day laborers The cable cars had begun to fill up all along the street could be seen the shopkeepers taking down their shutters some were still breakfasting Now and then a waiter from one of the cheap restaurants crossed from one sidewalk to another balancing on one palm a tray covered with a napkin Aren t you out pretty early this morning Miss Baker called Trina No no answered the other I m always up at half past six but I don t always get out so soon I wanted to get a nice head of cabbage and some lentils for a soup and if you don t go to market early the restaurants get all the best And you ve been to market already Miss Baker Oh my yes and I got a fish a sole see She drew the sole in question from her basket Oh the lovely sole exclaimed Trina I got this one at Spadella s he always has good fish on Friday How is the doctor missus McTeague Ah Mac is always well thank you Miss Baker You know missus Ryer told me cried the little dressmaker moving forward a step out of the way of a glass put in man that Doctor McTeague pulled a tooth of that Catholic priest Father oh I forget his name anyhow he pulled his tooth with his fingers Was that true missus McTeague Oh of course Mac does that almost all the time now specially with front teeth He s got a regular reputation for it He says it s brought him more patients than even the sign I gave him she added pointing to the big golden molar projecting from the office window With his fingers Now think of that exclaimed Miss Baker wagging her head Isn t he that strong It s just wonderful Cleaning house to day she inquired glancing at Trina s towelled head Um hum answered Trina Maria Macapa s coming in to help pretty soon At the mention of Maria s name the little old dressmaker suddenly uttered an exclamation Well if I m not here talking to you and forgetting something I was just dying to tell you missus McTeague what ever in the world do you suppose Maria and old Zerkow that red headed Polish Jew the rag bottles sacks man you know they re going to be married No cried Trina in blank amazement You don t mean it Of course I do Isn t it the funniest thing you ever heard of Oh tell me all about it said Trina leaning eagerly from the window Miss Baker crossed the street and stood just beneath her Well Maria came to me last night and wanted me to make her a new gown said she wanted something gay like what the girls at the candy store wear when they go out with their young men I couldn t tell what had got into the girl until finally she told me she wanted something to get married in and that Zerkow had asked her to marry him and that she was going to do it Poor Maria I guess it s the first and only offer she ever received and it s just turned her head But what DO those two see in each other cried Trina Zerkow is a horror he s an old man and his hair is red and his voice is gone and then he s a Jew isn t he I know I know but it s Maria s only chance for a husband and she don t mean to let it pass You know she isn t quite right in her head anyhow I m awfully sorry for poor Maria But I can t see what Zerkow wants to marry her for It s not possible that he s in love with Maria it s out of the question Maria hasn t a sou either and I m just positive that Zerkow has lots of money I ll bet I know why exclaimed Trina with sudden conviction yes I know just why See here Miss Baker you know how crazy old Zerkow is after money and gold and those sort of things Yes I know but you know Maria hasn t Now just listen You ve heard Maria tell about that wonderful service of gold dishes she says her folks used to own in Central America she s crazy on that subject don t you know She s all right on everything else but just start her on that service of gold plate and she ll talk you deaf She can describe it just as though she saw it and she can make you see it too almost Now you see Maria and Zerkow have known each other pretty well Maria goes to him every two weeks or so to sell him junk they got acquainted that way and I know Maria s been dropping in to see him pretty often this last year and sometimes he comes here to see her He s made Maria tell him the story of that plate over and over and over again and Maria does it and is glad to because he s the only one that believes it Now he s going to marry her just so s he can hear that story every day every hour He s pretty near as crazy on the subject as Maria is They re a pair for you aren t they Both crazy over a lot of gold dishes that never existed Perhaps Maria ll marry him because it s her only chance to get a husband but I m sure it s more for the reason that she s got some one to talk to now who believes her story Don t you think I m right Yes yes I guess you re right admitted Miss Baker But it s a queer match anyway you put it said Trina musingly Ah you may well say that returned the other nodding her head There was a silence For a long moment the dentist s wife and the retired dressmaker the one at the window the other on the sidewalk remained lost in thought wondering over the strangeness of the affair But suddenly there was a diversion Alexander Marcus Schouler s Irish setter whom his master had long since allowed the liberty of running untrammelled about the neighborhood turned the corner briskly and came trotting along the sidewalk where Miss Baker stood At the same moment the Scotch collie who had at one time belonged to the branch post office issued from the side door of a house not fifty feet away In an instant the two enemies had recognized each other They halted abruptly their fore feet planted rigidly Trina uttered a little cry Oh look out Miss Baker Those two dogs hate each other just like humans You best look out They ll fight sure Miss Baker sought safety in a nearby vestibule whence she peered forth at the scene very interested and curious Maria Macapa s head thrust itself from one of the top story windows of the flat with a shrill cry Even McTeague s huge form appeared above the half curtains of the Parlor windows while over his shoulder could be seen the face of the patient a napkin tucked in his collar the rubber dam depending from his mouth All the flat knew of the feud between the dogs but never before had the pair been brought face to face Meanwhile the collie and the setter had drawn near to each other five feet apart they paused as if by mutual consent The collie turned sidewise to the setter the setter instantly wheeled himself flank on to the collie Their tails rose and stiffened they raised their lips over their long white fangs the napes of their necks bristled and they showed each other the vicious whites of their eyes while they drew in their breaths with prolonged and rasping snarls Each dog seemed to be the personification of fury and unsatisfied hate They began to circle about each other with infinite slowness walking stiffed legged and upon the very points of their feet Then they wheeled about and began to circle in the opposite direction Twice they repeated this motion their snarls growing louder But still they did not come together and the distance of five feet between them was maintained with an almost mathematical precision It was magnificent but it was not war Then the setter pausing in his walk turned his head slowly from his enemy The collie sniffed the air and pretended an interest in an old shoe lying in the gutter Gradually and with all the dignity of monarchs they moved away from each other Alexander stalked back to the corner of the street The collie paced toward the side gate whence he had issued affecting to remember something of great importance They disappeared Once out of sight of one another they began to bark furiously Well I NEVER exclaimed Trina in great disgust The way those two dogs have been carrying on you d a thought they would a just torn each other to pieces when they had the chance and here I m wasting the whole morning she closed her window with a bang Sick im sick im called Maria Macapa in a vain attempt to promote a fight Old Miss Baker came out of the vestibule pursing her lips quite put out at the fiasco And after all that fuss she said to herself aggrievedly The little dressmaker bought an envelope of nasturtium seeds at the florist s and returned to her tiny room in the flat But as she slowly mounted the first flight of steps she suddenly came face to face with Old Grannis who was coming down It was between eight and nine and he was on his way to his little dog hospital no doubt Instantly Miss Baker was seized with trepidation her curious little false curls shook a faint a very faint flush came into her withered cheeks and her heart beat so violently under the worsted shawl that she felt obliged to shift the market basket to her other arm and put out her free hand to steady herself against the rail On his part Old Grannis was instantly overwhelmed with confusion His awkwardness seemed to paralyze his limbs his lips twitched and turned dry his hand went tremblingly to his chin But what added to Miss Baker s miserable embarrassment on this occasion was the fact that the old Englishman should meet her thus carrying a sordid market basket full of sordid fish and cabbage It seemed as if a malicious fate persisted in bringing the two old people face to face at the most inopportune moments Just now however a veritable catastrophe occurred The little old dressmaker changed her basket to her other arm at precisely the wrong moment and Old Grannis hastening to pass removing his hat in a hurried salutation struck it with his fore arm knocking it from her grasp and sending it rolling and bumping down the stairs The sole fell flat upon the first landing the lentils scattered themselves over the entire flight while the cabbage leaping from step to step thundered down the incline and brought up against the street door with a shock that reverberated through the entire building The little retired dressmaker horribly vexed nervous and embarrassed was hard put to it to keep back the tears Old Grannis stood for a moment with averted eyes murmuring Oh I m so sorry I m so sorry I I really I beg your pardon really really Marcus Schouler coming down stairs from his room saved the situation Hello people he cried By damn you ve upset your basket you have for a fact Here let s pick um up He and Old Grannis went up and down the flight gathering up the fish the lentils and the sadly battered cabbage Marcus was raging over the pusillanimity of Alexander of which Maria had just told him I ll cut him in two with the whip he shouted I will I will I say I will for a fact He wouldn t fight hey I ll give um all the fight he wants nasty mangy cur If he won t fight he won t eat I m going to get the butcher s bull pup and I ll put um both in a bag and shake um up I will for a fact and I guess Alec will fight Come along Mister Grannis and he took the old Englishman away Little Miss Baker hastened to her room and locked herself in She was excited and upset during all the rest of the day and listened eagerly for Old Grannis s return that evening He went instantly to work binding up The Breeder and Sportsman and back numbers of the Nation She heard him softly draw his chair and the table on which he had placed his little binding apparatus close to the wall At once she did the same brewing herself a cup of tea All through that evening the two old people kept company with each other after their own peculiar fashion Setting out with each other Miss Baker had begun to call it That they had been presented that they had even been forced to talk together had made no change in their relative positions Almost immediately they had fallen back into their old ways again quite unable to master their timidity to overcome the stifling embarrassment that seized upon them when in each other s presence It was a sort of hypnotism a thing stronger than themselves But they were not altogether dissatisfied with the way things had come to be It was their little romance their last and they were living through it with supreme enjoyment and calm contentment Marcus Schouler still occupied his old room on the floor above the McTeagues They saw but little of him however At long intervals the dentist or his wife met him on the stairs of the flat Sometimes he would stop and talk with Trina inquiring after the Sieppes asking her if mister Sieppe had yet heard of any one with whom he Marcus could go in with on a ranch McTeague Marcus merely nodded to Never had the quarrel between the two men been completely patched up It did not seem possible to the dentist now that Marcus had ever been his pal that they had ever taken long walks together He was sorry that he had treated Marcus gratis for an ulcerated tooth while Marcus daily recalled the fact that he had given up his girl to his friend the girl who had won a fortune as the great mistake of his life Only once since the wedding had he called upon Trina at a time when he knew McTeague would be out Trina had shown him through the rooms and had told him innocently enough how gay was their life there Marcus had come away fairly sick with envy his rancor against the dentist and against himself for that matter knew no bounds And you might a had it all yourself Marcus Schouler he muttered to himself on the stairs You mushhead you damn fool Meanwhile Marcus was becoming involved in the politics of his ward As secretary of the Polk Street Improvement Club which soon developed into quite an affair and began to assume the proportions of a Republican political machine he found he could make a little a very little more than enough to live on At once he had given up his position as Old Grannis s assistant in the dog hospital Marcus felt that he needed a wider sphere He had his eye upon a place connected with the city pound When the great railroad strike occurred he promptly got himself engaged as deputy sheriff and spent a memorable week in Sacramento where he involved himself in more than one terrible melee with the strikers Marcus had that quickness of temper and passionate readiness to take offence which passes among his class for bravery But whatever were his motives his promptness to face danger could not for a moment be doubted After the strike he returned to Polk Street and throwing himself into the Improvement Club heart soul and body soon became one of its ruling spirits In a certain local election where a huge paving contract was at stake the club made itself felt in the ward and Marcus so managed his cards and pulled his wires that at the end of the matter he found himself some four hundred dollars to the good When McTeague came out of his Parlors at noon of the day upon which Trina had heard the news of Maria Macapa s intended marriage he found Trina burning coffee on a shovel in the sitting room Try as she would Trina could never quite eradicate from their rooms a certain faint and indefinable odor particularly offensive to her The smell of the photographer s chemicals persisted in spite of all Trina could do to combat it She burnt pastilles and Chinese punk and even as now coffee on a shovel all to no purpose Indeed the only drawback to their delightful home was the general unpleasant smell that pervaded it a smell that arose partly from the photographer s chemicals partly from the cooking in the little kitchen and partly from the ether and creosote of the dentist s Parlors As McTeague came in to lunch on this occasion he found the table already laid a red cloth figured with white flowers was spread and as he took his seat his wife put down the shovel on a chair and brought in the stewed codfish and the pot of chocolate As he tucked his napkin into his enormous collar McTeague looked vaguely about the room rolling his eyes During the three years of their married life the McTeagues had made but few additions to their furniture Trina declaring that they could not afford it The sitting room could boast of but three new ornaments Over the melodeon hung their marriage certificate in a black frame It was balanced upon one side by Trina s wedding bouquet under a glass case preserved by some fearful unknown process and upon the other by the photograph of Trina and the dentist in their wedding finery This latter picture was quite an affair and had been taken immediately after the wedding while McTeague s broadcloth was still new and before Trina s silks and veil had lost their stiffness It represented Trina her veil thrown back sitting very straight in a rep armchair her elbows well in at her sides holding her bouquet of cut flowers directly before her The dentist stood at her side one hand on her shoulder the other thrust into the breast of his Prince Albert his chin in the air his eyes to one side his left foot forward in the attitude of a statue of a Secretary of State Say Trina said McTeague his mouth full of codfish Heise looked in on me this morning He says What s the matter with a basket picnic over at Schuetzen Park next Tuesday You know the paper hangers are going to be in the Parlors all that day so I ll have a holiday That s what made Heise think of it Heise says he ll get the Ryers to go too It s the anniversary of their wedding day We ll ask Selina to go she can meet us on the other side Come on let s go huh will you Trina still had her mania for family picnics which had been one of the Sieppes most cherished customs but now there were other considerations I don t know as we can afford it this month Mac she said pouring the chocolate I got to pay the gas bill next week and there s the papering of your office to be paid for some time I know I know answered her husband But I got a new patient this week had two molars and an upper incisor filled at the very first sitting and he s going to bring his children round He s a barber on the next block Well you pay half then said Trina It ll cost three or four dollars at the very least and mind the Heises pay their own fare both ways Mac and everybody gets their OWN lunch Yes she added after a pause I ll write and have Selina join us I haven t seen Selina in months I guess I ll have to put up a lunch for her though admitted Trina the way we did last time because she lives in a boarding house now and they make a fuss about putting up a lunch They could count on pleasant weather at this time of the year it was May and that particular Tuesday was all that could be desired The party assembled at the ferry slip at nine o clock laden with baskets The McTeagues came last of all Ryer and his wife had already boarded the boat They met the Heises in the waiting room Hello Doctor cried the harness maker as the McTeagues came up This is what you d call an old folks picnic all married people this time The party foregathered on the upper deck as the boat started and sat down to listen to the band of Italian musicians who were playing outside this morning because of the fineness of the weather Oh we re going to have lots of fun cried Trina If it s anything I do love it s a picnic Do you remember our first picnic Mac Sure sure replied the dentist we had a Gotha truffle And August lost his steamboat put in Trina and papa smacked him I remember it just as well Why look there said missus Heise nodding at a figure coming up the companion way Ain t that mister Schouler It was Marcus sure enough As he caught sight of the party he gaped at them a moment in blank astonishment and then ran up his eyes wide Well by damn he exclaimed excitedly What s up Where you all going anyhow Say ain t ut queer we should all run up against each other like this He made great sweeping bows to the three women and shook hands with Cousin Trina adding as he turned to the men of the party Glad to see you Mister Heise How do Mister Ryer The dentist who had formulated some sort of reserved greeting he ignored completely McTeague settled himself in his seat growling inarticulately behind his mustache Say say what s all up anyhow cried Marcus again It s a picnic exclaimed the three women all speaking at once and Trina added We re going over to the same old Schuetzen Park again But you re all fixed up yourself Cousin Mark you look as though you were going somewhere yourself In fact Marcus was dressed with great care He wore a new pair of slate blue trousers a black cutaway and a white lawn tie for him the symbol of the height of elegance He carried also his cane a thin wand of ebony with a gold head presented to him by the Improvement Club in recognition of services That s right that s right said Marcus with a grin I m takun a holiday myself to day I had a bit of business to do over at Oakland an I thought I d go up to B Street afterward and see Selina I haven t called on But the party uttered an exclamation Why Selina is going with us She s going to meet us at the Schuetzen Park station explained Trina Marcus s business in Oakland was a fiction He was crossing the bay that morning solely to see Selina Marcus had taken up with Selina a little after Trina had married and had been rushing her ever since dazzled and attracted by her accomplishments for which he pretended a great respect At the prospect of missing Selina on this occasion he was genuinely disappointed His vexation at once assumed the form of exasperation against McTeague It was all the dentist s fault Ah McTeague was coming between him and Selina now as he had come between him and Trina Best look out by damn how he monkeyed with him now Instantly his face flamed and he glanced over furiously at the dentist who catching his eye began again to mutter behind his mustache Well say began missus Ryer with some hesitation looking to Ryer for approval why can t Marcus come along with us Why of course exclaimed missus Heise disregarding her husband s vigorous nudges I guess we got lunch enough to go round all right don t you say so missus McTeague Thus appealed to Trina could only concur Why of course Cousin Mark she said of course come along with us if you want to Why you bet I will cried Marcus enthusiastic in an instant Say this is outa sight it is for a fact a picnic ah sure and we ll meet Selina at the station Just as the boat was passing Goat Island the harness maker proposed that the men of the party should go down to the bar on the lower deck and shake for the drinks The idea had an immediate success Have to see you on that said Ryer By damn we ll have a drink Yes sir we will for a fact Sure sure drinks that s the word At the bar Heise and Ryer ordered cocktails Marcus called for a creme Yvette in order to astonish the others The dentist spoke for a glass of beer Say look here suddenly exclaimed Heise as they took their glasses Look here you fellahs he had turned to Marcus and the dentist You two fellahs have had a grouch at each other for the last year or so now what s the matter with your shaking hands and calling quits McTeague was at once overcome with a great feeling of magnanimity He put out his great hand I got nothing against Marcus he growled Well I don t care if I shake admitted Marcus a little shamefacedly as their palms touched I guess that s all right That s the idea exclaimed Heise delighted at his success Come on boys now let s drink Their elbows crooked and they drank silently Their picnic that day was very jolly Nothing had changed at Schuetzen Park since the day of that other memorable Sieppe picnic four years previous After lunch the men took themselves off to the rifle range while Selina Trina and the other two women put away the dishes An hour later the men joined them in great spirits Ryer had won the impromptu match which they had arranged making quite a wonderful score which included three clean bulls eyes while McTeague had not been able even to hit the target itself Their shooting match had awakened a spirit of rivalry in the men and the rest of the afternoon was passed in athletic exercises between them The women sat on the slope of the grass their hats and gloves laid aside watching the men as they strove together Aroused by the little feminine cries of wonder and the clapping of their ungloved palms these latter began to show off at once They took off their coats and vests even their neckties and collars and worked themselves into a lather of perspiration for the sake of making an impression on their wives They ran hundred yard sprints on the cinder path and executed clumsy feats on the rings and on the parallel bars They even found a huge round stone on the beach and put the shot for a while As long as it was a question of agility Marcus was easily the best of the four but the dentist s enormous strength his crude untutored brute force was a matter of wonder for the entire party McTeague cracked English walnuts taken from the lunch baskets in the hollow of his arm and tossed the round stone a full five feet beyond their best mark Heise believed himself to be particularly strong in the wrists but the dentist using but one hand twisted a cane out of Heise s two with a wrench that all but sprained the harnessmaker s arm Then the dentist raised weights and chinned himself on the rings till they thought he would never tire His great success quite turned his head he strutted back and forth in front of the women his chest thrown out and his great mouth perpetually expanded in a triumphant grin As he felt his strength more and more he began to abuse it he domineered over the others gripping suddenly at their arms till they squirmed with pain and slapping Marcus on the back so that he gasped and gagged for breath The childish vanity of the great fellow was as undisguised as that of a schoolboy He began to tell of wonderful feats of strength he had accomplished when he was a young man Why at one time he had knocked down a half grown heifer with a blow of his fist between the eyes sure and the heifer had just stiffened out and trembled all over and died without getting up McTeague told this story again and yet again All through the afternoon he could be overheard relating the wonder to any one who would listen exaggerating the effect of his blow inventing terrific details Why the heifer had just frothed at the mouth and his eyes had rolled up ah sure his eyes rolled up just like that and the butcher had said his skull was all mashed in just all mashed in sure that s the word just as if from a sledge hammer Notwithstanding his reconciliation with the dentist on the boat Marcus s gorge rose within him at McTeague s boasting swagger When McTeague had slapped him on the back Marcus had retired to some little distance while he recovered his breath and glared at the dentist fiercely as he strode up and down glorying in the admiring glances of the women Ah one horse dentist he muttered between his teeth Ah zinc plugger cow killer I d like to show you once you overgrown mucker you you COW KILLER When he rejoined the group he found them preparing for a wrestling bout I tell you what said Heise we ll have a tournament Marcus and I will rastle and Doc and Ryer and then the winners will rastle each other The women clapped their hands excitedly This would be exciting Trina cried Better let me hold your money Mac and your keys so as you won t lose them out of your pockets The men gave their valuables into the keeping of their wives and promptly set to work The dentist thrust Ryer down without even changing his grip Marcus and the harness maker struggled together for a few moments till Heise all at once slipped on a bit of turf and fell backwards As they toppled over together Marcus writhed himself from under his opponent and as they reached the ground forced down first one shoulder and then the other All right all right panted the harness maker goodnaturedly I m down It s up to you and Doc now he added as he got to his feet The match between McTeague and Marcus promised to be interesting The dentist of course had an enormous advantage in point of strength but Marcus prided himself on his wrestling and knew something about strangle holds and half Nelsons The men drew back to allow them a free space as they faced each other while Trina and the other women rose to their feet in their excitement I bet Mac will throw him all the same said Trina All ready cried Ryer The dentist and Marcus stepped forward eyeing each other cautiously They circled around the impromptu ring Marcus watching eagerly for an opening He ground his teeth telling himself he would throw McTeague if it killed him Ah he d show him now Suddenly the two men caught at each other Marcus went to his knees The dentist threw his vast bulk on his adversary s shoulders and thrusting a huge palm against his face pushed him backwards and downwards It was out of the question to resist that enormous strength Marcus wrenched himself over and fell face downward on the ground McTeague rose on the instant with a great laugh of exultation You re down he exclaimed Marcus leaped to his feet Down nothing he vociferated with clenched fists Down nothing by damn You got to throw me so s my shoulders touch McTeague was stalking about swelling with pride Hoh you re down I threw you Didn t I throw him Trina Hoh you can t rastle ME Marcus capered with rage You didn t you didn t you didn t and you can t You got to give me another try The other men came crowding up Everybody was talking at once He s right You didn t throw him Both his shoulders at the same time Trina clapped and waved her hand at McTeague from where she stood on the little slope of lawn above the wrestlers Marcus broke through the group shaking all over with excitement and rage I tell you that ain t the WAY to rastle You ve got to throw a man so s his shoulders touch You got to give me another bout That s straight put in Heise both his shoulders down at the same time Try it again You and Schouler have another try McTeague was bewildered by so much simultaneous talk He could not make out what it was all about Could he have offended Marcus again What What Huh What is it he exclaimed in perplexity looking from one to the other Come on you must rastle me again shouted Marcus Sure sure cried the dentist I ll rastle you again I ll rastle everybody he cried suddenly struck with an idea Trina looked on in some apprehension Mark gets so mad she said half aloud Yes admitted Selina Mister Schouler s got an awful quick temper but he ain t afraid of anything All ready shouted Ryer This time Marcus was more careful Twice as McTeague rushed at him he slipped cleverly away But as the dentist came in a third time with his head bowed Marcus raising himself to his full height caught him with both arms around the neck The dentist gripped at him and rent away the sleeve of his shirt There was a great laugh Keep your shirt on cried missus Ryer The two men were grappling at each other wildly The party could hear them panting and grunting as they labored and struggled Their boots tore up great clods of turf Suddenly they came to the ground with a tremendous shock But even as they were in the act of falling Marcus like a very eel writhed in the dentist s clasp and fell upon his side McTeague crashed down upon him like the collapse of a felled ox Now you gotta turn him on his back shouted Heise to the dentist He ain t down if you don t With his huge salient chin digging into Marcus s shoulder the dentist heaved and tugged His face was flaming his huge shock of yellow hair fell over his forehead matted with sweat Marcus began to yield despite his frantic efforts One shoulder was down now the other began to go gradually gradually it was forced over The little audience held its breath in the suspense of the moment Selina broke the silence calling out shrilly Ain t Doctor McTeague just that strong Marcus heard it and his fury came instantly to a head Rage at his defeat at the hands of the dentist and before Selina s eyes the hate he still bore his old time pal and the impotent wrath of his own powerlessness were suddenly unleashed God damn you get off of me he cried under his breath spitting the words as a snake spits its venom The little audience uttered a cry With the oath Marcus had twisted his head and had bitten through the lobe of the dentist s ear There was a sudden flash of bright red blood Then followed a terrible scene The brute that in McTeague lay so close to the surface leaped instantly to life monstrous not to be resisted He sprang to his feet with a shrill and meaningless clamor totally unlike the ordinary bass of his speaking tones It was the hideous yelling of a hurt beast the squealing of a wounded elephant He framed no words in the rush of high pitched sound that issued from his wide open mouth there was nothing articulate It was something no longer human it was rather an echo from the jungle Sluggish enough and slow to anger on ordinary occasions McTeague when finally aroused became another man His rage was a kind of obsession an evil mania the drunkenness of passion the exalted and perverted fury of the Berserker blind and deaf a thing insensate As he rose he caught Marcus s wrist in both his hands He did not strike he did not know what he was doing His only idea was to batter the life out of the man before him to crush and annihilate him upon the instant Gripping his enemy in his enormous hands hard and knotted and covered with a stiff fell of yellow hair the hands of the old time car boy he swung him wide as a hammer thrower swings his hammer Marcus s feet flipped from the ground he spun through the air about McTeague as helpless as a bundle of clothes All at once there was a sharp snap almost like the report of a small pistol Then Marcus rolled over and over upon the ground as McTeague released his grip his arm the one the dentist had seized bending suddenly as though a third joint had formed between wrist and elbow The arm was broken But by this time every one was crying out at once Heise and Ryan ran in between the two men Selina turned her head away Trina was wringing her hands and crying in an agony of dread Oh stop them stop them Don t let them fight Oh it s too awful Here here Doc quit Don t make a fool of yourself cried Heise clinging to the dentist That s enough now LISTEN to me will you Oh Mac Mac cried Trina running to her husband Mac dear listen it s me it s Trina look at me you Get hold of his other arm will you Ryer panted Heise Quick Mac Mac cried Trina her arms about his neck For God s sake hold up Doc will you shouted the harness maker You don t want to kill him do you missus Ryer and Heise s lame wife were filling the air with their outcries Selina was giggling with hysteria Marcus terrified but too brave to run had picked up a jagged stone with his left hand and stood on the defensive His swollen right arm from which the shirt sleeve had been torn dangled at his side the back of the hand twisted where the palm should have been The shirt itself was a mass of grass stains and was spotted with the dentist s blood But McTeague in the centre of the group that struggled to hold him was nigh to madness The side of his face his neck and all the shoulder and breast of his shirt were covered with blood He had ceased to cry out but kept muttering between his gripped jaws as he labored to tear himself free of the retaining hands Ah I ll kill him Ah I ll kill him I ll kill him Damn you Heise he exclaimed suddenly trying to strike the harness maker let go of me will you Little by little they pacified him or rather for he paid but little attention to what was said to him his bestial fury lapsed by degrees He turned away and let fall his arms drawing long breaths and looking stupidly about him now searching helplessly upon the ground now gazing vaguely into the circle of faces about him His ear bled as though it would never stop Say Doctor asked Heise what s the best thing to do Huh answered McTeague What what do you mean What is it What ll we do to stop this bleeding here McTeague did not answer but looked intently at the blood stained bosom of his shirt Mac cried Trina her face close to his tell us something the best thing we can do to stop your ear bleeding Collodium said the dentist But we can t get to that right away we There s some ice in our lunch basket broke in Heise We brought it for the beer and take the napkins and make a bandage Ice muttered the dentist sure ice that s the word missus Heise and the Ryers were looking after Marcus s broken arm Selina sat on the slope of the grass gasping and sobbing Trina tore the napkins into strips and crushing some of the ice made a bandage for her husband s head The party resolved itself into two groups the Ryers and missus Heise bending over Marcus while the harness maker and Trina came and went about McTeague sitting on the ground his shirt a mere blur of red and white detaching itself violently from the background of pale green grass Between the two groups was the torn and trampled bit of turf the wrestling ring the picnic baskets together with empty beer bottles broken egg shells and discarded sardine tins were scattered here and there In the middle of the improvised wrestling ring the sleeve of Marcus s shirt fluttered occasionally in the sea breeze Nobody was paying any attention to Selina All at once she began to giggle hysterically again then cried out with a peal of laughter Oh what a way for our picnic to end CHAPTER twelve Now then Maria said Zerkow his cracked strained voice just rising above a whisper hitching his chair closer to the table now then my girl let s have it all over again Tell us about the gold plate the service Begin with There were over a hundred pieces and every one of them gold I don t know what you re talking about Zerkow answered Maria There never was no gold plate no gold service I guess you must have dreamed it Maria and the red headed Polish Jew had been married about a month after the McTeague s picnic which had ended in such lamentable fashion Zerkow had taken Maria home to his wretched hovel in the alley back of the flat and the flat had been obliged to get another maid of all work Time passed a month six months a whole year went by At length Maria gave birth to a child a wretched sickly child with not even strength enough nor wits enough to cry At the time of its birth Maria was out of her mind and continued in a state of dementia for nearly ten days She recovered just in time to make the arrangements for the baby s burial Neither Zerkow nor Maria was much affected by either the birth or the death of this little child Zerkow had welcomed it with pronounced disfavor since it had a mouth to be fed and wants to be provided for Maria was out of her head so much of the time that she could scarcely remember how it looked when alive The child was a mere incident in their lives a thing that had come undesired and had gone unregretted It had not even a name a strange hybrid little being come and gone within a fortnight s time yet combining in its puny little body the blood of the Hebrew the Pole and the Spaniard But the birth of this child had peculiar consequences Maria came out of her dementia and in a few days the household settled itself again to its sordid regime and Maria went about her duties as usual Then one evening about a week after the child s burial Zerkow had asked Maria to tell him the story of the famous service of gold plate for the hundredth time Zerkow had come to believe in this story infallibly He was immovably persuaded that at one time Maria or Maria s people had possessed these hundred golden dishes In his perverted mind the hallucination had developed still further Not only had that service of gold plate once existed but it existed now entire intact not a single burnished golden piece of it was missing It was somewhere somebody had it locked away in that leather trunk with its quilted lining and round brass locks It was to be searched for and secured to be fought for to be gained at all hazards Maria must know where it was by dint of questioning Zerkow would surely get the information from her Some day if only he was persistent he would hit upon the right combination of questions the right suggestion that would disentangle Maria s confused recollections Maria would tell him where the thing was kept was concealed was buried and he would go to that place and secure it and all that wonderful gold would be his forever and forever This service of plate had come to be Zerkow s mania On this particular evening about a week after the child s burial in the wretched back room of the Junk shop Zerkow had made Maria sit down to the table opposite him the whiskey bottle and the red glass tumbler with its broken base between them and had said Now then Maria tell us that story of the gold dishes again Maria stared at him an expression of perplexity coming into her face What gold dishes said she The ones your people used to own in Central America Come on Maria begin begin The Jew craned himself forward his lean fingers clawing eagerly at his lips What gold plate said Maria frowning at him as she drank her whiskey What gold plate I don know what you re talking about Zerkow Zerkow sat back in his chair staring at her Why your people s gold dishes what they used to eat off of You ve told me about it a hundred times You re crazy Zerkow said Maria Push the bottle here will you Come now insisted Zerkow sweating with desire come now my girl don t be a fool let s have it let s have it Begin now There were more n a hundred pieces and every one of em gold Oh YOU know come on come on I don t remember nothing of the kind protested Maria reaching for the bottle Zerkow snatched it from her You fool he wheezed trying to raise his broken voice to a shout You fool Don t you dare try an cheat ME or I ll DO for you You know about the gold plate and you know where it is Suddenly he pitched his voice at the prolonged rasping shout with which he made his street cry He rose to his feet his long prehensile fingers curled into fists He was menacing terrible in his rage He leaned over Maria his fists in her face I believe you ve got it he yelled I believe you ve got it an are hiding it from me Where is it where is it Is it here he rolled his eyes wildly about the room Hey hey he went on shaking Maria by the shoulders Where is it Is it here Tell me where it is Tell me or I ll do for you It ain t here cried Maria wrenching from him It ain t anywhere What gold plate What are you talking about I don t remember nothing about no gold plate at all No Maria did not remember The trouble and turmoil of her mind consequent upon the birth of her child seemed to have readjusted her disordered ideas upon this point Her mania had come to a crisis which in subsiding had cleared her brain of its one illusion She did not remember Or it was possible that the gold plate she had once remembered had had some foundation in fact that her recital of its splendors had been truth sound and sane It was possible that now her FORGETFULNESS of it was some form of brain trouble a relic of the dementia of childbirth At all events Maria did not remember the idea of the gold plate had passed entirely out of her mind and it was now Zerkow who labored under its hallucination It was now Zerkow the raker of the city s muck heap the searcher after gold that saw that wonderful service in the eye of his perverted mind It was he who could now describe it in a language almost eloquent Maria had been content merely to remember it but Zerkow s avarice goaded him to a belief that it was still in existence hid somewhere perhaps in that very house stowed away there by Maria For it stood to reason didn t it that Maria could not have described it with such wonderful accuracy and such careful detail unless she had seen it recently the day before perhaps or that very day or that very hour that very HOUR Look out for yourself he whispered hoarsely to his wife Look out for yourself my girl I ll hunt for it and hunt for it and hunt for it and some day I ll find it I will you ll see I ll find it I ll find it and if I don t I ll find a way that ll make you tell me where it is I ll make you speak believe me I will I will my girl trust me for that And at night Maria would sometimes wake to find Zerkow gone from the bed and would see him burrowing into some corner by the light of his dark lantern and would hear him mumbling to himself There were more n a hundred pieces and every one of em gold when the leather trunk was opened it fair dazzled your eyes why just that punchbowl was worth a fortune I guess solid solid heavy rich pure gold nothun but gold gold heaps and heaps of it what a glory I ll find it yet I ll find it It s here somewheres hid somewheres in this house At length his continued ill success began to exasperate him One day he took his whip from his junk wagon and thrashed Maria with it gasping the while Where is it you beast Where is it Tell me where it is I ll make you speak I don know I don know cried Maria dodging his blows I d tell you Zerkow if I knew but I don know nothing about it How can I tell you if I don know Then one evening matters reached a crisis Marcus Schouler was in his room the room in the flat just over McTeague s Parlors which he had always occupied It was between eleven and twelve o clock The vast house was quiet Polk Street outside was very still except for the occasional whirr and trundle of a passing cable car and the persistent calling of ducks and geese in the deserted market directly opposite Marcus was in his shirt sleeves perspiring and swearing with exertion as he tried to get all his belongings into an absurdly inadequate trunk The room was in great confusion It looked as though Marcus was about to move He stood in front of his trunk his precious silk hat in its hat box in his hand He was raging at the perverseness of a pair of boots that refused to fit in his trunk no matter how he arranged them I ve tried you SO and I ve tried you SO he exclaimed fiercely between his teeth and you won t go He began to swear horribly grabbing at the boots with his free hand Pretty soon I won t take you at all I won t for a fact He was interrupted by a rush of feet upon the back stairs and a clamorous pounding upon his door He opened it to let in Maria Macapa her hair dishevelled and her eyes starting with terror Oh MISTER Schouler she gasped lock the door quick Don t let him get me He s got a knife and he says sure he s going to do for me if I don t tell him where it is Who has What has Where is what shouted Marcus flaming with excitement upon the instant He opened the door and peered down the dark hall both fists clenched ready to fight he did not know whom and he did not know why It s Zerkow wailed Maria pulling him back into the room and bolting the door and he s got a knife as long as THAT Oh my Lord here he comes now Ain t that him Listen Zerkow was coming up the stairs calling for Maria Don t you let him get me will you Mister Schouler gasped Maria I ll break him in two shouted Marcus livid with rage Think I m afraid of his knife I know where you are cried Zerkow on the landing outside You re in Schouler s room What are you doing in Schouler s room at this time of night Come outa there you oughta be ashamed I ll do for you yet my girl Come outa there once an see if I don t I ll do for you myself you dirty Jew shouted Marcus unbolting the door and running out into the hall I want my wife exclaimed the Jew backing down the stairs What s she mean by running away from me and going into your room Look out he s got a knife cried Maria through the crack of the door Ah there you are Come outa that and come back home exclaimed Zerkow Get outa here yourself cried Marcus advancing on him angrily Get outa here Maria s gota come too Get outa here vociferated Marcus an put up that knife I see it you needn t try an hide it behind your leg Give it to me anyhow he shouted suddenly and before Zerkow was aware Marcus had wrenched it away Now get outa here Zerkow backed away peering and peeping over Marcus s shoulder I want Maria Get outa here Get along out or I ll PUT you out The street door closed The Jew was gone Huh snorted Marcus swelling with arrogance Huh Think I m afraid of his knife I ain t afraid of ANYBODY he shouted pointedly for McTeague and his wife roused by the clamor were peering over the banisters from the landing above Not of anybody repeated Marcus Maria came out into the hall Is he gone Is he sure gone What was the trouble inquired Marcus suddenly I woke up about an hour ago Maria explained and Zerkow wasn t in bed maybe he hadn t come to bed at all He was down on his knees by the sink and he d pried up some boards off the floor and was digging there He had his dark lantern He was digging with that knife I guess and all the time he kept mumbling to himself More n a hundred pieces an every one of em gold more n a hundred pieces an every one of em gold Then all of a sudden he caught sight of me I was sitting up in bed and he jumped up and came at me with his knife an he says Where is it Where is it I know you got it hid somewhere Where is it Tell me or I ll knife you I kind of fooled him and kept him off till I got my wrapper on an then I run out I didn t dare stay Well what did you tell him about your gold dishes for in the first place cried Marcus I never told him protested Maria with the greatest energy I never told him I never heard of any gold dishes I don know where he got the idea he must be crazy By this time Trina and McTeague Old Grannis and little Miss Baker all the lodgers on the upper floors of the flat had gathered about Maria Trina and the dentist who had gone to bed were partially dressed and Trina s enormous mane of black hair was hanging in two thick braids far down her back But late as it was Old Grannis and the retired dressmaker had still been up and about when Maria had aroused them Why Maria said Trina you always used to tell us about your gold dishes You said your folks used to have them Never never never exclaimed Maria vehemently You folks must all be crazy I never HEARD of any gold dishes Well spoke up Miss Baker you re a queer girl Maria that s all I can say She left the group and returned to her room Old Grannis watched her go from the corner of his eye and in a few moments followed her leaving the group as unnoticed as he had joined it By degrees the flat quieted down again Trina and McTeague returned to their rooms I guess I ll go back now said Maria He s all right now I ain t afraid of him so long as he ain t got his knife Well say Marcus called to her as she went down stairs if he gets funny again you just yell out I LL hear you I won t let him hurt you Marcus went into his room again and resumed his wrangle with the refractory boots His eye fell on Zerkow s knife a long keen bladed hunting knife with a buckhorn handle I ll take you along with me he exclaimed suddenly I ll just need you where I m going Meanwhile old Miss Baker was making tea to calm her nerves after the excitement of Maria s incursion This evening she went so far as to make tea for two laying an extra place on the other side of her little tea table setting out a cup and saucer and one of the Gorham silver spoons Close upon the other side of the partition Old Grannis bound uncut numbers of the Nation Do you know what I think Mac said Trina when the couple had returned to their rooms I think Marcus is going away What What muttered the dentist very sleepy and stupid what you saying What s that about Marcus I believe Marcus has been packing up the last two or three days I wonder if he s going away Who s going away said McTeague blinking at her Oh go to bed said Trina pushing him goodnaturedly Mac you re the stupidest man I ever knew But it was true Marcus was going away Trina received a letter the next morning from her mother The carpet cleaning and upholstery business in which mister Sieppe had involved himself was going from bad to worse mister Sieppe had even been obliged to put a mortgage upon their house missus Sieppe didn t know what was to become of them all Her husband had even begun to talk of emigrating to New Zealand Meanwhile she informed Trina that mister Sieppe had finally come across a man with whom Marcus could go in with on a ranch a cattle ranch in the southeastern portion of the State Her ideas were vague upon the subject but she knew that Marcus was wildly enthusiastic at the prospect and was expected down before the end of the month In the meantime could Trina send them fifty dollars Marcus IS going away after all Mac said Trina to her husband that day as he came out of his Parlors and sat down to the lunch of sausages mashed potatoes and chocolate in the sitting room Huh said the dentist a little confused Who s going away Schouler going away Why s Schouler going away Trina explained Oh growled McTeague behind his thick mustache he can go far before I LL stop him And say Mac continued Trina pouring the chocolate what do you think Mamma wants me wants us to send her fifty dollars She says they re hard up Well said the dentist after a moment well I guess we can send it can t we Oh that s easy to say complained Trina her little chin in the air her small pale lips pursed I wonder if mamma thinks we re millionaires Trina you re getting to be regular stingy muttered McTeague You re getting worse and worse every day But fifty dollars is fifty dollars Mac Just think how long it takes you to earn fifty dollars Fifty dollars That s two months of our interest Well said McTeague easily his mouth full of mashed potato you got a lot saved up Upon every reference to that little hoard in the brass match safe and chamois skin bag at the bottom of her trunk Trina bridled on the instant Don t TALK that way Mac A lot of money What do you call a lot of money I don t believe I ve got fifty dollars saved Hoh exclaimed McTeague Hoh I guess you got nearer a hundred AN fifty That s what I guess YOU got I ve NOT I ve NOT declared Trina and you know I ve not I wish mamma hadn t asked me for any money Why can t she be a little more economical I manage all right No no I can t possibly afford to send her fifty Oh pshaw What WILL you do then grumbled her husband I ll send her twenty five this month and tell her I ll send the rest as soon as I can afford it Trina you re a regular little miser said McTeague I don t care answered Trina beginning to laugh I guess I am but I can t help it and it s a good fault Trina put off sending this money for a couple of weeks and her mother made no mention of it in her next letter Oh I guess if she wants it so bad said Trina she ll speak about it again So she again postponed the sending of it Day by day she put it off When her mother asked her for it a second time it seemed harder than ever for Trina to part with even half the sum requested She answered her mother telling her that they were very hard up themselves for that month but that she would send down the amount in a few weeks I ll tell you what we ll do Mac she said to her husband you send half and I ll send half we ll send twenty five dollars altogether Twelve and a half apiece That s an idea How will that do Sure sure McTeague had answered giving her the money Trina sent McTeague s twelve dollars but never sent the twelve that was to be her share One day the dentist happened to ask her about it You sent that twenty five to your mother didn t you said he Oh long ago answered Trina without thinking In fact Trina never allowed herself to think very much of this affair And in fact another matter soon came to engross her attention One Sunday evening Trina and her husband were in their sitting room together It was dark but the lamp had not been lit McTeague had brought up some bottles of beer from the Wein Stube on the ground floor where the branch post office used to be But they had not opened the beer It was a warm evening in summer Trina was sitting on McTeague s lap in the bay window and had looped back the Nottingham curtains so the two could look out into the darkened street and watch the moon coming up over the glass roof of the huge public baths On occasions they sat like this for an hour or so philandering Trina cuddling herself down upon McTeague s enormous body rubbing her cheek against the grain of his unshaven chin kissing the bald spot on the top of his head or putting her fingers into his ears and eyes At times a brusque access of passion would seize upon her and with a nervous little sigh she would clasp his thick red neck in both her small arms and whisper in his ear Do you love me Mac dear Love me BIG BIG Sure do you love me as much as you did when we were married Puzzled McTeague would answer Well you know it don t you Trina But I want you to SAY so say so always and always Well I do of course I do Say it then Well then I love you But you don t say it of your own accord Well what what what I don t understand stammered the dentist bewildered There was a knock on the door Confused and embarrassed as if they were not married Trina scrambled off McTeague s lap hastening to light the lamp whispering Put on your coat Mac and smooth your hair and making gestures for him to put the beer bottles out of sight She opened the door and uttered an exclamation Why Cousin Mark she said McTeague glared at him struck speechless confused beyond expression Marcus Schouler perfectly at his ease stood in the doorway smiling with great affability Say he remarked can I come in Taken all aback Trina could only answer Why I suppose so Yes of course come in Yes yes come in exclaimed the dentist suddenly speaking without thought Have some beer he added struck with an idea No thanks Doctor said Marcus pleasantly McTeague and Trina were puzzled What could it all mean Did Marcus want to become reconciled to his enemy I know Trina said to herself He s going away and he wants to borrow some money He won t get a penny not a penny She set her teeth together hard Well said Marcus how s business Doctor Oh said McTeague uneasily oh I don know I guess I guess he broke off in helpless embarrassment They had all sat down by now Marcus continued holding his hat and his cane the black wand of ebony with the gold top presented to him by the Improvement Club Ah said he wagging his head and looking about the sitting room you people have got the best fixed rooms in the whole flat Yes sir you have for a fact He glanced from the lithograph framed in gilt and red plush the two little girls at their prayers to the I m Grandpa and I m Grandma pictures noted the clean white matting and the gay worsted tidies over the chair backs and appeared to contemplate in ecstasy the framed photograph of McTeague and Trina in their wedding finery Well you two are pretty happy together ain t you said he smiling good humoredly Oh we don t complain answered Trina Plenty of money lots to do everything fine hey We ve got lots to do returned Trina thinking to head him off but we ve not got lots of money But evidently Marcus wanted no money Well Cousin Trina he said rubbing his knee I m going away Yes mamma wrote me you re going on a ranch I m going in ranching with an English duck corrected Marcus mister Sieppe has fixed things We ll see if we can t raise some cattle I know a lot about horses and he s ranched some before this English duck And then I m going to keep my eye open for a political chance down there I got some introductions from the President of the Improvement Club I ll work things somehow oh sure How long you going to be gone asked Trina Marcus stared Why I ain t EVER coming back he vociferated I m going to morrow and I m going for good I come to say good by Marcus stayed for upwards of an hour that evening He talked on easily and agreeably addressing himself as much to McTeague as to Trina At last he rose Well good by Doc Good by Marcus returned McTeague The two shook hands Guess we won t ever see each other again continued Marcus But good luck to you Doc Hope some day you ll have the patients standing in line on the stairs Huh I guess so I guess so said the dentist Good by Cousin Trina Good by Marcus answered Trina You be sure to remember me to mamma and papa and everybody I m going to make two great big sets of Noah s ark animals for the twins on their next birthday August is too old for toys But you can tell the twins that I ll make them some great big animals Good by success to you Marcus Good by good by Good luck to you both Good by Cousin Mark Good by Marcus He was gone CHAPTER thirteen One morning about a week after Marcus had left for the southern part of the State McTeague found an oblong letter thrust through the letter drop of the door of his Parlors The address was typewritten He opened it The letter had been sent from the City Hall and was stamped in one corner with the seal of the State of California very official the form and file numbers superscribed McTeague had been making fillings when this letter arrived He was in his Parlors pottering over his movable rack underneath the bird cage in the bay window He was making blocks to be used in large proximal cavities and cylinders for commencing fillings He heard the postman s step in the hall and saw the envelopes begin to shuttle themselves through the slit of his letter drop Then came the fat oblong envelope with its official seal that dropped flatwise to the floor with a sodden dull impact The dentist put down the broach and scissors and gathered up his mail There were four letters altogether One was for Trina in Selina s elegant handwriting another was an advertisement of a new kind of operating chair for dentists the third was a card from a milliner on the next block announcing an opening and the fourth contained in the fat oblong envelope was a printed form with blanks left for names and dates and addressed to McTeague from an office in the City Hall McTeague read it through laboriously I don know I don know he muttered looking stupidly at the rifle manufacturer s calendar Then he heard Trina from the kitchen singing as she made a clattering noise with the breakfast dishes I guess I ll ask Trina about it he muttered He went through the suite by the sitting room where the sun was pouring in through the looped backed Nottingham curtains upon the clean white matting and the varnished surface of the melodeon passed on through the bedroom with its framed lithographs of round cheeked English babies and alert fox terriers and came out into the brick paved kitchen The kitchen was clean as a new whistle the freshly blackened cook stove glowed like a negro s hide the tins and porcelain lined stew pans might have been of silver and of ivory Trina was in the centre of the room wiping off with a damp sponge the oilcloth table cover on which they had breakfasted Never had she looked so pretty Early though it was her enormous tiara of swarthy hair was neatly combed and coiled not a pin was so much as loose She wore a blue calico skirt with a white figure and a belt of imitation alligator skin clasped around her small firmly corseted waist her shirt waist was of pink linen so new and crisp that it crackled with every movement while around the collar tied in a neat knot was one of McTeague s lawn ties which she had appropriated Her sleeves were carefully rolled up almost to her shoulders and nothing could have been more delicious than the sight of her small round arms white as milk moving back and forth as she sponged the table cover a faint touch of pink coming and going at the elbows as they bent and straightened She looked up quickly as her husband entered her narrow eyes alight her adorable little chin in the air her lips rounded and opened with the last words of her song so that one could catch a glint of gold in the fillings of her upper teeth The whole scene the clean kitchen and its clean brick floor the smell of coffee that lingered in the air Trina herself fresh as if from a bath and singing at her work the morning sun striking obliquely through the white muslin half curtain of the window and spanning the little kitchen with a bridge of golden mist gave off as it were a note of gayety that was not to be resisted Through the opened top of the window came the noises of Polk Street already long awake One heard the chanting of street cries the shrill calling of children on their way to school the merry rattle of a butcher s cart the brisk noise of hammering or the occasional prolonged roll of a cable car trundling heavily past with a vibrant whirring of its jostled glass and the joyous clanging of its bells What is it Mac dear said Trina McTeague shut the door behind him with his heel and handed her the letter Trina read it through Then suddenly her small hand gripped tightly upon the sponge so that the water started from it and dripped in a little pattering deluge upon the bricks The letter or rather printed notice informed McTeague that he had never received a diploma from a dental college and that in consequence he was forbidden to practise his profession any longer A legal extract bearing upon the case was attached in small type Why what s all this said Trina calmly without thought as yet I don know I don know answered her husband You can t practise any longer continued Trina is herewith prohibited and enjoined from further continuing She re read the extract her forehead lifting and puckering She put the sponge carefully away in its wire rack over the sink and drew up a chair to the table spreading out the notice before her Sit down she said to McTeague Draw up to the table here Mac and let s see what this is I got it this morning murmured the dentist It just now came I was making some fillings there in the Parlors in the window and the postman shoved it through the door I thought it was a number of the American System of Dentistry at first and when I d opened it and looked at it I thought I d better Say Mac interrupted Trina looking up from the notice DIDN T you ever go to a dental college Huh What What exclaimed McTeague How did you learn to be a dentist Did you go to a college I went along with a fellow who came to the mine once My mother sent me We used to go from one camp to another I sharpened his excavators for him and put up his notices in the towns stuck them up in the post offices and on the doors of the Odd Fellows halls He had a wagon But didn t you never go to a college Huh What College No I never went I learned from the fellow Trina rolled down her sleeves She was a little paler than usual She fastened the buttons into the cuffs and said But do you know you can t practise unless you re graduated from a college You haven t the right to call yourself doctor McTeague stared a moment then Why I ve been practising ten years More nearly twelve But it s the law What s the law That you can t practise or call yourself doctor unless you ve got a diploma What s that a diploma I don t know exactly It s a kind of paper that that oh Mac we re ruined Trina s voice rose to a cry What do you mean Trina Ain t I a dentist Ain t I a doctor Look at my sign and the gold tooth you gave me Why I ve been practising nearly twelve years Trina shut her lips tightly cleared her throat and pretended to resettle a hair pin at the back of her head I guess it isn t as bad as that she said very quietly Let s read this again Herewith prohibited and enjoined from further continuing She read to the end Why it isn t possible she cried They can t mean oh Mac I do believe pshaw she exclaimed her pale face flushing They don t know how good a dentist you are What difference does a diploma make if you re a first class dentist I guess that s all right Mac didn t you ever go to a dental college No answered McTeague doggedly What was the good I learned how to operate wa n t that enough Hark said Trina suddenly Wasn t that the bell of your office They had both heard the jangling of the bell that McTeague had hung over the door of his Parlors The dentist looked at the kitchen clock That s Vanovitch said he He s a plumber round on Sutter Street He s got an appointment with me to have a bicuspid pulled I got to go back to work He rose But you can t cried Trina the back of her hand upon her lips her eyes brimming Mac don t you see Can t you understand You ve got to stop Oh it s dreadful Listen She hurried around the table to him and caught his arm in both her hands Huh growled McTeague looking at her with a puzzled frown They ll arrest you You ll go to prison You can t work can t work any more We re ruined Vanovitch was pounding on the door of the sitting room He ll be gone in a minute exclaimed McTeague Well let him go Tell him to go tell him to come again Why he s got an APPOINTMENT with me exclaimed McTeague his hand upon the door Trina caught him back But Mac you ain t a dentist any longer you ain t a doctor You haven t the right to work You never went to a dental college Well suppose I never went to a college ain t I a dentist just the same Listen he s pounding there again No I m going sure Well of course go said Trina with sudden reaction It ain t possible they ll make you stop If you re a good dentist that s all that s wanted Go on Mac hurry before he goes McTeague went out closing the door Trina stood for a moment looking intently at the bricks at her feet Then she returned to the table and sat down again before the notice and resting her head in both her fists read it yet another time Suddenly the conviction seized upon her that it was all true McTeague would be obliged to stop work no matter how good a dentist he was But why had the authorities at the City Hall waited this long before serving the notice All at once Trina snapped her fingers with a quick flash of intelligence It s Marcus that s done it she cried It was like a clap of thunder McTeague was stunned stupefied He said nothing Never in his life had he been so taciturn At times he did not seem to hear Trina when she spoke to him and often she had to shake him by the shoulder to arouse his attention He would sit apart in his Parlors turning the notice about in his enormous clumsy fingers reading it stupidly over and over again He couldn t understand What had a clerk at the City Hall to do with him Why couldn t they let him alone Oh what s to become of us NOW wailed Trina What s to become of us now We re paupers beggars and all so sudden And once in a quick inexplicable fury totally unlike anything that McTeague had noticed in her before she had started up with fists and teeth shut tight and had cried Oh if you d only KILLED Marcus Schouler that time he fought you McTeague had continued his work acting from sheer force of habit his sluggish deliberate nature methodical obstinate refusing to adapt itself to the new conditions Maybe Marcus was only trying to scare us Trina had said How are they going to know whether you re practising or not I got a mould to make to morrow McTeague said and Vanovitch that plumber round on Sutter Street he s coming again at three Well you go right ahead Trina told him decisively you go right ahead and make the mould and pull every tooth in Vanovitch s head if you want to Who s going to know Maybe they just sent that notice as a matter of form Maybe Marcus got that paper and filled it in himself The two would lie awake all night long staring up into the dark talking talking talking Haven t you got any right to practise if you ve not been to a dental college Mac Didn t you ever go Trina would ask again and again No no answered the dentist I never went I learnt from the fellow I was apprenticed to I don know anything about a dental college Ain t I got a right to do as I like he suddenly exclaimed If you know your profession isn t that enough cried Trina Sure sure growled McTeague I ain t going to stop for them You go right on Trina said and I bet you won t hear another word about it Suppose I go round to the City Hall and see them hazarded McTeague No no don t you do it Mac exclaimed Trina Because if Marcus has done this just to scare you they won t know anything about it there at the City Hall but they ll begin to ask you questions and find out that you never HAD graduated from a dental college and you d be just as bad off as ever Well I ain t going to quit for just a piece of paper declared the dentist The phrase stuck to him All day long he went about their rooms or continued at his work in the Parlors growling behind his thick mustache I ain t going to quit for just a piece of paper No I ain t going to quit for just a piece of paper Sure not The days passed a week went by McTeague continued his work as usual They heard no more from the City Hall but the suspense of the situation was harrowing Trina was actually sick with it The terror of the thing was ever at their elbows going to bed with them sitting down with them at breakfast in the kitchen keeping them company all through the day Trina dared not think of what would be their fate if the income derived from McTeague s practice was suddenly taken from them Then they would have to fall back on the interest of her lottery money and the pittance she derived from the manufacture of the Noah s ark animals a little over thirty dollars a month No no it was not to be thought of It could not be that their means of livelihood was to be thus stricken from them A fortnight went by I guess we re all right Mac Trina allowed herself to say It looks as though we were all right How are they going to tell whether you re practising or not That day a second and much more peremptory notice was served upon McTeague by an official in person Then suddenly Trina was seized with a panic terror unreasoned instinctive If McTeague persisted they would both be sent to a prison she was sure of it a place where people were chained to the wall in the dark and fed on bread and water Oh Mac you ve got to quit she wailed You can t go on They can make you stop Oh why didn t you go to a dental college Why didn t you find out that you had to have a college degree And now we re paupers beggars We ve got to leave here leave this flat where I ve been where WE VE been so happy and sell all the pretty things sell the pictures and the melodeon and Oh it s too dreadful Huh Huh What What exclaimed the dentist bewildered I ain t going to quit for just a piece of paper Let them put me out I ll show them They they can t make small of me Oh that s all very fine to talk that way but you ll have to quit Well we ain t paupers McTeague suddenly exclaimed an idea entering his mind We ve got our money yet You ve got your five thousand dollars and the money you ve been saving up People ain t paupers when they ve got over five thousand dollars What do you mean Mac cried Trina apprehensively Well we can live on THAT money until until until he broke off with an uncertain movement of his shoulders looking about him stupidly Until WHEN cried Trina There ain t ever going to be any until We ve got the INTEREST of that five thousand and we ve got what Uncle Oelbermann gives me a little over thirty dollars a month and that s all we ve got You ll have to find something else to do What will I find to do What indeed McTeague was over thirty now sluggish and slow witted at best What new trade could he learn at this age Little by little Trina made the dentist understand the calamity that had befallen them and McTeague at last began cancelling his appointments Trina gave it out that he was sick Not a soul need know what s happened to us she said to her husband But it was only by slow degrees that McTeague abandoned his profession Every morning after breakfast he would go into his Parlors as usual and potter about his instruments his dental engine and his washstand in the corner behind his screen where he made his moulds Now he would sharpen a hoe excavator now he would busy himself for a whole hour making mats and cylinders Then he would look over his slate where he kept a record of his appointments One day Trina softly opened the door of the Parlors and came in from the sitting room She had not heard McTeague moving about for some time and had begun to wonder what he was doing She came in quietly shutting the door behind her McTeague had tidied the room with the greatest care The volumes of the Practical Dentist and the American System of Dentistry were piled upon the marble top centre table in rectangular blocks The few chairs were drawn up against the wall under the steel engraving of Lorenzo de Medici with more than usual precision The dental engine and the nickelled trimmings of the operating chair had been furbished till they shone while on the movable rack in the bay window McTeague had arranged his instruments with the greatest neatness and regularity Hoe excavators pluggers forceps pliers corundum disks and burrs even the boxwood mallet that Trina was never to use again all were laid out and ready for immediate use McTeague himself sat in his operating chair looking stupidly out of the windows across the roofs opposite with an unseeing gaze his red hands lying idly in his lap Trina came up to him There was something in his eyes that made her put both arms around his neck and lay his huge head with its coarse blond hair upon her shoulder I I got everything fixed he said I got everything fixed an ready See everything ready an waiting an an an nobody comes an nobody s ever going to come any more Oh Trina He put his arms about her and drew her down closer to him Never mind dear never mind cried Trina through her tears It ll all come right in the end and we ll be poor together if we have to You can sure find something else to do We ll start in again Look at the slate there said McTeague pulling away from her and reaching down the slate on which he kept a record of his appointments Look at them There s Vanovitch at two on Wednesday and Loughhead s wife Thursday morning and Heise s little girl Thursday afternoon at one thirty missus Watson on Friday and Vanovitch again Saturday morning early at seven That s what I was to have had and they ain t going to come They ain t ever going to come any more Trina took the little slate from him and looked at it ruefully Rub them out she said her voice trembling rub it all out and as she spoke her eyes brimmed again and a great tear dropped on the slate That s it she said that s the way to rub it out by me crying on it Then she passed her fingers over the tear blurred writing and washed the slate clean All gone all gone she said All gone echoed the dentist There was a silence Then McTeague heaved himself up to his full six feet two his face purpling his enormous mallet like fists raised over his head His massive jaw protruded more than ever while his teeth clicked and grated together then he growled If ever I meet Marcus Schouler he broke off abruptly the white of his eyes growing suddenly pink Oh if ever you DO exclaimed Trina catching her breath CHAPTER fourteen Well what do you think said Trina She and McTeague stood in a tiny room at the back of the flat and on its very top floor The room was whitewashed It contained a bed three cane seated chairs and a wooden washstand with its washbowl and pitcher From its single uncurtained window one looked down into the flat s dirty back yard and upon the roofs of the hovels that bordered the alley in the rear There was a rag carpet on the floor In place of a closet some dozen wooden pegs were affixed to the wall over the washstand There was a smell of cheap soap and of ancient hair oil in the air That s a single bed said Trina but the landlady says she ll put in a double one for us You see I ain t going to live here growled McTeague Well you ve got to live somewhere said Trina impatiently We ve looked Polk Street over and this is the only thing we can afford Afford afford muttered the dentist You with your five thousand dollars and the two or three hundred you got saved up talking about afford You make me sick Now Mac exclaimed Trina deliberately sitting down in one of the cane seated chairs now Mac let s have this thing Well I don t figure on living in one room growled the dentist sullenly Let s live decently until we can get a fresh start We ve got the money Who s got the money WE VE got it We Well it s all in the family What s yours is mine and what s mine is yours ain t it No it s not no it s not cried Trina vehemently It s all mine mine There s not a penny of it belongs to anybody else I don t like to have to talk this way to you but you just make me We re not going to touch a penny of my five thousand nor a penny of that little money I managed to save that seventy five That TWO hundred you mean That SEVENTY FIVE We re just going to live on the interest of that and on what I earn from Uncle Oelbermann on just that thirty one or two dollars Huh Think I m going to do that an live in such a room as this Trina folded her arms and looked him squarely in the face Well what ARE you going to do then Huh I say what ARE you going to do You can go on and find something to do and earn some more money and THEN we ll talk Well I ain t going to live here Oh very well suit yourself I M going to live here You ll live where I TELL you the dentist suddenly cried exasperated at the mincing tone she affected Then YOU LL pay the rent exclaimed Trina quite as angry as he Are you my boss I d like to know Who s the boss you or I Who s got the MONEY I d like to know cried Trina flushing to her pale lips Answer me that McTeague who s got the money You make me sick you and your money Why you re a miser I never saw anything like it When I was practising I never thought of my fees as my own we lumped everything in together Exactly and I M doing the working now I m working for Uncle Oelbermann and you re not lumping in ANYTHING now I m doing it all Do you know what I m doing McTeague I m supporting you Ah shut up you make me sick You got no RIGHT to talk to me that way I won t let you I I won t have it She caught her breath Tears were in her eyes Oh live where you like then said McTeague sullenly Well shall we take this room then All right we ll take it But why can t you take a little of your money an an sort of fix it up Not a penny not a single penny Oh I don t care WHAT you do And for the rest of the day the dentist and his wife did not speak This was not the only quarrel they had during these days when they were occupied in moving from their suite and in looking for new quarters Every hour the question of money came up Trina had become more niggardly than ever since the loss of McTeague s practice It was not mere economy with her now It was a panic terror lest a fraction of a cent of her little savings should be touched a passionate eagerness to continue to save in spite of all that had happened Trina could have easily afforded better quarters than the single whitewashed room at the top of the flat but she made McTeague believe that it was impossible I can still save a little she said to herself after the room had been engaged perhaps almost as much as ever I ll have three hundred dollars pretty soon and Mac thinks it s only two hundred It s almost two hundred and fifty and I ll get a good deal out of the sale But this sale was a long agony It lasted a week Everything went everything but the few big pieces that went with the suite and that belonged to the photographer The melodeon the chairs the black walnut table before which they were married the extension table in the sitting room the kitchen table with its oilcloth cover the framed lithographs from the English illustrated papers the very carpets on the floors But Trina s heart nearly broke when the kitchen utensils and furnishings began to go Every pot every stewpan every knife and fork was an old friend How she had worked over them How clean she had kept them What a pleasure it had been to invade that little brick paved kitchen every morning and to wash up and put to rights after breakfast turning on the hot water at the sink raking down the ashes in the cook stove going and coming over the warm bricks her head in the air singing at her work proud in the sense of her proprietorship and her independence How happy had she been the day after her marriage when she had first entered that kitchen and knew that it was all her own And how well she remembered her raids upon the bargain counters in the house furnishing departments of the great down town stores And now it was all to go Some one else would have it all while she was relegated to cheap restaurants and meals cooked by hired servants Night after night she sobbed herself to sleep at the thought of her past happiness and her present wretchedness However she was not alone in her unhappiness Anyhow I m going to keep the steel engraving an the stone pug dog declared the dentist his fist clenching When it had come to the sale of his office effects McTeague had rebelled with the instinctive obstinacy of a boy shutting his eyes and ears Only little by little did Trina induce him to part with his office furniture He fought over every article over the little iron stove the bed lounge the marble topped centre table the whatnot in the corner the bound volumes of Allen s Practical Dentist the rifle manufacturer s calendar and the prim military chairs A veritable scene took place between him and his wife before he could bring himself to part with the steel engraving of Lorenzo de Medici and His Court and the stone pug dog with its goggle eyes Why he would cry I ve had em ever since ever since I BEGAN long before I knew you Trina That steel engraving I bought in Sacramento one day when it was raining I saw it in the window of a second hand store and a fellow GAVE me that stone pug dog He was a druggist It was in Sacramento too We traded I gave him a shaving mug and a razor and he gave me the pug dog There were however two of his belongings that even Trina could not induce him to part with And your concertina Mac she prompted as they were making out the list for the second hand dealer The concertina and oh yes the canary and the bird cage No Mac you MUST be reasonable The concertina would bring quite a sum and the bird cage is as good as new I ll sell the canary to the bird store man on Kearney Street No If you re going to make objections to every single thing we might as well quit Come now Mac the concertina and the bird cage We ll put them in Lot D No You ll have to come to it sooner or later I M giving up everything I m going to put them down see No And she could get no further than that The dentist did not lose his temper as in the case of the steel engraving or the stone pug dog he simply opposed her entreaties and persuasions with a passive inert obstinacy that nothing could move In the end Trina was obliged to submit McTeague kept his concertina and his canary even going so far as to put them both away in the bedroom attaching to them tags on which he had scrawled in immense round letters Not for Sale One evening during that same week the dentist and his wife were in the dismantled sitting room The room presented the appearance of a wreck The Nottingham lace curtains were down The extension table was heaped high with dishes with tea and coffee pots and with baskets of spoons and knives and forks The melodeon was hauled out into the middle of the floor and covered with a sheet marked Lot A the pictures were in a pile in a corner the chenille portieres were folded on top of the black walnut table The room was desolate lamentable Trina was going over the inventory McTeague in his shirt sleeves was smoking his pipe looking stupidly out of the window All at once there was a brisk rapping at the door Come in called Trina apprehensively Now a days at every unexpected visit she anticipated a fresh calamity The door opened to let in a young man wearing a checked suit a gay cravat and a marvellously figured waistcoat Trina and McTeague recognized him at once It was the Other Dentist the debonair fellow whose clients were the barbers and the young women of the candy stores and soda water fountains the poser the wearer of waistcoats who bet money on greyhound races How do said this one bowing gracefully to the McTeagues as they stared at him distrustfully How do They tell me Doctor that you are going out of the profession McTeague muttered indistinctly behind his mustache and glowered at him Well say continued the other cheerily I d like to talk business with you That sign of yours that big golden tooth that you got outside of your window I don t suppose you ll have any further use for it Maybe I d buy it if we could agree on terms Trina shot a glance at her husband McTeague began to glower again What do you say said the Other Dentist I guess not growled McTeague What do you say to ten dollars Ten dollars cried Trina her chin in the air Well what figure DO you put on it Trina was about to answer when she was interrupted by McTeague You go out of here Hey What You go out of here The other retreated toward the door You can t make small of me Go out of here McTeague came forward a step his great red fist clenching The young man fled But half way down the stairs he paused long enough to call back You don t want to trade anything for a diploma do you McTeague and his wife exchanged looks How did he know exclaimed Trina sharply They had invented and spread the fiction that McTeague was merely retiring from business without assigning any reason But evidently every one knew the real cause The humiliation was complete now Old Miss Baker confirmed their suspicions on this point the next day The little retired dressmaker came down and wept with Trina over her misfortune and did what she could to encourage her But she too knew that McTeague had been forbidden by the authorities from practising Marcus had evidently left them no loophole of escape It s just like cutting off your husband s hands my dear said Miss Baker And you two were so happy When I first saw you together I said What a pair Old Grannis also called during this period of the breaking up of the McTeague household Dreadful dreadful murmured the old Englishman his hand going tremulously to his chin It seems unjust it does But mister Schouler could not have set them on to do it I can t quite believe it of him Of Marcus cried Trina Hoh Why he threw his knife at Mac one time and another time he bit him actually bit him with his teeth while they were wrestling just for fun Marcus would do anything to injure Mac Dear dear returned Old Grannis genuinely pained I had always believed Schouler to be such a good fellow That s because you re so good yourself mister Grannis responded Trina I tell you what Doc declared Heise the harness maker shaking his finger impressively at the dentist you must fight it you must appeal to the courts you ve been practising too long to be debarred now The statute of limitations you know No no Trina had exclaimed when the dentist had repeated this advice to her No no don t go near the law courts I know them The lawyers take all your money and you lose your case We re bad off as it is without lawing about it Then at last came the sale McTeague and Trina whom Miss Baker had invited to her room for that day sat there side by side holding each other s hands listening nervously to the turmoil that rose to them from the direction of their suite From nine o clock till dark the crowds came and went All Polk Street seemed to have invaded the suite lured on by the red flag that waved from the front windows It was a fete a veritable holiday for the whole neighborhood People with no thought of buying presented themselves Young women the candy store girls and florist s apprentices came to see the fun walking arm in arm from room to room making jokes about the pretty lithographs and mimicking the picture of the two little girls saying their prayers Look here they would cry look here what she used for curtains NOTTINGHAM lace actually Whoever thinks of buying Nottingham lace now a days Say don t that JAR you And a melodeon another one would exclaim lifting the sheet A melodeon when you can rent a piano for a dollar a week and say I really believe they used to eat in the kitchen Dollarn half dollarn half dollarn half give me two intoned the auctioneer from the second hand store By noon the crowd became a jam Wagons backed up to the curb outside and departed heavily laden In all directions people could be seen going away from the house carrying small articles of furniture a clock a water pitcher a towel rack Every now and then old Miss Baker who had gone below to see how things were progressing returned with reports of the foray missus Heise bought the chenille portieres Mister Ryer made a bid for your bed but a man in a gray coat bid over him It was knocked down for three dollars and a half The German shoe maker on the next block bought the stone pug dog I saw our postman going away with a lot of the pictures Zerkow has come on my word the rags bottles sacks man he s buying lots he bought all Doctor McTeague s gold tape and some of the instruments Maria s there too That dentist on the corner took the dental engine and wanted to get the sign the big gold tooth and so on and so on Cruelest of all however at least to Trina was when Miss Baker herself began to buy unable to resist a bargain The last time she came up she carried a bundle of the gay tidies that used to hang over the chair backs He offered them three for a nickel she explained to Trina and I thought I d spend just a quarter You don t mind now do you missus McTeague Why no of course not Miss Baker answered Trina bravely They ll look very pretty on some of my chairs went on the little old dressmaker innocently See She spread one of them on a chair back for inspection Trina s chin quivered Oh VERY pretty she answered At length that dreadful day was over The crowd dispersed Even the auctioneer went at last and as he closed the door with a bang the reverberation that went through the suite gave evidence of its emptiness Come said Trina to the dentist let s go down and look take a last look They went out of Miss Baker s room and descended to the floor below On the stairs however they were met by Old Grannis In his hands he carried a little package Was it possible that he too had taken advantage of their misfortunes to join in the raid upon the suite I went in he began timidly for for a few moments This he indicated the little package he carried this was put up It was of no value but to you I I ventured to bid it in I thought perhaps his hand went to his chin that you wouldn t mind that in fact I bought it for you as a present Will you take it He handed the package to Trina and hurried on Trina tore off the wrappings It was the framed photograph of McTeague and his wife in their wedding finery the one that had been taken immediately after the marriage It represented Trina sitting very erect in a rep armchair holding her wedding bouquet straight before her McTeague standing at her side his left foot forward one hand upon her shoulder and the other thrust into the breast of his Prince Albert coat in the attitude of a statue of a Secretary of State Oh it WAS good of him it WAS good of him cried Trina her eyes filling again I had forgotten to put it away Of course it was not for sale They went on down the stairs and arriving at the door of the sitting room opened it and looked in It was late in the afternoon and there was just light enough for the dentist and his wife to see the results of that day of sale Nothing was left not even the carpet It was a pillage a devastation the barrenness of a field after the passage of a swarm of locusts The room had been picked and stripped till only the bare walls and floor remained Here where they had been married where the wedding supper had taken place where Trina had bade farewell to her father and mother here where she had spent those first few hard months of her married life where afterward she had grown to be happy and contented where she had passed the long hours of the afternoon at her work of whittling and where she and her husband had spent so many evenings looking out of the window before the lamp was lit here in what had been her home nothing was left but echoes and the emptiness of complete desolation Only one thing remained On the wall between the windows in its oval glass frame preserved by some unknown and fearful process a melancholy relic of a vanished happiness unsold neglected and forgotten a thing that nobody wanted hung Trina s wedding bouquet CHAPTER fifteen Then the grind began It would have been easier for the McTeagues to have faced their misfortunes had they befallen them immediately after their marriage when their love for each other was fresh and fine and when they could have found a certain happiness in helping each other and sharing each other s privations Trina no doubt loved her husband more than ever in the sense that she felt she belonged to him But McTeague s affection for his wife was dwindling a little every day HAD been dwindling for a long time in fact He had become used to her by now She was part of the order of the things with which he found himself surrounded He saw nothing extraordinary about her it was no longer a pleasure for him to kiss her and take her in his arms she was merely his wife He did not dislike her he did not love her She was his wife that was all But he sadly missed and regretted all those little animal comforts which in the old prosperous life Trina had managed to find for him He missed the cabbage soups and steaming chocolate that Trina had taught him to like he missed his good tobacco that Trina had educated him to prefer he missed the Sunday afternoon walks that she had caused him to substitute in place of his nap in the operating chair and he missed the bottled beer that she had induced him to drink in place of the steam beer from Frenna s In the end he grew morose and sulky and sometimes neglected to answer his wife when she spoke to him Besides this Trina s avarice was a perpetual annoyance to him Oftentimes when a considerable alleviation of this unhappiness could have been obtained at the expense of a nickel or a dime Trina refused the money with a pettishness that was exasperating No no she would exclaim To ride to the park Sunday afternoon that means ten cents and I can t afford it Let s walk there then I ve got to work But you ve worked morning and afternoon every day this week I don t care I ve got to work There had been a time when Trina had hated the idea of McTeague drinking steam beer as common and vulgar Say let s have a bottle of beer to night We haven t had a drop of beer in three weeks We can t afford it It s fifteen cents a bottle But I haven t had a swallow of beer in three weeks Drink STEAM beer then You ve got a nickel I gave you a quarter day before yesterday But I don t like steam beer now It was so with everything Unfortunately Trina had cultivated tastes in McTeague which now could not be gratified He had come to be very proud of his silk hat and Prince Albert coat and liked to wear them on Sundays Trina had made him sell both He preferred Yale mixture in his pipe Trina had made him come down to Mastiff a five cent tobacco with which he was once contented but now abhorred He liked to wear clean cuffs Trina allowed him a fresh pair on Sundays only At first these deprivations angered McTeague Then all of a sudden he slipped back into the old habits that had been his before he knew Trina with an ease that was surprising Sundays he dined at the car conductors coffee joint once more and spent the afternoon lying full length upon the bed crop full stupid warm smoking his huge pipe drinking his steam beer and playing his six mournful tunes upon his concertina dozing off to sleep towards four o clock The sale of their furniture had after paying the rent and outstanding bills netted about a hundred and thirty dollars Trina believed that the auctioneer from the second hand store had swindled and cheated them and had made a great outcry to no effect But she had arranged the affair with the auctioneer herself and offset her disappointment in the matter of the sale by deceiving her husband as to the real amount of the returns It was easy to lie to McTeague who took everything for granted and since the occasion of her trickery with the money that was to have been sent to her mother Trina had found falsehood easier than ever Seventy dollars is all the auctioneer gave me she told her husband and after paying the balance due on the rent and the grocer s bill there s only fifty left Only fifty murmured McTeague wagging his head only fifty Think of that Only fifty declared Trina Afterwards she said to herself with a certain admiration for her cleverness Couldn t save sixty dollars much easier than that and she had added the hundred and thirty to the little hoard in the chamois skin bag and brass match box in the bottom of her trunk In these first months of their misfortunes the routine of the McTeagues was as follows They rose at seven and breakfasted in their room Trina cooking the very meagre meal on an oil stove Immediately after breakfast Trina sat down to her work of whittling the Noah s ark animals and McTeague took himself off to walk down town He had by the greatest good luck secured a position with a manufacturer of surgical instruments where his manual dexterity in the making of excavators pluggers and other dental contrivances stood him in fairly good stead He lunched at a sailor s boarding house near the water front and in the afternoon worked till six He was home at six thirty and he and Trina had supper together in the ladies dining parlor an adjunct of the car conductors coffee joint Trina meanwhile had worked at her whittling all day long with but half an hour s interval for lunch which she herself prepared upon the oil stove In the evening they were both so tired that they were in no mood for conversation and went to bed early worn out harried nervous and cross Trina was not quite so scrupulously tidy now as in the old days At one time while whittling the Noah s ark animals she had worn gloves She never wore them now She still took pride in neatly combing and coiling her wonderful black hair but as the days passed she found it more and more comfortable to work in her blue flannel wrapper Whittlings and chips accumulated under the window where she did her work and she was at no great pains to clear the air of the room vitiated by the fumes of the oil stove and heavy with the smell of cooking It was not gay that life The room itself was not gay The huge double bed sprawled over nearly a fourth of the available space the angles of Trina s trunk and the washstand projected into the room from the walls and barked shins and scraped elbows Streaks and spots of the non poisonous paint that Trina used were upon the walls and wood work However in one corner of the room next the window monstrous distorted brilliant shining with a light of its own stood the dentist s sign the enormous golden tooth the tooth of a Brobdingnag One afternoon in September about four months after the McTeagues had left their suite Trina was at her work by the window She had whittled some half dozen sets of animals and was now busy painting them and making the arks Little pots of non poisonous paint stood at her elbow on the table together with a box of labels that read Made in France Her huge clasp knife was stuck into the under side of the table She was now occupied solely with the brushes and the glue pot She turned the little figures in her fingers with a wonderful lightness and deftness painting the chickens Naples yellow the elephants blue gray the horses Vandyke brown adding a dot of Chinese white for the eyes and sticking in the ears and tail with a drop of glue The animals once done she put together and painted the arks some dozen of them all windows and no doors each one opening only by a lid which was half the roof She had all the work she could handle these days for from this time till a week before Christmas Uncle Oelbermann could take as many Noah s ark sets as she could make Suddenly Trina paused in her work looking expectantly toward the door McTeague came in Why Mac exclaimed Trina It s only three o clock What are you home so early for Have they discharged you They ve fired me said McTeague sitting down on the bed Fired you What for I don know Said the times were getting hard an they had to let me go Trina let her paint stained hands fall into her lap OH she cried If we don t have the HARDEST luck of any two people I ever heard of What can you do now Is there another place like that where they make surgical instruments Huh No I don know There s three more Well you must try them right away Go down there right now Huh Right now No I m tired I ll go down in the morning Mac cried Trina in alarm what are you thinking of You talk as though we were millionaires You must go down this minute You re losing money every second you sit there She goaded the huge fellow to his feet again thrust his hat into his hands and pushed him out of the door he obeying the while docile and obedient as a big cart horse He was on the stairs when she came running after him Mac they paid you off didn t they when they discharged you Yes Then you must have some money Give it to me The dentist heaved a shoulder uneasily No I don want to I ve got to have that money There s no more oil for the stove and I must buy some more meal tickets to night Always after me about money muttered the dentist but he emptied his pockets for her nevertheless I you ve taken it all he grumbled Better leave me something for car fare It s going to rain Pshaw You can walk just as well as not A big fellow like you fraid of a little walk and it ain t going to rain Trina had lied again both as to the want of oil for the stove and the commutation ticket for the restaurant But she knew by instinct that McTeague had money about him and she did not intend to let it go out of the house She listened intently until she was sure McTeague was gone Then she hurriedly opened her trunk and hid the money in the chamois bag at the bottom The dentist presented himself at every one of the makers of surgical instruments that afternoon and was promptly turned away in each case Then it came on to rain a fine cold drizzle that chilled him and wet him to the bone He had no umbrella and Trina had not left him even five cents for car fare He started to walk home through the rain It was a long way to Polk Street as the last manufactory he had visited was beyond even Folsom Street and not far from the city front By the time McTeague reached Polk Street his teeth were chattering with the cold He was wet from head to foot As he was passing Heise s harness shop a sudden deluge of rain overtook him and he was obliged to dodge into the vestibule for shelter He who loved to be warm to sleep and to be well fed was icy cold was exhausted and footsore from tramping the city He could look forward to nothing better than a badly cooked supper at the coffee joint hot meat on a cold plate half done suet pudding muddy coffee and bad bread and he was cold miserably cold and wet to the bone All at once a sudden rage against Trina took possession of him It was her fault She knew it was going to rain and she had not let him have a nickel for car fare she who had five thousand dollars She let him walk the streets in the cold and in the rain Miser he growled behind his mustache Miser nasty little old miser You re worse than old Zerkow always nagging about money money and you got five thousand dollars You got more an you live in that stinking hole of a room and you won t drink any decent beer I ain t going to stand it much longer She knew it was going to rain She KNEW it Didn t I TELL her And she drives me out of my own home in the rain for me to get money for her more money and she takes it She took that money from me that I earned Twasn t hers it was mine I earned it and not a nickel for car fare She don t care if I get wet and get a cold and DIE No she don t as long as she s warm and s got her money He became more and more indignant at the picture he made of himself I ain t going to stand it much longer he repeated Why hello Doc Is that you exclaimed Heise opening the door of the harness shop behind him Come in out of the wet Why you re soaked through he added as he and McTeague came back into the shop that reeked of oiled leather Didn t you have any umbrella Ought to have taken a car I guess so I guess so murmured the dentist confused His teeth were chattering YOU RE going to catch your death a cold exclaimed Heise Tell you what he said reaching for his hat come in next door to Frenna s and have something to warm you up I ll get the old lady to mind the shop He called missus Heise down from the floor above and took McTeague into Joe Frenna s saloon which was two doors above his harness shop Whiskey and gum twice Joe said he to the barkeeper as he and the dentist approached the bar Huh What said McTeague Whiskey No I can t drink whiskey It kind of disagrees with me Oh the hell returned Heise easily Take it as medicine You ll get your death a cold if you stand round soaked like that Two whiskey and gum Joe McTeague emptied the pony glass at a single enormous gulp That s the way said Heise approvingly Do you good He drank his off slowly I d I d ask you to have a drink with me Heise said the dentist who had an indistinct idea of the amenities of the barroom only he added shamefacedly only you see I don t believe I got any change His anger against Trina heated by the whiskey he had drank flamed up afresh What a humiliating position for Trina to place him in not to leave him the price of a drink with a friend she who had five thousand dollars Sha That s all right Doc returned Heise nibbling on a grain of coffee Want another Hey This my treat Two more of the same Joe McTeague hesitated It was lamentably true that whiskey did not agree with him he knew it well enough However by this time he felt very comfortably warm at the pit of his stomach The blood was beginning to circulate in his chilled finger tips and in his soggy wet feet He had had a hard day of it in fact the last week the last month the last three or four months had been hard He deserved a little consolation Nor could Trina object to this It wasn t costing a cent He drank again with Heise Get up here to the stove and warm yourself urged Heise drawing up a couple of chairs and cocking his feet upon the guard The two fell to talking while McTeague s draggled coat and trousers smoked What a dirty turn that was that Marcus Schouler did you said Heise wagging his head You ought to have fought that Doc sure You d been practising too long They discussed this question some ten or fifteen minutes and then Heise rose Well this ain t earning any money I got to get back to the shop McTeague got up as well and the pair started for the door Just as they were going out Ryer met them Hello hello he cried Lord what a wet day You two are going the wrong way You re going to have a drink with me Three whiskey punches Joe No no answered McTeague shaking his head I m going back home I ve had two glasses of whiskey already Sha cried Heise catching his arm A strapping big chap like you ain t afraid of a little whiskey Well I I I got to go right afterwards protested McTeague About half an hour after the dentist had left to go down town Maria Macapa had come in to see Trina Occasionally Maria dropped in on Trina in this fashion and spent an hour or so chatting with her while she worked At first Trina had been inclined to resent these intrusions of the Mexican woman but of late she had begun to tolerate them Her day was long and cheerless at the best and there was no one to talk to Trina even fancied that old Miss Baker had come to be less cordial since their misfortune Maria retailed to her all the gossip of the flat and the neighborhood and which was much more interesting told her of her troubles with Zerkow Trina said to herself that Maria was common and vulgar but one had to have some diversion and Trina could talk and listen without interrupting her work On this particular occasion Maria was much excited over Zerkow s demeanor of late He s gettun worse an worse she informed Trina as she sat on the edge of the bed her chin in her hand He says he knows I got the dishes and am hidun them from him The other day I thought he d gone off with his wagon and I was doin a bit of ir ning an by an by all of a sudden I saw him peeping at me through the crack of the door I never let on that I saw him and honest he stayed there over two hours watchun everything I did I could just feel his eyes on the back of my neck all the time Last Sunday he took down part of the wall cause he said he d seen me making figures on it Well I was but it was just the wash list All the time he says he ll kill me if I don t tell Why what do you stay with him for exclaimed Trina I d be deathly fraid of a man like that and he did take a knife to you once Hoh HE won t kill me never fear If he d kill me he d never know where the dishes were that s what HE thinks But I can t understand Maria you told him about those gold dishes yourself Never never I never saw such a lot of crazy folks as you are But you say he hits you sometimes Ah said Maria tossing her head scornfully I ain t afraid of him He takes his horsewhip to me now and then but I can always manage I say If you touch me with that then I ll NEVER tell you Just pretending you know and he drops it as though it was red hot Say missus McTeague have you got any tea Let s make a cup of tea over the stove No no cried Trina with niggardly apprehension no I haven t got a bit of tea Trina s stinginess had increased to such an extent that it had gone beyond the mere hoarding of money She grudged even the food that she and McTeague ate and even brought away half loaves of bread lumps of sugar and fruit from the car conductors coffee joint She hid these pilferings away on the shelf by the window and often managed to make a very creditable lunch from them enjoying the meal with the greater relish because it cost her nothing No Maria I haven t got a bit of tea she said shaking her head decisively Hark ain t that Mac she added her chin in the air That s his step sure Well I m going to skip said Maria She left hurriedly passing the dentist in the hall just outside the door Well said Trina interrogatively as her husband entered McTeague did not answer He hung his hat on the hook behind the door and dropped heavily into a chair Well asked Trina anxiously how did you make out Mac Still the dentist pretended not to hear scowling fiercely at his muddy boots Tell me Mac I want to know Did you get a place Did you get caught in the rain Did I Did I cried the dentist sharply an alacrity in his manner and voice that Trina had never observed before Look at me Look at me he went on speaking with an unwonted rapidity his wits sharp his ideas succeeding each other quickly Look at me drenched through shivering cold I ve walked the city over Caught in the rain Yes I guess I did get caught in the rain and it ain t your fault I didn t catch my death a cold wouldn t even let me have a nickel for car fare But Mac protested Trina I didn t know it was going to rain The dentist put back his head and laughed scornfully His face was very red and his small eyes twinkled Hoh no you didn t know it was going to rain Didn t I TELL you it was he exclaimed suddenly angry again Oh you re a DAISY you are Think I m going to put up with your foolishness ALL the time Who s the boss you or I Why Mac I never saw you this way before You talk like a different man Well I AM a different man retorted the dentist savagely You can t make small of me ALWAYS Well never mind that You know I m not trying to make small of you But never mind that Did you get a place Give me my money exclaimed McTeague jumping up briskly There was an activity a positive nimbleness about the huge blond giant that had never been his before also his stupidity the sluggishness of his brain seemed to be unusually stimulated Give me my money the money I gave you as I was going away I can t exclaimed Trina I paid the grocer s bill with it while you were gone Don t believe you Truly truly Mac Do you think I d lie to you Do you think I d lower myself to do that Well the next time I earn any money I ll keep it myself But tell me Mac DID you get a place McTeague turned his back on her Tell me Mac please did you The dentist jumped up and thrust his face close to hers his heavy jaw protruding his little eyes twinkling meanly No he shouted No no NO Do you hear NO Trina cowered before him Then suddenly she began to sob aloud weeping partly at his strange brutality partly at the disappointment of his failure to find employment McTeague cast a contemptuous glance about him a glance that embraced the dingy cheerless room the rain streaming down the panes of the one window and the figure of his weeping wife Oh ain t this all FINE he exclaimed Ain t it lovely It s not my fault sobbed Trina It is too vociferated McTeague It is too We could live like Christians and decent people if you wanted to You got more n five thousand dollars and you re so damned stingy that you d rather live in a rat hole and make me live there too before you d part with a nickel of it I tell you I m sick and tired of the whole business An allusion to her lottery money never failed to rouse Trina And I ll tell you this much too she cried winking back the tears Now that you re out of a job we can t afford even to live in your rat hole as you call it We ve got to find a cheaper place than THIS even What exclaimed the dentist purple with rage What get into a worse hole in the wall than this Well we ll SEE if we will We ll just see about that You re going to do just as I tell you after this Trina McTeague and once more he thrust his face close to hers I know what s the matter cried Trina with a half sob I know I can smell it on your breath You ve been drinking whiskey Yes I ve been drinking whiskey retorted her husband I ve been drinking whiskey Have you got anything to say about it Ah yes you re RIGHT I ve been drinking whiskey What have YOU got to say about my drinking whiskey Let s hear it Oh Oh Oh sobbed Trina covering her face with her hands McTeague caught her wrists in one palm and pulled them down Trina s pale face was streaming with tears her long narrow blue eyes were swimming her adorable little chin upraised and quivering Let s hear what you got to say exclaimed McTeague Nothing nothing said Trina between her sobs Then stop that noise Stop it do you hear me Stop it He threw up his open hand threateningly STOP he exclaimed Trina looked at him fearfully half blinded with weeping Her husband s thick mane of yellow hair was disordered and rumpled upon his great square cut head his big red ears were redder than ever his face was purple the thick eyebrows were knotted over the small twinkling eyes the heavy yellow mustache that smelt of alcohol drooped over the massive protruding chin salient like that of the carnivora the veins were swollen and throbbing on his thick red neck while over her head Trina saw his upraised palm callused enormous Stop he exclaimed And Trina watching fearfully saw the palm suddenly contract into a fist a fist that was hard as a wooden mallet the fist of the old time car boy And then her ancient terror of him the intuitive fear of the male leaped to life again She was afraid of him Every nerve of her quailed and shrank from him She choked back her sobs catching her breath There growled the dentist releasing her that s more like Now he went on fixing her with his little eyes now listen to me I m beat out I ve walked the city over ten miles I guess an I m going to bed an I don t want to be bothered You understand I want to be let alone Trina was silent Do you HEAR he snarled Yes Mac The dentist took off his coat his collar and necktie unbuttoned his vest and slipped his heavy soled boots from his big feet Then he stretched himself upon the bed and rolled over towards the wall In a few minutes the sound of his snoring filled the room Trina craned her neck and looked at her husband over the footboard of the bed She saw his red congested face the huge mouth wide open his unclean shirt with its frayed wristbands and his huge feet encased in thick woollen socks Then her grief and the sense of her unhappiness returned more poignant than ever She stretched her arms out in front of her on her work table and burying her face in them cried and sobbed as though her heart would break The rain continued The panes of the single window ran with sheets of water the eaves dripped incessantly It grew darker The tiny grimy room full of the smells of cooking and of non poisonous paint took on an aspect of desolation and cheerlessness lamentable beyond words The canary in its little gilt prison chittered feebly from time to time Sprawled at full length upon the bed the dentist snored and snored stupefied inert his legs wide apart his hands lying palm upward at his sides At last Trina raised her head with a long trembling breath She rose and going over to the washstand poured some water from the pitcher into the basin and washed her face and swollen eyelids and rearranged her hair Suddenly as she was about to return to her work she was struck with an idea I wonder she said to herself I wonder where he got the money to buy his whiskey She searched the pockets of his coat which he had flung into a corner of the room and even came up to him as he lay upon the bed and went through the pockets of his vest and trousers She found nothing I wonder she murmured I wonder if he s got any money he don t tell me about I ll have to look out for that CHAPTER sixteen A week passed then a fortnight then a month It was a month of the greatest anxiety and unquietude for Trina McTeague was out of a job could find nothing to do and Trina who saw the impossibility of saving as much money as usual out of her earnings under the present conditions was on the lookout for cheaper quarters In spite of his outcries and sulky resistance Trina had induced her husband to consent to such a move bewildering him with a torrent of phrases and marvellous columns of figures by which she proved conclusively that they were in a condition but one remove from downright destitution The dentist continued idle Since his ill success with the manufacturers of surgical instruments he had made but two attempts to secure a job Trina had gone to see Uncle Oelbermann and had obtained for McTeague a position in the shipping department of the wholesale toy store However it was a position that involved a certain amount of ciphering and McTeague had been obliged to throw it up in two days Then for a time they had entertained a wild idea that a place on the police force could be secured for McTeague He could pass the physical examination with flying colors and Ryer who had become the secretary of the Polk Street Improvement Club promised the requisite political pull If McTeague had shown a certain energy in the matter the attempt might have been successful but he was too stupid or of late had become too listless to exert himself greatly and the affair resulted only in a violent quarrel with Ryer McTeague had lost his ambition He did not care to better his situation All he wanted was a warm place to sleep and three good meals a day At the first at the very first he had chafed at his idleness and had spent the days with his wife in their one narrow room walking back and forth with the restlessness of a caged brute or sitting motionless for hours watching Trina at her work feeling a dull glow of shame at the idea that she was supporting him This feeling had worn off quickly however Trina s work was only hard when she chose to make it so and as a rule she supported their misfortunes with a silent fortitude Then wearied at his inaction and feeling the need of movement and exercise McTeague would light his pipe and take a turn upon the great avenue one block above Polk Street A gang of laborers were digging the foundations for a large brownstone house and McTeague found interest and amusement in leaning over the barrier that surrounded the excavations and watching the progress of the work He came to see it every afternoon by and by he even got to know the foreman who superintended the job and the two had long talks together Then McTeague would return to Polk Street and find Heise in the back room of the harness shop and occasionally the day ended with some half dozen drinks of whiskey at Joe Frenna s saloon It was curious to note the effect of the alcohol upon the dentist It did not make him drunk it made him vicious So far from being stupefied he became after the fourth glass active alert quick witted even talkative a certain wickedness stirred in him then he was intractable mean and when he had drunk a little more heavily than usual he found a certain pleasure in annoying and exasperating Trina even in abusing and hurting her It had begun on the evening of Thanksgiving Day when Heise had taken McTeague out to dinner with him The dentist on this occasion had drunk very freely He and Heise had returned to Polk Street towards ten o clock and Heise at once suggested a couple of drinks at Frenna s All right all right said McTeague Drinks that s the word I ll go home and get some money and meet you at Joe s Trina was awakened by her husband pinching her arm Oh Mac she cried jumping up in bed with a little scream how you hurt Oh that hurt me dreadfully Give me a little money answered the dentist grinning and pinching her again I haven t a cent There s not a oh MAC will you stop I won t have you pinch me that way Hurry up answered her husband calmly nipping the flesh of her shoulder between his thumb and finger Heise s waiting for me Trina wrenched from him with a sharp intake of breath frowning with pain and caressing her shoulder Mac you ve no idea how that hurts Mac STOP Give me some money then In the end Trina had to comply She gave him half a dollar from her dress pocket protesting that it was the only piece of money she had One more just for luck said McTeague pinching her again and another How can you how CAN you hurt a woman so exclaimed Trina beginning to cry with the pain Ah now CRY retorted the dentist That s right CRY I never saw such a little fool He went out slamming the door in disgust But McTeague never became a drunkard in the generally received sense of the term He did not drink to excess more than two or three times in a month and never upon any occasion did he become maudlin or staggering Perhaps his nerves were naturally too dull to admit of any excitation perhaps he did not really care for the whiskey and only drank because Heise and the other men at Frenna s did Trina could often reproach him with drinking too much she never could say that he was drunk The alcohol had its effect for all that It roused the man or rather the brute in the man and now not only roused it but goaded it to evil McTeague s nature changed It was not only the alcohol it was idleness and a general throwing off of the good influence his wife had had over him in the days of their prosperity McTeague disliked Trina She was a perpetual irritation to him She annoyed him because she was so small so prettily made so invariably correct and precise Her avarice incessantly harassed him Her industry was a constant reproach to him She seemed to flaunt her work defiantly in his face It was the red flag in the eyes of the bull One time when he had just come back from Frenna s and had been sitting in the chair near her silently watching her at her work he exclaimed all of a sudden Stop working Stop it I tell you Put em away Put em all away or I ll pinch you But why why Trina protested The dentist cuffed her ears I won t have you work He took her knife and her paint pots away and made her sit idly in the window the rest of the afternoon It was however only when his wits had been stirred with alcohol that the dentist was brutal to his wife At other times say three weeks of every month she was merely an incumbrance to him They often quarrelled about Trina s money her savings The dentist was bent upon having at least a part of them What he would do with the money once he had it he did not precisely know He would spend it in royal fashion no doubt feasting continually buying himself wonderful clothes The miner s idea of money quickly gained and lavishly squandered persisted in his mind As for Trina the more her husband stormed the tighter she drew the strings of the little chamois skin bag that she hid at the bottom of her trunk underneath her bridal dress Her five thousand dollars invested in Uncle Oelbermann s business was a glittering splendid dream which came to her almost every hour of the day as a solace and a compensation for all her unhappiness At times when she knew that McTeague was far from home she would lock her door open her trunk and pile all her little hoard on her table By now it was four hundred and seven dollars and fifty cents Trina would play with this money by the hour piling it and repiling it or gathering it all into one heap and drawing back to the farthest corner of the room to note the effect her head on one side She polished the gold pieces with a mixture of soap and ashes until they shone wiping them carefully on her apron Or again she would draw the heap lovingly toward her and bury her face in it delighted at the smell of it and the feel of the smooth cool metal on her cheeks She even put the smaller gold pieces in her mouth and jingled them there She loved her money with an intensity that she could hardly express She would plunge her small fingers into the pile with little murmurs of affection her long narrow eyes half closed and shining her breath coming in long sighs Ah the dear money the dear money she would whisper I love you so All mine every penny of it No one shall ever ever get you How I ve worked for you How I ve slaved and saved for you And I m going to get more I m going to get more more more a little every day She was still looking for cheaper quarters Whenever she could spare a moment from her work she would put on her hat and range up and down the entire neighborhood from Sutter to Sacramento Streets going into all the alleys and bystreets her head in the air looking for the Rooms to let sign But she was in despair All the cheaper tenements were occupied She could find no room more reasonable than the one she and the dentist now occupied As time went on McTeague s idleness became habitual He drank no more whiskey than at first but his dislike for Trina increased with every day of their poverty with every day of Trina s persistent stinginess At times fortunately rare he was more than ever brutal to her He would box her ears or hit her a great blow with the back of a hair brush or even with his closed fist His old time affection for his little woman unable to stand the test of privation had lapsed by degrees and what little of it was left was changed distorted and made monstrous by the alcohol The people about the house and the clerks at the provision stores often remarked that Trina s fingertips were swollen and the nails purple as though they had been shut in a door Indeed this was the explanation she gave The fact of the matter was that McTeague when he had been drinking used to bite them crunching and grinding them with his immense teeth always ingenious enough to remember which were the sorest Sometimes he extorted money from her by this means but as often as not he did it for his own satisfaction And in some strange inexplicable way this brutality made Trina all the more affectionate aroused in her a morbid unwholesome love of submission a strange unnatural pleasure in yielding in surrendering herself to the will of an irresistible virile power Trina s emotions had narrowed with the narrowing of her daily life They reduced themselves at last to but two her passion for her money and her perverted love for her husband when he was brutal She was a strange woman during these days Trina had come to be on very intimate terms with Maria Macapa and in the end the dentist s wife and the maid of all work became great friends Maria was constantly in and out of Trina s room and whenever she could Trina threw a shawl over her head and returned Maria s calls Trina could reach Zerkow s dirty house without going into the street The back yard of the flat had a gate that opened into a little inclosure where Zerkow kept his decrepit horse and ramshackle wagon and from thence Trina could enter directly into Maria s kitchen Trina made long visits to Maria during the morning in her dressing gown and curl papers and the two talked at great length over a cup of tea served on the edge of the sink or a corner of the laundry table The talk was all of their husbands and of what to do when they came home in aggressive moods You never ought to fight um advised Maria It only makes um worse Just hump your back and it s soonest over They told each other of their husbands brutalities taking a strange sort of pride in recounting some particularly savage blow each trying to make out that her own husband was the most cruel They critically compared each other s bruises each one glad when she could exhibit the worst They exaggerated they invented details and as if proud of their beatings as if glorying in their husbands mishandling lied to each other magnifying their own maltreatment They had long and excited arguments as to which were the most effective means of punishment the rope s ends and cart whips such as Zerkow used or the fists and backs of hair brushes affected by McTeague Maria contended that the lash of the whip hurt the most Trina that the butt did the most injury Maria showed Trina the holes in the walls and the loosened boards in the flooring where Zerkow had been searching for the gold plate Of late he had been digging in the back yard and had ransacked the hay in his horse shed for the concealed leather chest he imagined he would find But he was becoming impatient evidently The way he goes on Maria told Trina is somethun dreadful He s gettun regularly sick with it got a fever every night don t sleep and when he does talks to himself Says More n a hundred pieces an every one of em gold More n a hundred pieces an every one of em gold Then he ll whale me with his whip and shout You know where it is Tell me tell me you swine or I ll do for you An then he ll get down on his knees and whimper and beg me to tell um where I ve hid it He s just gone plum crazy Sometimes he has regular fits he gets so mad and rolls on the floor and scratches himself One morning in November about ten o clock Trina pasted a Made in France label on the bottom of a Noah s ark and leaned back in her chair with a long sigh of relief She had just finished a large Christmas order for Uncle Oelbermann and there was nothing else she could do that morning The bed had not yet been made nor had the breakfast things been washed Trina hesitated for a moment then put her chin in the air indifferently Bah she said let them go till this afternoon I don t care WHEN the room is put to rights and I know Mac don t She determined that instead of making the bed or washing the dishes she would go and call on Miss Baker on the floor below The little dressmaker might ask her to stay to lunch and that would be something saved as the dentist had announced his intention that morning of taking a long walk out to the Presidio to be gone all day But Trina rapped on Miss Baker s door in vain that morning She was out Perhaps she was gone to the florist s to buy some geranium seeds However Old Grannis s door stood a little ajar and on hearing Trina at Miss Baker s room the old Englishman came out into the hall She s gone out he said uncertainly and in a half whisper went out about half an hour ago I I think she went to the drug store to get some wafers for the goldfish Don t you go to your dog hospital any more Mister Grannis said Trina leaning against the balustrade in the hall willing to talk a moment Old Grannis stood in the doorway of his room in his carpet slippers and faded corduroy jacket that he wore when at home Why why he said hesitating tapping his chin thoughtfully You see I m thinking of giving up the little hospital Giving it up You see the people at the book store where I buy my pamphlets have found out I told them of my contrivance for binding books and one of the members of the firm came up to look at it He offered me quite a sum if I would sell him the right of it the patent of it quite a sum In fact in fact yes quite a sum quite He rubbed his chin tremulously and looked about him on the floor Why isn t that fine said Trina good naturedly I m very glad Mister Grannis Is it a good price Quite a sum quite In fact I never dreamed of having so much money Now see here Mister Grannis said Trina decisively I want to give you a good piece of advice Here are you and Miss Baker The old Englishman started nervously You and Miss Baker that have been in love with each other for Oh missus McTeague that subject if you would please Miss Baker is such an estimable lady Fiddlesticks said Trina You re in love with each other and the whole flat knows it and you two have been living here side by side year in and year out and you ve never said a word to each other It s all nonsense Now I want you should go right in and speak to her just as soon as she comes home and say you ve come into money and you want her to marry you Impossible impossible exclaimed the old Englishman alarmed and perturbed It s quite out of the question I wouldn t presume Well do you love her or not Really missus McTeague I I you must excuse me It s a matter so personal so I Oh yes I love her Oh yes indeed he exclaimed suddenly Well then she loves you She told me so Oh She did She said those very words Miss Baker had said nothing of the kind would have died sooner than have made such a confession but Trina had drawn her own conclusions like every other lodger of the flat and thought the time was come for decided action Now you do just as I tell you and when she comes home go right in and see her and have it over with Now don t say another word I m going but you do just as I tell you Trina turned about and went down stairs She had decided since Miss Baker was not at home that she would run over and see Maria possibly she could have lunch there At any rate Maria would offer her a cup of tea Old Grannis stood for a long time just as Trina had left him his hands trembling the blood coming and going in his withered cheeks She said she she she told her she said that that he could get no farther Then he faced about and entered his room closing the door behind him For a long time he sat in his armchair drawn close to the wall in front of the table on which stood his piles of pamphlets and his little binding apparatus I wonder said Trina as she crossed the yard back of Zerkow s house I wonder what rent Zerkow and Maria pay for this place I ll bet it s cheaper than where Mac and I are Trina found Maria sitting in front of the kitchen stove her chin upon her breast Trina went up to her She was dead And as Trina touched her shoulder her head rolled sideways and showed a fearful gash in her throat under her ear All the front of her dress was soaked through and through Trina backed sharply away from the body drawing her hands up to her very shoulders her eyes staring and wide an expression of unutterable horror twisting her face Oh h h she exclaimed in a long breath her voice hardly rising above a whisper Oh h isn t that horrible Suddenly she turned and fled through the front part of the house to the street door that opened upon the little alley She looked wildly about her Directly across the way a butcher s boy was getting into his two wheeled cart drawn up in front of the opposite house while near by a peddler of wild game was coming down the street a brace of ducks in his hand Oh say say gasped Trina trying to get her voice say come over here quick The butcher s boy paused one foot on the wheel and stared Trina beckoned frantically Come over here come over here quick The young fellow swung himself into his seat What s the matter with that woman he said half aloud There s a murder been done cried Trina swaying in the doorway The young fellow drove away his head over his shoulder staring at Trina with eyes that were fixed and absolutely devoid of expression What s the matter with that woman he said again to himself as he turned the corner Trina wondered why she didn t scream how she could keep from it how at such a moment as this she could remember that it was improper to make a disturbance and create a scene in the street The peddler of wild game was looking at her suspiciously It would not do to tell him He would go away like the butcher s boy Now wait a minute Trina said to herself speaking aloud She put her hands to her head Now wait a minute It won t do for me to lose my wits now What must I do She looked about her There was the same familiar aspect of Polk Street She could see it at the end of the alley The big market opposite the flat the delivery carts rattling up and down the great ladies from the avenue at their morning shopping the cable cars trundling past loaded with passengers She saw a little boy in a flat leather cap whistling and calling for an unseen dog slapping his small knee from time to time Two men came out of Frenna s saloon laughing heartily Heise the harness maker stood in the vestibule of his shop a bundle of whittlings in his apron of greasy ticking And all this was going on people were laughing and living buying and selling walking about out there on the sunny sidewalks while behind her in there in there in there Heise started back from the sudden apparition of a white lipped woman in a blue dressing gown that seemed to rise up before him from his very doorstep Well missus McTeague you did scare me for Oh come over here quick Trina put her hand to her neck swallowing something that seemed to be choking her Maria s killed Zerkow s wife I found her Get out exclaimed Heise you re joking Come over here over into the house I found her she s dead Heise dashed across the street on the run with Trina at his heels a trail of spilled whittlings marking his course The two ran down the alley The wild game peddler a woman who had been washing down the steps in a neighboring house and a man in a broad brimmed hat stood at Zerkow s doorway looking in from time to time and talking together They seemed puzzled Anything wrong in here asked the wild game peddler as Heise and Trina came up Two more men stopped on the corner of the alley and Polk Street and looked at the group A woman with a towel round her head raised a window opposite Zerkow s house and called to the woman who had been washing the steps What is it missus Flint Heise was already inside the house He turned to Trina panting from his run Where did you say where was it where In there said Trina farther in the next room They burst into the kitchen LORD ejaculated Heise stopping a yard or so from the body and bending down to peer into the gray face with its brown lips By God he s killed her Who Zerkow by God he s killed her Cut her throat He always said he would Zerkow He s killed her Her throat s cut Good Lord how she did bleed By God he s done for her in good shape this time Oh I told her I TOLD her cried Trina He s done for her SURE this time She said she could always manage Oh h It s horrible He s done for her sure this trip Cut her throat LORD how she has BLED Did you ever see so much that s murder that s cold blooded murder He s killed her Say we must get a policeman Come on They turned back through the house Half a dozen people the wild game peddler the man with the broad brimmed hat the washwoman and three other men were in the front room of the junk shop a bank of excited faces surged at the door Beyond this outside the crowd was packed solid from one end of the alley to the other Out in Polk Street the cable cars were nearly blocked and were bunting a way slowly through the throng with clanging bells Every window had its group And as Trina and the harness maker tried to force the way from the door of the junk shop the throng suddenly parted right and left before the passage of two blue coated policemen who clove a passage through the press working their elbows energetically They were accompanied by a third man in citizen s clothes Heise and Trina went back into the kitchen with the two policemen the third man in citizen s clothes cleared the intruders from the front room of the junk shop and kept the crowd back his arm across the open door Whew whistled one of the officers as they came out into the kitchen cutting scrape By George SOMEBODY S been using his knife all right He turned to the other officer Better get the wagon There s a box on the second corner south Now then he continued turning to Trina and the harness maker and taking out his note book and pencil I want your names and addresses It was a day of tremendous excitement for the entire street Long after the patrol wagon had driven away the crowd remained In fact until seven o clock that evening groups collected about the door of the junk shop where a policeman stood guard asking all manner of questions advancing all manner of opinions Do you think they ll get him asked Ryer of the policeman A dozen necks craned forward eagerly Hoh we ll get him all right easy enough answered the other with a grand air What What s that What did he say asked the people on the outskirts of the group Those in front passed the answer back He says they ll get him all right easy enough The group looked at the policeman admiringly He s skipped to San Jose Where the rumor started and how no one knew But every one seemed persuaded that Zerkow had gone to San Jose But what did he kill her for Was he drunk No he was crazy I tell you crazy in the head Thought she was hiding some money from him Frenna did a big business all day long The murder was the one subject of conversation Little parties were made up in his saloon parties of twos and threes to go over and have a look at the outside of the junk shop Heise was the most important man the length and breadth of Polk Street almost invariably he accompanied these parties telling again and again of the part he had played in the affair It was about eleven o clock I was standing in front of the shop when missus McTeague you know the dentist s wife came running across the street and so on and so on The next day came a fresh sensation Polk Street read of it in the morning papers Towards midnight on the day of the murder Zerkow s body had been found floating in the bay near Black Point No one knew whether he had drowned himself or fallen from one of the wharves Clutched in both his hands was a sack full of old and rusty pans tin dishes fully a hundred of them tin cans and iron knives and forks collected from some dump heap And all this exclaimed Trina on account of a set of gold dishes that never existed 
816_2301_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER seventeen
816_2301_000003_000000	train-clean-360	One day about a fortnight after the coroner s inquest had been held and when the excitement of the terrible affair was calming down and Polk Street beginning to resume its monotonous routine Old Grannis sat in his clean well kept little room in his cushioned armchair his hands lying idly upon his knees 
816_2301_000003_000001	train-clean-360	It was evening not quite time to light the lamps 
816_2301_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Old Grannis had drawn his chair close to the wall so close in fact that he could hear Miss Baker s grenadine brushing against the other side of the thin partition at his very elbow while she rocked gently back and forth a cup of tea in her hands 
816_2301_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Old Grannis s occupation was gone 
816_2301_000004_000001	train-clean-360	That morning the bookselling firm where he had bought his pamphlets had taken his little binding apparatus from him to use as a model 
816_2301_000004_000002	train-clean-360	The transaction had been concluded 
816_2301_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Old Grannis had received his check 
816_2301_000004_000004	train-clean-360	It was large enough to be sure but when all was over he returned to his room and sat there sad and unoccupied looking at the pattern in the carpet and counting the heads of the tacks in the zinc guard that was fastened to the wall behind his little stove 
none	none	By and by he heard Miss Baker moving about 
816_2301_000004_000006	train-clean-360	It was five o clock the time when she was accustomed to make her cup of tea and keep company with him on her side of the partition 
none	none	Old Grannis drew up his chair to the wall near where he knew she was sitting 
816_2301_000004_000008	train-clean-360	The minutes passed side by side and separated by only a couple of inches of board the two old people sat there together while the afternoon grew darker 
none	none	But for Old Grannis all was different that evening 
816_2301_000005_000001	train-clean-360	There was nothing for him to do 
816_2301_000005_000002	train-clean-360	His hands lay idly in his lap 
816_2301_000005_000003	train-clean-360	His table with its pile of pamphlets was in a far corner of the room and from time to time stirred with an uncertain trouble he turned his head and looked at it sadly reflecting that he would never use it again 
816_2301_000005_000004	train-clean-360	The absence of his accustomed work seemed to leave something out of his life 
816_2301_000005_000005	train-clean-360	It did not appear to him that he could be the same to Miss Baker now their little habits were disarranged their customs broken up 
816_2301_000005_000006	train-clean-360	He could no longer fancy himself so near to her 
816_2301_000005_000007	train-clean-360	They would drift apart now and she would no longer make herself a cup of tea and keep company with him when she knew that he would never again sit before his table binding uncut pamphlets 
816_2301_000005_000008	train-clean-360	He had sold his happiness for money he had bartered all his tardy romance for some miserable banknotes 
816_2301_000005_000009	train-clean-360	He had not foreseen that it would be like this 
816_2301_000005_000010	train-clean-360	A vast regret welled up within him 
816_2301_000005_000011	train-clean-360	What was that on the back of his hand 
none	none	He wiped it dry with his ancient silk handkerchief 
816_2301_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Old Grannis leant his face in his hands 
816_2301_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Not only did an inexplicable regret stir within him but a certain great tenderness came upon him The tears that swam in his faded blue eyes were not altogether those of unhappiness 
none	none	No this long delayed affection that had come upon him in his later years filled him with a joy for which tears seemed to be the natural expression 
816_2301_000006_000003	train-clean-360	For thirty years his eyes had not been wet but tonight he felt as if he were young again 
816_2301_000006_000004	train-clean-360	He had never loved before and there was still a part of him that was only twenty years of age 
816_2301_000006_000005	train-clean-360	He could not tell whether he was profoundly sad or deeply happy but he was not ashamed of the tears that brought the smart to his eyes and the ache to his throat 
816_2301_000006_000006	train-clean-360	He did not hear the timid rapping on his door and it was not until the door itself opened that he looked up quickly and saw the little retired dressmaker standing on the threshold carrying a cup of tea on a tiny Japanese tray 
816_2301_000006_000007	train-clean-360	She held it toward him 
816_2301_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 I was making some tea she said and I thought you would like to have a cup 
none	none	Never after could the little dressmaker understand how she had brought herself to do this thing 
816_2301_000008_000001	train-clean-360	One moment she had been sitting quietly on her side of the partition stirring her cup of tea with one of her Gorham spoons 
816_2301_000008_000002	train-clean-360	She was quiet she was peaceful 
816_2301_000008_000003	train-clean-360	The evening was closing down tranquilly 
816_2301_000008_000004	train-clean-360	Her room was the picture of calmness and order 
816_2301_000008_000005	train-clean-360	The geraniums blooming in the starch boxes in the window the aged goldfish occasionally turning his iridescent flank to catch a sudden glow of the setting sun 
816_2301_000008_000006	train-clean-360	The next moment she had been all trepidation 
816_2301_000008_000007	train-clean-360	It seemed to her the most natural thing in the world to make a steaming cup of tea and carry it in to Old Grannis next door 
816_2301_000008_000008	train-clean-360	It seemed to her that he was wanting her that she ought to go to him 
816_2301_000008_000009	train-clean-360	With the brusque resolve and intrepidity that sometimes seizes upon very timid people the courage of the coward greater than all others she had presented herself at the old Englishman s half open door and when he had not heeded her knock had pushed it open and at last after all these years stood upon the threshold of his room 
816_2301_000008_000010	train-clean-360	She had found courage enough to explain her intrusion 
816_2301_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I was making some tea and I thought you would like to have a cup 
816_2301_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Old Grannis dropped his hands upon either arm of his chair and leaning forward a little looked at her blankly 
816_2301_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He did not speak 
816_2301_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The retired dressmaker s courage had carried her thus far now it deserted her as abruptly as it had come 
816_2301_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Her cheeks became scarlet her funny little false curls trembled with her agitation 
816_2301_000011_000002	train-clean-360	What she had done seemed to her indecorous beyond expression 
816_2301_000011_000003	train-clean-360	It was an enormity 
none	none	Fancy she had gone into his room INTO HIS ROOM Mister Grannis s room 
816_2301_000011_000005	train-clean-360	She had done this she who could not pass him on the stairs without a qualm What to do she did not know 
none	none	She stood a fixture on the threshold of his room without even resolution enough to beat a retreat 
816_2301_000011_000007	train-clean-360	Helplessly and with a little quaver in her voice she repeated obstinately 
816_2301_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 I was making some tea and I thought you would like to have a cup of tea Her agitation betrayed itself in the repetition of the word 
816_2301_000012_000001	train-clean-360	She felt that she could not hold the tray out another instant 
816_2301_000012_000002	train-clean-360	Already she was trembling so that half the tea was spilled 
816_2301_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Old Grannis still kept silence still bending forward with wide eyes his hands gripping the arms of his chair 
816_2301_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Then with the tea tray still held straight before her the little dressmaker exclaimed tearfully 
816_2301_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I didn t mean I didn t mean I didn t know it would seem like this 
816_2301_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I only meant to be kind and bring you some tea and now it seems SO improper 
816_2301_000015_000002	train-clean-360	I I I m SO ashamed 
816_2301_000015_000003	train-clean-360	I don t know what you will think of me 
816_2301_000015_000004	train-clean-360	I she caught her breath improper she managed to exclaim unlady like you can never think well of me I ll go 
816_2301_000015_000005	train-clean-360	I ll go She turned about 
816_2301_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop cried Old Grannis finding his voice at last 
816_2301_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Baker paused looking at him over her shoulder her eyes very wide open blinking through her tears for all the world like a frightened child 
816_2301_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Stop exclaimed the old Englishman rising to his feet 
816_2301_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I didn t know it was you at first 
816_2301_000017_000002	train-clean-360	I hadn t dreamed I couldn t believe you would be so good so kind to me 
816_2301_000017_000003	train-clean-360	Oh he cried with a sudden sharp breath oh you ARE kind 
816_2301_000017_000004	train-clean-360	I I you have have made me very happy 
816_2301_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 No no exclaimed Miss Baker ready to sob 
816_2301_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 It was unlady like 
816_2301_000018_000002	train-clean-360	You will you must think ill of me She stood in the hall 
816_2301_000018_000003	train-clean-360	The tears were running down her cheeks and she had no free hand to dry them 
816_2301_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Let me I ll take the tray from you cried Old Grannis coming forward 
816_2301_000019_000001	train-clean-360	A tremulous joy came upon him 
816_2301_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Never in his life had he been so happy 
816_2301_000019_000003	train-clean-360	At last it had come come when he had least expected it 
none	none	That which he had longed for and hoped for through so many years behold it was come to night 
816_2301_000019_000005	train-clean-360	He felt his awkwardness leaving him 
816_2301_000019_000006	train-clean-360	He was almost certain that the little dressmaker loved him and the thought gave him boldness 
816_2301_000019_000007	train-clean-360	He came toward her and took the tray from her hands and turning back into the room with it made as if to set it upon his table But the piles of his pamphlets were in the way 
816_2301_000019_000008	train-clean-360	Both of his hands were occupied with the tray he could not make a place for it on the table He stood for a moment uncertain his embarrassment returning 
816_2301_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh won t you won t you please 
none	none	He turned his head looking appealingly at the little old dressmaker
816_2301_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Wait I ll help you she said 
816_2301_000021_000001	train-clean-360	She came into the room up to the table and moved the pamphlets to one side 
816_2301_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks thanks murmured Old Grannis setting down the tray 
816_2301_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Now now now I will go back she exclaimed hurriedly 
816_2301_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 No no returned the old Englishman 
816_2301_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 Don t go don t go 
816_2301_000024_000002	train-clean-360	I ve been so lonely to night and last night too all this year all my life he suddenly cried 
816_2301_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I I I ve forgotten the sugar 
816_2301_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 But I never take sugar in my tea 
816_2301_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 But it s rather cold and I ve spilled it almost all of it 
816_2301_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll drink it from the saucer Old Grannis had drawn up his armchair for her 
816_2301_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I shouldn t 
none	none	This is this is SO You must think ill of me Suddenly she sat down and resting her elbows on the table hid her face in her hands
816_2301_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Think ILL of you cried Old Grannis think ILL of you 
816_2301_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Why you don t know you have no idea all these years living so close to you I I he paused suddenly 
816_2301_000030_000002	train-clean-360	It seemed to him as if the beating of his heart was choking him 
816_2301_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought you were binding your books to night said Miss Baker suddenly and you looked tired 
816_2301_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I thought you looked tired when I last saw you and a cup of tea you know it that that does you so much good when you re tired 
816_2301_000031_000002	train-clean-360	But you weren t binding books 
816_2301_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 No no returned Old Grannis drawing up a chair and sitting down No I the fact is I ve sold my apparatus a firm of booksellers has bought the rights of it 
none	none	And aren t you going to bind books any more exclaimed the little dressmaker a shade of disappointment in her manner
816_2301_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 I thought you always did about four o clock 
816_2301_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I used to hear you when I was making tea 
816_2301_000034_000000	train-clean-360	It hardly seemed possible to Miss Baker that she was actually talking to Old Grannis that the two were really chatting together face to face and without the dreadful embarrassment that used to overwhelm them both when they met on the stairs 
816_2301_000034_000001	train-clean-360	She had often dreamed of this but had always put it off to some far distant day 
816_2301_000034_000002	train-clean-360	It was to come gradually little by little instead of as now abruptly and with no preparation That she should permit herself the indiscretion of actually intruding herself into his room had never so much as occurred to her 
816_2301_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Yet here she was IN HIS ROOM and they were talking together and little by little her embarrassment was wearing away 
816_2301_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes I always heard you when you were making tea returned the old Englishman I heard the tea things 
none	none	Then I used to draw my chair and my work table close to the wall on my side and sit there and work while you drank your tea just on the other side and I used to feel very near to you then 
816_2301_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I used to pass the whole evening that way 
816_2301_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 And yes yes I did too she answered 
816_2301_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 I used to make tea just at that time and sit there for a whole hour 
816_2301_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 And didn t you sit close to the partition on your side 
816_2301_000037_000003	train-clean-360	didn t you sit close to the partition 
none	none	on your side Sometimes I was sure of it 
816_2301_000037_000002	train-clean-360	I could even fancy that I could hear your dress brushing against the wall paper close beside me 
none	none	Didn t you sit close to the partition I I don t know where I sat 
816_2301_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Old Grannis shyly put out his hand and took hers as it lay upon her lap 
816_2301_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Didn t you sit close to the partition on your side he insisted 
816_2301_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 No I don t know perhaps sometimes 
816_2301_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Oh yes she exclaimed with a little gasp Oh yes I often did 
816_2301_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Then Old Grannis put his arm about her and kissed her faded cheek that flushed to pink upon the instant 
none	none	After that they spoke but little 
816_2301_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The day lapsed slowly into twilight and the two old people sat there in the gray evening quietly quietly their hands in each other s hands keeping company but now with nothing to separate them 
none	none	It had come at last 
816_2301_000043_000003	train-clean-360	After all these years they were together they understood each other 
816_2301_000043_000004	train-clean-360	They stood at length in a little Elysium of their own creating 
none	none	They walked hand in hand in a delicious garden where it was always autumn Far from the world and together they entered upon the long retarded romance of their commonplace and uneventful lives CHAPTER eighteen That same night McTeague was awakened by a shrill scream and woke to find Trina s arms around his neck She was trembling so that the bed springs creaked Huh cried the dentist sitting up in bed raising his clinched fists Huh What What What is it What is it Oh Mac gasped his wife I had such an awful dream I dreamed about Maria I thought she was chasing me and I couldn t run and her throat was Oh she was all covered with blood Oh h I am so frightened Trina had borne up very well for the first day or so after the affair and had given her testimony to the coroner with far greater calmness than Heise It was only a week later that the horror of the thing came upon her again She was so nervous that she hardly dared to be alone in the daytime and almost every night woke with a cry of terror trembling with the recollection of some dreadful nightmare The dentist was irritated beyond all expression by her nervousness and especially was he exasperated when her cries woke him suddenly in the middle of the night He would sit up in bed rolling his eyes wildly throwing out his huge fists at what he did not know exclaiming What what bewildered and hopelessly confused Then when he realized that it was only Trina his anger kindled abruptly Oh you and your dreams You go to sleep or I ll give you a dressing down Sometimes he would hit her a great thwack with his open palm or catch her hand and bite the tips of her fingers Trina would lie awake for hours afterward crying softly to herself Then by and by Mac she would say timidly Huh Mac do you love me Huh What Go to sleep Don t you love me any more Mac Oh go to sleep Don t bother me Well do you LOVE me Mac I guess so Oh Mac I ve only you now and if you don t love me what is going to become of me Shut up an let me go to sleep Well just tell me that you love me The dentist would turn abruptly away from her burying his big blond head in the pillow and covering up his ears with the blankets Then Trina would sob herself to sleep The dentist had long since given up looking for a job Between breakfast and supper time Trina saw but little of him Once the morning meal over McTeague bestirred himself put on his cap he had given up wearing even a hat since his wife had made him sell his silk hat and went out He had fallen into the habit of taking long and solitary walks beyond the suburbs of the city Sometimes it was to the Cliff House occasionally to the Park where he would sit on the sun warmed benches smoking his pipe and reading ragged ends of old newspapers but more often it was to the Presidio Reservation McTeague would walk out to the end of the Union Street car line entering the Reservation at the terminus then he would work down to the shore of the bay follow the shore line to the Old Fort at the Golden Gate and turning the Point here come out suddenly upon the full sweep of the Pacific Then he would follow the beach down to a certain point of rocks that he knew Here he would turn inland climbing the bluffs to a rolling grassy down sown with blue iris and a yellow flower that he did not know the name of On the far side of this down was a broad well kept road McTeague would keep to this road until he reached the city again by the way of the Sacramento Street car line The dentist loved these walks He liked to be alone He liked the solitude of the tremendous tumbling ocean the fresh windy downs he liked to feel the gusty Trades flogging his face and he would remain for hours watching the roll and plunge of the breakers with the silent unreasoned enjoyment of a child All at once he developed a passion for fishing He would sit all day nearly motionless upon a point of rocks his fish line between his fingers happy if he caught three perch in twelve hours At noon he would retire to a bit of level turf around an angle of the shore and cook his fish eating them without salt or knife or fork He thrust a pointed stick down the mouth of the perch and turned it slowly over the blaze When the grease stopped dripping he knew that it was done and would devour it slowly and with tremendous relish picking the bones clean eating even the head He remembered how often he used to do this sort of thing when he was a boy in the mountains of Placer County before he became a car boy at the mine The dentist enjoyed himself hugely during these days The instincts of the old time miner were returning In the stress of his misfortune McTeague was lapsing back to his early estate One evening as he reached home after such a tramp he was surprised to find Trina standing in front of what had been Zerkow s house looking at it thoughtfully her finger on her lips What you doing here growled the dentist as he came up There was a Rooms to let sign on the street door of the house Now we ve found a place to move to exclaimed Trina What cried McTeague There in that dirty house where you found Maria I can t afford that room in the flat any more now that you can t get any work to do But there s where Zerkow killed Maria the very house an you wake up an squeal in the night just thinking of it I know I know it will be bad at first but I ll get used to it an it s just half again as cheap as where we are now I was looking at a room we can have it dirt cheap It s a back room over the kitchen A German family are going to take the front part of the house and sublet the rest I m going to take it It ll be money in my pocket But it won t be any in mine vociferated the dentist angrily I ll have to live in that dirty rat hole just so s you can save money I ain t any the better off for it Find work to do and then we ll talk declared Trina I M going to save up some money against a rainy day and if I can save more by living here I m going to do it even if it is the house Maria was killed in I don t care All right said McTeague and did not make any further protest His wife looked at him surprised She could not understand this sudden acquiescence Perhaps McTeague was so much away from home of late that he had ceased to care where or how he lived But this sudden change troubled her a little for all that The next day the McTeagues moved for a second time It did not take them long They were obliged to buy the bed from the landlady a circumstance which nearly broke Trina s heart and this bed a couple of chairs Trina s trunk an ornament or two the oil stove and some plates and kitchen ware were all that they could call their own now and this back room in that wretched house with its grisly memories the one window looking out into a grimy maze of back yards and broken sheds was what they now knew as their home The McTeagues now began to sink rapidly lower and lower They became accustomed to their surroundings Worst of all Trina lost her pretty ways and her good looks The combined effects of hard work avarice poor food and her husband s brutalities told on her swiftly Her charming little figure grew coarse stunted and dumpy She who had once been of a catlike neatness now slovened all day about the room in a dirty flannel wrapper her slippers clap clapping after her as she walked At last she even neglected her hair the wonderful swarthy tiara the coiffure of a queen that shaded her little pale forehead In the morning she braided it before it was half combed and piled and coiled it about her head in haphazard fashion It came down half a dozen times a day by evening it was an unkempt tangled mass a veritable rat s nest Ah no it was not very gay that life of hers when one had to rustle for two cook and work and wash to say nothing of paying the rent What odds was it if she was slatternly dirty coarse Was there time to make herself look otherwise and who was there to be pleased when she was all prinked out Surely not a great brute of a husband who bit you like a dog and kicked and pounded you as though you were made of iron Ah no better let things go and take it as easy as you could Hump your back and it was soonest over The one room grew abominably dirty reeking with the odors of cooking and of non poisonous paint The bed was not made until late in the afternoon sometimes not at all Dirty unwashed crockery greasy knives sodden fragments of yesterday s meals cluttered the table while in one corner was the heap of evil smelling dirty linen Cockroaches appeared in the crevices of the woodwork the wall paper bulged from the damp walls and began to peel Trina had long ago ceased to dust or to wipe the furniture with a bit of rag The grime grew thick upon the window panes and in the corners of the room All the filth of the alley invaded their quarters like a rising muddy tide Between the windows however the faded photograph of the couple in their wedding finery looked down upon the wretchedness Trina still holding her set bouquet straight before her McTeague standing at her side his left foot forward in the attitude of a Secretary of State while near by hung the canary the one thing the dentist clung to obstinately piping and chittering all day in its little gilt prison And the tooth the gigantic golden molar of French gilt enormous and ungainly sprawled its branching prongs in one corner of the room by the footboard of the bed The McTeague s had come to use it as a sort of substitute for a table After breakfast and supper Trina piled the plates and greasy dishes upon it to have them out of the way One afternoon the Other Dentist McTeague s old time rival the wearer of marvellous waistcoats was surprised out of all countenance to receive a visit from McTeague The Other Dentist was in his operating room at the time at work upon a plaster of paris mould To his call of Come right in Don t you see the sign Enter without knocking McTeague came in He noted at once how airy and cheerful was the room A little fire coughed and tittered on the hearth a brindled greyhound sat on his haunches watching it intently a great mirror over the mantle offered to view an array of actresses pictures thrust between the glass and the frame and a big bunch of freshly cut violets stood in a glass bowl on the polished cherrywood table The Other Dentist came forward briskly exclaiming cheerfully Oh Doctor Mister McTeague how do how do The fellow was actually wearing a velvet smoking jacket A cigarette was between his lips his patent leather boots reflected the firelight McTeague wore a black surah neglige shirt without a cravat huge buckled brogans hob nailed gross encased his feet the hems of his trousers were spotted with mud his coat was frayed at the sleeves and a button was gone In three days he had not shaved his shock of heavy blond hair escaped from beneath the visor of his woollen cap and hung low over his forehead He stood with awkward shifting feet and uncertain eyes before the dapper young fellow who reeked of the barber shop and whom he had once ordered from his rooms What can I do for you this morning Mister McTeague Something wrong with the teeth eh No no McTeague floundering in the difficulties of his speech forgot the carefully rehearsed words with which he had intended to begin this interview I want to sell you my sign he said stupidly That big tooth of French gilt YOU know that you made an offer for once Oh I don t want that now said the other loftily I prefer a little quiet signboard nothing pretentious just the name and Dentist after it These big signs are vulgar No I don t want it McTeague remained looking about on the floor horribly embarrassed not knowing whether to go or to stay But I don t know said the Other Dentist reflectively If it will help you out any I guess you re pretty hard up I ll well I tell you what I ll give you five dollars for it All right all right On the following Thursday morning McTeague woke to hear the eaves dripping and the prolonged rattle of the rain upon the roof Raining he growled in deep disgust sitting up in bed and winking at the blurred window It s been raining all night said Trina She was already up and dressed and was cooking breakfast on the oil stove McTeague dressed himself grumbling Well I ll go anyhow The fish will bite all the better for the rain Look here Mac said Trina slicing a bit of bacon as thinly as she could Look here why don t you bring some of your fish home sometime Huh snorted the dentist so s we could have em for breakfast Might save you a nickel mightn t it Well and if it did Or you might fish for the market The fisherman across the street would buy em of you Shut up exclaimed the dentist and Trina obediently subsided Look here continued her husband fumbling in his trousers pocket and bringing out a dollar I m sick and tired of coffee and bacon and mashed potatoes Go over to the market and get some kind of meat for breakfast Get a steak or chops or something Why Mac that s a whole dollar and he only gave you five for your sign We can t afford it Sure Mac Let me put that money away against a rainy day You re just as well off without meat for breakfast You do as I tell you Get some steak or chops or something Please Mac dear Go on now I ll bite your fingers again pretty soon But The dentist took a step towards her snatching at her hand All right I ll go cried Trina wincing and shrinking I ll go She did not get the chops at the big market however Instead she hurried to a cheaper butcher shop on a side street two blocks away and bought fifteen cents worth of chops from a side of mutton some two or three days old She was gone some little time Give me the change exclaimed the dentist as soon as she returned Trina handed him a quarter and when McTeague was about to protest broke in upon him with a rapid stream of talk that confused him upon the instant But for that matter it was never difficult for Trina to deceive the dentist He never went to the bottom of things He would have believed her if she had told him the chops had cost a dollar There s sixty cents saved anyhow thought Trina as she clutched the money in her pocket to keep it from rattling Trina cooked the chops and they breakfasted in silence Now said McTeague as he rose wiping the coffee from his thick mustache with the hollow of his palm now I m going fishing rain or no rain I m going to be gone all day He stood for a moment at the door his fish line in his hand swinging the heavy sinker back and forth He looked at Trina as she cleared away the breakfast things So long said he nodding his huge square cut head This amiability in the matter of leave taking was unusual Trina put the dishes down and came up to him her little chin once so adorable in the air Kiss me good by Mac she said putting her arms around his neck You DO love me a little yet don t you Mac We ll be happy again some day This is hard times now but we ll pull out You ll find something to do pretty soon I guess so growled McTeague allowing her to kiss him The canary was stirring nimbly in its cage and just now broke out into a shrill trilling its little throat bulging and quivering The dentist stared at it Say he remarked slowly I think I ll take that bird of mine along Sell it inquired Trina Yes yes sell it Well you ARE coming to your senses at last answered Trina approvingly But don t you let the bird store man cheat you That s a good songster and with the cage you ought to make him give you five dollars You stick out for that at first anyhow McTeague unhooked the cage and carefully wrapped it in an old newspaper remarking He might get cold Well so long he repeated so long Good by Mac When he was gone Trina took the sixty cents she had stolen from him out of her pocket and recounted it It s sixty cents all right she said proudly But I DO believe that dime is too smooth She looked at it critically The clock on the power house of the Sutter Street cable struck eight Eight o clock already she exclaimed I must get to work She cleared the breakfast things from the table and drawing up her chair and her workbox began painting the sets of Noah s ark animals she had whittled the day before She worked steadily all the morning At noon she lunched warming over the coffee left from breakfast and frying a couple of sausages By one she was bending over her table again Her fingers some of them lacerated by McTeague s teeth flew and the little pile of cheap toys in the basket at her elbow grew steadily Where DO all the toys go to she murmured The thousands and thousands of these Noah s arks that I have made horses and chickens and elephants and always there never seems to be enough It s a good thing for me that children break their things and that they all have to have birthdays and Christmases She dipped her brush into a pot of Vandyke brown and painted one of the whittled toy horses in two strokes Then a touch of ivory black with a small flat brush created the tail and mane and dots of Chinese white made the eyes The turpentine in the paint dried it almost immediately and she tossed the completed little horse into the basket At six o clock the dentist had not returned Trina waited until seven and then put her work away and ate her supper alone I wonder what s keeping Mac she exclaimed as the clock from the power house on Sutter Street struck half past seven I KNOW he s drinking somewhere she cried apprehensively He had the money from his sign with him At eight o clock she threw a shawl over her head and went over to the harness shop If anybody would know where McTeague was it would be Heise But the harness maker had seen nothing of him since the day before He was in here yesterday afternoon and we had a drink or two at Frenna s Maybe he s been in there to day Oh won t you go in and see said Trina Mac always came home to his supper he never likes to miss his meals and I m getting frightened about him Heise went into the barroom next door and returned with no definite news Frenna had not seen the dentist since he had come in with the harness maker the previous afternoon Trina even humbled herself to ask of the Ryers with whom they had quarrelled if they knew anything of the dentist s whereabouts but received a contemptuous negative Maybe he s come in while I ve been out said Trina to herself She went down Polk Street again going towards the flat The rain had stopped but the sidewalks were still glistening The cable cars trundled by loaded with theatregoers The barbers were just closing their shops The candy store on the corner was brilliantly lighted and was filling up while the green and yellow lamps from the drug store directly opposite threw kaleidoscopic reflections deep down into the shining surface of the asphalt A band of Salvationists began to play and pray in front of Frenna s saloon Trina hurried on down the gay street with its evening s brilliancy and small activities her shawl over her head one hand lifting her faded skirt from off the wet pavements She turned into the alley entered Zerkow s old home by the ever open door and ran up stairs to the room Nobody Why isn t this FUNNY she exclaimed half aloud standing on the threshold her little milk white forehead curdling to a frown one sore finger on her lips Then a great fear seized upon her Inevitably she associated the house with a scene of violent death No no she said to the darkness Mac is all right HE can take care of himself But for all that she had a clear cut vision of her husband s body bloated with seawater his blond hair streaming like kelp rolling inertly in shifting waters He couldn t have fallen off the rocks she declared firmly There THERE he is now She heaved a great sigh of relief as a heavy tread sounded in the hallway below She ran to the banisters looking over and calling Oh Mac Is that you Mac It was the German whose family occupied the lower floor The power house clock struck nine My God where is Mac cried Trina stamping her foot She put the shawl over her head again and went out and stood on the corner of the alley and Polk Street watching and waiting craning her neck to see down the street Once even she went out upon the sidewalk in front of the flat and sat down for a moment upon the horse block there She could not help remembering the day when she had been driven up to that horse block in a hack Her mother and father and Owgooste and the twins were with her It was her wedding day Her wedding dress was in a huge tin trunk on the driver s seat She had never been happier before in all her life She remembered how she got out of the hack and stood for a moment upon the horse block looking up at McTeague s windows She had caught a glimpse of him at his shaving the lather still on his cheek and they had waved their hands at each other Instinctively Trina looked up at the flat behind her looked up at the bay window where her husband s Dental Parlors had been It was all dark the windows had the blind sightless appearance imparted by vacant untenanted rooms A rusty iron rod projected mournfully from one of the window ledges There s where our sign hung once said Trina She turned her head and looked down Polk Street towards where the Other Dentist had his rooms and there overhanging the street from his window newly furbished and brightened hung the huge tooth her birthday present to her husband flashing and glowing in the white glare of the electric lights like a beacon of defiance and triumph Ah no ah no whispered Trina choking back a sob Life isn t so gay But I wouldn t mind no I wouldn t mind anything if only Mac was home all right She got up from the horse block and stood again on the corner of the alley watching and listening It grew later The hours passed Trina kept at her post The noise of approaching footfalls grew less and less frequent Little by little Polk Street dropped back into solitude Eleven o clock struck from the power house clock lights were extinguished at one o clock the cable stopped leaving an abrupt and numbing silence in the air All at once it seemed very still The only noises were the occasional footfalls of a policeman and the persistent calling of ducks and geese in the closed market across the way The street was asleep When it is night and dark and one is awake and alone one s thoughts take the color of the surroundings become gloomy sombre and very dismal All at once an idea came to Trina a dark terrible idea worse even than the idea of McTeague s death Oh no she cried Oh no It isn t true But suppose suppose She left her post and hurried back to the house No no she was saying under her breath it isn t possible Maybe he s even come home already by another way But suppose suppose suppose She ran up the stairs opened the door of the room and paused out of breath The room was dark and empty With cold trembling fingers she lighted the lamp and turning about looked at her trunk The lock was burst No no no cried Trina it s not true it s not true She dropped on her knees before the trunk and tossed back the lid and plunged her hands down into the corner underneath her wedding dress where she always kept the savings The brass match safe and the chamois skin bag were there They were empty Trina flung herself full length upon the floor burying her face in her arms rolling her head from side to side Her voice rose to a wail No no no it s not true it s not true it s not true Oh he couldn t have done it Oh how could he have done it All my money all my little savings and deserted me He s gone my money s gone my dear money my dear dear gold pieces that I ve worked so hard for Oh to have deserted me gone for good gone and never coming back gone with my gold pieces Gone gone gone I ll never see them again and I ve worked so hard so so hard for him for them No no NO it s not true It IS true What will become of me now Oh if you ll only come back you can have all the money half of it Oh give me back my money Give me back my money and I ll forgive you You can leave me then if you want to Oh my money Mac Mac you ve gone for good You don t love me any more and now I m a beggar My money s gone my husband s gone gone gone gone Her grief was terrible She dug her nails into her scalp and clutching the heavy coils of her thick black hair tore it again and again She struck her forehead with her clenched fists Her little body shook from head to foot with the violence of her sobbing She ground her small teeth together and beat her head upon the floor with all her strength Her hair was uncoiled and hanging a tangled dishevelled mass far below her waist her dress was torn a spot of blood was upon her forehead her eyes were swollen her cheeks flamed vermilion from the fever that raged in her veins Old Miss Baker found her thus towards five o clock the next morning What had happened between one o clock and dawn of that fearful night Trina never remembered She could only recall herself as in a picture kneeling before her broken and rifled trunk and then weeks later so it seemed to her she woke to find herself in her own bed with an iced bandage about her forehead and the little old dressmaker at her side stroking her hot dry palm The facts of the matter were that the German woman who lived below had been awakened some hours after midnight by the sounds of Trina s weeping She had come upstairs and into the room to find Trina stretched face downward upon the floor half conscious and sobbing in the throes of an hysteria for which there was no relief The woman terrified had called her husband and between them they had got Trina upon the bed Then the German woman happened to remember that Trina had friends in the big flat near by and had sent her husband to fetch the retired dressmaker while she herself remained behind to undress Trina and put her to bed Miss Baker had come over at once and began to cry herself at the sight of the dentist s poor little wife She did not stop to ask what the trouble was and indeed it would have been useless to attempt to get any coherent explanation from Trina at that time Miss Baker had sent the German woman s husband to get some ice at one of the all night restaurants of the street had kept cold wet towels on Trina s head had combed and recombed her wonderful thick hair and had sat down by the side of the bed holding her hot hand with its poor maimed fingers waiting patiently until Trina should be able to speak Towards morning Trina awoke or perhaps it was a mere regaining of consciousness looked a moment at Miss Baker then about the room until her eyes fell upon her trunk with its broken lock Then she turned over upon the pillow and began to sob again She refused to answer any of the little dressmaker s questions shaking her head violently her face hidden in the pillow By breakfast time her fever had increased to such a point that Miss Baker took matters into her own hands and had the German woman call a doctor He arrived some twenty minutes later He was a big kindly fellow who lived over the drug store on the corner He had a deep voice and a tremendous striding gait less suggestive of a physician than of a sergeant of a cavalry troop By the time of his arrival little Miss Baker had divined intuitively the entire trouble She heard the doctor s swinging tramp in the entry below and heard the German woman saying Righd oop der stairs at der back of der halle Der room mit der door oppen Miss Baker met the doctor at the landing she told him in a whisper of the trouble Her husband s deserted her I m afraid doctor and took all of her money a good deal of it It s about killed the poor child She was out of her head a good deal of the night and now she s got a raging fever The doctor and Miss Baker returned to the room and entered closing the door The big doctor stood for a moment looking down at Trina rolling her head from side to side upon the pillow her face scarlet her enormous mane of hair spread out on either side of her The little dressmaker remained at his elbow looking from him to Trina Poor little woman said the doctor poor little woman Miss Baker pointed to the trunk whispering See there s where she kept her savings See he broke the lock Well missus McTeague said the doctor sitting down by the bed and taking Trina s wrist a little fever eh Trina opened her eyes and looked at him and then at Miss Baker She did not seem in the least surprised at the unfamiliar faces She appeared to consider it all as a matter of course Yes she said with a long tremulous breath I have a fever and my head my head aches and aches The doctor prescribed rest and mild opiates Then his eye fell upon the fingers of Trina s right hand He looked at them sharply A deep red glow unmistakable to a physician s eyes was upon some of them extending from the finger tips up to the second knuckle Hello he exclaimed what s the matter here In fact something was very wrong indeed For days Trina had noticed it The fingers of her right hand had swollen as never before aching and discolored Cruelly lacerated by McTeague s brutality as they were she had nevertheless gone on about her work on the Noah s ark animals constantly in contact with the non poisonous paint She told as much to the doctor in answer to his questions He shook his head with an exclamation Why this is blood poisoning you know he told her the worst kind You ll have to have those fingers amputated beyond a doubt or lose the entire hand or even worse And my work exclaimed Trina CHAPTER nineteen One can hold a scrubbing brush with two good fingers and the stumps of two others even if both joints of the thumb are gone but it takes considerable practice to get used to it Trina became a scrub woman She had taken council of Selina and through her had obtained the position of caretaker in a little memorial kindergarten over on Pacific Street Like Polk Street it was an accommodation street but running through a much poorer and more sordid quarter Trina had a little room over the kindergarten schoolroom It was not an unpleasant room It looked out upon a sunny little court floored with boards and used as the children s playground Two great cherry trees grew here the leaves almost brushing against the window of Trina s room and filtering the sunlight so that it fell in round golden spots upon the floor of the room Like gold pieces Trina said to herself Trina s work consisted in taking care of the kindergarten rooms scrubbing the floors washing the windows dusting and airing and carrying out the ashes Besides this she earned some five dollars a month by washing down the front steps of some big flats on Washington Street and by cleaning out vacant houses after the tenants had left She saw no one Nobody knew her She went about her work from dawn to dark and often entire days passed when she did not hear the sound of her own voice She was alone a solitary abandoned woman lost in the lowest eddies of the great city s tide the tide that always ebbs When Trina had been discharged from the hospital after the operation on her fingers she found herself alone in the world alone with her five thousand dollars The interest of this would support her and yet allow her to save a little But for a time Trina had thought of giving up the fight altogether and of joining her family in the southern part of the State But even while she hesitated about this she received a long letter from her mother an answer to one she herself had written just before the amputation of her right hand fingers the last letter she would ever be able to write missus Sieppe s letter was one long lamentation she had her own misfortunes to bewail as well as those of her daughter The carpet cleaning and upholstery business had failed mister Sieppe and Owgooste had left for New Zealand with a colonization company whither missus Sieppe and the twins were to follow them as soon as the colony established itself So far from helping Trina in her ill fortune it was she her mother who might some day in the near future be obliged to turn to Trina for aid So Trina had given up the idea of any help from her family For that matter she needed none She still had her five thousand and Uncle Oelbermann paid her the interest with a machine like regularity Now that McTeague had left her there was one less mouth to feed and with this saving together with the little she could earn as scrub woman Trina could almost manage to make good the amount she lost by being obliged to cease work upon the Noah s ark animals Little by little her sorrow over the loss of her precious savings overcame the grief of McTeague s desertion of her Her avarice had grown to be her one dominant passion her love of money for the money s sake brooded in her heart driving out by degrees every other natural affection She grew thin and meagre her flesh clove tight to her small skeleton her small pale mouth and little uplifted chin grew to have a certain feline eagerness of expression her long narrow eyes glistened continually as if they caught and held the glint of metal One day as she sat in her room the empty brass match box and the limp chamois bag in her hands she suddenly exclaimed I could have forgiven him if he had only gone away and left me my money I could have yes I could have forgiven him even THIS she looked at the stumps of her fingers But now her teeth closed tight and her eyes flashed now I ll never forgive him as long as I live The empty bag and the hollow light match box troubled her Day after day she took them from her trunk and wept over them as other women weep over a dead baby s shoe Her four hundred dollars were gone were gone were gone She would never see them again She could plainly see her husband spending her savings by handfuls squandering her beautiful gold pieces that she had been at such pains to polish with soap and ashes The thought filled her with an unspeakable anguish She would wake at night from a dream of McTeague revelling down her money and ask of the darkness How much did he spend to day How many of the gold pieces are left Has he broken either of the two twenty dollar pieces yet What did he spend it for The instant she was out of the hospital Trina had begun to save again but now it was with an eagerness that amounted at times to a veritable frenzy She even denied herself lights and fuel in order to put by a quarter or so grudging every penny she was obliged to spend She did her own washing and cooking Finally she sold her wedding dress that had hitherto lain in the bottom of her trunk The day she moved from Zerkow s old house she came suddenly upon the dentist s concertina under a heap of old clothes in the closet Within twenty minutes she had sold it to the dealer in second hand furniture returning to her room with seven dollars in her pocket happy for the first time since McTeague had left her But for all that the match box and the bag refused to fill up after three weeks of the most rigid economy they contained but eighteen dollars and some small change What was that compared with four hundred Trina told herself that she must have her money in hand She longed to see again the heap of it upon her work table where she could plunge her hands into it her face into it feeling the cool smooth metal upon her cheeks At such moments she would see in her imagination her wonderful five thousand dollars piled in columns shining and gleaming somewhere at the bottom of Uncle Oelbermann s vault She would look at the paper that Uncle Oelbermann had given her and tell herself that it represented five thousand dollars But in the end this ceased to satisfy her she must have the money itself She must have her four hundred dollars back again there in her trunk in her bag and her match box where she could touch it and see it whenever she desired At length she could stand it no longer and one day presented herself before Uncle Oelbermann as he sat in his office in the wholesale toy store and told him she wanted to have four hundred dollars of her money But this is very irregular you know missus McTeague said the great man Not business like at all But his niece s misfortunes and the sight of her poor maimed hand appealed to him He opened his check book You understand of course he said that this will reduce the amount of your interest by just so much I know I know I ve thought of that said Trina Four hundred did you say remarked Uncle Oelbermann taking the cap from his fountain pen Yes four hundred exclaimed Trina quickly her eyes glistening Trina cashed the check and returned home with the money all in twenty dollar pieces as she had desired in an ecstasy of delight For half of that night she sat up playing with her money counting it and recounting it polishing the duller pieces until they shone Altogether there were twenty twenty dollar gold pieces Oh h you beauties murmured Trina running her palms over them fairly quivering with pleasure You beauties IS there anything prettier than a twenty dollar gold piece You dear dear money Oh don t I LOVE you Mine mine mine all of you mine She laid them out in a row on the ledge of the table or arranged them in patterns triangles circles and squares or built them all up into a pyramid which she afterward overthrew for the sake of hearing the delicious clink of the pieces tumbling against each other Then at last she put them away in the brass match box and chamois bag delighted beyond words that they were once more full and heavy Then a few days after the thought of the money still remaining in Uncle Oelbermann s keeping returned to her It was hers all hers all that four thousand six hundred She could have as much of it or as little of it as she chose She only had to ask For a week Trina resisted knowing very well that taking from her capital was proportionately reducing her monthly income Then at last she yielded Just to make it an even five hundred anyhow she told herself That day she drew a hundred dollars more in twenty dollar gold pieces as before From that time Trina began to draw steadily upon her capital a little at a time It was a passion with her a mania a veritable mental disease a temptation such as drunkards only know It would come upon her all of a sudden While she was about her work scrubbing the floor of some vacant house or in her room in the morning as she made her coffee on the oil stove or when she woke in the night a brusque access of cupidity would seize upon her Her cheeks flushed her eyes glistened her breath came short At times she would leave her work just as it was put on her old bonnet of black straw throw her shawl about her and go straight to Uncle Oelbermann s store and draw against her money Now it would be a hundred dollars now sixty now she would content herself with only twenty and once after a fortnight s abstinence she permitted herself a positive debauch of five hundred Little by little she drew her capital from Uncle Oelbermann and little by little her original interest of twenty five dollars a month dwindled One day she presented herself again in the office of the whole sale toy store Will you let me have a check for two hundred dollars Uncle Oelbermann she said The great man laid down his fountain pen and leaned back in his swivel chair with great deliberation I don t understand missus McTeague he said Every week you come here and draw out a little of your money I ve told you that it is not at all regular or business like for me to let you have it this way And more than this it s a great inconvenience to me to give you these checks at unstated times If you wish to draw out the whole amount let s have some understanding Draw it in monthly installments of say five hundred dollars or else he added abruptly draw it all at once now to day I would even prefer it that way Otherwise it s it s annoying Come shall I draw you a check for thirty seven hundred and have it over and done with No no cried Trina with instinctive apprehension refusing she did not know why No I ll leave it with you I won t draw out any more She took her departure but paused on the pavement outside the store and stood for a moment lost in thought her eyes beginning to glisten and her breath coming short Slowly she turned about and reentered the store she came back into the office and stood trembling at the corner of Uncle Oelbermann s desk He looked up sharply Twice Trina tried to get her voice and when it did come to her she could hardly recognize it Between breaths she said Yes all right I ll you can give me will you give me a check for thirty seven hundred Give me ALL of my money A few hours later she entered her little room over the kindergarten bolted the door with shaking fingers and emptied a heavy canvas sack upon the middle of her bed Then she opened her trunk and taking thence the brass match box and chamois skin bag added their contents to the pile Next she laid herself upon the bed and gathered the gleaming heaps of gold pieces to her with both arms burying her face in them with long sighs of unspeakable delight It was a little past noon and the day was fine and warm The leaves of the huge cherry trees threw off a certain pungent aroma that entered through the open window together with long thin shafts of golden sunlight Below in the kindergarten the children were singing gayly and marching to the jangling of the piano Trina heard nothing saw nothing She lay on her bed her eyes closed her face buried in a pile of gold that she encircled with both her arms Trina even told herself at last that she was happy once more McTeague became a memory a memory that faded a little every day dim and indistinct in the golden splendor of five thousand dollars And yet Trina would say I did love Mac loved him dearly only a little while ago Even when he hurt me it only made me love him more How is it I ve changed so sudden How COULD I forget him so soon It must be because he stole my money That is it I couldn t forgive anyone that no not even my MOTHER And I never never will forgive him What had become of her husband Trina did not know She never saw any of the old Polk Street people There was no way she could have news of him even if she had cared to have it She had her money that was the main thing Her passion for it excluded every other sentiment There it was in the bottom of her trunk in the canvas sack the chamois skin bag and the little brass match safe Not a day passed that Trina did not have it out where she could see and touch it One evening she had even spread all the gold pieces between the sheets and had then gone to bed stripping herself and had slept all night upon the money taking a strange and ecstatic pleasure in the touch of the smooth flat pieces the length of her entire body One night some three months after she had come to live at the kindergarten Trina was awakened by a sharp tap on the pane of the window She sat up quickly in bed her heart beating thickly her eyes rolling wildly in the direction of her trunk The tap was repeated Trina rose and went fearfully to the window The little court below was bright with moonlight and standing just on the edge of the shadow thrown by one of the cherry trees was McTeague A bunch of half ripe cherries was in his hand He was eating them and throwing the pits at the window As he caught sight of her he made an eager sign for her to raise the sash Reluctant and wondering Trina obeyed and the dentist came quickly forward He was wearing a pair of blue overalls a navy blue flannel shirt without a cravat an old coat faded rain washed and ripped at the seams and his woollen cap Say Trina he exclaimed his heavy bass voice pitched just above a whisper let me in will you huh Say will you I m regularly starving and I haven t slept in a Christian bed for two weeks At sight at him standing there in the moonlight Trina could only think of him as the man who had beaten and bitten her had deserted her and stolen her money had made her suffer as she had never suffered before in all her life Now that he had spent the money that he had stolen from her he was whining to come back so that he might steal more no doubt Once in her room he could not help but smell out her five thousand dollars Her indignation rose No she whispered back at him No I will not let you in But listen here Trina I tell you I am starving regularly Hoh interrupted Trina scornfully A man can t starve with four hundred dollars I guess Well well I well faltered the dentist Never mind now Give me something to eat an let me in an sleep I ve been sleeping in the Plaza for the last ten nights and say I Damn it Trina I ain t had anything to eat since Where s the four hundred dollars you robbed me of when you deserted me returned Trina coldly Well I ve spent it growled the dentist But you CAN T see me starve Trina no matter what s happened Give me a little money then I ll see you starve before you get any more of MY money The dentist stepped back a pace and stared up at her wonder stricken His face was lean and pinched Never had the jaw bone looked so enormous nor the square cut head so huge The moonlight made deep black shadows in the shrunken cheeks Huh asked the dentist puzzled What did you say I won t give you any money never again not a cent But do you know that I m hungry Well I ve been hungry myself Besides I DON T believe you Trina I ain t had a thing to eat since yesterday morning that s God s truth Even if I did get off with your money you CAN T see me starve can you You can t see me walk the streets all night because I ain t got a place to sleep Will you let me in Say will you Huh No Well will you give me some money then just a little Give me a dollar Give me half a dol Say give me a DIME an I can get a cup of coffee No The dentist paused and looked at her with curious intentness bewildered nonplussed Say you you must be crazy Trina I I wouldn t let a DOG go hungry Not even if he d bitten you perhaps The dentist stared again There was another pause McTeague looked up at her in silence a mean and vicious twinkle coming into his small eyes He uttered a low exclamation and then checked himself Well look here for the last time I m starving I ve got nowhere to sleep Will you give me some money or something to eat Will you let me in No no no Trina could fancy she almost saw the brassy glint in her husband s eyes He raised one enormous lean fist Then he growled If I had hold of you for a minute by God I d make you dance An I will yet I will yet Don t you be afraid of that He turned about the moonlight showing like a layer of snow upon his massive shoulders Trina watched him as he passed under the shadow of the cherry trees and crossed the little court She heard his great feet grinding on the board flooring He disappeared Miser though she was Trina was only human and the echo of the dentist s heavy feet had not died away before she began to be sorry for what she had done She stood by the open window in her nightgown her finger upon her lips He did looked pinched she said half aloud Maybe he WAS hungry I ought to have given him something I wish I had I WISH I had Oh she cried suddenly with a frightened gesture of both hands what have I come to be that I would see Mac my husband that I would see him starve rather than give him money No no It s too dreadful I WILL give him some I ll send it to him to morrow Where well he ll come back She leaned from the window and called as loudly as she dared Mac oh Mac There was no answer When McTeague had told Trina he had been without food for nearly two days he was speaking the truth The week before he had spent the last of the four hundred dollars in the bar of a sailor s lodging house near the water front and since that time had lived a veritable hand to mouth existence He had spent her money here and there about the city in royal fashion absolutely reckless of the morrow feasting and drinking for the most part with companions he picked up heaven knows where acquaintances of twenty four hours whose names he forgot in two days Then suddenly he found himself at the end of his money He no longer had any friends Hunger rode him and rowelled him He was no longer well fed comfortable There was no longer a warm place for him to sleep He went back to Polk Street in the evening walking on the dark side of the street lurking in the shadows ashamed to have any of his old time friends see him He entered Zerkow s old house and knocked at the door of the room Trina and he had occupied It was empty Next day he went to Uncle Oelbermann s store and asked news of Trina Trina had not told Uncle Oelbermann of McTeague s brutalities giving him other reasons to explain the loss of her fingers neither had she told him of her husband s robbery So when the dentist had asked where Trina could be found Uncle Oelbermann believing that McTeague was seeking a reconciliation had told him without hesitation and he added She was in here only yesterday and drew out the balance of her money She s been drawing against her money for the last month or so She s got it all now I guess Ah she s got it all The dentist went away from his bootless visit to his wife shaking with rage hating her with all the strength of a crude and primitive nature He clenched his fists till his knuckles whitened his teeth ground furiously upon one another Ah if I had hold of you once I d make you dance She had five thousand dollars in that room while I stood there not twenty feet away and told her I was starving and she wouldn t give me a dime to get a cup of coffee with not a dime to get a cup of coffee Oh if I once get my hands on you His wrath strangled him He clutched at the darkness in front of him his breath fairly whistling between his teeth That night he walked the streets until the morning wondering what now he was to do to fight the wolf away The morning of the next day towards ten o clock he was on Kearney Street still walking still tramping the streets since there was nothing else for him to do By and by he paused on a corner near a music store finding a momentary amusement in watching two or three men loading a piano upon a dray Already half its weight was supported by the dray s backboard One of the men a big mulatto almost hidden under the mass of glistening rosewood was guiding its course while the other two heaved and tugged in the rear Something in the street frightened the horses and they shied abruptly The end of the piano was twitched sharply from the backboard There was a cry the mulatto staggered and fell with the falling piano and its weight dropped squarely upon his thigh which broke with a resounding crack An hour later McTeague had found his job The music store engaged him as handler at six dollars a week McTeague s enormous strength useless all his life stood him in good stead at last He slept in a tiny back room opening from the storeroom of the music store He was in some sense a watchman as well as handler and went the rounds of the store twice every night His room was a box of a place that reeked with odors of stale tobacco smoke The former occupant had papered the walls with newspapers and had pasted up figures cut out from the posters of some Kiralfy ballet very gaudy By the one window chittering all day in its little gilt prison hung the canary bird a tiny atom of life that McTeague still clung to with a strange obstinacy McTeague drank a good deal of whiskey in these days but the only effect it had upon him was to increase the viciousness and bad temper that had developed in him since the beginning of his misfortunes He terrorized his fellow handlers powerful men though they were For a gruff word for an awkward movement in lading the pianos for a surly look or a muttered oath the dentist s elbow would crook and his hand contract to a mallet like fist As often as not the blow followed colossal in its force swift as the leap of the piston from its cylinder His hatred of Trina increased from day to day He d make her dance yet Wait only till he got his hands upon her She d let him starve would she She d turn him out of doors while she hid her five thousand dollars in the bottom of her trunk Aha he would see about that some day She couldn t make small of him Ah no She d dance all right all right McTeague was not an imaginative man by nature but he would lie awake nights his clumsy wits galloping and frisking under the lash of the alcohol and fancy himself thrashing his wife till a sudden frenzy of rage would overcome him and he would shake all over rolling upon the bed and biting the mattress On a certain day about a week after Christmas of that year McTeague was on one of the top floors of the music store where the second hand instruments were kept helping to move about and rearrange some old pianos As he passed by one of the counters he paused abruptly his eye caught by an object that was strangely familiar Say he inquired addressing the clerk in charge say where d this come from Why let s see We got that from a second hand store up on Polk Street I guess It s a fairly good machine a little tinkering with the stops and a bit of shellac and we ll make it about s good as new Good tone See And the clerk drew a long sonorous wail from the depths of McTeague s old concertina Well it s mine growled the dentist The other laughed It s yours for eleven dollars It s mine persisted McTeague I want it Go long with you Mac What do you mean I mean that it s mine that s what I mean You got no right to it It was STOLEN from me that s what I mean he added a sullen anger flaming up in his little eyes The clerk raised a shoulder and put the concertina on an upper shelf You talk to the boss about that t ain t none of my affair If you want to buy it it s eleven dollars The dentist had been paid off the day before and had four dollars in his wallet at the moment He gave the money to the clerk Here there s part of the money You you put that concertina aside for me an I ll give you the rest in a week or so I ll give it to you tomorrow he exclaimed struck with a sudden idea McTeague had sadly missed his concertina Sunday afternoons when there was no work to be done he was accustomed to lie flat on his back on his springless bed in the little room in the rear of the music store his coat and shoes off reading the paper drinking steam beer from a pitcher and smoking his pipe But he could no longer play his six lugubrious airs upon his concertina and it was a deprivation He often wondered where it was gone It had been lost no doubt in the general wreck of his fortunes Once even the dentist had taken a concertina from the lot kept by the music store It was a Sunday and no one was about But he found he could not play upon it The stops were arranged upon a system he did not understand Now his own concertina was come back to him He would buy it back He had given the clerk four dollars He knew where he would get the remaining seven The clerk had told him the concertina had been sold on Polk Street to the second hand store there Trina had sold it McTeague knew it Trina had sold his concertina had stolen it and sold it his concertina his beloved concertina that he had had all his life Why barring the canary there was not one of all his belongings that McTeague had cherished more dearly His steel engraving of Lorenzo de Medici and his Court might be lost his stone pug dog might go but his concertina And she sold it stole it from me and sold it Just because I happened to forget to take it along with me Well we ll just see about that You ll give me the money to buy it back or His rage loomed big within him His hatred of Trina came back upon him like a returning surge He saw her small prim mouth her narrow blue eyes her black mane of hair and up tilted chin and hated her the more because of them Aha he d show her he d make her dance He d get that seven dollars from her or he d know the reason why He went through his work that day heaving and hauling at the ponderous pianos handling them with the ease of a lifting crane impatient for the coming of evening when he could be left to his own devices As often as he had a moment to spare he went down the street to the nearest saloon and drank a pony of whiskey Now and then as he fought and struggled with the vast masses of ebony rosewood and mahogany on the upper floor of the music store raging and chafing at their inertness and unwillingness while the whiskey pirouetted in his brain he would mutter to himself An I got to do this I got to work like a dray horse while she sits at home by her stove and counts her money and sells my concertina Six o clock came Instead of supper McTeague drank some more whiskey five ponies in rapid succession After supper he was obliged to go out with the dray to deliver a concert grand at the Odd Fellows Hall where a piano recital was to take place Ain t you coming back with us asked one of the handlers as he climbed upon the driver s seat after the piano had been put in place No no returned the dentist I got something else to do The brilliant lights of a saloon near the City Hall caught his eye He decided he would have another drink of whiskey It was about eight o clock The following day was to be a fete day at the kindergarten the Christmas and New Year festivals combined All that afternoon the little two story building on Pacific Street had been filled with a number of grand ladies of the Kindergarten Board who were hanging up ropes of evergreen and sprays of holly and arranging a great Christmas tree that stood in the centre of the ring in the schoolroom The whole place was pervaded with a pungent piney odor Trina had been very busy since the early morning coming and going at everybody s call now running down the street after another tack hammer or a fresh supply of cranberries now tying together the ropes of evergreen and passing them up to one of the grand ladies as she carefully balanced herself on a step ladder By evening everything was in place As the last grand lady left the school she gave Trina an extra dollar for her work and said Now if you ll just tidy up here missus McTeague I think that will be all Sweep up the pine needles here you see they are all over the floor and look through all the rooms and tidy up generally Good night and a Happy New Year she cried pleasantly as she went out Trina put the dollar away in her trunk before she did anything else and cooked herself a bit of supper Then she came downstairs again The kindergarten was not large On the lower floor were but two rooms the main schoolroom and another room a cloakroom very small where the children hung their hats and coats This cloakroom opened off the back of the main schoolroom Trina cast a critical glance into both of these rooms There had been a great deal of going and coming in them during the day and she decided that the first thing to do would be to scrub the floors She went up again to her room overhead and heated some water over her oil stove then re descending set to work vigorously By nine o clock she had almost finished with the schoolroom She was down on her hands and knees in the midst of a steaming muck of soapy water On her feet were a pair of man s shoes fastened with buckles a dirty cotton gown damp with the water clung about her shapeless stunted figure From time to time she sat back on her heels to ease the strain of her position and with one smoking hand white and parboiled with the hot water brushed her hair already streaked with gray out of her weazened pale face and the corners of her mouth It was very quiet A gas jet without a globe lit up the place with a crude raw light The cat who lived on the premises preferring to be dirty rather than to be wet had got into the coal scuttle and over its rim watched her sleepily with a long complacent purr All at once he stopped purring leaving an abrupt silence in the air like the sudden shutting off of a stream of water while his eyes grew wide two lambent disks of yellow in the heap of black fur Who is there cried Trina sitting back on her heels In the stillness that succeeded the water dripped from her hands with the steady tick of a clock Then a brutal fist swung open the street door of the schoolroom and McTeague came in He was drunk not with that drunkenness which is stupid maudlin wavering on its feet but with that which is alert unnaturally intelligent vicious perfectly steady deadly wicked Trina only had to look once at him and in an instant with some strange sixth sense born of the occasion knew what she had to expect She jumped up and ran from him into the little cloakroom She locked and bolted the door after her and leaned her weight against it panting and trembling every nerve shrinking and quivering with the fear of him McTeague put his hand on the knob of the door outside and opened it tearing off the lock and bolt guard and sending her staggering across the room Mac she cried to him as he came in speaking with horrid rapidity cringing and holding out her hands Mac listen Wait a minute look here listen here It wasn t my fault I ll give you some money You can come back I ll do ANYTHING you want Won t you just LISTEN to me Oh don t I ll scream I can t help it you know The people will hear McTeague came towards her slowly his immense feet dragging and grinding on the floor his enormous fists hard as wooden mallets swinging at his sides Trina backed from him to the corner of the room cowering before him holding her elbow crooked in front of her face watching him with fearful intentness ready to dodge I want that money he said pausing in front of her What money cried Trina I want that money You got it that five thousand dollars I want every nickel of it You understand I haven t it It isn t here Uncle Oelbermann s got it That s a lie He told me that you came and got it You ve had it long enough now I want it Do you hear Mac I can t give you that money I I WON T give it to you Trina cried with sudden resolution Yes you will You ll give me every nickel of it No NO You ain t going to make small of me this time Give me that money NO For the last time will you give me that money No You won t huh You won t give me it For the last time No NO Usually the dentist was slow in his movements but now the alcohol had awakened in him an ape like agility He kept his small eyes upon her and all at once sent his fist into the middle of her face with the suddenness of a relaxed spring Beside herself with terror Trina turned and fought him back fought for her miserable life with the exasperation and strength of a harassed cat and with such energy and such wild unnatural force that even McTeague for the moment drew back from her But her resistance was the one thing to drive him to the top of his fury He came back at her again his eyes drawn to two fine twinkling points and his enormous fists clenched till the knuckles whitened raised in the air Then it became abominable In the schoolroom outside behind the coal scuttle the cat listened to the sounds of stamping and struggling and the muffled noise of blows wildly terrified his eyes bulging like brass knobs At last the sounds stopped on a sudden he heard nothing more Then McTeague came out closing the door The cat followed him with distended eyes as he crossed the room and disappeared through the street door The dentist paused for a moment on the sidewalk looking carefully up and down the street It was deserted and quiet He turned sharply to the right and went down a narrow passage that led into the little court yard behind the school A candle was burning in Trina s room He went up by the outside stairway and entered The trunk stood locked in one corner of the room The dentist took the lid lifter from the little oil stove put it underneath the lock clasp and wrenched it open Groping beneath a pile of dresses he found the chamois skin bag the little brass match box and at the very bottom carefully thrust into one corner the canvas sack crammed to the mouth with twenty dollar gold pieces He emptied the chamois skin bag and the matchbox into the pockets of his trousers But the canvas sack was too bulky to hide about his clothes I guess I ll just naturally have to carry YOU he muttered He blew out the candle closed the door and gained the street again The dentist crossed the city going back to the music store It was a little after eleven o clock The night was moonless filled with a gray blur of faint light that seemed to come from all quarters of the horizon at once From time to time there were sudden explosions of a southeast wind at the street corners McTeague went on slanting his head against the gusts to keep his cap from blowing off carrying the sack close to his side Once he looked critically at the sky I bet it ll rain to morrow he muttered if this wind works round to the south Once in his little den behind the music store he washed his hands and forearms and put on his working clothes blue overalls and a jumper over cheap trousers and vest Then he got together his small belongings an old campaign hat a pair of boots a tin of tobacco and a pinchbeck bracelet which he had found one Sunday in the Park and which he believed to be valuable He stripped his blanket from his bed and rolled up in it all these objects together with the canvas sack fastening the roll with a half hitch such as miners use the instincts of the old time car boy coming back to him in his present confusion of mind He changed his pipe and his knife a huge jackknife with a yellowed bone handle to the pockets of his overalls Then at last he stood with his hand on the door holding up the lamp before blowing it out looking about to make sure he was ready to go The wavering light woke his canary It stirred and began to chitter feebly very sleepy and cross at being awakened McTeague started staring at it and reflecting He believed that it would be a long time before anyone came into that room again The canary would be days without food it was likely it would starve would die there hour by hour in its little gilt prison McTeague resolved to take it with him He took down the cage touching it gently with his enormous hands and tied a couple of sacks about it to shelter the little bird from the sharp night wind Then he went out locking all the doors behind him and turned toward the ferry slips The boats had ceased running hours ago but he told himself that by waiting till four o clock he could get across the bay on the tug that took over the morning papers Trina lay unconscious just as she had fallen under the last of McTeague s blows her body twitching with an occasional hiccough that stirred the pool of blood in which she lay face downward Towards morning she died with a rapid series of hiccoughs that sounded like a piece of clockwork running down The thing had been done in the cloakroom where the kindergarten children hung their hats and coats There was no other entrance except by going through the main schoolroom McTeague going out had shut the door of the cloakroom but had left the street door open so when the children arrived in the morning they entered as usual About half past eight two or three five year olds one a little colored girl came into the schoolroom of the kindergarten with a great chatter of voices going across to the cloakroom to hang up their hats and coats as they had been taught Half way across the room one of them stopped and put her small nose in the air crying Um o o what a funnee smell The others began to sniff the air as well and one the daughter of a butcher exclaimed Tsmells like my pa s shop adding in the next breath Look what s the matter with the kittee In fact the cat was acting strangely He lay quite flat on the floor his nose pressed close to the crevice under the door of the little cloakroom winding his tail slowly back and forth excited very eager At times he would draw back and make a strange little clacking noise down in his throat Ain t he funnee said the little girl again The cat slunk swiftly away as the children came up Then the tallest of the little girls swung the door of the little cloakroom wide open and they all ran in CHAPTER twenty The day was very hot and the silence of high noon lay close and thick between the steep slopes of the canyons like an invisible muffling fluid At intervals the drone of an insect bored the air and trailed slowly to silence again Everywhere were pungent aromatic smells The vast moveless heat seemed to distil countless odors from the brush odors of warm sap of pine needles and of tar weed and above all the medicinal odor of witch hazel As far as one could look uncounted multitudes of trees and manzanita bushes were quietly and motionlessly growing growing growing A tremendous immeasurable Life pushed steadily heavenward without a sound without a motion At turns of the road on the higher points canyons disclosed themselves far away gigantic grooves in the landscape deep blue in the distance opening one into another ocean deep silent huge and suggestive of colossal primeval forces held in reserve At their bottoms they were solid massive on their crests they broke delicately into fine serrated edges where the pines and redwoods outlined their million of tops against the high white horizon Here and there the mountains lifted themselves out of the narrow river beds in groups like giant lions rearing their heads after drinking The entire region was untamed In some places east of the Mississippi nature is cosey intimate small and homelike like a good natured housewife In Placer County California she is a vast unconquered brute of the Pliocene epoch savage sullen and magnificently indifferent to man But there were men in these mountains like lice on mammoths hides fighting them stubbornly now with hydraulic monitors now with drill and dynamite boring into the vitals of them or tearing away great yellow gravelly scars in the flanks of them sucking their blood extracting gold Here and there at long distances upon the canyon sides rose the headgear of a mine surrounded with its few unpainted houses and topped by its never failing feather of black smoke On near approach one heard the prolonged thunder of the stamp mill the crusher the insatiable monster gnashing the rocks to powder with its long iron teeth vomiting them out again in a thin stream of wet gray mud Its enormous maw fed night and day with the car boys loads gorged itself with gravel and spat out the gold grinding the rocks between its jaws glutted as it were with the very entrails of the earth and growling over its endless meal like some savage animal some legendary dragon some fabulous beast symbol of inordinate and monstrous gluttony McTeague had left the Overland train at Colfax and the same afternoon had ridden some eight miles across the mountains in the stage that connects Colfax with Iowa Hill Iowa Hill was a small one street town the headquarters of the mines of the district Originally it had been built upon the summit of a mountain but the sides of this mountain have long since been hydrau licked away so that the town now clings to a mere back bone and the rear windows of the houses on both sides of the street look down over sheer precipices into vast pits hundreds of feet deep The dentist stayed over night at the Hill and the next morning started off on foot farther into the mountains He still wore his blue overalls and jumper his woollen cap was pulled down over his eye on his feet were hob nailed boots he had bought at the store in Colfax his blanket roll was over his back in his left hand swung the bird cage wrapped in sacks Just outside the town he paused as if suddenly remembering something There ought to be a trail just off the road here he muttered There used to be a trail a short cut The next instant without moving from his position he saw where it opened just before him His instinct had halted him at the exact spot The trail zigzagged down the abrupt descent of the canyon debouching into a gravelly river bed Indian River muttered the dentist I remember I remember I ought to hear the Morning Star s stamps from here He cocked his head A low sustained roar like a distant cataract came to his ears from across the river That s right he said contentedly He crossed the river and regained the road beyond The slope rose under his feet a little farther on he passed the Morning Star mine smoking and thundering McTeague pushed steadily on The road rose with the rise of the mountain turned at a sharp angle where a great live oak grew and held level for nearly a quarter of a mile Twice again the dentist left the road and took to the trail that cut through deserted hydraulic pits He knew exactly where to look for these trails not once did his instinct deceive him He recognized familiar points at once Here was Cold canyon where invariably winter and summer a chilly wind was blowing here was where the road to Spencer s branched off here was Bussy s old place where at one time there were so many dogs here was Delmue s cabin where unlicensed whiskey used to be sold here was the plank bridge with its one rotten board and here the flat overgrown with manzanita where he once had shot three quail At noon after he had been tramping for some two hours he halted at a point where the road dipped suddenly A little to the right of him and flanking the road an enormous yellow gravel pit like an emptied lake gaped to heaven Farther on in the distance a canyon zigzagged toward the horizon rugged with pine clad mountain crests Nearer at hand and directly in the line of the road was an irregular cluster of unpainted cabins A dull prolonged roar vibrated in the air McTeague nodded his head as if satisfied That s the place he muttered He reshouldered his blanket roll and descended the road At last he halted again He stood before a low one story building differing from the others in that it was painted A verandah shut in with mosquito netting surrounded it McTeague dropped his blanket roll on a lumber pile outside and came up and knocked at the open door Some one called to him to come in McTeague entered rolling his eyes about him noting the changes that had been made since he had last seen this place A partition had been knocked down making one big room out of the two former small ones A counter and railing stood inside the door There was a telephone on the wall In one corner he also observed a stack of surveyor s instruments a big drawing board straddled on spindle legs across one end of the room a mechanical drawing of some kind no doubt the plan of the mine unrolled upon it a chromo representing a couple of peasants in a ploughed field Millet s Angelus was nailed unframed upon the wall and hanging from the same wire nail that secured one of its corners in place was a bullion bag and a cartridge belt with a loaded revolver in the pouch The dentist approached the counter and leaned his elbows upon it Three men were in the room a tall lean young man with a thick head of hair surprisingly gray who was playing with a half grown great Dane puppy another fellow about as young but with a jaw almost as salient as McTeague s stood at the letter press taking a copy of a letter a third man a little older than the other two was pottering over a transit This latter was massively built and wore overalls and low boots streaked and stained and spotted in every direction with gray mud The dentist looked slowly from one to the other then at length Is the foreman about he asked The man in the muddy overalls came forward What you want He spoke with a strong German accent The old invariable formula came back to McTeague on the instant What s the show for a job At once the German foreman became preoccupied looking aimlessly out of the window There was a silence You hev been miner alretty Yes yes Know how to hendle pick n shov le Yes I know The other seemed unsatisfied Are you a cousin Jack The dentist grinned This prejudice against Cornishmen he remembered too No American How long sence you mine Oh year or two Show your hends McTeague exhibited his hard callused palms When ken you go to work I want a chuck tender on der night shift I can tend a chuck I ll go on to night What s your name The dentist started He had forgotten to be prepared for this Huh What What s the name McTeague s eye was caught by a railroad calendar hanging over the desk There was no time to think Burlington he said loudly The German took a card from a file and wrote it down Give dis card to der boarding boss down at der boarding haus den gome find me bei der mill at sex o clock und I set you to work Straight as a homing pigeon and following a blind and unreasoned instinct McTeague had returned to the Big Dipper mine Within a week s time it seemed to him as though he had never been away He picked up his life again exactly where he had left it the day when his mother had sent him away with the travelling dentist the charlatan who had set up his tent by the bunk house The house McTeague had once lived in was still there occupied by one of the shift bosses and his family The dentist passed it on his way to and from the mine He himself slept in the bunk house with some thirty others of his shift At half past five in the evening the cook at the boarding house sounded a prolonged alarm upon a crowbar bent in the form of a triangle that hung upon the porch of the boarding house McTeague rose and dressed and with his shift had supper Their lunch pails were distributed to them Then he made his way to the tunnel mouth climbed into a car in the waiting ore train and was hauled into the mine Once inside the hot evening air turned to a cool dampness and the forest odors gave place to the smell of stale dynamite smoke suggestive of burning rubber A cloud of steam came from McTeague s mouth underneath the water swashed and rippled around the car wheels while the light from the miner s candlesticks threw wavering blurs of pale yellow over the gray rotting quartz of the roof and walls Occasionally McTeague bent down his head to avoid the lagging of the roof or the projections of an overhanging shute From car to car all along the line the miners called to one another as the train trundled along joshing and laughing A mile from the entrance the train reached the breast where McTeague s gang worked The men clambered from the cars and took up the labor where the day shift had left it burrowing their way steadily through a primeval river bed The candlesticks thrust into the crevices of the gravel strata lit up faintly the half dozen moving figures befouled with sweat and with wet gray mould The picks struck into the loose gravel with a yielding shock The long handled shovels clinked amidst the piles of bowlders and scraped dully in the heaps of rotten quartz The Burly drill boring for blasts broke out from time to time in an irregular chug chug chug chug while the engine that pumped the water from the mine coughed and strangled at short intervals McTeague tended the chuck In a way he was the assistant of the man who worked the Burly It was his duty to replace the drills in the Burly putting in longer ones as the hole got deeper and deeper From time to time he rapped the drill with a pole pick when it stuck fast or fitchered Once it even occurred to him that there was a resemblance between his present work and the profession he had been forced to abandon In the Burly drill he saw a queer counterpart of his old time dental engine and what were the drills and chucks but enormous hoe excavators hard bits and burrs It was the same work he had so often performed in his Parlors only magnified made monstrous distorted and grotesqued the caricature of dentistry He passed his nights thus in the midst of the play of crude and simple forces the powerful attacks of the Burly drills the great exertions of bared bent backs overlaid with muscle the brusque resistless expansion of dynamite and the silent vast Titanic force mysterious and slow that cracked the timbers supporting the roof of the tunnel and that gradually flattened the lagging till it was thin as paper The life pleased the dentist beyond words The still colossal mountains took him back again like a returning prodigal and vaguely without knowing why he yielded to their influence their immensity their enormous power crude and blind reflecting themselves in his own nature huge strong brutal in its simplicity And this though he only saw the mountains at night They appeared far different then than in the daytime At twelve o clock he came out of the mine and lunched on the contents of his dinner pail sitting upon the embankment of the track eating with both hands and looking around him with a steady ox like gaze The mountains rose sheer from every side heaving their gigantic crests far up into the night the black peaks crowding together and looking now less like beasts than like a company of cowled giants In the daytime they were silent but at night they seemed to stir and rouse themselves Occasionally the stamp mill stopped its thunder ceasing abruptly Then one could hear the noises that the mountains made in their living From the canyon from the crowding crests from the whole immense landscape there rose a steady and prolonged sound coming from all sides at once It was that incessant and muffled roar which disengages itself from all vast bodies from oceans from cities from forests from sleeping armies and which is like the breathing of an infinitely great monster alive palpitating McTeague returned to his work At six in the morning his shift was taken off and he went out of the mine and back to the bunk house All day long he slept flung at length upon the strong smelling blankets slept the dreamless sleep of exhaustion crushed and overpowered with the work flat and prone upon his belly till again in the evening the cook sounded the alarm upon the crowbar bent into a triangle Every alternate week the shifts were changed The second week McTeague s shift worked in the daytime and slept at night Wednesday night of this second week the dentist woke suddenly He sat up in his bed in the bunk house looking about him from side to side an alarm clock hanging on the wall over a lantern marked half past three What was it muttered the dentist I wonder what it was The rest of the shift were sleeping soundly filling the room with the rasping sound of snoring Everything was in its accustomed place nothing stirred But for all that McTeague got up and lit his miner s candlestick and went carefully about the room throwing the light into the dark corners peering under all the beds including his own Then he went to the door and stepped outside The night was warm and still the moon very low and canted on her side like a galleon foundering The camp was very quiet nobody was in sight I wonder what it was muttered the dentist There was something why did I wake up Huh He made a circuit about the bunk house unusually alert his small eyes twinkling rapidly seeing everything All was quiet An old dog who invariably slept on the steps of the bunk house had not even wakened McTeague went back to bed but did not sleep There was SOMETHING he muttered looking in a puzzled way at his canary in the cage that hung from the wall at his bedside something What was it There is something NOW There it is again the same thing He sat up in bed with eyes and ears strained What is it I don know what it is I don hear anything an I don see anything I feel something right now feel it now I wonder I don know I don know Once more he got up and this time dressed himself He made a complete tour of the camp looking and listening for what he did not know He even went to the outskirts of the camp and for nearly half an hour watched the road that led into the camp from the direction of Iowa Hill He saw nothing not even a rabbit stirred He went to bed But from this time on there was a change The dentist grew restless uneasy Suspicion of something he could not say what annoyed him incessantly He went wide around sharp corners At every moment he looked sharply over his shoulder He even went to bed with his clothes and cap on and at every hour during the night would get up and prowl about the bunk house one ear turned down the wind his eyes gimleting the darkness From time to time he would murmur There s something What is it I wonder what it is What strange sixth sense stirred in McTeague at this time What animal cunning what brute instinct clamored for recognition and obedience What lower faculty was it that roused his suspicion that drove him out into the night a score of times between dark and dawn his head in the air his eyes and ears keenly alert One night as he stood on the steps of the bunk house peering into the shadows of the camp he uttered an exclamation as of a man suddenly enlightened He turned back into the house drew from under his bed the blanket roll in which he kept his money hid and took the canary down from the wall He strode to the door and disappeared into the night When the sheriff of Placer County and the two deputies from San Francisco reached the Big Dipper mine McTeague had been gone two days CHAPTER twenty one Well said one of the deputies as he backed the horse into the shafts of the buggy in which the pursuers had driven over from the Hill we ve about as good as got him It isn t hard to follow a man who carries a bird cage with him wherever he goes McTeague crossed the mountains on foot the Friday and Saturday of that week going over through Emigrant Gap following the line of the Overland railroad He reached Reno Monday night By degrees a vague plan of action outlined itself in the dentist s mind Mexico he muttered to himself Mexico that s the place They ll watch the coast and they ll watch the Eastern trains but they won t think of Mexico The sense of pursuit which had harassed him during the last week of his stay at the Big Dipper mine had worn off and he believed himself to be very cunning I m pretty far ahead now I guess he said At Reno he boarded a south bound freight on the line of the Carson and Colorado railroad paying for a passage in the caboose Freights don run on schedule time he muttered and a conductor on a passenger train makes it his business to study faces I ll stay with this train as far as it goes The freight worked slowly southward through western Nevada the country becoming hourly more and more desolate and abandoned After leaving Walker Lake the sage brush country began and the freight rolled heavily over tracks that threw off visible layers of heat At times it stopped whole half days on sidings or by water tanks and the engineer and fireman came back to the caboose and played poker with the conductor and train crew The dentist sat apart behind the stove smoking pipe after pipe of cheap tobacco Sometimes he joined in the poker games He had learned poker when a boy at the mine and after a few deals his knowledge returned to him but for the most part he was taciturn and unsociable and rarely spoke to the others unless spoken to first The crew recognized the type and the impression gained ground among them that he had done for a livery stable keeper at Truckee and was trying to get down into Arizona McTeague heard two brakemen discussing him one night as they stood outside by the halted train The livery stable keeper called him a bastard that s what Picachos told me one of them remarked and started to draw his gun an this fellar did for him with a hayfork He s a horse doctor this chap is and the livery stable keeper had got the law on him so s he couldn t practise any more an he was sore about it Near a place called Queen s the train reentered California and McTeague observed with relief that the line of track which had hitherto held westward curved sharply to the south again The train was unmolested occasionally the crew fought with a gang of tramps who attempted to ride the brake beams and once in the northern part of Inyo County while they were halted at a water tank an immense Indian buck blanketed to the ground approached McTeague as he stood on the roadbed stretching his legs and without a word presented to him a filthy crumpled letter The letter was to the effect that the buck Big Jim was a good Indian and deserving of charity the signature was illegible The dentist stared at the letter returned it to the buck and regained the train just as it started Neither had spoken the buck did not move from his position and fully five minutes afterward when the slow moving freight was miles away the dentist looked back and saw him still standing motionless between the rails a forlorn and solitary point of red lost in the immensity of the surrounding white blur of the desert At length the mountains began again rising up on either side of the track vast naked hills of white sand and red rock spotted with blue shadows Here and there a patch of green was spread like a gay table cloth over the sand All at once Mount Whitney leaped over the horizon Independence was reached and passed the freight nearly emptied by now and much shortened rolled along the shores of Owen Lake At a place called Keeler it stopped definitely It was the terminus of the road The town of Keeler was a one street town not unlike Iowa Hill the post office the bar and hotel the Odd Fellows Hall and the livery stable being the principal buildings Where to now muttered McTeague to himself as he sat on the edge of the bed in his room in the hotel He hung the canary in the window filled its little bathtub and watched it take its bath with enormous satisfaction Where to now he muttered again This is as far as the railroad goes an it won do for me to stay in a town yet a while no it won do I got to clear out Where to That s the word where to I ll go down to supper now He went on whispering his thoughts aloud so that they would take more concrete shape in his mind I ll go down to supper now an then I ll hang aroun the bar this evening till I get the lay of this land Maybe this is fruit country though it looks more like a cattle country Maybe it s a mining country If it s a mining country he continued puckering his heavy eyebrows if it s a mining country an the mines are far enough off the roads maybe I d better get to the mines an lay quiet for a month before I try to get any farther south He washed the cinders and dust of a week s railroading from his face and hair put on a fresh pair of boots and went down to supper The dining room was of the invariable type of the smaller interior towns of California There was but one table covered with oilcloth rows of benches answered for chairs a railroad map a chromo with a gilt frame protected by mosquito netting hung on the walls together with a yellowed photograph of the proprietor in Masonic regalia Two waitresses whom the guests all men called by their first names came and went with large trays Through the windows outside McTeague observed a great number of saddle horses tied to trees and fences Each one of these horses had a riata on the pommel of the saddle He sat down to the table eating his thick hot soup watching his neighbors covertly listening to everything that was said It did not take him long to gather that the country to the east and south of Keeler was a cattle country Not far off across a range of hills was the Panamint Valley where the big cattle ranges were Every now and then this name was tossed to and fro across the table in the flow of conversation Over in the Panamint Just going down for a rodeo in the Panamint Panamint brands Has a range down in the Panamint Then by and by the remark Hoh yes Gold Gulch they re down to good pay there That s on the other side of the Panamint Range Peters came in yesterday and told me McTeague turned to the speaker Is that a gravel mine he asked No no quartz I m a miner that s why I asked Well I ve mined some too I had a hole in the ground meself but she was silver and when the skunks at Washington lowered the price of silver where was I Fitchered b God I was looking for a job Well it s mostly cattle down here in the Panamint but since the strike over at Gold Gulch some of the boys have gone prospecting There s gold in them damn Panamint Mountains If you can find a good long contact of country rocks you ain t far from it There s a couple of fellars from Redlands has located four claims around Gold Gulch They got a vein eighteen inches wide an Peters says you can trace it for more n a thousand feet Were you thinking of prospecting over there Well well I don know I don know Well I m going over to the other side of the range day after t morrow after some ponies of mine an I m going to have a look around You say you ve been a miner Yes yes If you re going over that way you might come along and see if we can t find a contact or copper sulphurets or something Even if we don t find color we may find silver bearing galena Then after a pause Let s see I didn t catch your name Huh My name s Carter answered McTeague promptly Why he should change his name again the dentist could not say Carter came to his mind at once and he answered without reflecting that he had registered as Burlington when he had arrived at the hotel Well my name s Cribbens answered the other The two shook hands solemnly You re about finished continued Cribbens pushing back Le s go out in the bar an have a drink on it Sure sure said the dentist The two sat up late that night in a corner of the barroom discussing the probability of finding gold in the Panamint hills It soon became evident that they held differing theories McTeague clung to the old prospector s idea that there was no way of telling where gold was until you actually saw it Cribbens had evidently read a good many books upon the subject and had already prospected in something of a scientific manner Shucks he exclaimed Gi me a long distinct contact between sedimentary and igneous rocks an I ll sink a shaft without ever SEEING color The dentist put his huge chin in the air Gold is where you find it he returned doggedly Well it s my idea as how pardners ought to work along different lines said Cribbens He tucked the corners of his mustache into his mouth and sucked the tobacco juice from them For a moment he was thoughtful then he blew out his mustache abruptly and exclaimed Say Carter le s make a go of this You got a little cash I suppose fifty dollars or so Huh Yes I I Well I got about fifty We ll go pardners on the proposition an we ll dally round the range yonder an see what we can see What do you say Sure sure answered the dentist Well it s a go then hey That s the word Well le s have a drink on it They drank with profound gravity They fitted out the next day at the general merchandise store of Keeler picks shovels prospectors hammers a couple of cradles pans bacon flour coffee and the like and they bought a burro on which to pack their kit Say by jingo you ain t got a horse suddenly exclaimed Cribbens as they came out of the store You can t get around this country without a pony of some kind Cribbens already owned and rode a buckskin cayuse that had to be knocked in the head and stunned before it could be saddled I got an extry saddle an a headstall at the hotel that you can use he said but you ll have to get a horse In the end the dentist bought a mule at the livery stable for forty dollars It turned out to be a good bargain however for the mule was a good traveller and seemed actually to fatten on sage brush and potato parings When the actual transaction took place McTeague had been obliged to get the money to pay for the mule out of the canvas sack Cribbens was with him at the time and as the dentist unrolled his blankets and disclosed the sack whistled in amazement An me asking you if you had fifty dollars he exclaimed You carry your mine right around with you don t you Huh I guess so muttered the dentist I I just sold a claim I had up in El Dorado County he added At five o clock on a magnificent May morning the pardners jogged out of Keeler driving the burro before them Cribbens rode his cayuse McTeague following in his rear on the mule Say remarked Cribbens why in thunder don t you leave that fool canary behind at the hotel It s going to be in your way all the time an it will sure die Better break its neck an chuck it No no insisted the dentist I ve had it too long I ll take it with me Well that s the craziest idea I ever heard of remarked Cribbens to take a canary along prospecting Why not kid gloves and be done with it They travelled leisurely to the southeast during the day following a well beaten cattle road and that evening camped on a spur of some hills at the head of the Panamint Valley where there was a spring The next day they crossed the Panamint itself That s a smart looking valley observed the dentist NOW you re talking straight talk returned Cribbens sucking his mustache The valley was beautiful wide level and very green Everywhere were herds of cattle scarcely less wild than deer Once or twice cowboys passed them on the road big boned fellows picturesque in their broad hats hairy trousers jingling spurs and revolver belts surprisingly like the pictures McTeague remembered to have seen Everyone of them knew Cribbens and almost invariably joshed him on his venture Say Crib ye d best take a wagon train with ye to bring your dust back Cribbens resented their humor and after they had passed chewed fiercely on his mustache I d like to make a strike b God if it was only to get the laugh on them joshers By noon they were climbing the eastern slope of the Panamint Range Long since they had abandoned the road vegetation ceased not a tree was in sight They followed faint cattle trails that led from one water hole to another By degrees these water holes grew dryer and dryer and at three o clock Cribbens halted and filled their canteens There ain t any TOO much water on the other side he observed grimly It s pretty hot muttered the dentist wiping his streaming forehead with the back of his hand Huh snorted the other more grimly than ever The motionless air was like the mouth of a furnace Cribbens s pony lathered and panted McTeague s mule began to droop his long ears Only the little burro plodded resolutely on picking the trail where McTeague could see but trackless sand and stunted sage Towards evening Cribbens who was in the lead drew rein on the summit of the hills Behind them was the beautiful green Panamint Valley but before and below them for miles and miles as far as the eye could reach a flat white desert empty even of sage brush unrolled toward the horizon In the immediate foreground a broken system of arroyos and little canyons tumbled down to meet it To the north faint blue hills shouldered themselves above the horizon Well observed Cribbens we re on the top of the Panamint Range now It s along this eastern slope right below us here that we re going to prospect Gold Gulch he pointed with the butt of his quirt is about eighteen or nineteen miles along here to the north of us Those hills way over yonder to the northeast are the Telescope hills What do you call the desert out yonder McTeague s eyes wandered over the illimitable stretch of alkali that stretched out forever and forever to the east to the north and to the south That said Cribbens that s Death Valley There was a long pause The horses panted irregularly the sweat dripping from their heaving bellies Cribbens and the dentist sat motionless in their saddles looking out over that abominable desolation silent troubled God ejaculated Cribbens at length under his breath with a shake of his head Then he seemed to rouse himself Well he remarked first thing we got to do now is to find water This was a long and difficult task They descended into one little canyon after another followed the course of numberless arroyos and even dug where there seemed indications of moisture all to no purpose But at length McTeague s mule put his nose in the air and blew once or twice through his nostrils Smells it the son of a gun exclaimed Cribbens The dentist let the animal have his head and in a few minutes he had brought them to the bed of a tiny canyon where a thin stream of brackish water filtered over a ledge of rocks We ll camp here observed Cribbens but we can t turn the horses loose We ll have to picket em with the lariats I saw some loco weed back here a piece and if they get to eating that they ll sure go plum crazy The burro won t eat it but I wouldn t trust the others A new life began for McTeague After breakfast the pardners separated going in opposite directions along the slope of the range examining rocks picking and chipping at ledges and bowlders looking for signs prospecting McTeague went up into the little canyons where the streams had cut through the bed rock searching for veins of quartz breaking out this quartz when he had found it pulverizing and panning it Cribbens hunted for contacts closely examining country rocks and out crops continually on the lookout for spots where sedimentary and igneous rock came together One day after a week of prospecting they met unexpectedly on the slope of an arroyo It was late in the afternoon Hello pardner exclaimed Cribbens as he came down to where McTeague was bending over his pan What luck The dentist emptied his pan and straightened up Nothing nothing You struck anything Not a trace Guess we might as well be moving towards camp They returned together Cribbens telling the dentist of a group of antelope he had seen We might lay off to morrow an see if we can plug a couple of them fellers Antelope steak would go pretty well after beans an bacon an coffee week in an week out McTeague was answering when Cribbens interrupted him with an exclamation of profound disgust I thought we were the first to prospect along in here an now look at that Don t it make you sick He pointed out evidences of an abandoned prospector s camp just before them charred ashes empty tin cans one or two gold miner s pans and a broken pick Don t that make you sick muttered Cribbens sucking his mustache furiously To think of us mushheads going over ground that s been covered already Say pardner we ll dig out of here to morrow I ve been thinking anyhow we d better move to the south that water of ours is pretty low Yes yes I guess so assented the dentist There ain t any gold here Yes there is protested Cribbens doggedly there s gold all through these hills if we could only strike it I tell you what pardner I got a place in mind where I ll bet no one ain t prospected least not very many There don t very many care to try an get to it It s over on the other side of Death Valley It s called Gold Mountain an there s only one mine been located there an it s paying like a nitrate bed There ain t many people in that country because it s all hell to get into First place you got to cross Death Valley and strike the Armagosa Range fur off to the south Well no one ain t stuck on crossing the Valley not if they can help it But we could work down the Panamint some hundred or so miles maybe two hundred an fetch around by the Armagosa River way to the south erd We could prospect on the way But I guess the Armagosa d be dried up at this season Anyhow he concluded we ll move camp to the south to morrow We got to get new feed an water for the horses We ll see if we can knock over a couple of antelope to morrow and then we ll scoot I ain t got a gun said the dentist not even a revolver I Wait a second said Cribbens pausing in his scramble down the side of one of the smaller gulches Here s some slate here I ain t seen no slate around here yet Let s see where it goes to McTeague followed him along the side of the gulch Cribbens went on ahead muttering to himself from time to time Runs right along here even enough and here s water too Didn t know this stream was here pretty near dry though Here s the slate again See where it runs pardner Look at it up there ahead said McTeague It runs right up over the back of this hill That s right assented Cribbens Hi he shouted suddenly HERE S A CONTACT and here it is again and there and yonder Oh look at it will you That s granodiorite on slate Couldn t want it any more distinct than that GOD if we could only find the quartz between the two now Well there it is exclaimed McTeague Look on ahead there ain t that quartz You re shouting right out loud vociferated Cribbens looking where McTeague was pointing His face went suddenly pale He turned to the dentist his eyes wide By God pardner he exclaimed breathlessly By God he broke off abruptly That s what you been looking for ain t it asked the dentist LOOKING for LOOKING for Cribbens checked himself That s SLATE all right and that s granodiorite I know he bent down and examined the rock and here s the quartz between em there can t be no mistake about that Gi me that hammer he cried excitedly Come on git to work Jab into the quartz with your pick git out some chunks of it Cribbens went down on his hands and knees attacking the quartz vein furiously The dentist followed his example swinging his pick with enormous force splintering the rocks at every stroke Cribbens was talking to himself in his excitement Got you THIS time you son of a gun By God I guess we got you THIS time at last Looks like it anyhow GET a move on pardner There ain t anybody round is there Hey Without looking he drew his revolver and threw it to the dentist Take the gun an look around pardner If you see any son of a gun ANYWHERE PLUG him This yere s OUR claim I guess we got it THIS tide pardner Come on He gathered up the chunks of quartz he had broken out and put them in his hat and started towards their camp The two went along with great strides hurrying as fast as they could over the uneven ground I don know exclaimed Cribbens breathlessly I don want to say too much Maybe we re fooled Lord that damn camp s a long ways off Oh I ain t goin to fool along this way Come on pardner He broke into a run McTeague followed at a lumbering gallop Over the scorched parched ground stumbling and tripping over sage brush and sharp pointed rocks under the palpitating heat of the desert sun they ran and scrambled carrying the quartz lumps in their hats See any COLOR in it pardner gasped Cribbens I can t can you Twouldn t be visible nohow I guess Hurry up Lord we ain t ever going to get to that camp Finally they arrived Cribbens dumped the quartz fragments into a pan You pestle her pardner an I ll fix the scales McTeague ground the lumps to fine dust in the iron mortar while Cribbens set up the tiny scales and got out the spoons from their outfit That s fine enough Cribbens exclaimed impatiently Now we ll spoon her Gi me the water Cribbens scooped up a spoonful of the fine white powder and began to spoon it carefully The two were on their hands and knees upon the ground their heads close together still panting with excitement and the exertion of their run Can t do it exclaimed Cribbens sitting back on his heels hand shakes so YOU take it pardner Careful now McTeague took the horn spoon and began rocking it gently in his huge fingers sluicing the water over the edge a little at a time each movement washing away a little more of the powdered quartz The two watched it with the intensest eagerness Don t see it yet don t see it yet whispered Cribbens chewing his mustache LEETLE faster pardner That s the ticket Careful steady now leetle more leetle more Don t see color yet do you The quartz sediment dwindled by degrees as McTeague spooned it steadily Then at last a thin streak of a foreign substance began to show just along the edge It was yellow Neither spoke Cribbens dug his nails into the sand and ground his mustache between his teeth The yellow streak broadened as the quartz sediment washed away Cribbens whispered We got it pardner That s gold McTeague washed the last of the white quartz dust away and let the water trickle after it A pinch of gold fine as flour was left in the bottom of the spoon There you are he said The two looked at each other Then Cribbens rose into the air with a great leap and a yell that could have been heard for half a mile Yee e ow We GOT it we struck it Pardner we got it Out of sight We re millionaires He snatched up his revolver and fired it with inconceivable rapidity PUT it there old man he shouted gripping McTeague s palm That s gold all right muttered McTeague studying the contents of the spoon You bet your great grandma s Cochin China Chessy cat it s gold shouted Cribbens Here now we got a lot to do We got to stake her out an put up the location notice We ll take our full acreage you bet You we haven t weighed this yet Where s the scales He weighed the pinch of gold with shaking hands Two grains he cried That ll run five dollars to the ton Rich it s rich it s the richest kind of pay pardner We re millionaires Why don t you say something Why don t you get excited Why don t you run around an do something Huh said McTeague rolling his eyes Huh I know I know we ve struck it pretty rich Come on exclaimed Cribbens jumping up again We ll stake her out an put up the location notice Lord suppose anyone should have come on her while we ve been away He reloaded his revolver deliberately We ll drop HIM all right if there s anyone fooling round there I ll tell you those right now Bring the rifle pardner an if you see anyone PLUG him an ask him what he wants afterward They hurried back to where they had made their discovery To think exclaimed Cribbens as he drove the first stake to think those other mushheads had their camp within gunshot of her and never located her Guess they didn t know the meaning of a contact Oh I knew I was solid on contacts They staked out their claim and Cribbens put up the notice of location It was dark before they were through Cribbens broke off some more chunks of quarts in the vein I ll spoon this too just for the fun of it when I get home he explained as they tramped back to the camp Well said the dentist we got the laugh on those cowboys Have we shouted Cribbens HAVE we Just wait and see the rush for this place when we tell em about it down in Keeler Say what ll we call her I don know I don know We might call her the Last Chance Twas our last chance wasn t it We d a gone antelope shooting tomorrow and the next day we d a say what you stopping for he added interrupting himself What s up The dentist had paused abruptly on the crest of a canyon Cribbens looking back saw him standing motionless in his tracks What s up asked Cribbens a second time McTeague slowly turned his head and looked over one shoulder then over the other Suddenly he wheeled sharply about cocking the Winchester and tossing it to his shoulder Cribbens ran back to his side whipping out his revolver What is it he cried See anybody He peered on ahead through the gathering twilight No no Hear anything No didn t hear anything What is it then What s up I don know I don know muttered the dentist lowering the rifle There was something What Something didn t you notice Notice what I don know Something something or other Who What Notice what What did you see The dentist let down the hammer of the rifle I guess it wasn t anything he said rather foolishly What d you think you saw anybody on the claim I didn t see anything I didn t hear anything either I had an idea that s all came all of a sudden like that Something I don know what I guess you just imagined something There ain t anybody within twenty miles of us I guess Yes I guess so just imagined it that s the word Half an hour later they had the fire going McTeague was frying strips of bacon over the coals and Cribbens was still chattering and exclaiming over their great strike All at once McTeague put down the frying pan What s that he growled Hey What s what exclaimed Cribbens getting up Didn t you notice something Where Off there The dentist made a vague gesture toward the eastern horizon Didn t you hear something I mean see something I mean What s the matter with you pardner Nothing I guess I just imagined it But it was not imagination Until midnight the partners lay broad awake rolled in their blankets under the open sky talking and discussing and making plans At last Cribbens rolled over on his side and slept The dentist could not sleep What It was warning him again that strange sixth sense that obscure brute instinct It was aroused again and clamoring to be obeyed Here in these desolate barren hills twenty miles from the nearest human being it stirred and woke and rowelled him to be moving on It had goaded him to flight from the Big Dipper mine and he had obeyed But now it was different now he had suddenly become rich he had lighted on a treasure a treasure far more valuable than the Big Dipper mine itself How was he to leave that He could not move on now He turned about in his blankets No he would not move on Perhaps it was his fancy after all He saw nothing heard nothing The emptiness of primeval desolation stretched from him leagues and leagues upon either hand The gigantic silence of the night lay close over everything like a muffling Titanic palm Of what was he suspicious In that treeless waste an object could be seen at half a day s journey distant In that vast silence the click of a pebble was as audible as a pistol shot And yet there was nothing nothing The dentist settled himself in his blankets and tried to sleep In five minutes he was sitting up staring into the blue gray shimmer of the moonlight straining his ears watching and listening intently Nothing was in sight The browned and broken flanks of the Panamint hills lay quiet and familiar under the moon The burro moved its head with a clinking of its bell and McTeagues mule dozing on three legs changed its weight to another foot with a long breath Everything fell silent again What is it muttered the dentist If I could only see something hear something He threw off the blankets and rising climbed to the summit of the nearest hill and looked back in the direction in which he and Cribbens had travelled a fortnight before For half an hour he waited watching and listening in vain But as he returned to camp and prepared to roll his blankets about him the strange impulse rose in him again abruptly never so strong never so insistent It seemed as though he were bitted and ridden as if some unseen hand were turning him toward the east some unseen heel spurring him to precipitate and instant flight Flight from what No he muttered under his breath Go now and leave the claim and leave a fortune What a fool I d be when I can t see anything or hear anything To leave a fortune No I won t No by God He drew Cribbens s Winchester toward him and slipped a cartridge into the magazine No he growled Whatever happens I m going to stay If anybody comes He depressed the lever of the rifle and sent the cartridge clashing into the breech I ain t going to sleep he muttered under his mustache I can t sleep I ll watch He rose a second time clambered to the nearest hilltop and sat down drawing the blanket around him and laying the Winchester across his knees The hours passed The dentist sat on the hilltop a motionless crouching figure inky black against the pale blur of the sky By and by the edge of the eastern horizon began to grow blacker and more distinct in out line The dawn was coming Once more McTeague felt the mysterious intuition of approaching danger an unseen hand seemed reining his head eastward a spur was in his flanks that seemed to urge him to hurry hurry hurry The influence grew stronger with every moment The dentist set his great jaws together and held his ground No he growled between his set teeth No I ll stay He made a long circuit around the camp even going as far as the first stake of the new claim his Winchester cocked his ears pricked his eyes alert There was nothing yet as plainly as though it were shouted at the very nape of his neck he felt an enemy It was not fear McTeague was not afraid If I could only SEE something somebody he muttered as he held the cocked rifle ready I I d show him He returned to camp Cribbens was snoring The burro had come down to the stream for its morning drink The mule was awake and browsing McTeague stood irresolutely by the cold ashes of the camp fire looking from side to side with all the suspicion and wariness of a tracked stag Stronger and stronger grew the strange impulse It seemed to him that on the next instant he MUST perforce wheel sharply eastward and rush away headlong in a clumsy lumbering gallop He fought against it with all the ferocious obstinacy of his simple brute nature Go and leave the mine Go and leave a million dollars No NO I won t go No I ll stay Ah he exclaimed under his breath with a shake of his huge head like an exasperated and harassed brute ah show yourself will you He brought the rifle to his shoulder and covered point after point along the range of hills to the west Come on show yourself Come on a little all of you I ain t afraid of you but don t skulk this way You ain t going to drive me away from my mine I m going to stay An hour passed Then two The stars winked out and the dawn whitened The air became warmer The whole east clean of clouds flamed opalescent from horizon to zenith crimson at the base where the earth blackened against it at the top fading from pink to pale yellow to green to light blue to the turquoise iridescence of the desert sky The long thin shadows of the early hours drew backward like receding serpents then suddenly the sun looked over the shoulder of the world and it was day At that moment McTeague was already eight miles away from the camp going steadily eastward He was descending the lowest spurs of the Panamint hills following an old and faint cattle trail Before him he drove his mule laden with blankets provisions for six days Cribben s rifle and a canteen full of water Securely bound to the pommel of the saddle was the canvas sack with its precious five thousand dollars all in twenty dollar gold pieces But strange enough in that horrid waste of sand and sage was the object that McTeague himself persistently carried the canary in its cage about which he had carefully wrapped a couple of old flour bags At about five o clock that morning McTeague had crossed several trails which seemed to be converging and guessing that they led to a water hole had followed one of them and had brought up at a sort of small sundried sink which nevertheless contained a little water at the bottom He had watered the mule here refilled the canteen and drank deep himself He had also dampened the old flour sacks around the bird cage to protect the little canary as far as possible from the heat that he knew would increase now with every hour He had made ready to go forward again but had paused irresolute again hesitating for the last time I m a fool he growled scowling back at the range behind him I m a fool What s the matter with me I m just walking right away from a million dollars I know it s there No by God he exclaimed savagely I ain t going to do it I m going back I can t leave a mine like that He had wheeled the mule about and had started to return on his tracks grinding his teeth fiercely inclining his head forward as though butting against a wind that would beat him back Go on go on he cried sometimes addressing the mule sometimes himself Go on go back go back I WILL go back It was as though he were climbing a hill that grew steeper with every stride The strange impelling instinct fought his advance yard by yard By degrees the dentist s steps grew slower he stopped went forward again cautiously almost feeling his way like someone approaching a pit in the darkness He stopped again hesitating gnashing his teeth clinching his fists with blind fury Suddenly he turned the mule about and once more set his face to the eastward I can t he cried aloud to the desert I can t I can t It s stronger than I am I CAN T go back Hurry now hurry hurry hurry He hastened on furtively his head and shoulders bent At times one could almost say he crouched as he pushed forward with long strides now and then he even looked over his shoulder Sweat rolled from him he lost his hat and the matted mane of thick yellow hair swept over his forehead and shaded his small twinkling eyes At times with a vague nearly automatic gesture he reached his hand forward the fingers prehensile and directed towards the horizon as if he would clutch it and draw it nearer and at intervals he muttered Hurry hurry hurry on hurry on For now at last McTeague was afraid His plans were uncertain He remembered what Cribbens had said about the Armagosa Mountains in the country on the other side of Death Valley It was all hell to get into that country Cribbens had said and not many men went there because of the terrible valley of alkali that barred the way a horrible vast sink of white sand and salt below even the sea level the dry bed no doubt of some prehistoric lake But McTeague resolved to make a circuit of the valley keeping to the south until he should strike the Armagosa River He would make a circuit of the valley and come up on the other side He would get into that country around Gold Mountain in the Armagosa hills barred off from the world by the leagues of the red hot alkali of Death Valley They would hardly reach him there He would stay at Gold Mountain two or three months and then work his way down into Mexico McTeague tramped steadily forward still descending the lower irregularities of the Panamint Range By nine o clock the slope flattened out abruptly the hills were behind him before him to the east all was level He had reached the region where even the sand and sage brush begin to dwindle giving place to white powdered alkali The trails were numerous but old and faint and they had been made by cattle not by men They led in all directions but one north south and west but not one however faint struck out towards the valley If I keep along the edge of the hills where these trails are muttered the dentist I ought to find water up in the arroyos from time to time At once he uttered an exclamation The mule had begun to squeal and lash out with alternate hoofs his eyes rolling his ears flattened He ran a few steps halted and squealed again Then suddenly wheeling at right angles set off on a jog trot to the north squealing and kicking from time to time McTeague ran after him shouting and swearing but for a long time the mule would not allow himself to be caught He seemed more bewildered than frightened He s eatun some of that loco weed that Cribbens spoke about panted McTeague Whoa there steady you At length the mule stopped of his own accord and seemed to come to his senses again McTeague came up and took the bridle rein speaking to him and rubbing his nose There there what s the matter with you The mule was docile again McTeague washed his mouth and set forward once more The day was magnificent From horizon to horizon was one vast span of blue whitening as it dipped earthward Miles upon miles to the east and southeast the desert unrolled itself white naked inhospitable palpitating and shimmering under the sun unbroken by so much as a rock or cactus stump In the distance it assumed all manner of faint colors pink purple and pale orange To the west rose the Panamint Range sparsely sprinkled with gray sagebrush here the earths and sands were yellow ochre and rich deep red the hollows and canyons picked out with intense blue shadows It seemed strange that such barrenness could exhibit this radiance of color but nothing could have been more beautiful than the deep red of the higher bluffs and ridges seamed with purple shadows standing sharply out against the pale blue whiteness of the horizon By nine o clock the sun stood high in the sky The heat was intense the atmosphere was thick and heavy with it McTeague gasped for breath and wiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead his cheeks and his neck Every inch and pore of his skin was tingling and pricking under the merciless lash of the sun s rays If it gets much hotter he muttered with a long breath if it gets much hotter I I don know He wagged his head and wiped the sweat from his eyelids where it was running like tears The sun rose higher hour by hour as the dentist tramped steadily on the heat increased The baked dry sand crackled into innumerable tiny flakes under his feet The twigs of the sage brush snapped like brittle pipestems as he pushed through them It grew hotter At eleven the earth was like the surface of a furnace the air as McTeague breathed it in was hot to his lips and the roof of his mouth The sun was a disk of molten brass swimming in the burnt out blue of the sky McTeague stripped off his woollen shirt and even unbuttoned his flannel undershirt tying a handkerchief loosely about his neck Lord he exclaimed I never knew it COULD get as hot as this The heat grew steadily fiercer all distant objects were visibly shimmering and palpitating under it At noon a mirage appeared on the hills to the northwest McTeague halted the mule and drank from the tepid water in the canteen dampening the sack around the canary s cage As soon as he ceased his tramp and the noise of his crunching grinding footsteps died away the silence vast illimitable enfolded him like an immeasurable tide From all that gigantic landscape that colossal reach of baking sand there arose not a single sound Not a twig rattled not an insect hummed not a bird or beast invaded that huge solitude with call or cry Everything as far as the eye could reach to north to south to east and west lay inert absolutely quiet and moveless under the remorseless scourge of the noon sun The very shadows shrank away hiding under sage bushes retreating to the farthest nooks and crevices in the canyons of the hills All the world was one gigantic blinding glare silent motionless If it gets much hotter murmured the dentist again moving his head from side to side if it gets much hotter I don know what I ll do Steadily the heat increased At three o clock it was even more terrible than it had been at noon Ain t it EVER going to let up groaned the dentist rolling his eyes at the sky of hot blue brass Then as he spoke the stillness was abruptly stabbed through and through by a shrill sound that seemed to come from all sides at once It ceased then as McTeague took another forward step began again with the suddenness of a blow shriller nearer at hand a hideous prolonged note that brought both man and mule to an instant halt I know what THAT is exclaimed the dentist His eyes searched the ground swiftly until he saw what he expected he should see the round thick coil the slowly waving clover shaped head and erect whirring tail with its vibrant rattles For fully thirty seconds the man and snake remained looking into each other s eyes Then the snake uncoiled and swiftly wound from sight amidst the sagebrush McTeague drew breath again and his eyes once more beheld the illimitable leagues of quivering sand and alkali Good Lord What a country he exclaimed But his voice was trembling as he urged forward the mule once more Fiercer and fiercer grew the heat as the afternoon advanced At four McTeague stopped again He was dripping at every pore but there was no relief in perspiration The very touch of his clothes upon his body was unendurable The mule s ears were drooping and his tongue lolled from his mouth The cattle trails seemed to be drawing together toward a common point perhaps a water hole was near by I ll have to lay up sure muttered the dentist I ain t made to travel in such heat as this He drove the mule up into one of the larger canyons and halted in the shadow of a pile of red rock After a long search he found water a few quarts warm and brackish at the bottom of a hollow of sunwracked mud it was little more than enough to water the mule and refill his canteen Here he camped easing the mule of the saddle and turning him loose to find what nourishment he might A few hours later the sun set in a cloudless glory of red and gold and the heat became by degrees less intolerable McTeague cooked his supper chiefly coffee and bacon and watched the twilight come on revelling in the delicious coolness of the evening As he spread his blankets on the ground he resolved that hereafter he would travel only at night laying up in the daytime in the shade of the canyons He was exhausted with his terrible day s march Never in his life had sleep seemed so sweet to him But suddenly he was broad awake his jaded senses all alert What was that he muttered I thought I heard something saw something He rose to his feet reaching for the Winchester Desolation lay still around him There was not a sound but his own breathing on the face of the desert not a grain of sand was in motion McTeague looked furtively and quickly from side to side his teeth set his eyes rolling Once more the rowel was in his flanks once more an unseen hand reined him toward the east After all the miles of that dreadful day s flight he was no better off than when he started If anything he was worse for never had that mysterious instinct in him been more insistent than now never had the impulse toward precipitate flight been stronger never had the spur bit deeper Every nerve of his body cried aloud for rest yet every instinct seemed aroused and alive goading him to hurry on to hurry on What IS it then What is it he cried between his teeth Can t I ever get rid of you Ain t I EVER going to shake you off Don keep it up this way Show yourselves Let s have it out right away Come on I ain t afraid if you ll only come on but don t skulk this way Suddenly he cried aloud in a frenzy of exasperation Damn you come on will you Come on and have it out His rifle was at his shoulder he was covering bush after bush rock after rock aiming at every denser shadow All at once and quite involuntarily his forefinger crooked and the rifle spoke and flamed The canyons roared back the echo tossing it out far over the desert in a rippling widening wave of sound McTeague lowered the rifle hastily with an exclamation of dismay You fool he said to himself you fool You ve done it now They could hear that miles away You ve done it now He stood listening intently the rifle smoking in his hands The last echo died away The smoke vanished the vast silence closed upon the passing echoes of the rifle as the ocean closes upon a ship s wake Nothing moved yet McTeague bestirred himself sharply rolling up his blankets resaddling the mule getting his outfit together again From time to time he muttered Hurry now hurry on You fool you ve done it now They could hear that miles away Hurry now They ain t far off now As he depressed the lever of the rifle to reload it he found that the magazine was empty He clapped his hands to his sides feeling rapidly first in one pocket then in another He had forgotten to take extra cartridges with him McTeague swore under his breath as he flung the rifle away Henceforth he must travel unarmed A little more water had gathered in the mud hole near which he had camped He watered the mule for the last time and wet the sacks around the canary s cage Then once more he set forward But there was a change in the direction of McTeague s flight Hitherto he had held to the south keeping upon the very edge of the hills now he turned sharply at right angles The slope fell away beneath his hurrying feet the sage brush dwindled and at length ceased the sand gave place to a fine powder white as snow and an hour after he had fired the rifle his mule s hoofs were crisping and cracking the sun baked flakes of alkali on the surface of Death Valley Tracked and harried as he felt himself to be from one camping place to another McTeague had suddenly resolved to make one last effort to rid himself of the enemy that seemed to hang upon his heels He would strike straight out into that horrible wilderness where even the beasts were afraid He would cross Death Valley at once and put its arid wastes between him and his pursuer You don t dare follow me now he muttered as he hurried on Let s see you come out HERE after me He hurried on swiftly urging the mule to a rapid racking walk Towards four o clock the sky in front of him began to flush pink and golden McTeague halted and breakfasted pushing on again immediately afterward The dawn flamed and glowed like a brazier and the sun rose a vast red hot coal floating in fire An hour passed then another and another It was about nine o clock Once more the dentist paused and stood panting and blowing his arms dangling his eyes screwed up and blinking as he looked about him Far behind him the Panamint hills were already but blue hummocks on the horizon Before him and upon either side to the north and to the east and to the south stretched primordial desolation League upon league the infinite reaches of dazzling white alkali laid themselves out like an immeasurable scroll unrolled from horizon to horizon not a bush not a twig relieved that horrible monotony Even the sand of the desert would have been a welcome sight a single clump of sage brush would have fascinated the eye but this was worse than the desert It was abominable this hideous sink of alkali this bed of some primeval lake lying so far below the level of the ocean The great mountains of Placer County had been merely indifferent to man but this awful sink of alkali was openly and unreservedly iniquitous and malignant McTeague had told himself that the heat upon the lower slopes of the Panamint had been dreadful here in Death Valley it became a thing of terror There was no longer any shadow but his own He was scorched and parched from head to heel It seemed to him that the smart of his tortured body could not have been keener if he had been flayed If it gets much hotter he muttered wringing the sweat from his thick fell of hair and mustache if it gets much hotter I don know what I ll do He was thirsty and drank a little from his canteen I ain t got any too much water he murmured shaking the canteen I got to get out of this place in a hurry sure By eleven o clock the heat had increased to such an extent that McTeague could feel the burning of the ground come pringling and stinging through the soles of his boots Every step he took threw up clouds of impalpable alkali dust salty and choking so that he strangled and coughed and sneezed with it LORD what a country exclaimed the dentist An hour later the mule stopped and lay down his jaws wide open his ears dangling McTeague washed his mouth with a handful of water and for a second time since sunrise wetted the flour sacks around the bird cage The air was quivering and palpitating like that in the stoke hold of a steamship The sun small and contracted swam molten overhead I can t stand it said McTeague at length I ll have to stop and make some kinda shade The mule was crouched upon the ground panting rapidly with half closed eyes The dentist removed the saddle and unrolling his blanket propped it up as best he could between him and the sun As he stooped down to crawl beneath it his palm touched the ground He snatched it away with a cry of pain The surface alkali was oven hot he was obliged to scoop out a trench in it before he dared to lie down By degrees the dentist began to doze He had had little or no sleep the night before and the hurry of his flight under the blazing sun had exhausted him But his rest was broken between waking and sleeping all manner of troublous images galloped through his brain He thought he was back in the Panamint hills again with Cribbens They had just discovered the mine and were returning toward camp McTeague saw himself as another man striding along over the sand and sagebrush At once he saw himself stop and wheel sharply about peering back suspiciously There was something behind him something was following him He looked as it were over the shoulder of this other McTeague and saw down there in the half light of the canyon something dark crawling upon the ground an indistinct gray figure man or brute he did not know Then he saw another and another then another A score of black crawling objects were following him crawling from bush to bush converging upon him THEY were after him were closing in upon him were within touch of his hand were at his feet WERE AT HIS THROAT McTeague jumped up with a shout oversetting the blanket There was nothing in sight For miles around the alkali was empty solitary quivering and shimmering under the pelting fire of the afternoon s sun But once more the spur bit into his body goading him on There was to be no rest no going back no pause no stop Hurry hurry hurry on The brute that in him slept so close to the surface was alive and alert and tugging to be gone There was no resisting that instinct The brute felt an enemy scented the trackers clamored and struggled and fought and would not be gainsaid I CAN T go on groaned McTeague his eyes sweeping the horizon behind him I m beat out I m dog tired I ain t slept any for two nights But for all that he roused himself again saddled the mule scarcely less exhausted than himself and pushed on once more over the scorching alkali and under the blazing sun From that time on the fear never left him the spur never ceased to bite the instinct that goaded him to fight never was dumb hurry or halt it was all the same On he went straight on chasing the receding horizon flagellated with heat tortured with thirst crouching over looking furtively behind and at times reaching his hand forward the fingers prehensile grasping as it were toward the horizon that always fled before him The sun set upon the third day of McTeague s flight night came on the stars burned slowly into the cool dark purple of the sky The gigantic sink of white alkali glowed like snow McTeague now far into the desert held steadily on swinging forward with great strides His enormous strength held him doggedly to his work Sullenly with his huge jaws gripping stolidly together he pushed on At midnight he stopped Now he growled with a certain desperate defiance as though he expected to be heard now I m going to lay up and get some sleep You can come or not He cleared away the hot surface alkali spread out his blanket and slept until the next day s heat aroused him His water was so low that he dared not make coffee now and so breakfasted without it Until ten o clock he tramped forward then camped again in the shade of one of the rare rock ledges and lay up during the heat of the day By five o clock he was once more on the march He travelled on for the greater part of that night stopping only once towards three in the morning to water the mule from the canteen Again the red hot day burned up over the horizon Even at six o clock it was hot It s going to be worse than ever to day he groaned I wish I could find another rock to camp by Ain t I ever going to get out of this place There was no change in the character of the desert Always the same measureless leagues of white hot alkali stretched away toward the horizon on every hand Here and there the flat dazzling surface of the desert broke and raised into long low mounds from the summit of which McTeague could look for miles and miles over its horrible desolation No shade was in sight Not a rock not a stone broke the monotony of the ground Again and again he ascended the low unevennesses looking and searching for a camping place shading his eyes from the glitter of sand and sky He tramped forward a little farther then paused at length in a hollow between two breaks resolving to make camp there Suddenly there was a shout Hands up By damn I got the drop on you McTeague looked up It was Marcus CHAPTER twenty two Within a month after his departure from San Francisco Marcus had gone in on a cattle ranch in the Panamint Valley with an Englishman an acquaintance of mister Sieppe s His headquarters were at a place called Modoc at the lower extremity of the valley about fifty miles by trail to the south of Keeler His life was the life of a cowboy He realized his former vision of himself booted sombreroed and revolvered passing his days in the saddle and the better part of his nights around the poker tables in Modoc s one saloon To his intense satisfaction he even involved himself in a gun fight that arose over a disputed brand with the result that two fingers of his left hand were shot away News from the outside world filtered slowly into the Panamint Valley and the telegraph had never been built beyond Keeler At intervals one of the local papers of Independence the nearest large town found its way into the cattle camps on the ranges and occasionally one of the Sunday editions of a Sacramento journal weeks old was passed from hand to hand Marcus ceased to hear from the Sieppes As for San Francisco it was as far from him as was London or Vienna One day a fortnight after McTeague s flight from San Francisco Marcus rode into Modoc to find a group of men gathered about a notice affixed to the outside of the Wells Fargo office It was an offer of reward for the arrest and apprehension of a murderer The crime had been committed in San Francisco but the man wanted had been traced as far as the western portion of Inyo County and was believed at that time to be in hiding in either the Pinto or Panamint hills in the vicinity of Keeler Marcus reached Keeler on the afternoon of that same day Half a mile from the town his pony fell and died from exhaustion Marcus did not stop even to remove the saddle He arrived in the barroom of the hotel in Keeler just after the posse had been made up The sheriff who had come down from Independence that morning at first refused his offer of assistance He had enough men already too many in fact The country travelled through would be hard and it would be difficult to find water for so many men and horses But none of you fellers have ever seen um vociferated Marcus quivering with excitement and wrath I know um well I could pick um out in a million I can identify um and you fellers can t And I knew I knew good GOD I knew that girl his wife in Frisco She s a cousin of mine she is she was I thought once of This thing s a personal matter of mine an that money he got away with that five thousand belongs to me by rights Oh never mind I m going along Do you hear he shouted his fists raised I m going along I tell you There ain t a man of you big enough to stop me Let s see you try and stop me going Let s see you once any two of you He filled the barroom with his clamor Lord love you come along then said the sheriff The posse rode out of Keeler that same night The keeper of the general merchandise store from whom Marcus had borrowed a second pony had informed them that Cribbens and his partner whose description tallied exactly with that given in the notice of reward had outfitted at his place with a view to prospecting in the Panamint hills The posse trailed them at once to their first camp at the head of the valley It was an easy matter It was only necessary to inquire of the cowboys and range riders of the valley if they had seen and noted the passage of two men one of whom carried a bird cage Beyond this first camp the trail was lost and a week was wasted in a bootless search around the mine at Gold Gulch whither it seemed probable the partners had gone Then a travelling peddler who included Gold Gulch in his route brought in the news of a wonderful strike of gold bearing quartz some ten miles to the south on the western slope of the range Two men from Keeler had made a strike the peddler had said and added the curious detail that one of the men had a canary bird in a cage with him The posse made Cribbens s camp three days after the unaccountable disappearance of his partner Their man was gone but the narrow hoof prints of a mule mixed with those of huge hob nailed boots could be plainly followed in the sand Here they picked up the trail and held to it steadily till the point was reached where instead of tending southward it swerved abruptly to the east The men could hardly believe their eyes It ain t reason exclaimed the sheriff What in thunder is he up to This beats me Cutting out into Death Valley at this time of year He s heading for Gold Mountain over in the Armagosa sure The men decided that this conjecture was true It was the only inhabited locality in that direction A discussion began as to the further movements of the posse I don t figure on going into that alkali sink with no eight men and horses declared the sheriff One man can t carry enough water to take him and his mount across let alone EIGHT No sir Four couldn t do it No THREE couldn t We ve got to make a circuit round the valley and come up on the other side and head him off at Gold Mountain That s what we got to do and ride like hell to do it too But Marcus protested with all the strength of his lungs against abandoning the trail now that they had found it He argued that they were but a day and a half behind their man now There was no possibility of their missing the trail as distinct in the white alkali as in snow They could make a dash into the valley secure their man and return long before their water failed them He for one would not give up the pursuit now that they were so close In the haste of the departure from Keeler the sheriff had neglected to swear him in He was under no orders He would do as he pleased Go on then you darn fool answered the sheriff We ll cut on round the valley for all that It s a gamble he ll be at Gold Mountain before you re half way across But if you catch him here he tossed Marcus a pair of handcuffs put em on him and bring him back to Keeler Two days after he had left the posse and when he was already far out in the desert Marcus s horse gave out In the fury of his impatience he had spurred mercilessly forward on the trail and on the morning of the third day found that his horse was unable to move The joints of his legs seemed locked rigidly He would go his own length stumbling and interfering then collapse helplessly upon the ground with a pitiful groan He was used up Marcus believed himself to be close upon McTeague now The ashes at his last camp had still been smoldering Marcus took what supplies of food and water he could carry and hurried on But McTeague was farther ahead than he had guessed and by evening of his third day upon the desert Marcus raging with thirst had drunk his last mouthful of water and had flung away the empty canteen If he ain t got water with um he said to himself as he pushed on If he ain t got water with um by damn I ll be in a bad way I will for a fact At Marcus s shout McTeague looked up and around him For the instant he saw no one The white glare of alkali was still unbroken Then his swiftly rolling eyes lighted upon a head and shoulder that protruded above the low crest of the break directly in front of him A man was there lying at full length upon the ground covering him with a revolver For a few seconds McTeague looked at the man stupidly bewildered confused as yet without definite thought Then he noticed that the man was singularly like Marcus Schouler It WAS Marcus Schouler How in the world did Marcus Schouler come to be in that desert What did he mean by pointing a pistol at him that way He d best look out or the pistol would go off Then his thoughts readjusted themselves with a swiftness born of a vivid sense of danger Here was the enemy at last the tracker he had felt upon his footsteps Now at length he had come on and shown himself after all those days of skulking McTeague was glad of it He d show him now They two would have it out right then and there His rifle He had thrown it away long since He was helpless Marcus had ordered him to put up his hands If he did not Marcus would kill him He had the drop on him McTeague stared scowling fiercely at the levelled pistol He did not move Hands up shouted Marcus a second time I ll give you three to do it in One two Instinctively McTeague put his hands above his head Marcus rose and came towards him over the break Keep em up he cried If you move em once I ll kill you sure He came up to McTeague and searched him going through his pockets but McTeague had no revolver not even a hunting knife What did you do with that money with that five thousand dollars It s on the mule answered McTeague sullenly Marcus grunted and cast a glance at the mule who was standing some distance away snorting nervously and from time to time flattening his long ears Is that it there on the horn of the saddle there in that canvas sack Marcus demanded Yes that s it A gleam of satisfaction came into Marcus s eyes and under his breath he muttered Got it at last He was singularly puzzled to know what next to do He had got McTeague There he stood at length with his big hands over his head scowling at him sullenly Marcus had caught his enemy had run down the man for whom every officer in the State had been looking What should he do with him now He couldn t keep him standing there forever with his hands over his head Got any water he demanded There s a canteen of water on the mule Marcus moved toward the mule and made as if to reach the bridle rein The mule squealed threw up his head and galloped to a little distance rolling his eyes and flattening his ears Marcus swore wrathfully He acted that way once before explained McTeague his hands still in the air He ate some loco weed back in the hills before I started For a moment Marcus hesitated While he was catching the mule McTeague might get away But where to in heaven s name A rat could not hide on the surface of that glistening alkali and besides all McTeague s store of provisions and his priceless supply of water were on the mule Marcus ran after the mule revolver in hand shouting and cursing But the mule would not be caught He acted as if possessed squealing lashing out and galloping in wide circles his head high in the air Come on shouted Marcus furious turning back to McTeague Come on help me catch him We got to catch him All the water we got is on the saddle McTeague came up He s eatun some loco weed he repeated He went kinda crazy once before If he should take it into his head to bolt and keep on running Marcus did not finish A sudden great fear seemed to widen around and inclose the two men Once their water gone the end would not be long We can catch him all right said the dentist I caught him once before Oh I guess we can catch him answered Marcus reassuringly Already the sense of enmity between the two had weakened in the face of a common peril Marcus let down the hammer of his revolver and slid it back into the holster The mule was trotting on ahead snorting and throwing up great clouds of alkali dust At every step the canvas sack jingled and McTeague s bird cage still wrapped in the flour bags bumped against the saddlepads By and by the mule stopped blowing out his nostrils excitedly He s clean crazy fumed Marcus panting and swearing We ought to come up on him quiet observed McTeague I ll try and sneak up said Marcus two of us would scare him again You stay here Marcus went forward a step at a time He was almost within arm s length of the bridle when the mule shied from him abruptly and galloped away Marcus danced with rage shaking his fists and swearing horribly Some hundred yards away the mule paused and began blowing and snuffing in the alkali as though in search of feed Then for no reason he shied again and started off on a jog trot toward the east We ve GOT to follow him exclaimed Marcus as McTeague came up There s no water within seventy miles of here Then began an interminable pursuit Mile after mile under the terrible heat of the desert sun the two men followed the mule racked with a thirst that grew fiercer every hour A dozen times they could almost touch the canteen of water and as often the distraught animal shied away and fled before them At length Marcus cried It s no use we can t catch him and we re killing ourselves with thirst We got to take our chances He drew his revolver from its holster cocked it and crept forward Steady now said McTeague it won do to shoot through the canteen Within twenty yards Marcus paused made a rest of his left forearm and fired You GOT him cried McTeague No he s up again Shoot him again He s going to bolt Marcus ran on firing as he ran The mule one foreleg trailing scrambled along squealing and snorting Marcus fired his last shot The mule pitched forward upon his head then rolling sideways fell upon the canteen bursting it open and spilling its entire contents into the sand Marcus and McTeague ran up and Marcus snatched the battered canteen from under the reeking bloody hide There was no water left Marcus flung the canteen from him and stood up facing McTeague There was a pause We re dead men said Marcus McTeague looked from him out over the desert Chaotic desolation stretched from them on either hand flaming and glaring with the afternoon heat There was the brazen sky and the leagues upon leagues of alkali leper white There was nothing more They were in the heart of Death Valley Not a drop of water muttered McTeague not a drop of water We can drink the mule s blood said Marcus It s been done before But but he looked down at the quivering gory body but I ain t thirsty enough for that yet Where s the nearest water Well it s about a hundred miles or more back of us in the Panamint hills returned Marcus doggedly We d be crazy long before we reached it I tell you we re done for by damn we re DONE for We ain t ever going to get outa here Done for murmured the other looking about stupidly Done for that s the word Done for Yes I guess we re done for What are we going to do NOW exclaimed Marcus sharply after a while Well let s let s be moving along somewhere WHERE I d like to know What s the good of moving on What s the good of stopping here There was a silence Lord it s hot said the dentist finally wiping his forehead with the back of his hand Marcus ground his teeth Done for he muttered done for I never WAS so thirsty continued McTeague I m that dry I can hear my tongue rubbing against the roof of my mouth Well we can t stop here said Marcus finally we got to go somewhere We ll try and get back but it ain t no manner of use Anything we want to take along with us from the mule We can Suddenly he paused In an instant the eyes of the two doomed men had met as the same thought simultaneously rose in their minds The canvas sack with its five thousand dollars was still tied to the horn of the saddle Marcus had emptied his revolver at the mule and though he still wore his cartridge belt he was for the moment as unarmed as McTeague I guess began McTeague coming forward a step I guess even if we are done for I ll take some of my truck along Hold on exclaimed Marcus with rising aggressiveness Let s talk about that I ain t so sure about who that who that money belongs to Well I AM you see growled the dentist The old enmity between the two men their ancient hate was flaming up again Don t try an load that gun either cried McTeague fixing Marcus with his little eyes Then don t lay your finger on that sack shouted the other You re my prisoner do you understand You ll do as I say Marcus had drawn the handcuffs from his pocket and stood ready with his revolver held as a club You soldiered me out of that money once and played me for a sucker an it s my turn now Don t you lay your finger on that sack Marcus barred McTeague s way white with passion McTeague did not answer His eyes drew to two fine twinkling points and his enormous hands knotted themselves into fists hard as wooden mallets He moved a step nearer to Marcus then another Suddenly the men grappled and in another instant were rolling and struggling upon the hot white ground McTeague thrust Marcus backward until he tripped and fell over the body of the dead mule The little bird cage broke from the saddle with the violence of their fall and rolled out upon the ground the flour bags slipping from it McTeague tore the revolver from Marcus s grip and struck out with it blindly Clouds of alkali dust fine and pungent enveloped the two fighting men all but strangling them McTeague did not know how he killed his enemy but all at once Marcus grew still beneath his blows Then there was a sudden last return of energy McTeague s right wrist was caught something licked upon it then the struggling body fell limp and motionless with a long breath As McTeague rose to his feet he felt a pull at his right wrist something held it fast Looking down he saw that Marcus in that last struggle had found strength to handcuff their wrists together Marcus was dead now McTeague was locked to the body All about him vast interminable stretched the measureless leagues of Death Valley McTeague remained stupidly looking around him now at the distant horizon now at the ground now at the half dead canary chittering feebly in its little gilt prison End of the
