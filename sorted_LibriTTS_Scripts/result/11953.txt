grave of good laws and good morals in France There is no exaggeration in these words the sixteenth century with its saint Bartholomew and The League the eighteenth with its reign of terror and the nineteenth with its Commune of Paris contain scarcely any events so sinister as those of which France was in the reign of Charles VI from thirteen eighty to fourteen twenty two the theatre and the victim Scarcely was Charles V laid on his bier when it was seen what a loss he was and would be to his kingdom Discord arose in the king s own family In order to shorten the ever critical period of minority Charles V had fixed the king s majority at the age of fourteen His son Charles VI was not yet twelve and so had two years to remain under the guardianship of his four uncles the Dukes of Anjou Berry Burgundy and Bourbon but the last being only a maternal uncle and a less puissant prince than his paternal uncles it was between the other three that strife began for temporary possession of the kingly power Though very unequal in talent and in force of character they were all three ambitious and jealous The eldest the Duke of Anjou who was energetic despotic and stubborn aspired to dominion in France for the sake of making French influence subserve the conquest of the kingdom of Naples the object of his ambition The Duke of Berry was a mediocre restless prodigal and grasping prince The Duke of Burgundy Philip the Bold the most able and the most powerful of the three had been the favorite first of his father King John and then of his brother Charles V who had confidence in him and readily adopted his counsels His marriage in thirteen sixty nine with the heiress to the countship of Flanders had been vigorously opposed by the Count of Flanders the young princess s father and by the Flemish communes ever more friendly to England than to France but the old Countess of Flanders Marguerite of France vexed at the ill will of the count her son had one day said to him as she tore open her dress before his eyes Since you will not yield to your mother s wishes I will cut off these breasts which gave suck to you to you and to no other and will throw them to the dogs to devour This singular argument had moved the Count of Flanders he had consented to the marriage and the Duke of Burgundy s power had received such increment by it that on the fourth of October thirteen eighty when Charles VI was crowned at Rheims Philip the Bold without a word said previously to any suddenly went up and sat himself down at the young king s side above his eldest brother the Duke of Anjou thus assuming without anybody s daring to oppose him the rank and the rights of premier peer of France He was not slow to demonstrate that his superiority in externals could not fail to establish his political preponderance His father in law Count Louis of Flanders was in almost continual strife with the great Flemish communes ever on the point of rising against the taxes he heaped upon them and the blows he struck at their privileges The city of Ghent in particular joined complaint with menace In thirteen eighty one the quarrel became war The Ghentese at first experienced reverses Ah if James Van Artevelde were alive said they James Van Artevelde had left a son named Philip and there was in Ghent a burgher captain Peter Dubois who went one evening to see Philip Van Artevelde What we want now said he is to choose a captain of great renown Raise up again in this country that father of yours who in his lifetime was so loved and feared in Flanders Peter replied Philip you make me a great offer I promise that if you put me in that place I will do nought without your advice Ah well said Dubois can you really be haughty and cruel The Flemings like to be treated so with them you must make no more account of the life of men than you do of larks when the season for eating them comes I will do what shall be necessary said Van Artevelde The struggle grew violent between the count and the communes of Flanders with Ghent at their head After alternations of successes and reverses the Ghentese were victorious and Count Louis with difficulty escaped by hiding himself at Bruges in the house of a poor woman who took him up into a loft where her children slept and where he lay flat between the paillasse and the feather bed On leaving this asylum he went to Bapaume to see his son in law the Duke of Burgundy and to ask his aid My lord said the duke to him by the allegiance I owe to you and also to the king you shall have satisfaction It were to fail in one s duty to allow such a scum to govern a country Unless order were restored all knighthood and lordship might be destroyed in Christendom The Duke of Burgundy went to Senlis where Charles VI was and asked for his support on behalf of the Count of Flanders The question was referred to the king s council The Duke of Berry hesitated saying The best part of the prelates and nobles must be assembled and the whole matter set before them we will see what is the general opinion In the midst of this deliberation the young king came in with a hawk on his wrist Well my dear uncles said he of what are you parleying Is it aught that I may know The Duke of Berry enlightened him saying A brewer named Van Artevelde who is English to the core is besieging the remnant of the knights of Flanders shut up in Oudenarde and they can get no aid but from you What say you to it Are you minded to help the Count of Flanders to reconquer his heritage which those presumptuous villains have taken from him By my faith answered the king I am greatly minded go we thither there is nothing I desire so much as to get on my harness for I have never yet borne arms I would fain set out to morrow Amongst the prelates and lords summoned to Compiegne some spoke of the difficulties and dangers that might be encountered Yes yes said the king but begin nought and win nought When the Flemings heard of the king s decision they sent respectful letters to him begging him to be their mediator with the count their lord but the letters were received with scoffs and the messengers were kept in prison At this news Van Artevelde said We must make alliance with the English what meaneth this King Wren of France It is the Duke of Burgundy leading him by the nose and he will not abide by his purpose we will frighten France by showing her that we have the English for allies But Van Artevelde was under a delusion Edward III was no longer King of England the Flemings demand was considered there to be arrogant and opposed to the interests of the lords in all countries and the alliance was not concluded Some attempts at negotiation took place between the advisers of Charles VI and the Flemings but without success The Count of Flanders repaired to the king who said Your quarrel is ours get you back to Artois we shall soon be there and within sight of our enemies Accordingly in November thirteen eighty two the King of France and his army marched into Flanders Several towns Cassel Bergues Gravelines and Turnhout hastily submitted to him There was less complete unanimity and greater alarm amongst the Flemings than their chiefs had anticipated Noble king said the inhabitants we place our persons and our possessions at your discretion and to show you that we recognize you as our lawful lord here are the captains whom Van Artevelde gave us do with them according to your will for it is they who have governed us On the twenty eighth of November the two armies found themselves close together at Rosebecque between Ypres and Courtrai In the evening Van Artevelde assembled his captains at supper and Comrades said he we shall to morrow have rough work for the King of France is here all agog for fighting But have no fear we are defending our good right and the liberties of Flanders The English have not helped us well we shall only have the more honor With the King of France is all the flower of his kingdom Tell your men to slay all and show no quarter We must spare the King of France only he is a child and must be pardoned we will take him away to Ghent and have him taught Flemish As for the dukes counts barons and other men at arms slay them all the commons of France shall not bear us ill will I am quite sure that they would not have a single one of them back At the very same moment King Charles VI was entertaining at supper the princes his uncles the Count of Flanders the constable Oliver de Clisson the marshals c They were arranging the order of battle for the morrow Many folks blamed the Duke of Burgundy for having brought so young a king the hope of the realm into the perils of war It was resolved to confide the care of him to the constable de Clisson whilst conferring upon Sire de Coucy for that day only the command of the army Most dear lord said the constable to the king I know that there is no greater honor than to have the care of your person but it would be great grief to my comrades not to have me with them I say not that they could not do without me but for a fortnight now I have been getting everything ready for bringing most honor to you and yours They would be much surprised if I should now withdraw The king was somewhat embarrassed Constable said he I would fain have you in my company to day you know well that my lord my father loved you and trusted you more than any other in the name of God and saint Denis do whatever you think best You have a clearer insight into the matter than I and those who have advised me Only attend my mass to morrow The battle began with spirit the next morning in the midst of a thick fog According to the monk of saint Denis Van Artevelde was not without disquietude He had bidden one of his people go and observe the French army and You bring me bad news said he to the man in a whisper when you tell me there are so many French with the king I was far from expecting it This is a hard war it requires discreet management I think the best thing for me is to go and hurry up ten thousand of our comrades who are due Why leave thy host without a head said they who were about him it was to obey thy orders that we engaged in this enterprise thou must run the risks of battle with us The French were more confident than Van Artevelde Sir said the constable addressing the king cap in hand be of good cheer these fellows are ours our very varlets might beat them These words were far too presumptuous for the Flemings fought with great bravery Drawn up in a compact body they drove back for a moment the French who were opposed to them but Clisson had made everything ready for hemming them in attacked on all sides they tried but in vain to fly a few with difficulty succeeded in escaping and casting as they went into the neighboring swamps the banner of saint George It is not easy says the monk of saint Denis to set down with any certainty the number of the dead those who were present on this day and I am disposed to follow their account say that twenty five thousand Flemings fell on the field together with their leader Van Artevelde the concoctor of this rebellion whose corpse discovered with great trouble amongst a heap of slain was by order of Charles VI hung upon a tree in the neighborhood The French also lost in this struggle some noble knights not less illustrious by birth than valor amongst others forty four valiant men who being the first to hurl themselves upon the ranks of the enemy to break them thus won for themselves great glory The victory of Rosebecque was a great cause for satisfaction and pride to Charles VI and his uncle the Duke of Burgundy They had conquered on the field in Flanders the commonalty of Paris as well as that of Ghent and in France there was great need of such a success for since the accession of the young king the Parisians had risen with a demand for actual abolition of the taxes of which Charles V on his death bed had deplored the necessity and all but decreed the cessation The king s uncles his guardians had at first stopped and indeed suppressed the greater part of those taxes but soon afterwards they had to face a pressing necessity the war with England was going on and the revenues of the royal domain were not sufficient for the maintenance of it The Duke of Anjou attempted to renew the taxes and one of Charles V s former councillors John Desmarets advocate general in parliament abetted him in his attempt Seven times in the course of the year thirteen eighty one assemblies of notables met at Paris to consider the project and on the first of March thirteen eighty two an agent of the governing power scoured the city at full gallop proclaiming the renewal of the principal tax There was a fresh outbreak The populace armed with all sorts of weapons with strong mallets amongst the rest spread in all directions killing the collectors and storming and plundering the Hotel de Ville They were called the Malleteers They were put down but with as much timidity as cruelty Some of them were arrested and at night thrown into the Seine sewn up in sacks without other formality or trial A fresh meeting of notables was convened towards the middle of April at Compiegne and the deputies from the principal towns were summoned to it but they durst not come to any decision They were come they said only to hear and report they would use their best endeavors to prevail on those by whom they had been sent to do the king s pleasure Towards the end of April some of them returned to Meaux reporting that they had everywhere met with the most lively resistance they had everywhere heard shouted at them Sooner death than the tax Only the deputies from Sens had voted a tax which was to be levied on all merchandise but when the question of collecting it arose the people of Sens evinced such violent opposition that it had to be given up It was when facts and feelings were in this condition in France that Charles VI and the Duke of Burgundy had set out with their army to go and force the Flemish communes to submit to their count Illustration The Procession went over the Gates sixteen Returning victorious from Flanders to France Charles VI and his uncles everywhere brilliantly feasted on their march went first of all for nine days to Compiegne to find recreation after their fatigues says the monk of saint Denis in the pleasures of the chase afterwards on the tenth of January thirteen eighty three the king took back in state to the church of saint Denis the oriflamme which he had borne away on his expedition and next day the eleventh of January he re entered Paris he alone being mounted in the midst of his army The burgesses went out of the city to meet him and offer him their wonted homage but they were curtly ordered to retrace their steps the king and his uncles they were informed could not forget offences so recent The wooden barriers which had been placed before the gates of the city to prevent anybody from entering without permission were cut down with battle axes the very gates were torn from their hinges they were thrown down upon the king s highway and the procession went over them as if to trample under foot the fierce pride of the Parisians When he was once in the city and was leaving Notre Dame the king sent abroad throughout all the streets an order forbidding any one under the most severe penalties from insulting or causing the least harm to the burgesses in any way whatsoever and the constable had two plunderers strung up to the windows of the houses in which they had committed their thefts But fundamental order having been thus upheld reprisals began to be taken for the outbreaks of the Parisians municipal magistrates or populace burgesses or artisans rich or poor in the course of the two preceding years arrests imprisonments fines confiscations executions severities of all kinds fell upon the most conspicuous and the most formidable of those who had headed or favored popular movements The most solemn and most iniquitous of these punishments was that which befell the advocate general John Desmarets For nearly a whole year says the monk of saint Denis he had served as mediator between the king and the Parisians he had often restrained the fury and stopped the excesses of the populace by preventing them from giving rein to their cruelty He was always warning the factious that to provoke the wrath of the king and the princes was to expose themselves to almost certain death But yielding to the prayers of this rebellious and turbulent mob he instead of leaving Paris as the rest of his profession had done had remained there and throwing himself boldly amidst the storms of civil discord he had advised the assumption of arms and the defence of the city which he knew was very displeasing to the king and the grandees When he was taken to execution he was put on a car higher than the rest that he might be better seen by everybody Nothing shook for a moment the firmness of this old man of seventy years Where are they who judged me he said let them come and set forth the reasons for my death Judge me O God and separate my cause from that of the evil doers On his arrival at the market place some of the spectators called out to him Ask the king s mercy Master John that he may pardon your offences He turned round saying I served well and loyally his great grandfather King Philip his grandfather King John and his father King Charles none of those kings ever had anything to reproach me with and this one would not reproach me any the more if he were of a grown man s age and experience I don t suppose that he is a whit to blame for such a sentence and I have no cause to cry him mercy To God alone must I cry for mercy and I pray Him to forgive my sins Public respect accompanied the old and courageous magistrate beyond the scaffold his corpse was taken up by his friends and at a later period honorably buried in the church of saint Catherine After the chastisements came galas again of which the king and his court were immoderately fond Young as he was he was but seventeen his powerful uncle the Duke of Burgundy was very anxious to get him married so as to secure his own personal influence over him The wise Charles V in his dying hours had testified a desire that his son should seek alliances in Germany A son of the reigning duke Stephen of Bavaria had come to serve in the French army and the Duke of Burgundy had asked him if there were any marriageable princess of Bavaria My eldest brother answered the Bavarian has a very beautiful daughter aged fourteen That is just what we want said the Burgundian try and get her over here the king is very fond of beautiful girls if she takes his fancy she will be Queen of France The Duke of Bavaria being informed by his brother at first showed some hesitation It would be a great honor said he for my daughter to be Queen of France but it is a long way from here If my daughter were taken to France and then sent back to me because she was not suitable it would cause me too much chagrin I prefer to marry her at my leisure and in my own neighborhood The matter was pressed however and at last the Duke of Bavaria consented It was agreed that the Princess Isabel should go on a visit to the Duchess of Brabant who instructed her and had her well dressed say the chroniclers for in Germany they clad themselves too simply for the fashions of France Being thus got ready the Princess Isabel was conducted to Amiens where the king then was to whom her portrait had already been shown She was presented to him and bent the knee before him He considered her charming Seeing with what pleasure he looked upon her the constable Oliver de Clisson said to Sire De Coney By my faith she will bide with us The same evening the young king said to his councillor Bureau de la Riviere She pleases me go and tell my uncle the Duke of Burgundy to conclude at once The duke delighted lost no time in informing the ladies of the court who cried Noel for joy The duke had wished the nuptials to take place at Arras but the young king in his impatience was urgent for Amiens without delay saying that he couldn t sleep for her Well well replied his uncle you must be cured of your complaint On the eighteenth of July thirteen eighty five the marriage was celebrated at the cathedral of Amiens whither the Princess Isabel was conducted in a handsome chariot whereof the tires of the wheels were of silvern stuff King uncles and courtiers were far from a thought of the crimes and shame which would be connected in France with the name of Isabel of Bavaria There is still more levity and imprudence in the marriages of kings than in those of their subjects Whilst this marriage was being celebrated the war with England and her new king Richard II was going on but slackly and without result Charles VI and his uncle of Burgundy still full of the proud confidence inspired by their success against the Flemish and Parisian communes resolved to strike England a heavy blow and to go and land there with a powerful army Immense preparations were made in France for this expedition In September thirteen eighty six there were collected in the port of Ecluse Sluys and at sea between Sluys and Blankenberg thirteen hundred and eighty seven vessels according to some and according to others only nine hundred large and small and Oliver de Clisson had caused to be built at Trdguier in Brittany a wooden town which was to be transported to England and rebuilt after landing in such sort says Froissart that the lords might lodge therein and retire at night so as to be in safety from sudden awakenings and sleep in greater security Equal care was taken in the matter of supplies Whoever had been at that time at Bruges or the Dam or the Sluys would have seen how ships and vessels were being laden by torchlight with hay in casks biscuits in sacks onions peas beans barley oats candles gaiters shoes boots spurs iron nails culinary utensils and all things that can be used for the service of man Search was made everywhere for the various supplies and they were very dear If you want us and our service said the Hollanders pay us on the nail otherwise we will be neutral To the intelligent foresight shown in these preparations was added useless magnificence On the masts was nothing to be seen but paintings and gildings everything was emblazoned and covered with armorial bearings But nothing came up to the Duke of Burgundy s ship it was painted all over outside with blue and gold and there were five huge banners with the arms of the duchy of Burgundy and the countships of Flanders Artois Rethel and Burgundy and everywhere the duke s device I m a longing The young king too displayed great anxiety to enter on the campaign He liked to go aboard his ship saying I am very eager to be off I think I shall be a good sailor for the sea does me no harm But everybody was not so impatient as the king who was waiting for his uncle the Duke of Berry and writing to him letter after letter urging him to come The duke who had no liking for the expedition contented himself with making an answer bidding him not to take any trouble but to amuse himself for the matter would probably terminate otherwise than was imagined The Duke of Berry at last arrived at Sluys on the fourteenth of October thirteen eighty six If it hadn t been for you uncle said the king to him we should have been by this time in England Three months had gone by the fine season was past the winds were becoming violent and contrary the vessels come from Treguier with the constable to join the fleet had suffered much on the passage and deliberations were recommencing touching the opportuneness and even the feasibility of the expedition thus thrown back If anybody goes to England I will said the king But nobody went One day when it was calm says the monk of saint Denis the king completely armed went with his uncles aboard of the royal vessel but the wind did not permit them to get more than two miles out to sea and drove them back in spite of the sailors efforts to the shore they had just left The king who saw with deep displeasure his hopes thus frustrated had orders given to his troops to go back and at his departure left by the advice of his barons some men of war to unload the fleet and place it in a place of safety as soon as possible But the enemy gave them no time to execute the order As soon as the calm allowed the English to set sail they bore down on the French burned or took in tow to their own ports the most part of the fleet carried off the supplies and found two thousand casks full of wine which sufficed a long while for the wants of England Such a mistake after such a fuss was probably not unconnected with a resolution adopted by Charles VI some time after the abandonment of the projected expedition against England In October thirteen eighty eight he assembled at Rheims a grand council at which were present his two uncles the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry the third the Duke of Anjou had died in Italy on the twentieth of September thirteen eighty four after a vain attempt to conquer the kingdom of Naples his brother the Duke of Orleans his cousins and several prelates and lords of note The chancellor announced thereat that he had been ordered by the king to put in discussion the question whether it were not expedient that he should henceforth take the government of his kingdom upon himself Cardinal Ascelin de Montaigu Bishop of Laon the first to be interrogated upon this subject replied that in his opinion the king was quite in a condition as well as in a legal position to take the government of his kingdom upon himself and without naming anybody he referred to the king s uncles and especially to the Duke of Burgundy as being no longer necessary for the government of France Nearly all who were present were of the same opinion The king without further waiting thanked his uncles for the care they had taken of his dominions and of himself and begged them to continue their affection for him Neither the Duke of Burgundy nor the Duke of Berry had calculated upon this resolution they submitted without making any objection but not without letting a little temper leak out The Duke of Berry even said that he and his brother would beg the king to confer with them more maturely on the subject when he returned to Paris Hereupon the council broke up the king s two uncles started for their own dominions and a few weeks afterwards the Cardinal bishop of Laon died of a short illness It was generally believed says the monk of saint Denis that he died of poison At his own dying wish no inquiry was instituted on this subject The measure adopted in the late council was however generally approved of The king was popular he had a good heart and courteous and gentle manners he was faithful to his friends and affable to all and the people liked to see him passing along the streets On taking in hand the government he recalled to it the former advisers of his father Charles V Bureau de la Riviere Le Mercier de Noviant and Le Begue de Vilaine all men of sense and reputation The taxes were diminished the city of Paris recovered a portion of her municipal liberties there was felicitation for what had been obtained and there was hope of more Charles VI was not content with the satisfaction of Paris only he wished all his realm to have cognizance of and to profit by his independence He determined upon a visit to the centre and the south of France Such a trip was to himself and to the princes and cities that entertained him a cause of enormous expense When the king stopped anywhere there were wanted for his own table and for the maintenance of his following six oxen eighty sheep thirty calves seven hundred chickens two hundred pigeons and many other things besides The expenses for the king were set down at two hundred and thirty livres a day without counting the presents which the large towns felt bound to make him But Charles was himself magnificent even to prodigality and he delighted in the magnificence of which he was the object without troubling himself about their cost to himself Between thirteen eighty nine and thirteen ninety for about six months he travelled through Burgundy the banks of the Rhone Languedoc and the small principalities bordering on the Pyrenees Everywhere his progress was stopped for the purpose of presenting to him petitions or expressing wishes before him At Nimes and Montpellier and throughout Languedoc passionate representations were made to him touching the bad government of his two uncles the Dukes of Anjou and Berry They had plundered and ruined he was told that beautiful and rich province there were five or six talliages a year one was no sooner over than another began they had levied quite three millions of gold from Villeneuve d Avignon to Toulouse Charles listened with feeling and promised to have justice done and his father s old councillors who were in his train were far from dissuading him The Duke of Burgundy seeing him start with them in his train had testified his spite and disquietude to the Duke of Berry saying Aha there goes the king on a visit to Languedoc to hold an inquiry about those who have governed it For all his council be takes with him only La Riviere Le Mercier Montaigu and Le Begue de Vilaine What say you to that my brother The king our nephew is young answered the Duke of Berry if he trusts the new councillors he is taking he will be deceived and it will end ill as you will see As for the present we must support him The time will come when we will make those councillors and the king himself rue it Let them do as they please by God we will return to our own dominions We are none the less the two greatest in the kingdom and so long as we are united none can do aught against us The future is a blank as well to the anxieties as to the hopes of men The king s uncles were on the point of getting back the power which they believed to be lost to them On the thirteenth of June thirteen ninety two the constable Oliver de Clisson was waylaid as he was returning home after a banquet given by the king at the hostel of saint Paul The assassin was Peter de Craon cousin of John IV Duke of Brittany He believed De Clisson to be dead and left him bathed in blood at a baker s door in the street called Culture Sainte Catherine The king was just going to bed when one of his people came and said to him Ah sir a great misfortune has happened in Paris What and to whom said the king To your constable sir who has just been slain Slain cried Charles and by whom Nobody knows but it was close by here in saint Catherine Street Lights quick said the king I will go and see him and he set off without waiting for his following When he entered the baker s shop De Clisson grievously wounded was just beginning to recover his senses Ah constable said the king and how do you feel Very poorly dear sir And who brought you to this pass Peter de Craon and his accomplices traitorously and without warning Constable said the king never was anything so punished or dearly paid for as this shall be take thought for yourself and have no further care it is my affair Orders were immediately given to seek out Peter de Craon and hurry on his trial He had taken refuge first in his own castle of Sable and afterwards with the Duke of Brittany who kept him concealed and replied to the king s envoys that he did not know where he was The king proclaimed his intention of making war on the Duke of Brittany until Peter de Craon should be discovered and justice done to the constable Preparations for war were begun and the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy received orders to get ready for it themselves and their vassals The former who happened to be in Paris at the time of the attack did not care to directly oppose the king s project but he evaded delayed and predicted a serious war According to Froissart he had been warned the morning before the attack by a simple cleric of Peter de Craon s design but It is too late in the day he had said I do not like to trouble the king to day to morrow without fail we will see to it He had however forgotten or neglected to speak to his nephew Neither he nor his brother the Duke of Burgundy there is reason to suppose were accomplices in the attack upon De Clisson but they were not at all sorry for it It was to them an incident in the strife begun between themselves princes of the blood royal and those former councillors of Charles V and now again of Charles VI whom with the impertinence of great lords they were wont to call the marinosettes They left nothing undone to avert the king s anger and to preserve the Duke of Brittany from the war which was threatening him Charles VI s excitement was very strong and endured forever He pressed forward eagerly his preparations for war though attempts were made to appease him He was recommended to take care of himself for he had been ill and could scarcely mount his horse and the Duke of Burgundy remonstrated with him several times on the fatigue he was incurring I find it better for me he answered to be on horseback or working at my council than to keep resting Whoso wishes to persuade me otherwise is not of my friends and is displeasing to me A letter from the Queen of Arragon gave some ground for supposing that Peter de Craon had taken refuge in Spain and the Duke of Burgundy took advantage of it to dissuade the king from his prompt departure for the war in Brittany At the very least he said it was right to send to Arragon to know the truth of the matter and to thank the queen for her courtesy We are quite willing uncle answered Charles you need not be vexed but for my own part I hold that this traitor of a Peter de Craon is in no other prison and no other Barcelona than there is in being quite comfortable at the Duke of Brittany s There was no way of deterring him from his purpose He had got together his uncles and his troops at Le Mans and after passing three weeks there he gave the word to march for Brittany The tragic incident which at that time occurred has nowhere been more faithfully or better narrated than in M de Barante s History of the Dukes of Burgundy It was says he the beginning of August thirteen ninety two during the hottest days of the year The sun was blazing especially in those sandy districts The king was on horseback clad in a short and tight dress called a jacket His was of black velvet and very oppressive On his head he wore a cap of scarlet velvet ornamented with a chaplet of large pearls which the queen had given him at his departure Behind him were two pages on horseback In order not to incommode the king with dust he was left to march almost alone To the left of him were the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry some paces in front conversing together The Duke of Orleans the Duke of Bourbon Sire de Coney and some others were also in front forming another group Behind were Sires de Navarre de Bar d Albret d Artois and many others in one pretty large troop They rode along in this order and had just entered the great forest of Le Mans when all at once there started from behind a tree by the road side a tall man with bare head and feet clad in a common white smock who dashing forward and seizing the king s horse by the bridle cried Go no farther thou art betrayed Illustration Thou art betrayed twenty six The men at arms hurried up immediately and striking the hands of the fellow with the butts of their lances made him let go the bridle As he had the appearance of a poor madman and nothing more he was allowed to go without any questioning and he followed the king for nearly half an hour repeating the same cry from a distance The king was much troubled at this sudden apparition and his head which was very weak was quite turned by it Nevertheless the march was continued When the forest had been traversed they came to a great sandy plain where the rays of the sun were more scorching than ever One of the king s pages overcome by the heat had fallen asleep and the lance he carried fell against his helmet and suddenly caused a loud clash of steel The king shuddered and then he was observed rising in his stirrups to draw his sword touch his horse with the spur and make a dash crying Forward upon these traitors They would deliver me up to the enemy Every one moved hastily aside but not before some were wounded it is even said that several were killed among them a bastard of Polignac The king s brother the Duke of Orleans happened to be quite close by Fly my nephew d Orleans shouted the Duke of Burgundy my lord is beside himself My God let some one try and seize him He was so furious that none durst risk it and he was left to gallop hither and thither and tire himself in pursuit of first one and then another At last when he was weary and bathed in sweat his chamberlain William de Martel came up behind and threw his arms about him He was surrounded had his sword taken from him was lifted from his horse and laid gently on the ground and then his jacket was unfastened His brother and his uncles came up but his eyes were fixed and recognized nobody and he did not utter a word We must go back to Le Mans said the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy here is an end of the trip to Brittany On the way they fell in with a wagon drawn by oxen in this they laid the King of France having bound him for fear of a renewal of his frenzy and so took him back motionless and speechless to the town It was not a mere fit of delirious fever it was the beginning of a radical mental derangement sometimes in abeyance or at least for some time alleviated but bursting out again without appreciable reason and aggravated at every fresh explosion Charles VI had always had a taste for masquerading When in thirteen eighty nine the young queen Isabel of Bavaria came to Paris to be married the king on the morning of her entry said to his chamberlain Sire de Savoisy Prithee take a good horse and I will mount behind thee and we will dress so as not to be known and go to see my wife cone in Savoisy did not like it but the king insisted and so they went in this guise through the crowd and got many a blow from the officers staves when they attempted to approach too near the procession In thirteen ninety three a year after his first outbreak of madness the king during an entertainment at court conceived the idea of disguising as savages himself and five of his courtiers They had been sewn up in a linen skin which defined their whole bodies and this skin had been covered with a resinous pitch so as to hold sticking upon it a covering of tow which made them appear hairy from head to foot Thus disguised these savages went dancing into the ball room one of those present took up a lighted torch and went up to them and in a moment several of them were in flames It was impossible to get off the fantastic dresses clinging to their bodies Save the king shouted one of the poor masquers but it was not known which was the king The Duchess de Berry his aunt recognized him caught hold of him and wrapped him in her robe saying Do not move you see your companions are burning And thus he was saved amidst the terror of all present When he was conscious of his mad state he was horrified he asked pardon for the injury he had done confessed and received the communion Later when he perceived his malady returning he would allude to it with tears in his eyes ask to have his hunting knife taken away and say to those about him If any of you by I know not what witchcraft be guilty of my sufferings I adjure him in the name of Jesus Christ to torment me no more and to put an end to me forthwith without making me linger so He conceived a horror of Queen Isabel and without recognizing her would say when he saw her What woman is this What does she want Will she never cease her importunities Save me from her persecution At first great care was taken of him They sent for a skilful doctor from Laon named William de Harsely who put him on a regimen from which for some time good effects were experienced But the doctor was uncomfortable at court he preferred going back to his little place at Laon where he soon afterwards died and eleven years later in fourteen oh five nobody took any more trouble about the king He was fed like a dog and allowed to fall ravenously upon his food For five whole months he had not a change of clothes At last some shame was felt for this neglect and an attempt was made to repair it It took a dozen men to overcome the madman s resistance He was washed shaved and dressed in fresh clothes He became more composed and began once more to recognize certain persons amongst others the former provost of Paris Juvenal des Ursins whose visit appeared to give him pleasure and to whom he said without well knowing why Juvenal let us not waste our time On his good days he was sometimes brought in to sit at certain councils at which there was a discussion about the diminution of taxes and relief of the people and he showed symptoms at intervals of taking an interest in them A fair young Burgundian Odette de Champdivers was the only one amongst his many favorites who was at all successful in soothing him during his violent fits It was Duke John the Fearless who had placed her near the king that she might promote his own influence and she took advantage of it to further her own fortunes which however did not hinder her from afterwards passing into the service of Charles VII against the house of Burgundy Illustration Charles VI and Odette seventy one For thirty years from thirteen ninety two to fourteen twenty two the crown remained on the head of this poor madman whilst France was a victim to the bloody quarrels of the royal house to national dismemberment to licentiousness in morals to civil anarchy and to foreign conquest When for the first time in the forest of Le Mans the Dukes of Berry and Burgundy saw their nephew in this condition their first feeling was one of sorrow and disquietude The Duke of Burgundy especially who was accessible to generous and sympathetic emotions cried out with tears as he embraced the king My lord and nephew comfort me with just one word But the desires and the hopes of selfish ambition reappeared before long more prominently than these honest effusions of feeling All said the Duke of Berry De Clisson La Mviere Noviant and Vilaine have been haughty and harsh towards me the time has come when I shall pay them out in the same coin from the same mint The guardianship of the king was withdrawn from his councillors and transferred to four chamberlains chosen by his uncles The two dukes however did not immediately lay hands on the government of the kingdom the constable De Clisson and the late councillors of Charles V remained in charge of it for some time longer they had given enduring proofs of capacity and fidelity to the king s service and the two dukes did not at first openly attack them but labored strenuously nevertheless to destroy them The Duke of Burgundy one day said to Sire de Noviant I have been overtaken by a very pressing business for which I require forthwith thirty thousand crowns let me have them out of my lord s treasury I will restore them at another time Noviant answered respectfully that the council must be spoken to about it I wish none to know of it said the duke Noviant persisted You will not do me this favor rejoined the duke you shall rue it before long It was against the constable that the wrath of the princes was chiefly directed He was the most powerful and the richest One day he went with a single squire behind him to the Duke of Burgundy s house and My lord said he many knights and squires are persecuting me to get the money which is owing to them I know not where to find it The chancellor and the treasurer refer me to you Since it is you and the Duke of Berry who govern may it please you to give me an answer Clisson said the duke you have no occasion to trouble yourself about the state of the kingdom it will manage very well without your services Whence pray have you been able to amass so much money My lord my brother of Berry and myself have not so much between us three Away from my presence and let me see you no more If I had not a respect for myself I would have your other eye put out Clisson went out mounted his horse returned to his house set his affairs in order and departed with two attendants to his strong castle of Montlhery The two dukes were very sorry that they had not put him under arrest on the spot The rupture came to a climax Of the king s four other councillors one escaped in time two were seized and thrown into prison the fourth Bureau de la Riviere was at his castle of Auneau near Chartres honored and beloved by all his neighbors Everybody urged him to save himself If I were to fly or hide myself said he I should acknowledge myself guilty of crimes from which I feel myself free Here as elsewhere I am at the will of God He gave me all I have and He can take it away whensoever He pleases I served King Charles of blessed memory and also the king his son and they recompensed me handsomely for my services I will abide the judgment of the parliament of Paris touching what I have done according to my king s commands as to the affairs of the realm He was told that the people sent to look for him were hard by and was asked Shall we open to them Why not was his reply He himself went to meet them and received them with a courtesy which they returned He was then removed to Paris where he was shut up with his colleagues in the Louvre Their trial before parliament was prosecuted eagerly especially in the case of the absent De Clisson whom a royal decree banished from the kingdom as a false and wicked traitor to the crown and condemned him to pay a hundred thousand marks of silver and to forfeit forever the office of constable It is impossible in the present day to estimate how much legal justice there was in this decree but in any case it was certainly extreme severity to so noble and valiant a warrior who had done so much for the safety and honor of France The Dukes of Burgundy and Berry and many barons of the realm signed the decree but the king s brother the Duke of Orleans refused to have any part in it Against the other councillors of the king the prosecution was continued with fits and starts of determination but in general with slowness and uncertainty Under the influence of the Dukes of Burgundy and Berry the parliament showed an inclination towards severity but Bureau de la Riviere had warm friends and amongst others the young and beautiful Duchess of Berry to whose marriage he had greatly contributed and John Juvenal des Ursins provost of the tradesmen of Paris one of the men towards whom the king and the populace felt the highest esteem and confidence The king favorably inclined towards the accused by his own bias and the influence of the Duke of Orleans presented a demand to parliament to have the papers of the procedure brought to him Parliament hesitated and postponed a reply the procedure followed its course and at the end of some months further the king ordered it to be stopped and Sires de la Riviere and Neviant to be set at liberty and to have their real property restored to them at the same time that they lost their personal property and were commanded to remain forever at fifteen leagues distance at least from the court This was moral equity if not legal justice The accused had been able and faithful servants of their king and country Their imprisonment had lasted more than a year The Dukes of Burgundy and Berry remained in possession of power They exercised it for ten years from thirteen ninety two to fourteen oh two without any great dispute between themselves the Duke of Burgundy s influence being predominant or with the king who save certain lucid intervals took merely a nominal part in the government During this period no event of importance disturbed France internally In thirteen ninety three the King of England Richard II son of the Black Prince sought in marriage the daughter of Charles VI Isabel of France only eight years old In both courts and in both countries there was a desire for peace An embassy came in state to demand the hand of the princess The ambassadors were presented and the Earl of Northampton marshal of England putting one knee to the ground before her said Madame please God you shall be our sovereign lady and Queen of England The young girl well tutored answered If it please God and my lord and father that I should be Queen of England I would be willingly for I have certainly been told that I should then be a great lady The contract was signed on the ninth of March thirteen ninety six with a promise that when the princess had accomplished her twelfth year she should be free to assent to or refuse the union and ten days after the marriage the king s uncles and the English ambassadors mutually signed a truce which promised but quite in vain to last for eight and twenty years About the same time Sigismund King of Hungary threatened with an invasion of his kingdom by the great Turkish Sultan Bajazet I nicknamed Lightning El Derfr because of his rapid conquests invoked the aid of the Christian kings of the West and especially of the King of France Thereupon there was a fresh outbreak of those crusades so often renewed since the end of the thirteenth century All the knighthood of France arose for the defence of a Christian king John Count of Nevers eldest son of the Duke of Burgundy scarcely eighteen years of age said to his comrades If it pleased my two lords my lord the king and my lord and father I would willingly head this army and this venture for I have a desire to make myself known The Duke of Burgundy consented and in person conducted his son to saint Denis but without intending to make him a knight as yet He shall receive the accolade said he as a knight of Jesus Christ at the first battle against the infidels In April thirteen ninety six an army of new crusaders left France and traversed Germany uproariously everywhere displaying its valiant ardor presumptuous recklessness and chivalrous irregularity Some months elapsed without any news but at the beginning of December there were seen arriving in France some poor creatures half naked dying of hunger cold and weariness and giving deplorable accounts of the destruction of the French army The people would not believe them They ought to be thrown into the water they said these scoundrels who propagate such lies But on the twenty third of December there arrived at Paris James de Helly a knight of Artois who booted and spurred strode into the hostel of saint Paul threw himself on his knees before the king in the midst of the princes and reported that he had come straight from Turkey that on the twenty eighth of the preceding September the Christian army had been destroyed at the battle of Nicopolis that most of the lords had been either slain in battle or afterwards massacred by the sultan s order and that the Count of Nevers had sent him to the king and to his father the duke to get negotiations entered into for his release There was no exaggeration about the knight s story The battle had been terrible the slaughter awful For the latter the French who were for a moment victorious had set a cruel example with their prisoners and Bajazet had surpassed them in cool ferocity After the first explosion of the father s and the people s grief the ransom of the prisoners became the topic It was a large sum and rather difficult to raise and whilst it was being sought for James de Helly returned to report as much to Bajazet and to place himself once more in his power Thou art welcome said the sultan thou hast loyally kept thy word I give thee thy liberty thou canst go whither thou wiliest Terms of ransom were concluded and the sum total was paid through the hands of Bartholomew Pellegrini a Genoese trader Before the Count of Nevers and his comrades set out Bajazet sent for them John said he to the count through an interpreter I know that thou art a great lord in thy country and the son of a great lord Thou art young It may be that thou art abashed and grieved at what hath befallen thee in thy first essay of knighthood and that to retrieve thine honor thou wilt collect a powerful army against me I might ere I release thee bind thee by oath not to take arms against me neither thyself nor thy people But no I will not exact this oath either from them or from thee When thou hast returned yonder take up arms if it please thee and come and attack me Thou wilt find me ever ready to receive thee in the open field thee and thy men at arms And what I say to thee I say for the sake of all the Christians thou mayest purpose to bring I fear them not I was born to fight them and to conquer the world Everywhere and at all times human pride with its blind arrogance is the same Bajazet saw no glimpse of that future when his empire would be decaying and held together only by the interested protection of Christian powers After paying dearly for their errors and their disasters Count John of Nevers and his comrades in captivity re entered France in February thirteen ninety eight and their expedition to Hungary was but one of the last vain ventures of chivalry in the great struggle that commenced in the seventh century between Islamry and Christendom While this tragic incident was taking place in Eastern Europe the court of the mad king was falling a victim to rivalries intrigues and scandals which towards the close of this reign were to be the curse and the shame of France

none	none	 At this answer the assembly broke up It had just been reported that the Duke of Burgundy had completely beaten and reduced to submission the insurgent Liegese and that he was preparing to return to Paris with his army Great was the consternation amongst the council of the queen and princes They feared above everything to see the king and the dauphin in the Duke of Burgundy s power and it was decided to quit Paris which had always testified a favorable disposition towards Duke John Charles VI was the first to depart on the threed of November fourteen oh eight The queen the dauphin and the princes followed him two days afterwards and at Gien they all took boat on the Loire to go to Tours The Duke of Burgundy on his arrival at Paris on the twenty eighth of November found not a soul belonging to the royal family or the court and he felt a moment s embarrassment Even his audacity and lack of scruple did not go to the extent of doing without the king altogether or even of dispensing with having him for a tool and he had seen too much of the Parisian populace not to know how precarious and fickle was its favor He determined to negotiate with the king s party and for that purpose he sent his brother in law the Count of Hainault to Tours with a brilliant train of unarmed attendants bidden to make themselves agreeable and not to fight A recent event had probably much to do with his decision His most indomitable foe she to whom the king and his councillors had lately granted a portion of the vengeance she was seeking to take on him Valentine of Milan Duchess of Orleans died on the fourth of December fourteen oh eight at Blois far from satisfied with the moral reparation she had obtained in her enemy s absence and clearly foreseeing that against the Duke of Burgundy flushed with victory and present in person she would obtain nothing of what she had asked For spirits of the best mettle and especially for a woman s heart impotent passion is a heavy burden to bear and Valentine Visconti beautiful amiable and unhappy even in her best days through the fault of the husband she loved sank under this trial At the close of her life she had taken for device Nought have I more more hold I nought Bien ne m est plus plus ne m est rien and so fully was that her habitual feeling that she had the words inscribed upon the black tapestry of her chamber In her last hours she had by her side her three sons and her daughter but there was another still whom she remembered She sent for a child six years of age John a natural son of her husband by Marietta d Enghien wife of Sire de Cany Dunois This one said she was filched from me yet there is not a child so well cut out as he to avenge his father s death Twenty five years later John was the famous Bastard of Orleans Count Dunois Charles VII s lieutenant general and Joan of Arc s comrade in the work of saving the French kingship and France Illustration Death of Valentine de Milan forty five The Duke of Burgundy s negotiations at Tours were not fruitless The result was that on the ninth of March fourteen oh nine a treaty was concluded and an interview effected at Chartres between the duke on one side and on the other the king the queen the dauphin all the royal family the councillors of the crown the young Duke of Orleans his brother and a hundred knights of their house all met together to hear the king declare that he pardoned the Duke of Burgundy The duke prayed my lord of Orleans and my lords his brothers to banish from their hearts all hatred and vengeance and the princes of Orleans assented to what the king commanded them and forgave their cousin the Duke of Burgundy everything entirely On the way back from Chartres the Duke of Burgundy s fool kept playing with a church paten called peace and thrusting it under his cloak saying See this is a cloak of peace and Many folks says Juvenal des Ursins considered this fool pretty wise The Duke of Burgundy had good reason however for seeking this outward reconciliation it put an end to a position too extended not to become pretty soon untenable the peace was a cause of great joy at Paris the king was not long coming back and two hundred thousand persons says the chronicle went out to meet him shouting Noel The Duke of Burgundy had gone out to receive him and the queen and the princes arrived two days after wards It was not known at the time though it was perhaps the most serious result of the negotiation that a secret understanding had been established between John the Fearless and Isabel of Bavaria The queen as false as she was dissolute had seen that the duke might be of service to her on occasion if she served him in her turn and they had added the falsehood of their undivulged arrangement to that of the general reconciliation But falsehood does not extinguish the facts it attempts to disguise The hostility between the houses of Orleans and Burgundy could not fail to survive the treaty of Chartres and cause search to be made for a man to head the struggle so soon as it could be recommenced The hour and the man were not long waited for In the very year of the treaty Charles of Orleans eldest son of the murdered duke and Valentine of Milan lost his wife Isabel of France daughter of Charles VI and as early as the following year fourteen ten the princes his uncles made him marry Bonne d Armagnac daughter of Count Bernard d Armagnac one of the most powerful the most able and the most ambitious lords of Southern France Forthwith in concert with the Duke of Berry the Duke of Brittany and several other lords Count Bernard put himself at the head of the Orleans party and prepared to proceed against the Duke of Burgundy in the cause of dominion combined with vengeance From fourteen ten to fourteen fifteen France was a prey to civil war between the Armagnacs and Burgundians and to their alternate successes and reverses brought about by the unscrupulous employment of the most odious and desperate means The Burgundians had generally the advantage in the struggle for Paris was chiefly the centre of it and their influence was predominant there Their principal allies there were the butchers the boldest and most ambitious corporation in the city For a long time the butcher trade of Paris had been in the hands of a score of families the number had been repeatedly reduced and at the opening of the fifteenth century three families the Legoix the saint Yons and the Thiberts had exercised absolute mastery in the market district which in turn exercised mastery over nearly the whole city One Caboche a flayer of beasts in the shambles of Hotel Dieu and Master John de Troyes a surgeon with a talent for speaking were their most active associates Their company consisted of prentice butchers medical students skinners tailors and every kind of lewd fellows When anybody caused their displeasure they said Here s an Armagnac and despatched him on the spot and plundered his house or dragged him off to prison to pay dear for his release The rich burgesses lived in fear and peril More than three hundred of them went off to Melun with the provost of tradesmen who could no longer answer for the tranquillity of the city The Armagnacs in spite of their general inferiority sometimes got the upper hand and did not then behave with much more discretion than the others They committed the mistake of asking aid from the King of England promising him the immediate surrender of all the cities castles and bailiwicks they still possessed in Guienne and Poitou Their correspondence fell into the hands of the Burgundians and the Duke of Burgundy showed the king himself a letter stating that the Duke of Berry the Duke of Orleans and the Duke of Bourbon had lately conspired together at Bourges for the destruction of the king the kingdom and the good city of Paris Ah cried the poor king with tears we quite see their wickedness and we do conjure you who are of our own blood to aid and advise us against them The duke and his partisans kneeling on one knee promised the king all the assistance possible with their persons and their property The civil war was passionately carried on The Burgundians went and besieged Bourges The siege continued a long while without success Some of the besiegers grew weary of it Negotiations were opened with the besieged An interview took place before the walls between the Duke of Berry and the Duke of Burgundy Nephew said the former I have acted ill and you still worse It is for us to try and maintain the kingdom in peace and prosperity I will be no obstacle uncle answered Duke John Peace was made It was stipulated that the Duke of Berry and the Armagnac lords should give up all alliance with the English and all confederacy against the Duke of Burgundy who on his side should give up any that he might have formed against them An engagement was entered into mutually to render aid service and obedience to the king against his foe of England as they were bound by right and reason to do and lastly a promise was made to observe the articles of the peace of Chartres and to swear them over again There was a special prohibition against using for the future the words Armagnacs and Burgundians or any other term reflecting upon either party The pacification was solemnly celebrated at Auxerre on the twenty twod of August fourteen twelve and on the twenty ninth of September following the dauphin once more entered Paris with the Duke of Burgundy at his side The king queen and Duke of Berry arrived a few days afterwards The people gave a hearty reception to them even to the Armagnacs well known as such in their train but the butchers and the men of their faction murmured loudly and treated the peace as treason Outside it was little more than nominal the Count of Armagnac remained under arms and the Duke of Orleans held aloof from Paris A violent ferment again began there The butchers continued to hold the mastery The Duke of Burgundy all the while finding them very much in the way did not cease to pay court to them Many of his knights were highly displeased at seeing themselves mixed up with such fellows The honest burgesses began to be less frightened at the threats and more angry at the excesses of the butchers The advocate general Juvenal des Ursins had several times called without being received at the Hotel d Artois but one night the Duke of Burgundy sent for him and asked him what he thought of the position My lord said the magistrate do not persist in always maintaining that you did well to have the Duke of Orleans slain enough mischief has come of it to make you agree that you were wrong It is not to your honor to let yourself be guided by flayers of beasts and a lot of lewd fellows I can guarantee that a hundred burgesses of Paris of the highest character would undertake to attend you everywhere and do whatever you should bid them and even lend you money if you wanted it The duke listened patiently but answered that he had done no wrong in the case of the Duke of Orleans and would never confess that he had As to the fellows of whom you speak said he I know my own business Juvenal returned home without much belief in the duke s firmness He himself full of courage as he was durst not yet declare himself openly The thought of all this occupied his mind incessantly sleeping and waking One night when he had fallen asleep towards morning it seemed to him that a voice kept saying Surgite cum sederitis qui manducatis panem doloris Rise up from your sitting ye who eat the bread of sorrow When he awoke his wife a good and pious woman said to him My dear this morning I heard some one saying to you or you pronouncing in a dream some words that I have often read in my Hours and she repeated them to him My dear answered Juvenal we have eleven children and consequently great cause to pray God to grant us peace let us hope in Him and He will help us He often saw the Duke of Berry Well Juvenal the old prince would say to him shall this last forever Shall we be forever under the sway of these lewd fellows My lord Juvenal would answer hope we in God yet a little while and we shall see them confounded and destroyed Nor was Juvenal mistaken The opposition to the yoke of the Burgundians was daily becoming more and more earnest and general The butchers attempted to stein the current but the carpenters took sides against them saying We will see which are the stronger in Paris the hewers of wood or the fellers of oxen The parliament the exchequer chamber and the Hotel de Ville demanded peace and the shouts of Peace peace resounded in the streets A great crowd of people assembled on the Greve and thither the butchers came with their company of about twelve hundred persons it is said They began to speak against peace but could not get a hearing Let those who are for it go to the right shouted a voice and those who are against it to the left But the adversaries of peace durst not risk this test The Duke of Burgundy could not help seeing that he was declining rapidly he was no longer summoned to the king s council a watch was kept upon his house and he determined to go away On the twenty threed of August fourteen thirteen without a word said even to his household he went away to the wood of Vincennes prevailing on the king to go hawking with him There was a suspicion that the duke meant to carry off the king Juvenal des Ursins with a company of armed burgesses hurried off to Vincennes and going straight to the king said Sir come away to Paris it is too hot to be out The king turned to go back to the city The Duke of Burgundy was angry saying that the king was going a hawking You would take him too far rejoined Juvenal your people are in travelling dress and you have your trumpeters with you Illustration John the Fearless fifty one The duke took leave of the king said business required his presence in Flanders and went off as fast as he could When it was known that he had gone there was a feeling of regret and disquietude amongst the sensible and sober burgesses at Paris What they wanted was peace and in order to have it the adherence of the Duke of Burgundy was indispensable Whilst he was present there might be hope of winning him or forcing him over to it but whilst he was absent headstrong as he was known to be a renewal of war was the most probable contingency And this result appeared certain when it was seen how the princes hostile to the Duke of Burgundy above all Duke Charles of Orleans the Count of Armagnac and their partisans hastened back to Paris and resumed their ascendency with the king and in his council The dauphin Louis Duke of Aquitaine united himself by the ties of close friendship with the Duke of Orleans and prevailed upon him to give up the mourning he had worn since his father s murder the two princes appeared everywhere dressed alike the scarf of Armagnac re placed that of Burgundy the feelings of the populace changed as the fashion of the court and when children sang in the streets the song but lately in vogue Burgundy s duke God give thee joy they were struck and hurled to the ground Facts were before long in accordance with appearances After a few pretences of arrangement the Duke of Burgundy took up arms and marched on Paris Charles VI on his side annulled in the presence of Parliament all acts adverse to the Duke of Orleans and his adherents and the king the queen and the dauphin bound themselves by oath not to treat with the duke of Burgundy until they had destroyed his power At the end of March fourteen fourteen the king s army was set in motion Compiegne Soissons and Bapaume which held out for the Duke of Burgundy were successively taken by assault or surrendered the royal troops treated the people as vanquished rebels and the four great communes of Flanders sent a deputation to the king to make protestations of their respect and an attempt to arrange matters between their lord and his suzerain Animosity was still too lively and too recent in the king s camp to admit of satisfaction with a victory as yet incomplete On the twenty eighth of July began the siege of Arras but after five weeks the besiegers had made no impression an epidemic came upon them the Duke of Bavaria and the constable Charles d Albret were attacked by it weariness set in on both sides the Duke of Burgundy himself began to be anxious about his position and he sent the Duke of Brabant his brother and the Countess of Hainault his sister to the king and the dauphin with more submissive words than he had hitherto deigned to utter The Countess of Hainault pleading the ties of family and royal interests managed to give the dauphin a bias towards peace and the dauphin in his turn worked upon the mind of the king who was becoming more and more feeble and accessible to the most opposite impressions It was in vain that the most intimate friends of the Duke of Orleans tried to keep the king steadfast in his wrath from night to morning One day when he was still in bed one of them softly approaching and putting his hand under the coverlet said plucking him by the foot My lord are you asleep No cousin answered the king you are quite welcome is there anything new No sir only that your people report that if you would assault Arras there would be good hope of effecting an entry But if my cousin of Burgundy listens to reason and puts the town into my hands without assault we will make peace What sir you would make peace with this wicked this disloyal man who so cruelly had your brother slain But all was forgiven him with the consent of my nephew of Orleans said the king mournfully Alas sir you will never see that brother again Let me be cousin said the king impatiently I shall see him again on the day of judgment Notwithstanding this stubborn way of working up the irreconcilable enmities which caused divisions in the royal family peace was decided upon and concluded at Arras on the fourth of September fourteen fourteen on conditions as vague as ever which really put no end to the causes of civil war but permitted the king on the one hand and the Duke of Burgundy on the other to call themselves and to wear an appearance of being reconciled A serious event which happened abroad at that time was heavily felt in France reawakened the spirit of nationality and opened the eyes of all parties a little to the necessity of suspending their own selfish disagreements Henry IV King of England died on the twentieth of March fourteen thirteen Having been chiefly occupied with the difficulties of his own government at home he without renouncing the war with France had not prosecuted it vigorously and had kept it in suspense or adjournment by a repetition of truces Henry V his son and successor a young prince of five and twenty active ambitious able and popular gave from the very moment of his accession signs of having bolder views which were not long coming to maturity in respect of his relations with France The Duke of Burgundy had undoubtedly anticipated them for as soon as he was cognizant of Henry IV s death he made overtures in London for the marriage of his daughter Catherine with the new King of England and he received at Bruges an English embassy on the subject When this was known at Paris the council of Charles VI sent to the Duke of Burgundy Sire de Dampierre and the Bishop of Evreux bearing letters to him from the king which forbade him on pain of forfeiture and treason to enter into any treaty with the King of England either for his daughter s marriage or for any other cause But the views of Henry V soared higher than a marriage with a daughter of the Duke of Burgundy It was to the hand of the King of France s daughter herself also named Catherine that he made pretension flattering himself that he would find in this union aid in support of his pretences to the crown of France These pretences he put forward hardly a year after his accession to the throne basing them as Edward III had done on the alleged right of Isabel of France wife of Edward II to succeed King John No reply was vouchsafed from Paris to this demand Only the Princess Catherine who was but thirteen was presented to the envoys of the King of England and she struck them as being tall and beautiful A month later in August fourteen fourteen Henry V gave Charles VI to understand that he would be content with a strict execution of the treaty of Bretigny with the addition of Normandy Anjou and Maine and the hand of the Princess Catherine with a dowry of two million crowns The war between Charles VI and John the Fearless caused a suspension of all negotiations on this subject but after the peace of Arras in January fourteen fifteen a new and solemn embassy from England arrived at Paris and the late proposals were again brought forward The ambassadors had a magnificent reception splendid presents and entertainments were given them but no answer was made to their demands they were only told that the King of France was about to send an embassy to the King of England It did not set out before the twenty seventh of the following April the Archbishop of Bourges the most eloquent prelate in the council was its spokesman and it had orders to offer the King of England the hand of the Princess Catherine with a dowry of eight hundred and forty thousand golden crowns besides fifteen towns in Aquitaine and the seneschalty of Limoges Henry V rejected these offers declaring that if he did not get Normandy and all the districts ceded by the treaty of Bretigny he would have recourse to war to recover a crown which belonged to him To this arrogant language the Archbishop of Bourges replied O king what canst thou be thinking of that thou wouldst fain thus oust the King of the French our lord the most noble and excellent of Christian kings from the throne of so powerful a kingdom Thinkest thou that it is for fear of thee and of the English that he hath made thee an offer of his daughter together with so great a sum and a portion of his land Nay verily he was moved by pity and the love of peace he would not that the innocent blood should be spilt and Christian people destroyed in the hurly burly of battle He will invoke the aid of God Almighty of the blessed virgin Mary and of all the saints Then by his own arms and those of his loyal subjects vassals and allies thou wilt be driven from his kingdom and peradventure meet with death or capture On returning to Paris the ambassadors in presence of the king s council and a numerous assembly of clergy nobility and people gave an account of their embassy and advised instant preparation for war without listening to a single word of peace They loudly declared says the monk of saint Denis that King Henry s letters though they were apparently full of moderation had lurking at the bottom of them a great deal of perfidy and that this king all the time that he was offering peace and union in the most honeyed terms was thinking only how he might destroy the kingdom and was levying troops in all quarters Henry V indeed in November fourteen fourteen demanded of his Parliament a large subsidy which was at once voted without any precise mention of the use to be made of it and merely in the terms following For the defence of the realm of England and the security of the seas At the commencement of the following year Henry resumed negotiations with France renouncing his claims to Normandy Anjou and Maine but Charles VI and his council adhered to their former offers On the sixteenth of April fourteen fifteen Henry announced to a grand council of spiritual and temporal peers assembled at Westminster his determination of setting out in person to go and by God s grace recover his heritage He appointed one of his brothers the Duke of Bedford to be regent in his absence and the peers ecclesiastical and laical applauded his design promising him their sincere company operation Thus France under a poor mad king and amidst civil dissensions of the most obstinate character found the question renewed for her of French versus English king ship and national independence versus foreign conquest On the fourteenth of August fourteen fifteen an English fleet having on board together with King Henry V six thousand men at arms twenty four thousand archers powerful war machines and a multitude of artisans and small folk came to land near Harfleur not far from the mouth of the Seine It was the most formidable expedition that had ever issued from the ports of England The English spent several days in effecting their landing and setting up their siege train around the walls of the city It would have been easy says the monk of saint Denis to hinder their operations and the inhabitants of the town and neighborhood would have worked thereat with zeal if they had not counted that the nobility of the district and the royal army commanded by the constable Charles d Albret would come to their aid No one came The burgesses and the small garrison of Harfleur made a gallant defence but on the twenty twod of September not receiving from Vernon where the king and the dauphin were massing their troops any other assistance than the advice to take courage and trust to the king s discretion they capitulated and Henry V after taking possession of the place advanced into the country with an army already much reduced by sickness looking for a favorable point at which to cross the Somme and push his invasion still farther It was not until the nineteenth of October that he succeeded at Bethencourt near saint Quentin Charles VI who at that time had a lucid interval after holding at Rouen a council of war at which it was resolved to give the English battle wished to repair with the dauphin his son to Bapaume where the French army had taken position but his uncle the Duke of Berry having still quite a lively recollection of the battle of Poitiers fought fifty nine years before made opposition saying Better lose the battle than the king and the battle All the princes of the royal blood and all the flower of the French nobility except the king and his three sons and the Dukes of Berry Brittany and Burgundy joined the army The Dukes of Orleans and Bourbon and the Constable d Albret who was in command sent to ask the King of England on what day and at what place he would be pleased to give them battle I do not shut myself up in walled towns replied Henry I shall be found at any time and any where ready to fight if any attempt be made to cut off my march The French resolved to stop him between Agincourt and Framecourt a little north of saint Paul and Hesdin The encounter took place on the twenty fifth of October fourteen fifteen It was a monotonous and lamentable repetition of the disasters of Crecy and Poitiers disasters almost inevitable owing to the incapacity of the leaders and ever the same defects on the part of the French nobility defects which rendered their valorous and generous qualities not only fruitless but fatal Never had that nobility been more numerous and more brilliant than in this premeditated struggle On the eve of the battle Marshal de Boucicaut had armed five hundred new knights the greater part passed the night on horse back under arms on ground soaked with rain and men and horses were already distressed in the morning when the battle began It were tedious to describe the faulty manoeuvres of the French army and their deplorable consequences on that day Never was battle more stubborn or defeat more complete and bloody Eight thousand men of family amongst whom were a hundred and twenty lords bearing their own banners were left on the field of battle The Duke of Brabant the Count of Nevers the Duke of Bar the Duke of Alencon and the Constable d Albret were killed The Duke of Orleans was dragged out wounded from under the dead When Henry V after having spent several hours on the field of battle retired to his quarters he was told that the Duke of Orleans would neither eat nor drink He went to see him What fare cousin said he Good my lord Why will you not eat or drink I wish to fast Cousin said the king gently make good cheer if God has granted me grace to gain the victory I know it is not owing to my deserts I believe that God wished to punish the French and if all I have heard is true it is no wonder for they say that never were seen disorder licentiousness sins and vices like what is going on in France just now Surely God did well to be angry It appears that the King of England s feeling was that also of many amongst the people of France On reflecting upon this cruel mishap says the monk of saint Denis all the inhabitants of the kingdom men and women said In what evil days are we come into this world that we should be witnesses of such confusion and shame During the battle the eldest son of Duke John the Fearless the young Count of Charolais at that time nineteen who was afterwards Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy was at the castle of Aire where his governors kept him by his father s orders and prevented him from joining the king s army His servants were leaving him one after another to go and defend the kingdom against the English Illustration Already distressed fifty seven When he heard of the disaster at Agincourt he was seized with profound despair at having failed in that patriotic duty he would fain have starved himself to death and he spent three whole days in tears none being able to comfort him When four years afterwards he became Duke of Burgundy and during his whole life he continued to testify his keen regret at not having fought in that cruel battle though it should have cost him his life and he often talked with his servants about that event of grievous memory When his father Duke John received the news of the disaster at Agincourt he also exhibited great sorrow and irritation he had lost by it his two brothers the Duke of Brabant and the Count of Nevers and he sent forthwith a herald to the King of England who was still at Calais with orders to say that in consequence of the death of his brother the Duke of Brabant who was no vassal of France and held nothing in fief there he the Duke of Burgundy did defy him mortally fire and sword and sent him his gauntlet I will not accept the gauntlet of so noble and puissant a prince as the Duke of Burgundy was Henry V s soft answer I am of no account compared with him If I have had the victory over the nobles of France it is by God s grace The death of the Duke of Brabant hath been an affliction to me but I do assure thee that neither I nor my people did cause his death Take back to thy master his gauntlet if he will be at Boulogne on the fifteenth of January next I will prove to him by the testimony of my prisoners and two of my friends that it was the French who accomplished his brother s destruction The Duke of Burgundy as a matter of course let his quarrel with the King of England drop and occupied himself for the future only in recovering his power in France He set out on the march for Paris proclaiming everywhere that he was assembling his army solely for the purpose of avenging the kingdom chastising the English and aiding the king with his counsels and his forces The sentiment of nationality was so strongly aroused that politicians most anxious about their own personal interests and about them alone found themselves obliged to pay homage to it Unfortunately it was so far as Duke John was concerned only a superficial and transitory homage There is no repentance so rarely seen as that of selfishness in pride and power The four years which elapsed between the battle of Agincourt and the death of John the Fearless were filled with nothing but fresh and still more tragic explosions of hatred and strife between the two factions of the Burgundians and Armagnacs taking and losing re taking and re losing alternately their ascendency with the king and in the government of France When after the battle of Agincourt the Duke of Burgundy marched towards Paris he heard almost simultaneously that the king was issuing a prohibition against the entry of his troops and that his rival the Count of Armagnac had just arrived and been put in possession of the military power as constable and of the civil power as superintendent general of finance The duke then returned to Burgundy and lost no time in recommencing hostilities against the king s government At one time he let his troops make war on the king s and pillage the domains of the crown at another he entered into negotiations with the King of England and showed a disposition to admit his claims to such and such a province and even perhaps to the throne of France He did not accede to the positive alliance offered him by Henry but he employed the fear entertained of it by the king s government as a weapon against his enemies The Count of Armagnac on his side made the most relentless use of power against the Duke of Burgundy and his partisans he pursued them everywhere especially in Paris with dexterous and pitiless hatred He abolished the whole organization and the privileges of the Parisian butcherdom which had shown so favorable a leaning towards Duke John and the system he established as a substitute was founded on excellent grounds appertaining to the interests of the people and of good order in the heart of Paris but the violence of absolute power and of hatred robs the best measures of the credit they would deserve if they were more disinterested and dispassionate A lively reaction set in at Paris in favor of the persecuted Burgundians even outside of Paris several towns of importance Rheims Chalons Troyes Auxerre Amiens and Rouen itself showed a favorable disposition towards the Duke of Burgundy and made a sort of alliance with him promising to aid him in reinstating the king in his freedom and lordship and the realm in its freedom and just rights The Count of Armagnac was no more tender with the court than with the populace of Paris He suspected not without reason that the queen Isabel of Bavaria was in secret communication with and gave information to Duke John Moreover she was leading a scandalously licentious life at Vincennes and one of her favorites Louis de Bosredon a nobleman of Auvergne and her steward meeting the king one day on the road greeted the king cavalierly and hastily went his way Charles VI was plainly offended The Count of Armagnac seized the opportunity and not only did he foment the king s ill humor but talked to him of all the irregularities of which the queen was the centre and in which Louis de Bosredon was he said at that time her principal accomplice Charles in spite of the cloud upon his mind could hardly have been completely ignorant cf such facts but it is not necessary to be a king to experience extreme displeasure on learning that offensive scandals are almost public and on hearing the whole tale of them The king carried away by his anger went straight to Vincennes had a violent scene with his wife and caused Bosredon to be arrested imprisoned and put to the question and he on his own confession it is said was thrown into the Seine sewn up in a leathern sack on which were inscribed the words Let the king s justice run its course Charles VI and Armagnac did not stop there Queen Isabel was first of all removed from the council and stripped of all authority and then banished to Tours where commissioners were appointed to watch over her conduct and not to let her even write a letter without their seeing it But royal personages can easily elude such strictness A few months after her banishment whilst the despotism of Armagnac and the war between the king and the Duke of Burgundy were still going on Queen Isabel managed to send to the duke through one of her servants her golden seal which John the Fearless well knew with a message to the effect that she would go with him if he would come to fetch her On the night of November one fourteen seventeen the Duke of Burgundy hurriedly raised the siege of Corbeil advanced with a body of troops to a position within two leagues from Tours and sent the queen notice that he was awaiting her Isabel ordered her three custodians to go with her to mass at the Convent of Marmoutier outside the city Scarcely was she within the church when a Burgundian captain Hector de Saveuse presented himself with sixty men at the door Look to your safety madame said her custodians to Isabel here is a large company of Burgundians or English Keep close to me replied the queen Hector de Saveuse at that moment entered and saluted the queen on behalf of the Duke of Burgundy Where is he asked the queen He will not be long coming Isabel ordered the captain to arrest her three custodians and two hours afterwards Duke John arrived with his men at arms My dearest cousin said the queen to him I ought to love you above every man in the realm you have left all at my bidding and are come to deliver me from prison Be assured that I will never fail you I quite see that you have always been devoted to my lord his family the realm and the common weal The duke carried the queen off to Chartres and as soon as she was settled there on the twelfth of November fourteen seventeen she wrote to the good towns of the kingdom We Isabel by the grace of God Queen of France having by reason of my lord the king s seclusion the government and administration of this realm by irrevocable grant made to us by the said my lord the king and his council are come to Chartres in company with our cousin the Duke of Burgundy in order to advise and ordain whatsoever is necessary to preserve and recover the supremacy of my lord the king on advice taken of the prud hommes vassals and subjects She at the same time ordered that Master Philip de Morvilliers heretofore councillor of the Duke of Burgundy should go to Amiens accompanied by several clerics of note and by a registrar and that there should be held there by the queen s authority for the bailiwicks of Amiens Vermandois Tournai and the countship of Ponthieu a sovereign court of justice in the place of that which there was at Paris Thus and by such a series of acts of violence and of falsehoods the Duke of Burgundy all the while making war on the king surrounded himself with hollow forms of royal and legal government Whilst civil war was thus penetrating to the very core of the kingship foreign war was making its way again into the kingdom Henry V after the battle of Agincourt had returned to London and had left his army to repose and reorganize after its sufferings and its losses It was not until eighteen months afterwards on the first of August fourteen seventeen that he landed at Touques not far from Honfleur with fresh troops and resumed his campaign in France Between fourteen seventeen and fourteen nineteen he successively laid siege to nearly all the towns of importance in Normandy to Caen Bayeux Falaise Evreux Coutances Laigle saint Lo Cherbourg c c Some he occupied after a short resistance others were sold to him by their governors but when in the month of July fourteen eighteen he undertook the siege of Rouen he encountered there a long and serious struggle Rouen had at that time it is said a population of one hundred and fifty thousand souls which was animated by ardent patriotism The Rouennese on the approach of the English had repaired their gates their ramparts and their moats had demanded re enforcements from the King of France and the Duke of Burgundy and had ordered every person incapable of bearing arms or procuring provisions for ten months to leave the city Twelve thousand old men women and children were thus expelled and died either round the place or whilst roving in misery over the neighboring country poor women gave birth unassisted beneath the walls and good compassionate people in the town drew up the new born in baskets to have them baptized and afterwards lowered them down to their mothers to die together Fifteen thousand men of city militia four thousand regular soldiers three hundred spearmen and as many archers from Paris and it is not quite known how many men at arms sent by the Duke of Burgundy defended Rouen for more than five months amidst all the usual sufferings of strictly besieged cities As early as the beginning of October says Monstrelet they were forced to eat horses dogs cats and other things not fit for human beings but they nevertheless made frequent sorties rushing furiously upon the enemy to whom they caused many a heavy loss Four gentlemen and four burgesses succeeded in escaping and going to Beauvais to tell the king and his council about the deplorable condition of their city The council replied that the king was not in a condition to raise the siege but that Rouen would be relieved within on the fourth day after Christmas It was now the middle of December The Rouennese resigned themselves to waiting a fortnight longer but when that period was over they found nothing arrive but a message from the Duke of Burgundy recommending them to treat for their preservation with the King of England as best they could They asked to capitulate Henry V demanded that all the men of the town should place themselves at his disposal When the commonalty of Rouen heard this answer they all cried out that it were better to die all together sword in hand against their enemies than place themselves at the disposal of yonder king and they were for shoring up with planks a loosened layer of the wall inside the city and having armed themselves and joined all of them together men women and children for setting fire to the city throwing down the said layer of wall into the moats and getting them gone by night whither it might please God to direct them Henry V was unwilling to confront such heroic despair and on the thirteenth of January fourteen nineteen he granted the Rouennese a capitulation from which seven persons only were excepted Robert Delivet the archbishop s vicar general who from the top of the ramparts had excommunicated the foreign conqueror D Houdetot baillie of the city John Segneult the mayor Alan Blanchard the captain of the militia crossbowmen and three other burgesses The last named the hero of the siege was the only one who paid for his heroism with his life the baillie the mayor and the vicar bought themselves off On the nineteenth of January at midday the English king and army made their solemn entry into the city It was two hundred and fifteen years since Philip Augustus had won Rouen by conquest from John Lackland King of England and happily his successors were not to be condemned to deplore the loss of it very long These successes of the King of England were so many reverses and perils for the Count of Armagnac He had in his hands Paris the king and the dauphin in the people s eyes the responsibility of government and of events rested on his shoulders and at one time he was doing nothing at another he was unsuccessful in what he did Whilst Henry V was becoming master of nearly all the towns of Normandy the constable with the king in his army was besieging Senlis and he was obliged to raise the siege The legates of Pope Martin V had set about establishing peace between the Burgundians and Armagnacs as well as between France and England they had prepared on the basis of the treaty of Arras a new treaty with which a great part of the country and even of the burgesses of Paris showed themselves well pleased but the constable had it rejected on the ground of its being adverse to the interests of the king and of France and his friend the chancellor Henry de Marle declared that if the king were disposed to sign it he would have to seal it himself for that as for him the chancellor he certainly would not seal it Bernard of Armagnac and his confidential friend Tanneguy Duchatel a Breton nobleman provost of Paris were hard and haughty When a complaint was made to them of any violent procedure they would answer What business had you there If it were the Burgundians you would make no complaint The Parisian population was becoming every day more Burgundian In the latter days of May fourteen eighteen a plot was contrived for opening to the Burgundians one of the gates of Paris Perrinet Leclerc son of a rich iron merchant having influence in the quarter of saint Germain des Pros stole the keys from under the bolster of his father s bed a troop of Burgundian men at arms came in and they were immediately joined by a troop of Parisians They spread over the city shouting Our Lady of peace Hurrah for the king Hurrah for Burgundy Let all who wish for peace take arms and follow us The people swarmed from the houses and followed them accordingly The Armagnacs were surprised and seized with alarm Tanneguy Duchatel a man of prompt and resolute spirit ran to the dauphin s wrapped him in his bed clothes and carried him off to the Bastille where he shut him up with several of his partisans The Count of Armagnac towards whose house the multitude thronged left by a back door and took refuge at a mason s where he believed himself secure In a few hours the Burgundians were masters of Paris Their chief the lord of Isle Adam had the doors of the hostel of saint Paul broken in and presented himself before the king How fares my cousin of Burgundy said Charles VI I have not seen him for some time That was all he said He was set on horseback and marched through the streets He showed no astonishment at anything he had all but lost memory as well as reason and no longer knew the difference between Armagnac and Burgundian A devoted Burgundian Sire Guy de Bar was named provost of Paris in the place of Tanneguy Duchatel The mason with whom Bernard of Armagnac had taken refuge went and told the new provost that the constable was concealed at his house Thither the provost hurried made the constable mount behind him and carried him off to prison at the Chatelet at the same time making honorable exertions to prevent massacre and plunder But factions do not so soon give up either their vengeance or their hopes On the eleventh of June fourteen eighteen hardly twelve days after Paris had fallen into the hands of the Burgundians a body of sixteen hundred men issued from the Bastille and rushed into the street saint Antoine shouting Hurrah for the king the dauphin and the Count of Armagnac They were Tanneguy Duchatel and some of the chiefs of the Armagnacs who were attempting to regain Paris where they had observed that the Burgundians were not numerous Their attempt had no success and merely gave the Burgundians the opportunity and the signal for a massacre of their enemies The little band of Tanneguy Duchatel was instantly repulsed hemmed in and forced to re enter the Bastille with a loss of four hundred men Tanneguy saw that he could make no defence there so he hastily made his way out taking the dauphin with him to Melun The massacre of the Armagnacs had already commenced on the previous evening they were harried in the hostelries and houses they were cut down with axes in the streets On the night between the twelfth and thirteenth of June a rumor spread about that there were bands of Armagnacs coming to deliver their friends in prison They are at the saint Germain gate said some No it is the saint Marceau gate said others The mob assembled and made a furious rush upon the prison gates The city and burgesses will have no peace was the general saying so long as there is one Armagnac left Hurrah for peace Hurrah for the Duke of Burgundy The provost of Paris the lord of Isle Adam and the principal Burgundian chieftains galloped up with a thousand horse and strove to pacify these madmen numbering it is said some forty thousand They were received with a stout of A plague of your justice and pity Accursed be he whosoever shall have pity on these traitors of Armagnacs They are English they are hounds They had already made banners for the King of England and would fain have planted them upon the gates of the city They made us work for nothing and when we asked for our due they said You rascals haven t ye a sou to buy a cord and go hang yourselves In the devil s name speak no more of it it will be no use whatever you say The provost of Paris durst not oppose such fury as this Do what you please said he The mob ran to look for the constable Armagnac and the chancellor de Marle in the Palace tower in which they had been shut up and they were at once torn to pieces amidst ferocious rejoicings All the prisons were ransacked and emptied the prisoners who attempted resistance were smoked out they were hurled down from the windows upon pikes held up to catch them The massacre lasted from four o clock in the morning to eleven The common report was that fifteen hundred persons had perished in it the account rendered to parliament made the number eight hundred The servants of the Duke of Burgundy mentioned to him no more than four hundred It was not before the fourteenth of July that he with Queen Isabel came back to the city and he came with a sincere design if not of punishing the cut throats at least of putting a stop to all massacre and pillage but there is nothing more difficult than to suppress the consequences of a mischief of which you dare not attack the cause One Bertrand head of one of the companies of butchers had been elected captain of saint Denis because he had saved the abbey from the rapacity of a noble Burgundian chieftain Hector de Saveuse The lord to avenge himself had the butcher assassinated The burgesses went to the duke to demand that the assassin should be punished and the duke who durst neither assent nor refuse could only partially cloak his weakness by imputing the crime to some disorderly youngsters whom he enabled to get away On the twentieth of August an angry mob collected in front of the Chatelet shouting out that nobody would bring the Armagnacs to justice and that they were every day being set at liberty on payment of money The great and little Chatelet were stormed and the prisoners massacred The mob would have liked to serve the Bastille the same but the duke told the rioters that he would give the prisoners up to them if they would engage to conduct them to the Chatelet without doing them any harm and to win them over he grasped the hand of their head man who was no other than Capeluche the city executioner Scarcely had they arrived at the court yard of the little Chatelet when the prisoners were massacred there without any regard for the promise made to the duke He sent for the most distinguished burgesses and consulted them as to what could be done to check such excesses but they confined themselves to joining him in deploring them He sent for the savages once more and said to them You would do far better to go and lay siege to Montlhery to drive off the king s enemies who have come ravaging everything up to the saint Jacques gate and preventing the harvest from being got in Readily they answered only give us leaders He gave them leaders who led six thousand of them to Montlhery As soon as they were gone Duke John had Capeluche and two of his chief accomplices brought to trial and Capeluche was beheaded in the market place by his own apprentice But the gentry sent to the siege of Montlhery did not take the place they accused their leaders of having betrayed them and returned to be a scourge to the neighborhood of Paris everywhere saying that the Duke of Burgundy was the most irresolute man in the kingdom and that if there were no nobles the war would be ended in a couple of months Duke John set about negotiating with the dauphin and getting him back to Paris The dauphin replied that he was quite ready to obey and serve his mother as a good son should but that it would be more than he could stomach to go back to a city where so many crimes and so much tyranny had but lately been practised Terms of reconciliation were drawn up and signed on the sixteenth of September fourteen eighteen at saint Maur by the queen the Duke of Burgundy and the pope s legates but the dauphin refused to ratify them The unpunished and long continued massacres in Paris had redoubled his distrust towards the Duke of Burgundy he had moreover just assumed the title of regent of the kingdom and he had established at Poitiers a parliament of which Juvenal des Ursins was a member He had promised the young Count of Armagnac to exact justice for his father s cruel death and the old friends of the house of Orleans remained faithful to their enmities The Duke of Burgundy had at one time to fight and at another to negotiate with the dauphin and the King of England both at once and always without success The dauphin and his council though showing a little more discretion were going on in the same alternative and unsatisfactory condition Clearly neither France and England nor the factions in France had yet exhausted their passions or their powers and the day of summary vengeance was nearer than that of real reconciliation Nevertheless complicated disturbed and persistently resultless situations always end by becoming irksome to those who are entangled in them and by inspiring a desire for extrication The King of England in spite of his successes and his pride determined upon sending the Earl of Warwick to Provins where the king and the Duke of Burgundy still were a truce was concluded between the English and the Burgundians and it was arranged that on the thirtieth of May fourteen nineteen the two kings should meet between Mantes and Melun and hold a conference for the purpose of trying to arrive at a peace A few days before the time Duke John set out from Provins with the king Queen Isabel and Princess Catherine and repaired first of all to Pontoise and then to the place fixed for the interview on the borders of the Seine near Meulan where two pavilions had been prepared one for the King of France and the other for the King of England Charles VI being ill remained at Pontoise Queen Isabel Princess Catherine and the Duke of Burgundy arrived at the appointed spot Henry V was already there he went to meet the queen saluted her took her hand and embraced her and Madame Catherine as well Duke John slightly bent his knee to the king who raised him up and embraced him likewise This solemn interview was succeeded by several others to which Princess Catherine did not come The queen requested the King of England to state exactly what he proposed and he demanded the execution of the treaty of Bretigny the cession of Normandy and the absolute sovereignty without any bond of vassalage of whatever should be ceded by the treaty A short discussion ensued upon some secondary questions There appeared to be no distant probability of an understanding The English believed that they saw an inclination on the Duke of Burgundy s part not to hasten to a conclusion and to obtain better conditions from King Henry by making him apprehensive of a reconciliation with the dauphin Henry proposed to him for the purpose of ending everything a conference between themselves alone and it took place on the threed of June Cousin said the king to the duke we wish you to know that we will have your king s daughter and all that we have demanded with her else we will thrust him out of his kingdom and you too Sir answered the duke you speak according to your pleasure but before thrusting my lord and myself from the kingdom you will have what will tire you we make no doubt and you will have enough to do to keep yourself in your own island Between two princes so proud there was little probability of an understanding and they parted with no other result than mutual displeasure Some days before on the fourteenth of May fourteen nineteen a truce of three months had been concluded between the dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy and was to lead to a conference also between these two princes It did not commence before the eighth of July During this interval Duke John had submitted for the mature deliberation of his council the question whether it were better to grant the English demands or become reconciled to the dauphin Amongst his official councillors opinions were divided but in his privacy the lady of Giac whom he loved and trusted mightily and Philip Jossequin who had at first been his chamber attendant and afterwards custodian of his jewels and of his privy seal strongly urged him to make peace with the dauphin and the pope s fresh legate the Bishop of Laon added his exhortations to these home influences There had been fitted up at a league s distance from Melun on the embankment of the ponds of Vert a summer house of branches and leaves hung with drapery and silken stuffs and there the first interview between the two princes took place The dauphin left in displeasure he had found the Duke of Burgundy haughty and headstrong Already the old servants of the late Duke of Orleans impelled by their thirst for vengeance were saying out loud that the matter should be decided by arms when the lady of Giac went after the dauphin who from infancy had also been very much attached to her and she going backwards and forwards between the two princes was so affectionate and persuasive with both that she prevailed upon them to meet again and to sincerely wish for an understanding The next day but one they returned to the place of meeting attended each of them by a large body of men at arms They advanced towards one another with ten men only and dismounted The Duke of Burgundy went on bended knee The dauphin took him by the hand embraced him and would have raised him up No my lord said the duke I know how I ought to address you The dauphin assured him that he forgave every offence if indeed he had received any and added Cousin if in the proposed treaty between us there be aught which is not to your liking we desire that you amend it and henceforth we will desire all you shall desire make no doubt of it They conversed for some time with every appearance of cordiality and then the treaty was signed It was really a treaty of reconciliation in which without dwelling upon the suspicions and imaginings which have been engendered in the hearts of ourselves and many of our officers and have hindered us from acting with concord in the great matters of my lord the king and his kingdom and resisting the damnable attempts of his and our old enemies the two princes made mutual promises each in language suitable to their rank and connection to love one another support one another and serve one another mutually as good and loyal relatives and bade all their servants if they saw any hinderance thereto to give them notice thereof according to their bounden duty The treaty was signed by all the men of note belonging to the houses of both princes and the crowd which surrounded them shouted Noel and invoked curses on whosoever should be minded henceforth to take up arms again in this damnable quarrel When the dauphin went away the duke insisted upon holding his stirrup and they parted with every demonstration of amity The dauphin returned to Touraine and the duke to Pontoise to be near the king who by letters of July nineteen confirmed the treaty enjoined general forgetfulness of the past and ordained that all war should cease save against the English There was universal and sincere joy The peace fulfilled the requirements at the same time of the public welfare and of national feeling it was the only means of re establishing order at home and driving from the kingdom the foreigner who aspired to conquer it Only the friends of the Duke of Orleans and of the Count of Armagnac one assassinated twelve years before and the other massacred but lately remained sad and angry at not having yet been able to obtain either justice or vengeance but they maintained reserve and silence They were not long in once more finding for mistrust and murmuring grounds or pretexts which a portion of the public showed a disposition to take up The Duke of Burgundy had made haste to publish his ratification of the treaty of reconciliation the dauphin had let his wait The Parisians were astounded not to see either the dauphin or the Duke of Burgundy coming back within their walls and at being as it were forgotten and deserted amidst the universal making up They complained that no armed force was being collected to oppose the English and that there was an appearance of flying before them leaving open to them Paris in which at this time there was no captain of renown They were still more troubled when on the twenty ninth of July they saw the arrival at the saint Denis gate of a multitude of disconsolate fugitives some wounded and others dropping from hunger thirst and fatigue When they were asked who they were and what was the reason of their desperate condition We are from Pontoise they said the English took the town this morning they killed or wounded all before them happy he whosoever could escape from their hands never were Saracens so cruel to Christians as yonder folk are It was a real fact The King of England disquieted at the reconciliation between the Duke of Burgundy and the dauphin and at the ill success of his own proposals at the conference of the thirtieth of May preceding had vigorously resumed the war in order to give both the reunited French factions a taste of his resolution and power He had suddenly attacked and carried Pontoise where the command was in the hands of the lord of Isle Adam one of the most valiant Burgundian officers Isle Adam surprised and lacking sufficient force had made a feeble resistance There was no sign of an active union on the part of the two French factions for the purpose of giving the English battle Duke John who had fallen back upon Troyes sent order upon order for his vassals from Burgundy but they did not come up Public alarm and distrust were day by day becoming stronger Duke John it was said was still keeping up secret communications with the seditious in Paris and with the King of England why did he not act with more energy against this latter the common enemy The two princes in their conference of July nine near Melun had promised to meet again a fresh interview appeared necessary in order to give efficacy to their reconciliation Duke John was very pressing for the dauphin to go to Troyes where the king and queen happened to be The dauphin on his side was earnestly solicited by the most considerable burgesses of Paris to get this interview over in order to insure the execution of the treaty of peace which had been sworn to with the Duke of Burgundy The dauphin showed a disposition to listen to these entreaties He advanced as far as Montereau in order to be ready to meet Duke John as soon as a place of meeting should be fixed Duke John hesitated from irresolution even more than from distrust It was a serious matter for him to commit himself more and more by his own proper motion against the King of England and his old allies amongst the populace of Paris Why should he be required to go in person to seek the dauphin It was far simpler he said for Charles to come to the king his father Tanneguy Duchatel went to Troyes to tell the duke that the dauphin had come to meet him as far as Montereau and with the help of the lady of Giae persuaded on his side to Bray sur Seine two leagues from Montereau When the two princes had drawn thus near their agents proposed that the interview should take place on the very bridge of Montereau with the precautions and according to the forms decided on In the duke s household many of his most devoted servants were opposed to this interview the place they said had been chosen by and would be under the ordering of the dauphin s people of the old servants of the Duke of Orleans and the Count of Armagnac At the same time four successive messages came from Paris urging the duke to make the plunge and at last he took his resolution It is my duty said he to risk my person in order to get at so great a blessing as peace Whatever happens my wish is peace If they kill me I shall die a martyr Peace being made I will take the men of my lord the dauphin to go and fight the English He has some good men of war and some sagacious captains Tanneguy and Barbazan are valiant knights Then we shall see which is the better man Jack Hannotin of Flanders or Henry of Lancaster He set out for Bray on the tenth of September fourteen nineteen and arrived about two o clock before Montereau Tanneguy Duchatel came and met him there Well said the duke on your assurance we are come to see my lord the dauphin supposing that he is quite willing to keep the peace between himself and us as we also will keep it all ready to serve him according to his wishes My most dread lord answered Tanneguy have ye no fear my lord is well pleased with you and desires henceforth to govern himself according to your counsels You have about him good friends who serve you well It was agreed that the dauphin and the duke should each from his own side go upon the bridge of Montereau each with ten men at arms of whom they should previously forward a list The dauphin s people had caused to be constructed at the two ends of the bridge strong barriers closed by a gate about the centre of the bridge was a sort of lodge made of planks the entrance to which was on either side through a pretty narrow passage within the lodge there was no barrier in the middle to separate the two parties Whilst Duke John and his confidants in concert with the dauphin s people were regulating these material arrangements a chamber attendant ran in quite scared shouting out My lord look to yourself without a doubt you will be betrayed The duke turned towards Tanneguy and said We trust ourselves to your word in God s holy name are you quite sure of what you have told us For you would do ill to betray us My most dread lord answered Tanneguy I would rather be dead than commit treason against you or any other have ye no fear I certify you that my lord meaneth you no evil Very well we will go then trusting in God and you re joined the duke and he set out walking to the bridge On arriving at the barrier on the castle side he found there to receive him Sire de Beauveau and Tanneguy Duchatel Come to my lord said they he is awaiting you Gentlemen said the duke you see how I come and he showed them that he and his people had only their swords then clapping Tanneguy on the shoulder he said Here is he in whom I trust and advanced towards the dauphin who remained standing on the town side at the end of the lodge constructed in the middle of the bridge On arriving at the prince s presence Duke John took off his velvet cap and bent his knee to the ground My lord said he after God my duty is to obey and serve you I offer to apply thereto and employ therein my body my friends my allies and well wishers Say I well he added fixing his eyes on the dauphin Fair cousin answered the prince you say so well that none could say better rise and be covered Conversation thereupon ensued between the two princes The dauphin complained of the duke s delay in coming to see him For eighteen days he said you have made us await your coming in this place of Montereau this place a prey to epidemic and mortality at the risk of and probably with an eye to our personal danger The duke surprised and troubled resumed his haughty and exacting tone We can neither do nor advise aught said he save in your father s presence you must come thither I shall go when I think proper said Charles and not at your will and pleasure it is well known that whatever we do we two together the king will be content therewith Then he reproached the duke with his inertness against the English with the capture of Pontoise and with his alliances amongst the promoters of civil war The conversation was becoming more and more acrid and biting In so doing added the dauphin you were wanting to your duty My lord replied the duke I did only what it was my duty to do Yes you were wanting repeated Charles No replied the duke It was probably at these words that the lookers on also waxing wroth Tanneguy Duchatel told the duke that the time had come for expiating the murder of the Duke of Orleans which none of them had forgotten and raised his battle axe to strike the duke Sire de Navailles who happened to be at his master s side arrested the weapon but on the other hand the Viscount of Narbonne raised his over Navailles saying Whoever stirs is a dead man At this moment it is said the mob which was thronging before the barriers at the end of the bridge heard cries of Alarm slay slay Tanneguy had struck and felled the duke several others ran their swords into him and he expired The dauphin had withdrawn from the scene and gone back into the town After his departure his partisans forced the barrier charged the dumbfounded Burgundians sent them flying along the road to Bray and returning on to the bridge would have cast the body of Duke John after stripping it into the river but the minister of Montereau withstood them and had it carried to a mill near the bridge Next day he was put in a pauper s shell with nothing on but his shirt and drawers and was subsequently interred at the church of Notre Dame de Montereau without winding sheet and without pall over his grave Illustration Into the River seventy seven The enmities of the Orleannese and the Armagnacs had obtained satisfaction but they were transferred to the hearts of the Burgundians After twelve years of public crime and misfortune the murder of Louis of Orleans had been avenged and should not that of John of Burgundy be in its turn Wherever the direct power or the indirect influence of the Duke of Burgundy was predominant there was a burst of indignation and vindictive passion As soon as the Count of Charolais Philip afterwards called the Good heard at Ghent where he happened at that time to be of his father s murder he was proclaimed Duke of Burgundy Michelle said he to his wife sister of the dauphin Charles your brother has murdered my father The princess burst into tears but the new duke calmed her by saying that nothing could alter the love and confidence he felt towards her At Troyes Queen Isabel showed more anger than any one else against her son the dauphin and she got a letter written by King Charles VI to the dowager Duchess of Burgundy begging her her and her children to set in motion all their relatives friends and vassals to avenge Duke John At Paris on the twelfth of September the next day but one after the murder the chancellor the parliament the provost royal the provost of tradesmen and all the councillors and officers of the king assembled together with great number of nobles and burgesses and a great multitude of people who all swore to oppose with their bodies and all their might the enterprise of the criminal breakers of the peace and to prosecute the cause of vengeance and reparation against those who were guilty of the death and homicide of the late Duke of Burgundy Independently of party passion such was in Northern and Eastern France the general and spontaneous sentiment of the people The dauphin and his councillors in order to explain and justify their act wrote in all directions to say that during the interview Duke John had answered the dauphin with mad words He had felt for his sword in order to attack and outrage our person the which as we have since found out he aspired to place in subjection but through his own madness met death instead But these assertions found little credence and one of the two knights who were singled out by the dauphin to accompany him on to the bridge of Montereau Sire de Barbazan who had been a friend of the Duke of Orleans and of the Count of Armagnac said vehemently to the authors of the plot You have destroyed our master s honor and heritage and I would rather have died than be present at this day s work even though I had not been there to no purpose But it was not long before an event easy to foresee counterbalanced this general impression and restored credit and strength to the dauphin and his party Henry V King of England as soon as he heard about the murder of Duke John set himself to work to derive from it all the advantages he anticipated A great loss said he is the Duke of Burgundy he was a good and true knight and an honorable prince but through his death we are by God s help at the summit of our wishes We shall thus in spite of all Frenchmen possess Dame Catherine whom we have so much desired As early as the twenty fourth of September fourteen nineteen Henry V gave full powers to certain of his people to treat with the illustrious city of Paris and the other towns in adherence to the said city On the seventeenth of October was opened at Arras a congress between the plenipotentiaries of England and those of Burgundy On the twentieth of November a special truce was granted to the Parisians whilst Henry V in concert with Duke Philip of Burgundy was prosecuting the war against the dauphin On the twod of December the bases were laid of an agreement between the English and the Burgundians The preliminaries of the treaty which was drawn up in accordance with these bases were signed on the ninth of April fourteen twenty by King Charles VI and on the twentieth communicated at Paris by the chancellor of France to the parliament and to all the religious and civil royal and municipal authorities of the capital After this communication the chancellor and the premier president of parliament went with these preliminaries to Henry V at Pontoise where he set out with a division of his army for Troyes where the treaty definitive and complete was at last signed and promulgated in the cathedral of Troyes on the twenty first of May fourteen twenty Of the twenty eight articles in this treaty five contained its essential points and fixed its character first The King of France Charles VI gave his daughter Catherine in marriage to Henry V King of England twod Our son King Henry shall place no hinderance or trouble in the way of our holding and possessing as long as we live and as at the present time the crown the kingly dignity of France and all the revenues proceeds and profits which are attached thereto for the maintenance of our state and the charges of the kingdom threed It is agreed that immediately after our death and from that time forward the crown and kingdom of France with all their rights and appurtenances shall belong perpetually and shall be continued to our son King Henry and his heirs fourth Whereas we are at most times prevented from advising by ourselves and from taking part in the disposal of the affairs of our kingdom the power and the practice of governing and ordering the commonweal shall belong and shall be continued during our life to our son King Henry with the counsel of the nobles and sages of the kingdom who shall obey us and shall desire the honor and advantage of the said kingdom fifth Our son King Henry shall strive with all his might and as soon as possible to bring back to their obedience to us all and each of the towns cities castles places districts and persons in our kingdom that belong to the party commonly called of the dauphin or Armagnac This substitution in the near future of an English for the French kingship this relinquishment in the present of the government of France to the hands of an English prince nominated to become before long her king this authority given to the English prince to prosecute in France against the dauphin of France a civil war this complete abdication of all the rights and duties of the kingship of paternity and of national independence and to sum up all in one word this anti French state stroke accomplished by a king of France with the company operation of him who was the greatest amongst French lords to the advantage of a foreign sovereign there was surely in this enough to excite the most ardent and most legitimate national feelings They did not show themselves promptly or with a blaze The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries after so many military and civil troubles had great weaknesses and deep seated corruption in mind and character Nevertheless the revulsion against the treaty of Troyes was real and serious even in the very heart of the party attached to the Duke of Burgundy He was obliged to lay upon several of his servants formal injunctions to swear to this peace which seemed to them treason He had great difficulty in winning John of Luxembourg and his brother Louis Bishop of Therouenne over to it It is your will said they we will take this oath but if we do we will keep it to the hour of death Many less powerful lords who had lived a long while in the household of Duke John the Fearless quitted his son and sorrowfully returned to their own homes They were treated as Armagnacs but they persisted in calling themselves good and loyal Frenchmen In the duchy of Burgundy the majority of the towns refused to take the oath to the King of England The most decisive and the most helpful proof of this awakening of national feeling was the ease experienced by the dauphin who was one day to be Charles VII in maintaining the war which after the treaty of Troyes was in his father s and his mother s name made upon him by the King of England and the Duke of Burgundy This war lasted more than three years Several towns amongst others Melun Crotoy Meaux and saint Riquier offered an obstinate resistance to the attacks of the English and Burgundians On the twenty threed of March fourteen twenty one the dauphin s troops commanded by Sire de la Fayette gained a signal victory over those of Henry V whose brother the Duke of Clarence was killed in action It was in Perche Anjou Maine on the banks of the Loire and in Southern France that the dauphin found most of his enterprising and devoted partisans The sojourn made by Henry V at Paris in December fourteen twenty with his wife Queen Catherine King Charles VI Queen Isabel and the Duke of Burgundy was not in spite of galas and acclamations a substantial and durable success for him His dignified but haughty manners did not please the French and he either could not or would not render them more easy and amiable even with men of note who were necessary to him Marshal Isle Adam one day went to see him in camp on war business The king considered that he did not present himself with sufficient ceremony Isle Adam said he is that the robe of a marshal of France Sir I had this whity gray robe made to come hither by water aboard of Seine boats Ha said the king look you a prince in the face when you speak to him Sir it is the custom in France that when one man speaks to another of whatever rank and puissance that other may be he passes for a sorry fellow and but little honorable if he dares not look him in the face It is not our fashion said the king and the subject dropped there A popular poet of the time Alan Chattier constituted himself censor of the moral corruption and interpreter of the patriotic paroxysms caused by the cold and harsh supremacy of this unbending foreigner who set himself up for king of France and had not one feeling in sympathy with the French Alan Chartier s Quadriloge invectif is a lively and sometimes eloquent allegory in which France personified implores her three children the clergy the chivalry and the people to forget their own quarrels and unite to save their mother whilst saving themselves and this political pamphlet getting spread about amongst the provinces did good service to the national cause against the foreign conqueror An event more powerful than any human eloquence occurred to give the dauphin and his partisans earlier hopes Towards the end of August fourteen twenty two Henry V fell ill and too stout hearted to delude himself as to his condition he thought no longer of anything but preparing himself for death He had himself removed to Vincennes called his councillors about him and gave them his last royal instructions I leave you the government of France said he to his brother the Duke of Bedford unless our brother of Burgundy have a mind to undertake it for above all things I conjure you not to have any dissension with him If that should happen God preserve you from it the affairs of this kingdom which seem well advanced for us would become bad As soon as he had done with politics he bade his doctors tell him how long he had still to live One of them knelt down before his bed and said Sir be thinking of your soul it seemeth to us that saving the divine mercy you have not more than two hours The king summoned his confessor with the priests and asked to have recited to him the penitential psalms When they came to the twentieth versicle of the Miserere Ut oedificentur muri Hierusalem that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up He made them stop Ah said he if God had been pleased to let me live out my time I would after putting an end to the war in France reducing the dauphin to submission or driving him out of the kingdom in which I would have established a sound peace have gone to conquer Jerusalem The wars I have undertaken have had the approval of all the proper men and of the most holy personages I commenced them and have prosecuted them without offence to God or peril to my soul These were his last words The chanting of the psalms was resumed around him and he expired on the thirty first of August fourteen twenty two at the age of thirty four A great soul and a great king but a great example also of the boundless errors which may be fallen into by the greatest men when they pursue with arrogant confidence their own views forgetting the laws of justice and the rights of other men On the twenty twod of October fourteen twenty two less than two months after the death of Henry V Charles VI King of France died at Paris in the forty third year of his reign As soon as he had been buried at saint Denis the Duke of Bedford regent of France according to the will of Henry V caused a herald to proclaim Long live Henry of Lancaster King of England and of France The people s voice made very different proclamation It had always been said that the public evils proceeded from the state of illness into which the unhappy King Charles had fallen The goodness he had given glimpses of in his lucid intervals had made him an object of tender pity Some weeks yet before his death when he had entered Paris again the inhabitants in the midst of their sufferings and under the harsh government of the English had seen with joy their poor mad king coming back amongst them and had greeted him with thousand fold shouts of Noel His body lay in state for three days with the face uncovered in a hall of the hostel of saint Paul and the multitude went thither to pray for him saying Ah dear prince never shall we have any so good as thou Wert never shall we see thee more Accursed be thy death Since thou dost leave us we shall never have aught but wars and troubles As for thee thou goest to thy rest as for us we remain in tribulation and sorrow We seem made to fall into the same distress as the children of Israel during the captivity in Babylon Illustration The Body of Charles VI lying in State eighty four The people s instinct was at the same time right and wrong France had yet many evil days to go through and cruel trials to endure she was however to be saved at last Charles VI was to be followed by Charles VII and Joan of Arc CHAPTER XXIV THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR CHARLES VII AND JOAN OF ARC fourteen twenty two fourteen sixty one Illustration PORTRAIT OF JOAN OF ARC eighty five Whilst Charles VI was dying at Paris his son Charles the dauphin was on his way back from Saintonge to Berry where he usually resided On the twenty fourth of October fourteen twenty two at Mehun sur Yevre he heard of his father s death For six days longer from the twenty fourth to the twenty ninth of October he took no style but that of regent as if he were waiting to see what was going to happen elsewhere in respect of the succession to the throne It was only when he knew that on the twenty seventh of October the parliament of Paris had not without some little hesitation and ambiguity recognized as King of England and of France Henry VI son of Henry V lately deceased that the dauphin Charles assumed on the thirtieth of October in his castle of Mehun sur Yevre the title of king and repaired to Bourges to inaugurate in the cathedral of that city his reign as Charles VII Illustration The Shepherdess of Domremy ninety He was twenty years old and had as yet done nothing to gain for himself not to say anything of glory the confidence and hopes of the people He passed for an indolent and frivolous prince abandoned to his pleasures only one whose capacity there was nothing to foreshadow and of whom France outside of his own court scarcely ever thought at all Some days before his accession he had all but lost his life at Rochelle by the sudden breaking down of the room in the episcopal palace where he was staying and so little did the country know of what happened to him that a short time after the accident messengers sent by some of his partisans had arrived at Bourges to inquire if the prince were still living At a time when not only the crown of the kingdom but the existence and independence of the nation were at stake Charles had not given any signs of being strongly moved by patriotic feelings He was in person a handsome prince and handsome in speech with all persons and compassionate towards poor folks says his contemporary Monstrelet but he did not readily put on his harness and he had no heart for war if he could do without it On ascending the throne this young prince so little of the politician and so little of the knight encountered at the head of his enemies the most able amongst the politicians and warriors of the day in the Duke of Bedford whom his brother Henry V had appointed regent of France and had charged to defend on behalf of his nephew Henry VI a child in the cradle the crown of France already more than half won Never did struggle appear more unequal or native king more inferior to foreign pretender Sagacious observers however would have easily discerned in the cause which appeared the stronger and the better supported many seeds of weakness and danger When Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy heard at Arras that Charles VI was dead it occurred to him immediately that if he attended the obsequies of the English King of France he would be obliged French prince as he was and cousin german of Charles VI to yield precedence to John Duke of Bedford regent of France and uncle of the new king Henry VI He resolved to hold aloof and contented himself with sending to Paris chamberlains to make his excuses and supply his place with the regent On the eleventh of November fourteen twenty two the Duke of Bedford followed alone at the funeral of the late king of France and alone made offering at the mass Alone he went but with the sword of state borne before him as regent The people of Paris cast down their eyes with restrained wrath They wept says a contemporary and not without cause for they knew not whether for a long long while they would have any king in France But they did not for long confine themselves to tears Two poets partly in Latin and partly in French Robert Blondel and Alan Chartier whilst deploring the public woes excited the popular feeling Conspiracies soon followed the songs One was set on foot at Paris to deliver the city to king Charles VII but it was stifled ruthlessly several burgesses were beheaded and one woman was burned In several great provincial cities at Troyes and at Rheims the same ferment showed itself and drew down the same severity William Prieuse superior of the Carmelites was accused of propagating sentiments favorable to the dauphin as the English called Charles VII Being brought in spite of the privileges of his gown before John Cauchon lieutenant of the captain of Rheims related probably to Peter Cauchon Bishop of Beauvais who nine years afterwards was to sentence Joan of Arc to be burned he stoutly replied Never was English king of France and never shall be The country had no mind to believe in the conquest it was undergoing and the Duke of Burgundy the most puissant ally of the English sulkily went on eluding the consequences of the anti national alliance he had accepted Such being the disposition of conquerors and conquered the war though still carried on with great spirit could not and in fact did not bring about any decisive result from fourteen twenty two to fourteen twenty nine Towns were alternately taken lost and retaken at one time by the French at another by the English or Burgundians petty encounters and even important engagements took place with vicissitudes of success and reverses on both sides At Crevant sur Yonne on the thirty first of July fourteen twenty three and at Verneuil in Normandy on the seventeenth of August fourteen twenty four the French were beaten and their faithful allies the Scots suffered considerable loss In the latter affair however several Norman lords deserted the English flag refusing to fight against the King of France On the twenty sixth of September fourteen twenty three at La Gravelle in Maine the French were victorious and Du Guesclin was commemorated in their victory Anne de Laval granddaughter of the great Breton warrior and mistress of a castle hard by the scene of action sent thither her son Andrew de Laval a child twelve years of age and as she buckled with her own hands the sword which his ancestor had worn she said to him God make thee as valiant as he whose sword this was The boy received the order of knighthood on the field of battle and became afterwards a marshal of France Little bands made up of volunteers attempted enterprises which the chiefs of the regular armies considered impossible Stephen de Vignolles celebrated under the name of La Hire resolved to succor the town of Montargis besieged by the English and young Dunois the bastard of Orleans joined him On arriving September five fourteen twenty seven beneath the walls of the place a priest was encountered in their road La Hire asked him for absolution The priest told him to confess I have no time for that said La Hire I am in a hurry I have done in the way of sins all that men of war are in the habit of doing Whereupon says the chronicler the chaplain gave him absolution for what it was worth and La Hire putting his hands together said God I pray Thee to do for La Hire this day as much as Thou wouldst have La Hire do for Thee if he were God and Thou wert La Hire And Montargis was rid of its besiegers The English determined to become masters of Mont saint Michel au peril de la mer that abbey built on a rock facing the western coast of Normandy and surrounded every day by the waves of ocean The thirty second abbot Robert Jolivet promised to give the place up to them and went to Rouen with that design but one of his monks John Enault being elected vicar general by the chapter and supported by some valiant Norman warriors offered an obstinate resistance for eight years baffled all the attacks of the English and retained the abbey in the possession of the King of France The inhabitants of La Rochelle rendered the same service to the king and to France in a more important case On the fifteenth of August fourteen twenty seven an English fleet of a hundred and twenty sail it is said appeared off their city with invading troops aboard The Rochellese immediately levied upon themselves an extraordinary tax and put themselves in a state of defence troops raised in the neighborhood went and occupied the heights bordering on the coast and a bold Breton sailor Bernard de Kercabin put to sea to meet the enemy with ships armed as privateers The attempt of the English seemed to them to offer more danger than chance of success and they withdrew Thus Charles VII kept possession of the only seaport remaining to the crown Almost everywhere in the midst of a war as indecisive as it was obstinate local patriotism and the spirit of chivalry successfully disputed against foreign supremacy the scattered fragments of the fatherland and the throne In order to put an end to this doubtful condition of events and of minds the Duke of Bedford determined to aim a grand blow at the national party in France and at her king After Paris and Rouen Orleans was the most important city in the kingdom it was as supreme on the banks of the Loire as Paris and Rouen were on those of the Seine After having obtained from England considerable re enforcements commanded by leaders of experience the English commenced in October fourteen twenty eight the siege of Orleans The approaches to the place were occupied in force and bastilles closely connected one with another were constructed around the walls As a set off the most valiant warriors of France La Hire Dunois Xaintrailles and the Marshal La Fayette threw themselves into Orleans the garrison of which amounted to scarcely twelve hundred men Several towns Bourges Poitiers and La Rochelle sent thither money munitions and militia the states general assembled at Chinon voted an extraordinary aid and Charles VII called out the regulars and the reserves Assaults on the one side and sorties on the other were begun with ardor Besiegers and besieged quite felt that they were engaged in a decisive struggle The first encounter was unfortunate for the Orleannese In a fight called the Herring affair they were unsuccessful in an attempt to carry off a supply of victuals and salt fish which Sir John Falstolf was bringing to the besiegers Being a little discouraged they offered the Duke of Burgundy to place their city in his hands that it might not fall into those of the English and Philip the Good accepted the offer but the Duke of Bedford made a formal objection He didn t care he said to beat the bushes for another to get the birds Philip in displeasure withdrew from the siege the small force of Burgundians he had sent The English remained alone before the place which was every day harder pressed and more strictly blockaded The besieged were far from foreseeing what succor was preparing for them This very year on the sixth of January fourteen twenty eight at Domremy a little village in the valley of the Meuse between Neufchateau and Vaucouleurs on the edge of the frontier from Champagne to Lorraine the young daughter of simple tillers of the soil of good life and repute herself a good simple gentle girl no idler occupied hitherto in sewing or spinning with her mother or driving afield her parent s sheep and sometimes even when her father s turn came round keeping for him the whole flock of the commune was fulfilling her sixteenth year It was Joan of Arc whom all her neighbors called Joannette She was no recluse she often went with her companions to sing and eat cakes beside the fountain by the gooseberry bush under an old beech which was called the fairy tree but dancing she did not like She was constant at church she delighted in the sound of the bells she went often to confession and communion and she blushed when her fair friends taxed her with being too religious In fourteen twenty one when Joan was hardly nine a band of Anglo Burgundians penetrated into her country and transferred thither the ravages of war The village of Domremy and the little town of Vaucouleurs were French and faithful to the French king ship and Joan wept to see the lads of her parish returning bruised and bleeding from encounters with the enemy Her relations and neighbors were one day obliged to take to flight and at their return they found their houses burned or devastated Joan wondered whether it could possibly be that God permitted such excesses and disasters In fourteen twenty five on a summer s day at noon she was in her father s little garden She heard a voice calling her at her right side in the direction of the church and a great brightness shone upon her at the same time in the same spot At first she was frightened but she recovered herself on finding that it was a worthy voice and at the second call she perceived that it was the voice of angels I saw them with my bodily eyes she said six years later to her judges at Rouen as plainly as I see you when they departed from me I wept and would fain have had them take me with them The apparitions came again and again and exhorted her to go to France for to deliver the kingdom She became dreamy rapt in constant meditation I could endure no longer said she at a later period and the time went heavily with me as with a woman in travail She ended by telling everything to her father who listened to her words anxiously at first and afterwards wrathfully He himself one night dreamed that his daughter had followed the king s men at arms to France and from that moment he kept her under strict superintendence If I knew of your sister s going he said to his sons I would bid you drown her and if you did not do it I would drown her myself Joan submitted there was no leaven of pride in her sublimation and she did not suppose that her intercourse with celestial voices relieved her from the duty of obeying her parents Attempts were made to distract her mind A young man who had courted her was induced to say that he had a promise of marriage from her and to claim the fulfilment of it Joan went before the ecclesiastical judge made affirmation that she had given no promise and without difficulty gained her cause Everybody believed and respected her Illustration Joan of Arc in her Father s Garden ninety one In a village hard by Domremy she had an uncle whose wife was near her confinement she got herself invited to go and nurse her aunt and thereupon she opened her heart to her uncle repeating to him a popular saying which had spread indeed throughout the country Is it not said that a woman shall ruin France and a young maid restore it She pressed him to take her to Vaucouleurs to Sire Robert de Baudricourt captain of the bailiwick for she wished to go to the dauphin and carry assistance to him Her uncle gave way and on the thirteenth of May fourteen twenty eight he did take her to Vaucouleurs I come on behalf of my Lord said she to Sire de Baudricourt to bid you send word to the dauphin to keep himself well in hand and not give battle to his foes for my Lord will presently give him succor Who is thy lord asked Baudricourt The King of Heaven answered Joan Baudricourt set her down for mad and urged her uncle to take her back to her parents with a good slap o the face In July fourteen twenty eight a fresh invasion of Burgundians occurred at Domremy and redoubled the popular excitement there Shortly afterwards the report touching the siege of Orleans arrived there Joan more and more passionately possessed with her idea returned to Vaucouleurs I must go said she to Sire de Baudricourt for to raise the siege of Orleans I will go should I have to wear off my legs to the knee She had returned to Vaucouleurs without taking leave of her parents Had I possessed said she in fourteen thirty one to her judges at Rouen a hundred fathers and a hundred mothers and had I been a king s daughter I should have gone Baudricourt impressed without being convinced did not oppose her remaining at Vaucouleurs and sent an account of this singular young girl to Duke Charles of Lorraine at Nancy and perhaps even according to some chronicles to the king s court Joan lodged at Vaucouleurs in a wheelwright s house and passed three weeks there spinning with her hostess and dividing her time between work and church There was much talk in Vaucouleurs of her and her visions and her purpose John of Metz also called John of Novelompont a knight serving with Sire de Baudricourt desired to see her and went to the wheelwright s What do you here my dear said he must the king be driven from his kingdom and we become English I am come hither answered Joan to speak to Robert de Baudricourt that he may be pleased to take me or have me taken to the king but he pays no heed to me or my words However I must be with the king before the middle of Lent for none in the world nor kings nor dukes nor daughter of the Scottish king can recover the kingdom of France there is no help but in me Assuredly I would far rather be spinning beside my poor mother for this other is not my condition but I must go and do the work because my Lord wills that I should do it Who is your lord The Lord God By my faith said the knight seizing Joan s hands I will take you to the king God helping When will you set out Rather now than to morrow rather to morrow than later Vaucouleurs was full of the fame and the sayings of Joan Another knight Bertrand de Poulengy offered as John of Metz had to be her escort Duke Charles of Lorraine wished to see her and sent for her to Nancy Old and ill as he was he had deserted the duchess his wife a virtuous lady and was leading anything but a regular life He asked Joan s advice about his health I have no power to cure you said Joan but go back to your wife and help me in that for which God ordains me The duke ordered her four golden crowns and she returned to Vaucouleurs thinking of nothing but her departure There was no want of confidence and good will on the part of the inhabitants of Vaucouleurs in forwarding her preparations John of Metz the knight charged to accompany her asked her if she intended to make the journey in her poor red rustic petticoats I would like to don man s clothes answered Joan Subscriptions were made to give her a suitable costume She was supplied with a horse a coat of mail a lance a sword the complete equipment indeed of a man at arms and a king s messenger and an archer formed her train Baudricourt made them swear to escort her safely and on the twenty fifth of February fourteen twenty nine he bade her farewell and all he said was Away then Joan and come what may Charles VII was at that time residing at Chinon in Touraine In order to get there Joan had nearly a hundred and fifty leagues to go in a country occupied here and there by English and Burgundians and everywhere a theatre of war She took eleven days to do this journey often marching by night never giving up man s dress disquieted by no difficulty and no danger and testifying no desire for a halt save to worship God Could we hear mass daily said she to her comrades we should do well They only consented twice first in the abbey of saint Urban and again in the principal church of Auxerre As they were full of respect though at the same time also of doubt towards Joan she never had to defend herself against their familiarities but she had constantly to dissipate their disquietude touching the reality or the character of her mission Fear nothing she said to them God shows me the way I should go for thereto was I born On arriving at the village of saint Catherine de Fierbois near Chinon she heard three masses on the same day and had a letter written thence to the king to announce her coming and to ask to see him she had gone she said a hundred and fifty leagues to come and tell him things which would be most useful to him Charles VII and his councillors hesitated The men of war did not like to believe that a little peasant girl of Lorraine was coming to bring the king a more effectual support than their own Nevertheless some and the most heroic amongst them Dunois La Hire and Xaintrailles were moved by what was told of this young girl The letters of Sire de Baudricourt though full of doubt suffered a gleam of something like a serious impression to peep out and why should not the king receive this young girl whom the captain of Vaucouleurs had thought it a duty to send It would soon be seen what she was and what she would do The politicians and courtiers especially the most trusted of them George de la Tremoille the king s favorite shrugged their shoulders What could be expected from the dreams of a young peasant girl of nineteen Influences of a more private character and more disposed towards sympathy Yolande of Arragon for instance Queen of Sicily and mother in law of Charles VII and perhaps also her daughter the young queen Mary of Anjou were urgent for the king to reply to Joan that she might go to Chinon She was authorized to do so and on the sixth of March fourteen twenty nine she with her comrades arrived at the royal residence At the very first moment two incidents occurred to still further increase the curiosity of which she was the object Quite close to Chinon some vagabonds it is said had prepared an ambuscade for the purpose of despoiling her her and her train She passed close by them without the least obstacle The rumor went that at her approach they were struck motionless and had been unable to attempt their wicked purpose Joan was rather tall well shaped dark with a look of composure animation and gentleness A man at arms who met her on her way thought her pretty and with an impious oath expressed a coarse sentiment Alas said Joan thou blasphemest thy God and yet thou art so near thy death He drowned himself it is said soon after Already popular feeling was surrounding her marvellous mission with a halo of instantaneous miracles Illustration CHINON CASTLE ninety five On her arrival at Chinon she at first lodged with an honest family near the castle For three days longer there was a deliberation in the council as to whether the king ought to receive her But there was bad news from Orleans There were no more troops to send thither and there was no money forthcoming the king s treasurer it was said had but four crowns in the chest If Orleans were taken the king would perhaps be reduced to seeking a refuge in Spain or in Scotland Joan promised to set Orleans free The Orleannese themselves were clamorous for her Dunois kept up their spirits with the expectation of this marvellous assistance It was decided that the king should receive her She had assigned to her for residence an apartment in the tower of the Coudray a block of quarters adjoining the royal mansion and she was committed to the charge of William Bellier an officer of the king s household whose wife was a woman of great piety and excellent fame On the ninth of March fourteen twenty nine Joan was at last introduced into the king s presence by the Count of Vendome high steward in the great hall on the first story a portion of the wall and the fireplace being still visible in the present day It was evening candle light and nearly three hundred knights were present Charles kept himself a little aloof amidst a group of warriors and courtiers more richly dressed than he According to some chroniclers Joan had demanded that she should not be deceived and should have pointed out to her him to whom she was to speak others affirm that she went straight to the king whom she had never seen accosting him humbly and simply like a poor little shepherdess says an eye witness and according to another account making the usual bends and reverences as if she had been brought up at court Whatever may have been her outward behavior Gentle dauphin she said to the king for she did not think it right to call him king so long as he was not crowned my name is Joan the maid the King of Heaven sendeth you word by me that you shall be anointed and crowned in the city of Rheims and shall be lieutenant of the King of Heaven who is King of France It is God s pleasure that our enemies the English should depart to their own country if they depart no evil will come to them and the kingdom is sure to continue yours Charles was impressed without being convinced as so many others had been before or were as he was on that very day He saw Joan again several times She did not delude herself as to the doubts he still entertained Gentle dauphin she said to him one day why do you not believe me I say unto you that God hath compassion on you your kingdom and your people saint Louis and Charlemagne are kneeling before Him making prayer for you and I will say unto you so please you a thing which will give you to understand that you ought to believe me Charles gave her audience on this occasion in the presence according to some accounts of four witnesses the most trusted of his intimates who swore to reveal nothing and according to others completely alone What she said to him there is none who knows wrote Alan Chartier a short time after in July fourteen twenty nine but it is quite certain that he was all radiant with joy thereat as at a revelation from the Holy Spirit M Wallop after a scrupulous sifting of evidence has given the following exposition of this mysterious interview Sire de Boisy he says who was in his youth one of the gentlemen of the bed chamber on the most familiar terms with Charles VII told Peter Sala giving the king himself as his authority for the story that one day at the period of his greatest adversity the prince vainly looking for a remedy against so many troubles entered in the morning alone into his oratory and there without uttering a word aloud made prayer to God from the depths of his heart that if he were the true heir issue of the house of France and a doubt was possible with such a queen as Isabel of Bavaria and the kingdom ought justly to be his God would be pleased to keep and defend it for him if not to give him grace to escape without death or imprisonment and find safety in Spain or in Scotland where he intended in the last resort to seek a refuge This prayer known to God alone the Maid recalled to the mind of Charles VII and thus is explained the joy which as the witnesses say he testified whilst none at that time knew the cause Joan by this revelation not only caused the king to believe in her she caused him to believe in himself and his right and title though she never spoke in that way as of her own motion to the king it was always a superior power speaking by her voice I tell thee on behalf of my Lord that thou art true heir of France and son of the king Jeanne d Arc by M Wallon t i p thirty two Whether Charles VII were or were not convinced by this interview of Joan s divine mission he clearly saw that many of those about him had little or no faith in it and that other proofs were required to upset their doubts He resolved to go to Poitiers where his council the parliament and several learned members of the University of Paris were in session and have Joan put to the strictest examination When she learned her destination she said In the name of God I know that I shall have tough work there but my Lord will help me Let us go then for God s sake On her arrival at Poitiers on the eleventh of March fourteen twenty nine she was placed in one of the most respectable families in the town that of John Rabuteau advocate general in parliament The Archbishop of Rheims Reginald de Chartres Chancellor of France five bishops the king s councillors several learned doctors and amongst others Father Seguin an austere and harsh Dominican repaired thither to question her When she saw them come in she went and sat down at the end of the bench and asked them what they wanted with her For two hours they set themselves to the task of showing her by fair and gentle arguments that she was not entitled to belief Joan said William Aimery professor of theology you ask for men at arms and you say that it is God s pleasure that the English should leave the kingdom of France and depart to their own land if so there is no need of men at arms for God s pleasure alone can discomfit them and force them to return to their homes In the name of God answered Joan the men at arms will do battle and God will give them victory Master William did not urge his point The Dominican Seguin a very sour man says the chronicle asked Joan what language the voices spoke to her Better than yours answered Joan The doctor spoke the Limousine dialect Do you believe in God he asked ill humoredly More than you do retorted Joan offended Well rejoined the monk God forbids belief in you without some sign tending thereto I shall not give the king advice to trust men at arms to you and put them in peril on your simple word In the name of God said Joan I am not come to Poitiers to show signs take me to Orleans and I will give you signs of what I am sent for Let me have ever so few men at arms given me and I will go to Orleans then addressing another of the examiners Master Peter of Versailles who was afterwards Bishop of Meaux she said I know nor A nor B but in our Lord s book there is more than in your books I come on behalf of the King of Heaven to cause the siege of Orleans to be raised and to take the king to Rheims that he may be crowned and anointed there The examination was prolonged for a fortnight not without symptoms of impatience on the part of Joan At the end of it she said to one of the doctors John Erault Have you paper and ink Write what I shall say to you And she dictated a form of letter which became some weeks later the manifesto addressed in a more developed shape by her from Orleans to the English calling upon them to raise the siege and put a stop to the war The chief of those piously and patriotically heroic phrases were as follows Jesu Maria King of England account to the King of Heaven for His blood royal Give up to the Maid the keys of all the good towns you have taken by force She is come from God to avenge the blood royal and quite ready to make peace if you will render proper account If you do not so I am a war chief in whatsoever place I shall fall in with your folks in France if they be not willing to obey I shall make them get thence whether they will or not and if they be willing to obey I will receive them to mercy The Maid cometh from the King of Heaven as His representative to thrust you out of France she doth promise and certify you that she will make therein such mighty haha great tumult that for a thousand years hitherto in France was never the like Duke of Bedford who call yourself regent of France the Maid doth pray you and request you not to bring destruction on yourself if you do not justice towards her she will do the finest deed ever done in Christendom Writ on Tuesday in the great week Easter week March fourteen twenty nine Subscribed Hearken to the news from God and the Maid At the end of their examination the doctors decided in Joan s favor Two of them the Bishop of Castres Gerard Machet the king s confessor and Master John Erault recognized the divine nature of her mission She was they said the virgin foretold in the ancient prophecies notably in those of Merlin and the most exacting amongst them approved of the king s having neither accepted nor rejected with levity the promises made by Joan after a grave inquiry there had been discovered in her they said nought but goodness humility devotion honesty simplicity Before Orleans she professes to be going to show her sign so she must be taken to Orleans for to give her up without any appearance on her part of evil would be to fight against the Holy Spirit and to become unworthy of aid from God After the doctors examination came that of the women Three of the greatest ladies in France Yolande of Arragon Queen of Sicily the Countess of Gaucourt wife of the Governor of Orleans and Joan de Mortemer wife of Robert le Macon Baron of Troves were charged to examine Joan as to her life as a woman They found therein nothing but truth virtue and modesty she spoke to them with such sweetness and grace says the chronicle that she drew tears from their eyes and she excused herself to them for the dress she wore and for which the sternest doctors had not dreamed of reproaching her It is more decent said the Archbishop of Embrun to do such things in man s dress since they must be done along with men The men of intelligence at court bowed down before this village saint who was coming to bring to the king in his peril assistance from God the most valiant men of war were moved by the confident outbursts of her patriotic courage and the people everywhere welcomed her with faith and enthusiasm Joan had as yet only just appeared and already she was the heaven sent interpretress of the nation s feeling the hope of the people of France Charles no longer hesitated Joan was treated according to her own expression in her letter to the English as a war chief there were assigned to her a squire a page two heralds a chaplain Brother Pasquerel of the order of the hermit brotherhood of saint Augustin varlets and serving folks A complete suit of armor was made to fit her Her two guides John of Metz and Bertrand of Poulengy had not quitted her and the king continued them in her train Her sword he wished to be supplied by himself she asked for one marked with five crosses it would be found she said behind the altar in the chapel of saint Catherine de Fierbois where she had halted on her arrival at Chinon and there indeed it was found She had a white banner made studded with lilies bearing the representation of God seated upon the clouds and holding in His hand the globe of the world Above were the words Jesu Maria and below were two angels on their knees in adoration Joan was fond of her sword as she said two years afterwards at her trial but she was forty times more fond of her banner which was in her eyes the sign of her commission and the pledge of victory On the completion of the preparations she demanded the immediate departure of the expedition Orleans was crying for succor Dunois was sending messenger after messenger and Joan was in a greater hurry than anybody else More than a month elapsed before her anxieties were satisfied During this interval we find Charles VII and Joan of Arc at Chatelherault at Poitiers at Tours at Florent les Saumur at Chinon and at Blois going to and fro through all that country to push forward the expedition resolved upon and to remove the obstacles it encountered Through a haze of vague indications a glimpse is caught of the struggle which was commencing between the partisans and the adversaries of Joan and in favor of or in opposition to the impulse she was communicating to the war of nationality Charles VII s mother in law Yolande of Arragon Queen of Sicily and the young Duke of Alencon whose father had been killed at the battle of Agincourt were at the head of Joan s partisans Yolande gave money and took a great deal of trouble in order to promote the expedition which was to go and succor Orleans The Duke of Alencon hardly twenty years of age was the only one amongst the princes of the house of Valois who had given Joan a kind reception on her arrival and who together with the brave La Hire said that he would follow her whithersoever she pleased to lead him Joan in her gratitude called him the handsome duke and exhibited towards him amity and confidence But side by side with these friends she had an adversary in the king s favorite George de la Tremoille an ambitious courtier jealous of any one who seemed within the range of the king s favor and opposed to a vigorous prosecution of the war since it hampered him in the policy he wished to keep up towards the Duke of Burgundy To the ill will of La Tremoille was added that of the majority of courtiers enlisted in the following of the powerful favorite and that of warriors irritated at the importance acquired at their expense by a rustic and fantastic little adventuress Here was the source of the enmities and intrigues which stood in the way of all Joan s demands rendered her successes more tardy difficult and incomplete and were one day to cost her more dearly still At the end of about five weeks the expedition was in readiness It was a heavy convoy of revictualment protected by a body of ten or twelve thousand men commanded by Marshal de Boussac and numbering amongst them Xaintrailles and La Hire The march began on the twenty seventh of April fourteen twenty nine Joan had caused the removal of all women of bad character and had recommended her comrades to confess She took the communion in the open air before their eyes and a company of priests headed by her chaplain Pasquerel led the way whilst chanting sacred hymns Great was the surprise amongst the men at arms many had words of mockery on their lips It was the time when La Hire used to say If God were a soldier He would turn robber Nevertheless respect got the better of habit the most honorable were really touched the coarsest considered themselves bound to show restraint On the twenty ninth of April they arrived before Orleans But in consequence of the road they had followed the Loire was between the army and the town the expeditionary corps had to be split in two the troops were obliged to go and feel for the bridge of Blois in order to cross the river and Joan was vexed and surprised Dunois arrived from Orleans in a little boat urged her to enter the town that same evening Are you the bastard of Orleans asked she when he accosted her Yes and I am rejoiced at your coming Was it you who gave counsel for making me come hither by this side of the river and not the direct way over yonder where Talbot and the English were Yes such was the opinion of the wisest captains In the name of God the counsel of my Lord is wiser than yours you thought to deceive me and you have deceived yourselves for I am bringing you the best succor that ever had knight or town or city and that is the good will of God and succor from the King of Heaven not assuredly for love of me it is from God only that it proceeds It was a great trial for Joan to separate from her comrades so well prepared penitent and well disposed in their company said she I should not fear the whole power of the English She was afraid that disorder might set in amongst the troops and that they might break up instead of fulfilling her mission Dunois was urgent for her to go herself at once into Orleans with such portion of the convoy as boats might be able to transport thither without delay Orleans said he would count it for nought if they received the victuals without the Maid Joan decided to go the captains of her division promised to rejoin her at Orleans she left them her chaplain Pasquerel the priests who accompanied him and the banner around which she was accustomed to muster them and she herself with Dunois La Hire and two hundred men at arms crossed the river at the same time with a part of the supplies Illustration JOAN ENTERING ORLEANS one hundred four The same day at eight P M she entered the city on horseback completely armed preceded by her own banner and having beside her Dunois and behind her the captains of the garrison and several of the most distinguished burgesses of Orleans who had gone out to meet her The population one and all rushed thronging round her carrying torches and greeting her arrival with joy as great as if they had seen God come down amongst them They felt says the Journal of the Siege all of them recomforted and as it were disbesieged by the divine virtue which they had been told existed in this simple maid In their anxiety to approach her to touch her one of their lighted torches set fire to her banner Joan disengaged herself with her horse as cleverly as it could have been done by the most skilful horseman and herself extinguished the flame The crowd attended her to the church whither she desired to go first of all to render thanks to God and then to the house of John Boucher the Duke of Orleans s treasurer where she was received together with her two brothers and the two gentlemen who had been her guides from Vaucouleurs The treasurer s wife was one of the most virtuous city dames in Orleans and from this night forth her daughter Charlotte had Joan for her bedfellow A splendid supper had been prepared for her but she would merely dip some slices of bread in wine and water Neither her enthusiasm nor her success the two greatest tempters to pride in mankind made any change in her modesty and simplicity The very day after her arrival she would have liked to go and attack the English in their bastilles within which they kept themselves shut up La Hire was pretty much of her opinion but Dunois and the captains of the garrison thought they ought to await the coming of the troops which had gone to cross the Loire at Blois and the supports which several French garrisons in the neighborhood had received orders to forward to Orleans Joan insisted Sire de Gamaches one of the officers present could not contain himself Since ear is given said he to the advice of a wench of low degree rather than to that of a knight like me I will not bandy more words when the time comes it shall be my sword that will speak I shall fall perhaps but the king and my own honor demand it henceforth I give up my banner and am nothing more than a poor esquire I prefer to have for master a noble man rather than a girl who has heretofore been perhaps I know not what He furled his banner and handed it to Dunois Dunois as sensible as he was brave would not give heed either to the choler of Gamaches or to the insistence of Joan and thanks to his intervention they were reconciled on being induced to think better respectively of giving up the banner and ordering an immediate attack Dunois went to Blois to hurry the movements of the division which had repaired thither and his presence there was highly necessary since Joan s enemies especially the chancellor Regnault were nearly carrying a decision that no such re enforcement should be sent to Orleans Dunois frustrated this purpose and led back to Orleans by way of Beauce the troops concentrated at Blois On the fourth of May as soon as it was known that he was coming Joan La Hire and the principal leaders of the city as well as of the garrison went to meet him and re entered Orleans with him and his troops passing between the bastilles of the English who made not even an attempt to oppose them That is the sorceress yonder said some of the besiegers others asked if it were quite so clear that her power did not come to her from on high and their commander the Earl of Suffolk being himself perhaps uncertain did not like to risk it doubt produced terror and terror inactivity The convoy from Blois entered Orleans preceded by Brother Pasquerel and the priests Joan whilst she was awaiting it sent the English captains a fresh summons to withdraw conformably with the letter which she had already addressed to them from Blois and the principal clauses of which were just now quoted here They replied with coarse insults calling her strumpet and cow girl and threatening to burn her when they caught her She was very much moved by their insults insomuch as to weep but calling God to witness her innocence she found herself comforted and expressed it by saying I have had news from my Lord The English had detained the first herald she had sent them and when she would have sent them a second to demand his comrade back he was afraid In the name of God said Joan they will do no harm nor to thee nor to him thou shalt tell Talbot to arm and I too will arm let him show himself in front of the city if he can take me let him burn me if I discomfit him let him raise the siege and let the English get them gone to their own country The second herald appeared to be far from reassured but Dunois charged him to say that the English prisoners should answer for what was done to the heralds from the Maid The two heralds were sent back Joan made up her mind to iterate in person to the English the warnings she had given them in her letter She mounted upon one of the bastions of Orleans opposite the English bastille called Tournelles and there at the top of her voice she repeated her counsel to them to be gone else woe and shame would come upon them The commandant of the bastille Sir William Gladesdale called by Joan and the French chroniclers Glacidas answered with the usual insults telling her to go back and mind her cows and alluding to the French as miscreants You lie cried Joan and in spite of you soon shall ye depart hence many of your people shall be slain but as for you you shall not see it Dunois the very day of his return to Orleans after dinner went to call upon Joan and told her that he had heard on his way that Sir John Falstolf the same who on the twelfth of the previous February had beaten the French in the Herring affair was about to arrive with re enforcements and supplies for the besiegers Bastard bastard said Joan in the name of God I command thee as soon as thou shalt know of this Pascot s coming to have me warned of it for should he pass without my knowing of it I promise thee that I will have thy head cut off Dunois assured her that she should be warned Joan was tired with the day s excitement she threw herself upon her bed to sleep but unsuccessfully all at once she said to Sire Daulon her esquire My counsel doth tell me to go against the English but I know not whether against their bastilles or against this Fascot I must arm Her esquire was beginning to arm her when she heard it shouted in the street that the enemy were at that moment doing great damage to the French My God said she the blood of our people is running on the ground why was I not awakened sooner Ah it was ill done My arms My arms my horse Leaving behind her esquire who was not yet armed she went down Her page was playing at the door Ah naughty boy said she not to come and tell me that the blood of France was being shed Come quick my horse It was brought to her she bade them hand down to her by the window her banner which she had left behind and without any further waiting she departed and went to the Burgundy gate whence the noise seemed to come Seeing on her way one of the townsmen passing who was being carried off wounded she said Alas I never see a Frenchman s blood but my hair stands up on my head It was some of the Orleannese themselves who without consulting their chiefs had made a sortie and attacked the Bastille saint Loup the strongest held by the English on this side The French had been repulsed and were falling back in flight when Joan came up and soon after her Dunois and a throng of men at arms who had been warned of the danger The fugitives returned to the assault the battle was renewed with ardor the bastille of saint Loup notwithstanding energetic resistance on the part of the English who manned it was taken and all its defenders were put to the sword before Talbot and the main body of the besiegers could come up to their assistance Joan showed sorrow that so many people should have died unconfessed and she herself was the means of saving some who had disguised themselves as priests in gowns which they had taken from the church of saint Loup Great was the joy in Orleans and the enthusiasm for Joan was more lively than ever Her voices had warned her they said and apprised her that there was a battle and then she had found by herself alone and without any guide the way to the Burgundy gate Men at arms and burgesses all demanded that the attack upon the English hastilles should be resumed but the next day the fifth of May was Ascension day Joan advocated lions repose on this holy festival and the general feeling was in accord with her own She recommended her comrades to fulfil their religious duties and she herself received the communion The chiefs of the besieged resolved to begin on the morrow a combined attack upon the English bastilles which surrounded the palace but Joan was not in their counsels Tell me what you have resolved she said to them I can keep this and greater secrets Dunois made her acquainted with the plan adopted of which she fully approved and on the morrow the sixth of May a fierce struggle began again all round Orleans For two days the bastilles erected by the besiegers against the place were repeatedly attacked by the besieged On the first day Joan was slightly wounded in the foot Some disagreement arose between her and Sire de Gaucourt governor of Orleans as to continuing the struggle and John Boucher her host tried to keep her back the second day Stay and dine with us said he to eat that shad which has just been brought Keep it for supper said Joan I will come back this evening and bring you some goddamns Englishman or other to eat his share and she sallied forth eager to return to the assault On arriving at the Burgundy gate she found it closed the governor would not allow any sortie thereby to attack on that side Ah naughty man said Joan you are wrong whether you will or no our men at arms shall go and win on this day as they have already won The gate was forced and men at arms and burgesses rushed out from all quarters to attack the bastille of Tournelles the strongest of the English works It was ten o clock in the morning the passive and active powers of both parties were concentrated on this point and for a moment the French appeared weary and downcast Joan took a scaling ladder set it against the rampart and was the first to mount There came an arrow and struck her between neck and shoulder and she fell Sire de Gamaches who had but lately displayed so much temper towards her found her where she lay Take my horse said he and bear no malice I was wrong I had formed a false idea of you Yes said Joan and bear no malice I never saw a more accomplished knight She was taken away and had her armor removed The arrow it is said stood out almost half a foot behind There was an instant of faintness and tears but she prayed and felt her strength renewed and pulled out the arrow with her own hand Illustration Herself drew out the Arrow one hundred nine Some one proposed to her to charm the wound by means of cabalistic words but I would rather die she said than so sin against the will of God I know full well that I must die some day but I know nor where nor when nor how If without sin my wound may be healed I am right willing A dressing of oil and lard was applied to the wound and she retired apart into a vineyard and was continually in prayer Fatigue and discouragement were overcoming the French and the captains ordered the retreat to be sounded Joan begged Dunois to wait a while My God said she we shall soon be inside Give your people a little rest eat and drink She resumed her arms and remounted her horse her banner floated in the air the French took fresh courage the English who thought Joan half dead were seized with surprise and fear and one of their principal leaders Sir William Gladesdale made up his mind to abandon the outwork which he had hitherto so well kept and retire within the bastille itself Joan perceived his movement Yield thee she shouted to him from afar yield thee to the King of Heaven Ah Glacidas thou hast basely insulted me but I have great pity on the souls of thee and thine The Englishman continued his retreat Whilst he was passing over the drawbridge which reached from the out work to the bastille a shot from the side of Orleans broke down the bridge Gladesdale fell into the water and was drowned together with many of his comrades the French got into the bastille without any fresh fighting and Joan re entered Orleans amidst the joy and acclamations of the people The bells rang all through the night and the Te Deum was chanted The day of combat was about to be succeeded by the day of deliverance On the morrow the eighth of May fourteen twenty nine at daybreak the English leaders drew up their troops close to the very moats of the city and seemed to offer battle to the French Many of the Orleannese leaders would have liked to accept this challenge but Joan got up from her bed where she was resting because of her wound put on a light suit of armor and ran to the city gates For the love and honor of holy Sunday said she to the assembled warriors do not be the first to attack and make to them no demand it is God s good will and pleasure that they be allowed to get them gone if they be minded to go away if they attack you defend yourselves boldly you will be the masters She caused an altar to be raised thanksgivings were sung and mass was celebrated See said Joan are the English turning to you their faces or verily their backs They had commenced their retreat in good order with standards flying Let them go my Lord willeth not that there be any fighting to day you shall have them another time The good words spoken by Joan were not so preventive but that many men set off to pursue the English and cut off stragglers and baggage Their bastilles were found to be full of victual and munitions and they had abandoned their sick and many of their prisoners The siege of Orleans was raised The day but one after this deliverance Joan set out to go and rejoin the king and prosecute her work at his side She fell in with him on the thirteenth of May at Tours moved forward to meet him with her banner in her hand and her head uncovered and bending down over her charger s neck made him a deep obeisance Charles took off his cap held out his hand to her and as it seemed to many says a contemporary chronicler he would fain have kissed her for the joy that he felt But the king s joy was not enough for Joan She urged him to march with her against enemies who were flying so to speak from themselves and to start without delay for Rheims where he would be crowned I shall hardly last more than a year said she we must think about working right well this year for there is much to do Hesitation was natural to Charles even in the hour of victory His favorite La Tremoille and his chancellor the Archbishop of Rheims opposed Joan s entreaties with all the objections that could be devised under the inspiration of their ill will there were neither troops nor money in hand for so great a journey and council after council was held for the purpose of doing nothing Joan in her impatience went one day to Loches without previous notice and tapped softly at the door of the king s privy chamber chambre de re trait He bade her enter She fell upon her knees saying Gentle dauphin hold not so many and such long councils but rather come to Rheims and there assume your crown I am much pricked to take you thither Joan said the Bishop of Castres Christopher d Harcourt the king s confessor cannot you tell the king what pricketh you Ah I see replied Joan with some embarrassment well I will tell you I had set me to prayer according to my wont and I was making complaint for that you would not believe what I said then the voice came and said unto me Go go my daughter I will be a help to thee go When this voice comes to me I feel marvellously rejoiced I would that it might endure forever She was eager and overcome Joan and her voices were not alone in urging the king to shake off his doubts and his indolence In church and court and army allies were not wanting to the pious and valiant maid In a written document dated the fourteenth of May six days after the siege of Orleans was raised the most Christian doctor of the age as Gerson was called sifted the question whether it were possible whether it were a duty to believe in the Maid Even if which God forbid said he she should be mistaken in her hope and ours it would not necessarily follow that what she does comes of the evil spirit and not of God but that rather our ingratitude was to blame Let the party which hath a just cause take care how by incredulity or injustice it rendereth useless the divine succor so miraculously manifested for God without any change of counsel changeth the upshot according to deserts Great lords and simple gentlemen old and young warriors were eager to go and join Joan for the salvation of the king and of France The constable De Richemont banished from the court through the jealous hatred of George la Tremoille made a pressing application there followed by a body of men at arms and when the king refused to see him he resolved though continuing in disgrace to take an active part in the war The young Duke of Alencon who had been a prisoner with the English since the battle of Agincourt hurried on the payment of his ransom in order to accompany Joan as lieutenant general of the king in the little army which was forming His wife the duchess was in grief about it We have just spent great sums said she in buying him back from the English if he would take my advice he would stay at home Madame said Joan I will bring him back to you safe and sound nay even in better contentment than at present be not afraid And on this promise the duchess took heart Du Guesciin s widow Joan de Laval was still living and she had two grandsons Guy and Andrew de Laval who were amongst the most zealous of those taking service in the army destined to march on Rheims The king to all appearance desired to keep them near his person God forbid that I should do so wrote Guy de Laval on the eighth of June fourteen twenty nine to those most dread dames his grandmother and his mother my brother says as also my lord the Duke d Alencon that a good riddance of bad rubbish would he be who should stay at home And he describes his first interview with the Maid as follows The king had sent for her to come and meet him at Selles en Berry Some say that it was for my sake in order that I might see her She gave right good cheer a kind reception to my brother and myself and after we had dismounted at Selles I went to see her in her quarters She ordered wine and told me that she would soon have me drinking some at Paris It seems a thing divine to look on her and listen to her I saw her mount on horseback armed all in white armor save her head and with a little axe in her hand on a great black charger which at the door of her quarters was very restive and would not let her mount Then said she Lead him to the cross which was in front of the neighboring church on the road There she mounted him without his moving and as if he were tied up and turning towards the door of the church which was very nigh at hand she said in quite a womanly voice You priests and church men make procession and prayers to God Then she resumed her road saying Push forward push forward She told me that three days before my arrival she had sent you dear grand mother a little golden ring but that it was a very small matter and she would have liked to send you something better having regard to your estimation It was amidst this burst of patriotism and with all these valiant comrades that Joan recommenced the campaign on the tenth of June fourteen twenty nine quite resolved to bring the king to Rheims To complete the deliverance of Orleans an attack was begun upon the neighboring places Jargeau Meung and Beaugency Before Jargeau on the twelfth of June although it was Sunday Joan had the trumpets sounded for the assault The Duke d Alencon thought it was too soon Ah said Joan be not doubtful it is the hour pleasing to God work ye and God will work And she added familiarly Art thou afeard gentle duke Knowest thou not that I have promised thy wife to take thee back safe and sound The assault began and Joan soon had occasion to keep her promise The Duke d Alencon was watching the assault from an exposed spot and Joan remarked a piece pointed at this spot Get you hence said she to the duke yonder is a piece which will slay you The Duke moved and a moment afterwards Sire de Lude was killed at the self same place by a shot from the said piece Jargeau was taken Before Beaugency a serious incident took place The constable De Richemont came up with a force of twelve hundred men When he was crossing to Loudun Charles VII swayed as ever by the jealous La Tremoille had word sent to him to withdraw and that if he advanced he would be attacked What I am doing in the matter said the constable is for the good of the king and the realm if anybody comes to attack me we shall see When he had joined the army before Beaugency the Duke d Alencon was much troubled The king s orders were precise and Joan herself hesitated But news came that Talbot and the English were approaching Now said Joan we must think no more of anything but helping one another She rode forward to meet the constable and saluted him courteously Joan said he I was told that you meant to attack me I know not whether you come from God or not if you are from God I fear you not at all for God knows my good will if you are from the devil I fear you still less He remained and Beaugency was taken The English army came up Sir John Falstolf had joined Talbot Some disquietude showed itself amongst the French so roughly handled for some time past in pitched battles Ah fair constable said Joan to Richemont you are not come by my orders but you are right welcome The Duke d Alencon consulted Joan as to what was to be done It will be well to have horses was suggested by those about her She asked her neighbors Have you good spurs Ha cried they must we fly then No surely replied Joan but there will be need to ride boldly we shall give a good account of the English and our spurs will serve us famously in pursuing them The battle began on the eighteenth of June at Patay between Orleans and Chateaudun By Joan s advice the French attacked In the name of God said she we must fight Though the English were suspended from the clouds we should have them for God hath sent us to punish them The gentle king shall have to day the greatest victory he has ever had my counsel hath told me they are ours The English lost heart in their turn the battle was short and the victory brilliant Lord Talbot and the most part of the English captains remained prisoners Lord Talbot said the Duke d Alencon to him this is not what you expected this morning It is the fortune of war answered Talbot with the cool dignity of an old warrior Joan s immediate return to Orleans was a triumph but even triumph has its embarrassments and perils She demanded the speedy march of the army upon Rheims that the king might be crowned there without delay but objections were raised on all sides the objections of the timid and those of the jealous By reason of Joan the Maid says a contemporary chronicler so many folks came from all parts unto the king for to serve him at their own expense that La Tremoille and others of the council were much wroth thereat through anxiety for their own persons Joan impatient and irritated at so much hesitation and intrigue took upon herself to act as if the decision belonged to her On the twenty fifth of June she wrote to the inhabitants of Tournai Loyal Frenchmen I do pray and require you to be all ready to come to the coronation of the gentle King Charles at Rheims where we shall shortly be and to come and meet us when ye shall learn that we are approaching Two days afterwards on the twenty seventh of June she left Gien where the court was and went to take up her quarters in the open country with the troops There was nothing for it but to follow her On the twenty ninth of June the king the court including La Tremoille and the army about twelve thousand strong set out on the march for Rheims Other obstacles were encountered on the road In most of the towns the inhabitants even the royalists feared to compromise themselves by openly pronouncing against the English and the Duke of Burgundy Those of Auxerre demanded a truce offering provisions and promising to do as those of Troyes Chalons and Rheims should do At Troyes the difficulty was greater still There was in it a garrison of five or six hundred English and Burgundians who had the burgesses under their thumbs All attempts at accommodation failed There was great perplexity in the royal camp there were neither provisions enough for a long stay before Troyes nor batteries and siege trains to carry it by force There was talk of turning back One of the king s councillors Robert le Macon proposed that Joan should be summoned to the council It was at her instance that the expedition had been undertaken she had great influence amongst the army and the populace the idea ought not to be given up without consulting her Whilst he was speaking Joan came knocking at the door she was told to come in and the chancellor the Archbishop of Rheims put the question to her Joan turning to the king asked him if he would believe her Speak said the king if you say what is reasonable and tends to profit readily will you be believed Gentle king of France said Joan if you be willing to abide here before your town of Troyes it shall be at your disposal within two days by love or by force make no doubt of it Joan replied the chancellor whoever could be certain of having it within six days might well wait for it but say you true Joan repeated her assertion and it was decided to wait Joan mounted her horse and with her banner in her hand she went through the camp giving orders everywhere to prepare for the assault She had her own tent pitched close to the ditch doing more says a contemporary than two of the ablest captains would have done On the next day July ten all was ready Joan had the fascines thrown into the ditches and was shouting out Assault when the inhabitants of Troyes burgesses and men at arms came demanding permission to capitulate The conditions were easy The inhabitants obtained for themselves and their property such guarantees as they desired and the strangers were allowed to go out with what belonged to them On the morrow July eleven the king entered Troyes with all his captains and at his side the Maid carrying her banner All the difficulties of the journey were surmounted On the fifteenth of July the Bishop of Chalons brought the keys of his town to the king who took up his quarters there Joan found there four or five of her own villagers who had hastened up to see the young girl of Domremy in all her glory She received them with a satisfaction in which familiarity was blended with gravity To one of them her godfather she gave a red cap which she had worn to another who had been a Burgundian she said I fear but one thing treachery In the Duke d Alencon s presence she repeated to the king Make good use of my time for I shall hardly last longer than a year On the sixteenth of July King Charles entered Rheims and the ceremony of his coronation was fixed for the morrow It was solemn and emotional as are all old national traditions which recur after a forced suspension Joan rode between Dunois and the Archbishop of Rheims chancellor of France The air resounded with the Te Deum sung with all their hearts by clergy and crowd In God s name said Joan to Dunois here is a good people and a devout when I die I should much like it to be in these parts Joan inquired Dunois know you when you will die and in what place I know not said she for I am at the will of God Then she added I have accomplished that which my Lord commanded me to raise the siege of Orleans and have the gentle king crowned I would like it well if it should please him to send me back to my father and mother to keep their sheep and their cattle and do that which was my wont When the said lords says the chronicler an eye witness heard these words of Joan who with eyes towards heaven gave thanks to God they the more believed that it was somewhat sent from God and not otherwise Historians and even contemporaries have given much discussion to the question whether Joan of Arc according to her first ideas had really limited her design to the raising of the siege of Orleans and the coronation of Charles VII at Rheims She had said so herself several times just as she had to Dunois at Rheims on the seventeenth of July fourteen twenty nine but she sometimes also spoke of more vast and varied projects as for instance driving the English completely out of France and withdrawing from his long captivity Charles Duke of Orleans He had been a prisoner in London ever since the battle of Agincourt and was popular in his day as he has continued to be in French history on the double ground of having been the father of Louis XII and one of the most charming poets in the ancient literature of France The Duke d Alencon who was so high in the regard of Joan attributed to her more expressly this quadruple design She said according to him that she had four duties to get rid of the English to have the king anointed and crowned to deliver Duke Charles of Orleans and to raise the siege laid by the English to Orleans One is inclined to believe that Joan s language to Dunois at Rheims in the hour of Charles VII s coronation more accurately expressed her first idea the two other notions occurred to her naturally in proportion as her hopes as well as her power kept growing greater with success But however lofty and daring her soul may have been she had a simple and not at all a fantastic mind She may have foreseen the complete expulsion of the English and may have desired the deliverance of the Duke of Orleans without having in the first instance premeditated anything more than she said to Dunois during the king s coronation at Rheims which was looked upon by her as the triumph of the national cause However that may be when Orleans was relieved and Charles VII crowned the situation posture and part of Joan underwent a change She no longer manifested the same confidence in herself and her designs She no longer exercised over those in whose midst she lived the same authority She continued to carry on war but at hap hazard sometimes with and sometimes without success just like La Hire and Dunois never discouraged never satisfied and never looking upon her self as triumphant After the coronation her advice was to march at once upon Paris in order to take up a fixed position in it as being the political centre of the realm of which Rheims was the religious Nothing of the sort was done Charles and La Tremoille once more began their course of hesitation tergiversation and changes of tactics and residence without doing anything of a public and decisive character They negotiated with the Duke of Burgundy in the hope of detaching him from the English cause and they even concluded with him a secret local and temporary truce From the twentieth of July to the twenty threed of August Joan followed the king whithersoever he went to Chateau Thierry to Senlis to Blois to Provins and to Compigne as devoted as ever but without having her former power She was still active but not from inspiration and to obey her voices simply to promote the royal policy She wrote the Duke of Burgundy a letter full of dignity and patriotism which had no more effect than the negotiations of La Tremoille During this fruitless labor amongst the French the Duke of Bedford sent for five thousand men from England who came and settled themselves at Paris One division of this army had a white standard in the middle of which was depicted a distaff full of cotton a half filled spindle was hanging to the distaff and the field studded with empty spindles bore this inscription Now fair one come Insult to Joan was accompanied by redoubled war against France Joan saddened and wearied by the position of things attempted to escape from it by a bold stroke On the twenty threed of August fourteen twenty nine she set out from Compiegne with the Duke d Alencon and a fair company of men at arms and suddenly went and occupied saint Denis with the view of attacking Paris Charles VII felt himself obliged to quit Compiegne likewise and went greatly against the grain says a contemporary chronicler as far as into the town of Senlis The attack on Paris began vigorously Joan with the Duke d Alencon pitched her camp at La Chapelle Charles took up his abode in the abbey of saint Denis The municipal corporation of Paris received letters with the arms of the Duke d Alencon which called upon them to recognize the king s authority and promised a general amnesty The assault was delivered on the eighth of September Joan was severely wounded but she insisted upon remaining where she was Night came and the troops had not entered the breach which had been opened in the morning Joan was still calling out to persevere The Duke d Alencon himself begged her but in vain to retire La Tremoille gave orders to retreat and some knights came up set Joan on horse back and led her back against her will to La Chapelle By my martin staff of command said she the place would have been taken One hope still remained In concert with the Duke d Alencon she had caused a flying bridge to be thrown across the Seine opposite saint Denis The next day but one she sent her vanguard in this direction she intended to return thereby to the siege but by the king s order the bridge had been cut adrift saint Denis fell once more into the hands of the English Before leaving Joan left there on the tomb of saint Denis her complete suit of armor and a sword she had lately obtained possession of at the saint Honore gate of Paris as trophy of war From the thirteenth of September fourteen twenty nine to the twenty fourth of May fourteen thirty she continued to lead the same life of efforts ever equally valiant and equally ineffectual She failed in an attempt upon Laemir Charite sur Loire undertaken for all that appears with the sole design of recovering an important town in the possession of the enemy The English evacuated Paris and left the keeping of it to the Duke of Burgundy no doubt to test his fidelity On the thirteenth of Aprils fourteen thirty at the expiration of the truce he had concluded Philip the Good resumed hostilities against Charles VII Joan of Arc once more plunged into them with her wonted zeal Ile de France and Picardy became the theatre of war Compiegne was regarded as the gate of the road between these two provinces and the Duke of Burgundy attached much importance to holding the key of it The authority of Charles VII was recognized there and a young knight of Compiegne William de Flavy held the command there as lieutenant of La Tremoille who had got himself appointed captain of the town La Tremoille attempted to treat with the Duke of Burgundy for the cession of Compiegne but the inhabitants were strenuously opposed to it They were they said the king s most humble subjects and they desired to serve him with body and substance but as for trusting themselves to the lord Duke of Burgundy they could not do it they were resolved to suffer destruction themselves and their wives and children rather than be exposed to the tender mercies of the said duke Meanwhile Joan of Arc after several warlike expeditions in the neighborhood re entered Compiegne and was received there with a popular expression of satisfaction She was presented says a local chronicler with three hogsheads of wine a present which was large and exceeding costly and which showed the estimate formed of this maiden s worth Joan manifested the profound distrust with which she was inspired of the Duke of Burgundy There is no peace possible with him she said save at the point of the lance She had quarters at the house of the king s attorney Le Boucher and shared the bed of his wife Mary She often made the said Mary rise from her bed to go and warn the said attorney to be on his guard against several acts of Burgundian treachery At this period again she said she was often warned by her voices of what must happen to her she expected to be taken prisoner before saint John s or Midsummer day June twenty four on what day and hour she did not know she had received no instructions as to sorties from the place but she had constantly been told that she would be taken and she was distrustful of the captains who were in command there She was nevertheless not the less bold and enterprising On the twentieth of May fourteen thirty the Duke of Burgundy came and laid siege to Compiegne Joan was away on an expedition to Crepy in Valois with a small band of three or four hundred brave comrades On the twenty fourth of May the eve of Ascension day she learned that Compiegne was being besieged and she resolved to re enter it She was reminded that her force was a very weak one to cut its way through the besiegers camp By my martin said she we are enough I will go see my friends in Compiegne She arrived about daybreak without hinderance and penetrated into the town and repaired immediately to the parish church of saint Jacques to perform her devotions on the eve of so great a festival Many persons attracted by her presence and amongst others from a hundred to six score children thronged to the church After hearing mass and herself taking the communion Joan said to those who surrounded her My children and dear friends I notify you that I am sold and betrayed and that I shall shortly be delivered over to death I beseech you pray God for me When evening came she was not the less eager to take part in a sortie with her usual comrades and a troop of about five hundred men William de Flavy commandant of the place got ready some boats on the Oise to assist the return of the troops All the town gates were closed save the bridge gate The sortie was unsuccessful Being severely repulsed and all but hemmed in the majority of the soldiers shouted to Joan Try to quickly regain the town or we are lost Silence said Joan it only rests with you to throw the enemy into confusion think only of striking at them Her words and her bravery were in vain the infantry flung themselves into the boats and regained the town and Joan and her brave comrades covered their retreat The Burgundians were coming up in mass upon Compiegne and Flavy gave orders to pull up the draw bridge and let down the portcullis Joan and some of her following lingered outside still fighting She wore a rich surcoat and a red sash and all the efforts of the Burgundians were directed against her Twenty men thronged round her horse and a Picard archer a tough fellow and mighty sour seized her by her dress and flung her on the ground All at once called on her to surrender Yield you to me said one of them pledge your faith to me I am a gentleman It was an archer of the bastard of Wandonne one of the lieutenants of John of Luxembourg Count of Ligny I have pledged my faith to one other than you said Joan and to Him I will keep my oath The archer took her and conducted her to Count John whose prisoner she became Was she betrayed and delivered up as she had predicted Did William de Flavy purposely have the drawbridge raised and the portcullis lowered before she could get back into Compiegne He was suspected of it at the time and many historians have indorsed the suspicion But there is nothing to prove it That La Tremoille prime minister of Charles VII and Reginald de Chartres Archbishop of Rheims had an antipathy to Joan of Arc and did all they could on every occasion to compromise her and destroy her influence and that they were glad to see her a prisoner is as certain as anything can be On announcing her capture to the inhabitants of Rheims the arch bishop said She would not listen to counsel and did everything according to her pleasure But there is a long distance between such expressions and a premeditated plot to deliver to the enemy the young heroine who had just raised the siege of Orleans and brought the king to be crowned at Rheims History must not without proof impute crimes so odious and so shameful to even the most depraved of men However that may be Joan remained for six months the prisoner of John of Luxembourg who to make his possession of her secure sent her under good escort successively to his two castles of Beaulieu and Beaurevoir one in the Vermandois and the other in the Cambresis Twice in July and in October fourteen thirty Joan attempted unsuccessfully to escape The second time she carried despair and hardihood so far as to throw herself down from the platform of her prison She was picked up cruelly bruised but without any fracture or wound of importance Her fame her youth her virtue her courage made her even in her prison and in the very family of her custodian two warm and powerful friends John of Luxembourg had with him his wife Joan of Bethune and his aunt Joan of Luxembourg godmother of Charles VII They both of them took a tender interest in the prisoner and they often went to see her and left nothing undone to mitigate the annoyances of a prison One thing only shocked them about her her man s clothes They offered her as Joan herself said when questioned upon this subject at a later period during her trial a woman s dress or stuff to make it to her liking and requested her to wear it but she answered that she had not leave from our Lord and that it was not yet time for it John of Luxembourg s aunt was full of years and reverenced as a saint Hearing that the English were tempting her nephew by the offer of a sum of money to give up his prisoner to them she conjured him in her will dated September ten fourteen thirty not to sully by such an act the honor of his name But Count John was neither rich nor scrupulous and pretexts were not wanting to aid his cupidity and his weakness Joan had been taken at Compiegne on the twenty threed of May in the evening and the news arrived in Paris on the twenty fifth of May in the morning On the morrow the twenty sixth the registrar of the University in the name and under the seal of the inquisition of France wrote a citation to the Duke of Burgundy to the end that the Maid should be delivered up to appear before the said inquisitor and to respond to the good counsel favor and aid of the good doctors and masters of the University of Paris Peter Cauchon Bishop of Beauvais had been the prime mover in this step Some weeks later on the fourteenth of July seeing that no reply arrived from the Duke of Burgundy he caused a renewal of the same demands to be made on the part of the University in more urgent terms and he added in his own name that Joan having been taken at Compiegne in his own diocese belonged to him as judge spiritual He further asserted that according to the law usage and custom of France every prisoner of war even were it king dauphin or other prince might be redeemed in the name of the King of England in consideration of an indemnity of ten thousand livres granted to the capturer Nothing was more opposed to the common law of nations and to the feudal spirit often grasping but noble at bottom For four months still John of Luxembourg hesitated but his aunt Joan died at Boulogne on the thirteenth of November and Joan of Arc had no longer near him this powerful intercessor The King of England transmitted to the keeping of his coffers at Rouen in golden coin English money the sum of ten thousand livres John of Luxembourg yielded to the temptation On the twenty first of November fourteen thirty Joan of Arc was handed over to the King of England and the same day the University of Paris through its rector Hebert besought that sovereign as King of France to order that this woman be brought to their city for to be shortly placed in the hands of the justice of the Church that is of our honored lord the Bishop and Count of Beauvais and also of the ordained inquisitor in France in order that her trial may be conducted officially and securely It was not to Paris but to Rouen the real capital of the English in France that Joan was taken She arrived there on the twenty threed of December fourteen thirty On the threed of January fourteen thirty one an order from Henry VI King of England placed her in the hands of the Bishop of Beauvais Peter Cauchon Some days afterwards Count John of Luxembourg accompanied by his brother the English chancellor by his esquire and by two English lords Richard Beauchamp Earl of Warwick and Humphrey Earl of Stafford the King of England s constable in France entered the prison Had John of Luxembourg come out of sheer curiosity or to relieve himself of certain scruples by offering Joan a chance for her life Joan said he I am come hither to put you to ransom and to treat for the price of your deliverance only give us your promise here to no more bear arms against us In God s name answered Joan are you making a mock of me captain Ransom me You have neither the will nor the power no you have neither The count persisted I know well said Joan that these English will put me to death but were they a hundred thousand more Goddams than have already been in France they shall never have the kingdom At this patriotic burst on the heroine s part the Earl of Stafford half drew his dagger from the sheath as if to strike Joan but the Earl of Warwick held him back The visitors went out from the prison and handed over Joan to the judges The court of Rouen was promptly formed but not without opposition and difficulty Though Joan had lost somewhat of her greatness and importance by going beyond her main object and by showing recklessness unattended by success on small occasions she still remained the true heroic representative of the feelings and wishes of the nation When she was removed from Beaurevoir to Rouen all the places at which she stopped were like so many luminous points for the illustration of her popularity At Arras a Scot showed her a portrait of her which he wore an outward sign of the devoted worship of her lieges At Amiens the chancellor of the cathedral gave her audience at confession and administered to her the eucharist At Abbeville ladies of distinction went five leagues to pay her a visit they were glad to have had the happiness of seeing her so firm and resigned to the will of Our Lord they wished her all the favors of heaven and then wept affectionately on taking leave of her Joan touched by their sympathy and open heartedness said Ah what a good people is this Would to God I might be so happy when my days are ended as to be buried in these parts When the Bishop of Beauvais installed at Rouen set about forming his court of justice the majority of the members he appointed amongst the clergy or the University of Paris obeyed the summons without hesitation Some few would have refused but their wishes were overruled The Abbot of Jumieges Nicholas de Houppeville maintained that the trial was not legal The Bishop of Beauvais he said belonged to the party which declared itself hostile to the Maid and besides he made himself judge in a case already decided by his metropolitan the Archbishop of Rheims of whom Beauvais was holden and who had approved of Joan s conduct The bishop summoned before him the recalcitrant who refused to appear saying that he was under no official jurisdiction but that of Rouen He was arrested and thrown into prison by order of the bishop whose authority he denied There was some talk of banishing him and even of throwing him into the river but the influence of his brethren saved him The sub inquisitor himself allowed the trial in which he was to be one of the judges to begin without him and he only put in an appearance at the express order of the inquisitor general and on a confidential hint that he would be in danger of his life if he persisted in his refusal The court being thus constituted Joan after it had been put in possession of the evidence already collected was cited on the twentieth of February fourteen thirty one to appear on the morrow the twenty first before her judges assembled in the chapel of Rouen Castle The trial lasted from the twenty first of February to the thirtieth of May fourteen thirty one The court held forty sittings mostly in the chapel of the castle some in Joan s very prison On her arrival there she had been put in an iron cage afterwards she was kept no longer in the cage but in a dark room in a tower of the castle wearing irons upon her feet fastened by a chain to a large piece of wood and guarded night and day by four or five soldiers of low grade She complained of being thus chained but the bishop told her that her former attempts at escape demanded this precaution It is true said Joan as truthful as heroic I did wish and I still wish to escape from prison as is the right of every prisoner At her examination the bishop required her to take an oath to tell the truth about everything as to which she should be questioned I know not what you mean to question me about perchance you may ask me things I would not tell you touching my revelations for instance you might ask me to tell something I have sworn not to tell thus I should be perjured which you ought not to desire The bishop insisted upon an oath absolute and with out condition You are too hard on me said Joan I do not like to take an oath to tell the truth save as to matters which concern the faith The bishop called upon her to swear on pain of being held guilty of the things imputed to her Illustration Joan examined in Prison one hundred twenty eight Go on to something else said she And this was the answer she made to all questions which seemed to her to be a violation of her right to be silent Wearied and hurt at these imperious demands she one day said I come on God s business and I have nought to do here send me back to God from whom I come Are you sure you are in God s grace asked the bishop If I be not answered Joan please God to bring me to it and if I be please God to keep me in it The bishop himself remained dumbfounded There is no object in following through all its sittings and all its twistings this odious and shameful trial in which the judges prejudiced servility and scientific subtlety were employed for three months to wear out the courage or overreach the understanding of a young girl of nineteen who refused at one time to lie and at another to enter into discussion with them and made no defence beyond holding her tongue or appealing to God who had spoken to her and dictated to her that which she had done In order to force her from her silence or bring her to submit to the Church instead of appealing from it to God it was proposed to employ the last means of all torture On the ninth of May the bishop had Joan brought into the great tower of Rouen Castle the instruments of torture were displayed before her eyes and the executioners were ready to fulfil their office for to bring her back said the bishop into the ways of truth in order to insure the salvation of her soul and body so gravely endangered by erroneous inventions Verily answered Joan if you should have to tear me limb from limb and separate soul from body I should not tell you aught else and if I were to tell you aught else I should afterwards still tell you that you had made me tell it by force The idea of torture was given up It was resolved to display all the armory of science in order to subdue the mind of this young girl whose conscience was not to be subjugated The chapter of Rouen declared that in consequence of her public refusal to submit herself to the decision of the Church as to her deeds and her statements Joan deserved to be declared a heretic The University of Paris to which had been handed in the twelve heads of accusation resulting from Joan s statements and examinations replied that if having been charitably admonished she would not make reparation and return to union with the Catholic faith she must be left to the secular judges to undergo punishment for her crime Armed with these documents the Bishop of Beauvais had Joan brought up on the twenty threed of May in a hall adjoining her prison and after having addressed to her a long exhortation Joan said he if in the dominions of your king when you were at large in them a knight or any other born under his rule and allegiance to him had risen up saying I will not obey the king or submit to his officers would you not have said that he ought to be condemned What then will you say of yourself you who were born in the faith of Christ and became by baptism a daughter of the Church and spouse of Jesus Christ if you obey not the officers of Christ that is the prelates of the Church Joan listened modestly to this admonition and confined herself to answering As to my deeds and sayings what I said of them at the trial I do hold to and mean to abide by Think you that you are not bound to submit your sayings and deeds to the Church militant or to any other than God The course that I always mentioned and pursued at the trial I mean to maintain as to that If I were at the stake and saw the torch lighted and the executioner ready to set fire to the fagots even if I were in the midst of the flames I should not say aught else and I should uphold that which I said at the trial even unto death According to the laws ideas and practices of the time the legal question was decided Joan declared heretic and rebellious by the Church was liable to have sentence pronounced against her but she had persisted in her statements she had shown no submission Although she appeared to be quite forgotten and was quite neglected by the king whose coronation she had effected by his councillors and even by the brave warriors at whose side she had fought the public exhibited a lively interest in her accounts of the scenes which took place at her trial were inquired after with curiosity Amongst the very judges who prosecuted her many were troubled in spirit and wished that Joan by an abjuration of her statements would herself put them at ease and relieve them from pronouncing against her the most severe penalty What means were employed to arrive at this end Did she really and with full knowledge of what she was about come round to the adjuration which there was so much anxiety to obtain from her It is difficult to solve this historical problem with exactness and certainty More than once during the examinations and the conversations which took place at that time between Joan and her judges she maintained her firm posture and her first statements One of those who were exhorting her to yield said to her one day Thy king is a heretic and a schismatic Joan could not brook this insult to her king By my faith said she full well dare I both say and swear that he is the noblest Christian of all Christians and the truest lover of the faith and the Church Make her hold her tongue said the usher to the preacher who was disconcerted at having provoked such language Another day when Joan was being urged to submit to the Church brother Isambard de la Pierre a Dominican who was interested in her spoke to her about the council at the same time explaining to her its province in the church It was the very time when that of Bale had been convoked Ah said Joan I would fain surrender and submit myself to the council of Bale The Bishop of Beauvais trembled at the idea of this appeal Hold your tongue in the devil s name said he to the monk Another of the judges William Erard asked Joan menacingly Will you abjure those reprobate words and deeds of yours I leave it to the universal Church whether I ought to abjure or not That is not enough you shall abjure at once or you shall burn Joan shuddered I would rather sign than burn she said There was put before her a form of abjuration whereby disavowing her revelations and visions from heaven she confessed her errors in matters of faith and renounced them humbly At the bottom of the document she made the mark of a cross Doubts have arisen as to the genuineness of this long and diffuse deed in the form in which it has been published in the trial papers Twenty four years later in fourteen fifty five during the trial undertaken for the rehabilitation of Joan several of those who had been present at the trial at which she was condemned amongst others the usher Massieu and the registrar Taquel declared that the form of abjuration read out at that time to Joan and signed by her contained only seven or eight lines of big writing and according to another witness of the scene it was an Englishman John Calot secretary of Henry VI King of England who as soon as Joan had yielded drew from his sleeve a little paper which he gave to her to sign and dissatisfied with the mark she had made held her hand and guided it so that she might put down her name every letter However that may be as soon as Joan s abjuration had thus been obtained the court issued on the twenty fourth of May fourteen thirty one a definitive decree whereby after some long and severe strictures in the preamble it condemned Joan to perpetual imprisonment with the bread of affliction and the water of affliction in order that she might deplore the errors and faults she had committed and relapse into them no more henceforth The Church might be satisfied but the King of England his councillors and his officers were not It was Joan living even though a prisoner that they feared They were animated towards her by the two ruthless passions of vengeance and fear When it was known that she would escape with her life murmurs broke out amongst the crowd of enemies present at the trial Stones were thrown at the judges One of the Cardinal of Winchester s chaplains who happened to be close to the Bishop of Beauvais called him traitor You lie said the bishop And the bishop was right the chaplain did lie the bishop had no intention of betraying his masters The Earl of Warwick complained to him of the inadequacy of the sentence Never you mind my lord said one of Peter Cauchon s confidants we will have her up again After the passing of her sentence Joan had said to those about her Come now you churchmen amongst you lead me off to your own prisons and let me be no more in the hands of the English Lead her to where you took her said the bishop and she was conducted to the castle prison She had been told by some of the judges who went to see her after her sentence that she would have to give up her man s dress and resume her woman s clothing as the Church ordained She was rejoiced thereat forthwith accordingly resumed her woman s clothes and had her hair properly cut which up to that time she used to wear clipped round like a man s When she was taken back to prison the man s dress which she had worn was put in a sack in the same room in which she was confined and she remained in custody at the said place in the hands of five Englishmen of whom three staid by night in the room and two outside at the door And he who speaks John Massieu a priest the same who in fourteen thirty one had been present as usher of the court at the trial in which Joan was condemned knows for certain that at night she had her legs ironed in such sort that she could not stir from the spot When the next Sunday morning which was Trinity Sunday had come and she should have got up according to what she herself told to him who speaks she said to her English guards Uniron me I will get up Then one of then took away her woman s clothes they emptied the sack in which was her man s dress and pitched the said dress to her saying Get up then and they put her woman s clothes in the same sack And according to what she told me she only clad herself in her man s dress after saying You know it is forbidden me I certainly will not take it Nevertheless they would not allow her any other insomuch that the dispute lasted to the hour of noon Finally from corporeal necessity Joan was constrained to get up and take the dress The official documents drawn up during the condemnation trial contain quite a different account On the twenty eighth of May it is there said eight of the judges who had taken part in the sentence their names are given in the document t i p four hundred fifty four betook themselves to Joan s prison and seeing her clad in man s dress which she had but just given up according to our order that she should resume woman s clothes we asked her when and for what cause she had resumed this dress and who had prevailed on her to do so Joan answered that it was of her own will without any constraint from any one and because she preferred that dress to woman s clothes To our question as to why she had made this change she answered that being surrounded by men man s dress was more suitable for her than woman s She also said that she had resumed it because there had been made to her but not kept a promise that she should go to mass receive the body of Christ and be set free from her fetters She added that if this promise were kept she would be good and would do what was the will of the Church As we had heard some persons say that she persisted in her errors as to the pretended revelations which she had but lately renounced we asked whether she had since Thursday last heard the voices of saint Catherine and saint Margaret and she answered Yes To our question as to what the saints had said she answered that God had testified to her by their voices great pity for the great treason she had committed in abjuring for the sake of saving her life and that by so doing she had damned herself She said that all she had thus done last Thursday in abjuring her visions and revelations she had done through fear of the stake and that all her abjuration was contrary to the truth She added that she did not herself comprehend what was contained in the form of abjuration she had been made to sign and that she would rather do penance once for all by dying to maintain the truth than remain any longer a prisoner being all the while a traitress to it We will not stop to examine whether these two accounts though very different are not fundamentally reconcilable and whether Joan resumed man s dress of her own desire or was constrained to do so by the soldiers on guard over her and perhaps to escape from their insults The important points in the incident are the burst of remorse which Joan felt for her weakness and her striking retractation of the abjuration which had been wrung from her So soon as the news was noised abroad her enemies cried She has relapsed This was exactly what they had hoped for when on learning that she had been sentenced only to perpetual imprisonment they had said Never you mind we will have her up again Farewell farewell my lord said the Bishop of Beauvais to the Earl of Warwick whom he met shortly after Joan s retractation and in his words there was plainly an expression of satisfaction and not a mere phrase of politeness On the twenty ninth of May the tribunal met again Forty judges took part in the deliberation Joan was unanimously declared a case of relapse was found guilty and cited to appear next day the thirtieth on the Vieux Marche to hear sentence pronounced and then undergo the punishment of the stake When on the thirtieth of May in the morning the Dominican brother Martin Ladvenu was charged to announce her sentence to Joan she gave way at first to grief and terror Alas she cried am I to be so horribly and cruelly treated that this my body full pure and perfect and never defiled must to day be consumed and reduced to ashes Ah I would seven times rather be beheaded than burned The Bishop of Beauvais at this moment came up Bishop said Joan you are the cause of my death if you had put me in the prisons of the Church and in the hands of fit and proper ecclesiastical warders this had never happened I appeal from you to the presence of God One of the doctors who had sat in judgment upon her Peter Maurice went to see her and spoke to her with sympathy Master Peter said she to him where shall I be to night Have you not good hope in God asked the doctor O yes she answered by the grace of God I shall be in paradise Being left alone with the Dominican Martin Ladvenu she confessed and asked to communicate The monk applied to the Bishop of Beauvais to know what he was to do Tell brother Martin was the answer to give her the eucharist and all she asks for At nine o clock having resumed her woman s dress Joan was dragged from prison and driven to the Vieux Marche From seven to eight hundred soldiers escorted the car and prohibited all approach to it on the part of the crowd which encumbered the road and the vicinities but a man forced a passage and flung himself towards Joan It was a canon of Rouen Nicholas Loiseleur whom the Bishop of Beauvais had placed near her and who had abused the confidence she had shown him Beside himself with despair he wished to ask pardon of her but the English soldiers drove him back with violence and with the epithet of traitor and but for the intervention of the Earl of Warwick his life would have been in danger Joan wept and prayed and the crowd afar off wept and prayed with her On arriving at the place she listened in silence to a sermon by one of the doctors of the court who ended by saying Joan go in peace the Church can no longer defend thee she gives thee over to the secular arm The laic judges Raoul Bouteillier baillie of Rouen and his lieutenant Peter Daron were alone qualified to pronounce sentence of death but no time was given them The priest Massieu was still continuing his exhortations to Joan but How now priest was the cry from amidst the soldiery are you going to make us dine here Away with her Away with her said the baillie to the guards and to the executioner Do thy duty When she came to the stake Joan knelt down completely absorbed in prayer She had begged Massieu to get her a cross and an Englishman present made one out of a little stick and handed it to the French heroine who took it kissed it and laid it on her breast She begged brother Isambard de la Pierre to go and fetch the cross from the church of saint Sauveur the chief door of which opened on the Vieux Marche and to hold it upright before her eyes till the coming of death in order she said that the cross whereon God hung might as long as she lived be continually in her sight and her wishes were fulfilled She wept over her country and the spectators as well as over herself Rouen Rouen she cried is it here that I must die Shalt thou be my last resting place I fear greatly thou wilt have to suffer for my death It is said that the aged Cardinal of Winchester and the Bishop of Beauvais himself could not stifle their emotion and peradventure their tears The executioner set fire to the fagots When Joan perceived the flames rising she urged her confessor the Dominican brother Martin Ladvenu to go down at the same time asking him to keep holding the cross up high in front of her that she might never cease to see it The same monk when questioned four and twenty years later at the rehabilitation trial as to the last sentiments and the last words of Joan said that to the very latest moment she had affirmed that her voices were heavenly that they had not deluded her and that the revelations she had received came from God When she had ceased to live two of her judges John Alespie canon of Rouen and Peter Maurice doctor of theology cried out Would that my soul were where I believe the soul of that woman is And Tressart secretary to King Henry VI said sorrowfully on returning from the place of execution We are all lost we have burned a saint A saint indeed in faith and in destiny Never was human creature more heroically confident in and devoted to inspiration coming from God a commission received from God Joan of Arc sought nothing of all that happened to her and of all she did nor exploit nor power nor glory It was not her condition as she used to say to be a warrior to get her king crowned and to deliver her country from the foreigner Everything came to her from on high and she accepted everything without hesitation without discussion without calculation as we should say in our times She believed in God and obeyed Him God was not to her an idea a hope a flash of human imagination or a problem of human science He was the Creator of the world the Saviour of mankind through Jesus Christ the Being of beings ever present ever in action sole legitimate sovereign of man whom He has made intelligent and free the real and true God whom we are painfully searching for in our own day and whom we shall never find again until we cease pretending to do without Him and putting ourselves in His place Meanwhile one fact may be mentioned which does honor to our epoch and gives us hope for our future Four centuries have rolled by since Joan of Arc that modest and heroic servant of God made a sacrifice of herself for France For four and twenty years after her death France and the king appeared to think no more of her However in fourteen fifty five remorse came upon Charles VII and upon France Nearly all the provinces all the towns were freed from the foreigner and shame was felt that nothing was said nothing done for the young girl who had saved everything At Rouen especially where the sacrifice was completed a cry for reparation arose It was timidly demanded from the spiritual power which had sentenced and delivered over Joan as a heretic to the stake Pope Calixtus III entertained the request preferred not by the King of France but in the name of Isabel Romee Joan s mother and her whole family Regular proceedings were commenced and followed up for the rehabilitation of the martyr and on the seventh of July fourteen fifty six a decree of the court assembled at Rouen quashed the sentence of fourteen thirty one together with all its consequences and ordered a general procession and solemn sermon at saint Ouen Place and the Vieux Marche where the said maid had been cruelly and horribly burned besides the planting of a cross of honor crucis honestee on the Vieux Marche the judges reserving the official notice to be given of their decision throughout the cities and notable places of the realm The city of Orleans responded to this appeal by raising on the bridge over the Loire a group in bronze representing Joan of Arc on her knees before Our Lady between two angels This monument which was broken during the religious wars of the sixteenth century and repaired shortly afterwards was removed in the eighteenth century and Joan of Arc then received a fresh insult the poetry of a cynic was devoted to the task of diverting a licentious public at the expense of the saint whom three centuries before fanatical hatred had brought to the stake In seventeen ninety two the council of the commune of Orleans considering that the monument in bronze did not represent the heroine s services and did not by any sign call to mind the struggle against the English ordered it to be melted down and cast into cannons of which one should bear the name of Joan of Arc It is in our time that the city of Orleans and its distinguished bishop Mgr Dupanloup have at last paid Joan homage worthy of her not only by erecting to her a new statue but by recalling her again to the memory of France with her true features and in her grand character Neither French nor any other history offers a like example of a modest little soul with a faith so pure and efficacious resting on divine inspiration and patriotic hope During the trial of Joan of Arc the war between France and England without being discontinued had been somewhat slack the curiosity and the passions of men were concentrated upon the scenes at Rouen After the execution of Joan the war resumed its course though without any great events By way of a step towards solution the Duke of Bedford in November fourteen thirty one escorted to Paris King Henry VI scarcely ten years old and had him crowned at Notre Dame The ceremony was distinguished for pomp but not for warmth The Duke of Burgundy was not present it was an Englishman the Cardinal bishop of Winchester who anointed the young Englander King of France the Bishop of Paris complained of it as a violation of his rights the parliament the university and the municipal body had not even seats reserved at the royal banquet Paris was melancholy and day by day more deserted by the native inhabitants grass was growing in the court yards of the great mansions the students were leaving the great school of Paris to which the Duke of Bedford at Caen and Charles VII himself at Poitiers were attempting to raise up rivals and silence reigned in the Latin quarter The child king was considered unintelligent and ungraceful and ungracious When on the day after Christmas he started on his way back to Rouen and from Rouen to England he did not confer on Paris any of the boons expected either by releasing prisoners or by putting an end to black mails gabels and wicked imposts The burgesses were astonished and grumbled and the old queen Isabel of Bavaria who was still living at the hostel of saint Paul wept it is said for vexation at seeing from one of her windows her grandson s royal procession go by Though war was going on all the while attempts were made to negotiate and in March fourteen thirty three a conference was opened at Seineport near Corbeil Everybody in France desired peace Philip the Good himself began to feel the necessity of it Burgundy was almost as discontented and troubled as Ile de France There was grumbling at Dijon as there was conspiracy at Paris The English gave fresh cause for national irritation They showed an inclination to canton themselves in Normandy and abandon the other French provinces to the hazards and sufferings of a desultory war Anne of Burgundy the Duke of Bedford s wife and Philip the Good s sister died The English duke speedily married again without even giving any notice to the French prince Every family tie between the two persons was broken and the negotiations as well as the war remained without result An incident at court caused a change in the situation and gave the government of Charles a different character His favorite George de la Tremoille had become almost as unpopular amongst the royal family as in the country in general He could not manage a war and he frustrated attempts at peace The Queen of Sicily Yolande d Aragon her daughter Mary d Anjou Queen of France and her son Louis Count of Maine who all three desired peace set themselves to work to overthrow the favorite In June fourteen thirty three four young lords one of whom Sire de Beuil was La Tremoille s own nephew introduced themselves unexpectedly into his room at the castle of Coudray near Chinon where Charles VII was La Tremoille showed an intention of resisting and received a sword thrust He was made to resign all his offices and was sent under strict guard to the castle of Alontresor the property of his nephew Sire de Beuil The conspirators had concerted measures with La Tremoille s rival the constable De Richemont Arthur of Brittany a man distinguished in war who had lately gone to help Joan of Arc and who was known to be a friend of peace at the same time that he was firmly devoted to the national cause He was called away from his castle of Parthenay and set at the head of the government as well as of the army Charles VII at first showed anger at his favorite s downfall He asked if Richemont was present and was told no where upon he seemed to grow calmer Before long he did more he became resigned and continuing all the while to give La Tremoille occasional proofs of his former favor he fully accepted De Richemont s influence and the new direction which the constable imposed upon his government War was continued nearly everywhere with alternations of success and reverse which deprived none of the parties of hope without giving victory to any Peace however was more and more the general desire Scarcely had one attempt at pacification failed when another was begun The constable De Richemont s return to power led to fresh overtures He was a states man as well as a warrior and his inclinations were known at Dijon and London as well as at Chinon The advisers of King Henry VI proposed to open a conference on the fifteenth of October fourteen thirty three at Calais They had they said a prisoner in England confined there ever since the battle of Agincourt Duke Charles of Orleans who was sincerely desirous of peace in spite of his family enmity towards the Duke of Burgundy He was considered a very proper person to promote the negotiations although he sought in poetry which was destined to bring lustre to his name a refuge from politics which made his life a burden He one day meeting the Duke of Burgundy s two ambassadors at the Earl of Suffolk s Henry VI s prime minister went up to them affectionately took their hands and when they inquired after his health said My body is well my soul is sick I am dying with vexation at passing my best days a prisoner without any one to think of me The ambassadors said that people would be indebted to him for the benefit of peace for he was known to be laboring for it My Lord of Suffolk said he can tell you that I never cease to urge it upon the king and his council but I am as useless here as the sword never drawn from the scabbard I must see my relatives and friends in France they will not treat surely without having consulted with me If peace depended upon me though I were doomed to die seven days after swearing it that would cause me no regret however what matters it what I say I am not master in anything at all next to the two kings it is the Duke of Burgundy and the Duke of Brittany who have most power Will you not come and call upon me he added pressing the hand of one of the ambassadors They will see you before they go said the Earl of Suffolk in a tone which made it plain that no private conversation would be permitted between them And indeed the Earl of Suffolk s barber went alone to wait upon the ambassadors in order to tell them that if the Duke of Burgundy desired it the Duke of Orleans would write to him I will undertake he added to bring you his letter There was evident mistrust and it was explained to the Burgundian ambassadors by the Earl of Warwick s remark Your duke never once came to see our king during his stay in France The Duke of Bedford used similar language to them Why said he does my brother the Duke of Burgundy give way to evil imaginings against me There is not a prince in the world after my king whom I esteem so much The ill will which seems to exist between us spoils the king s affairs and his own too But tell him that I am not the less disposed to serve him In March fourteen thirty five the Duke of Burgundy went to Paris taking with him his third wife Isabel of Portugal and a magnificent following There were seen moreover in his train a hundred wagons laden with artillery armor salted provisions cheeses and wines of Burgundy There was once more joy in Paris and the duke received the most affectionate welcome The university was represented before him and made him a great speech on the necessity of peace Two days afterwards a deputation from the city dames of Paris waited upon the Duchess of Burgundy and implored her to use her influence for the re establishment of peace She answered My good friends it is the thing I desire most of all in the world I pray for it night and day to the Lord our God for I believe that we all have great need of it and I know for certain that my lord and husband has the greatest willingness to give up to that purpose his person and his substance At the bottom of his soul Duke Philip s decision was already taken He had but lately discussed the condition of France with the constable De Richemont and Duke Charles of Bourbon his brother in law whom he had summoned to Nevers with that design Being convinced of the necessity for peace he spoke of it to the King of England s advisers whom he found in Paris and who dared not show absolute opposition to it It was agreed that in the month of July a general and more properly speaking a European conference should meet at Arras that the legates of Pope Eugenius IV should be invited to it and that consultation should be held thereat as to the means of putting an end to the sufferings of the two kingdoms Towards the end of July accordingly whilst the war was being prosecuted with redoubled ardor on both sides at the very gates of Paris there arrived at Arras the pope s legates and the ambassadors of the Emperor Sigismund of the Kings of Castile Aragon Portugal Naples Sicily Cyprus Poland and Denmark and of the Dukes of Brittany and Milan The university of Paris and many of the good towns of France Flanders and even Holland had sent their deputies thither Many bishops were there in person The Bishop of Liege came thither with a magnificent train mounted says the chroniclers on two hundred white horses The Duke of Burgundy made his entrance on the thirtieth of July escorted by three hundred archers wearing his livery All the lords who happened to be in the city went to meet him at a league s distance except the cardinal legates of the pope who confined themselves to sending their people Two days afterwards arrived the ambassadors of the King of France having at their head the Duke of Bourbon and the constable De Richemont together with several of the greatest French lords and a retinue of four or five hundred persons Duke Philip forewarned of their coming issued from the city with all the princes and lords who happened to be there The English alone refused to accompany him wondering at his showing such great honor to the ambassadors of their common enemy Philip went forward a mile to meet his two brothers in law the Duke of Bourbon and the Count de Richemont embraced them affectionately and turned back with them into Arras amidst the joy and acclamations of the populace Last of all arrived the Duchess of Burgundy magnificently dressed and bringing with her her young son the Count of Charolais who was hereafter to be Charles the Rash The Duke of Bourbon the constable De Richemont and all the lords were on horseback around her litter but the English who had gone like the others to meet her were unwilling on turning back to Arras to form a part of her retinue with the French Grand as was the sight it was not superior in grandeur to the event on the eve of accomplishment The question was whether France should remain a great nation in full possession of itself and of its independence under a French king or whether the King of England should in London and with the title of King of France have France in his possession and under his government Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy was called upon to solve this problem of the future that is to say to decide upon the fate of his lineage and his country Illustration Philip the Good of Burgundy one hundred forty four As soon as the conference was opened and no matter what attempts were made to veil or adjourn the question it was put nakedly The English instead of peace began by proposing a long truce and the marriage of Henry VI with a daughter of King Charles The French ambassadors refused absolutely to negotiate on this basis they desired a definitive peace and their conditions were that the King and people of England making an end of this situation so full of clanger for the whole royal house and of suffering for the people Nevertheless the duke showed strong scruples The treaties he had sworn to the promises he had made threw him into a constant fever of anxiety he would not have any one able to say that he had in any respect forfeited his honor He asked for three consultations one with the Italian doctors connected with the pope s legates another with English doctors and another with French doctors He was granted all three though they were more calculated to furnish him with arguments each on their own side than to dissipate his doubts if he had any real ones The legates ended by solemnly saying to him We do conjure you by the bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ and by the authority of our holy father the pope of the holy council assembled at Bale and of the universal Church to renounce that spirit of vengeance whereby you are moved against King Charles in memory of the late Duke John your father nothing can render you more pleasing in the eyes of God or further augment your fame in this world For three days Duke Philip remained still undecided but he heard that the Duke of Bedford regent of France on behalf of the English who was his brother in law had just died at Rouen on the fourteenth of September He was besides the late King of England Henry V the only English man who had received promises from the duke and who lived in intimacy with him Ten days afterwards on the twenty first of September the queen Isabel of Bavaria also died at Paris and thus another of the principal causes of shame to the French kingship and misfortune to France disappeared from the stage of the world Duke Philip felt himself more free and more at rest in his mind if not rightfully at any rate so far as political and worldly expedience was concerned He declared his readiness to accept the proposals which had been communicated to him by the ambassadors of Charles VII and on the twenty first of September fourteen thirty five peace was signed at Arras between France and Burgundy without any care for what England might say or do There was great and general joy in France It was peace and national reconciliation as well Dauphinizers and Burgundians embraced in the streets the Burgundians were delighted at being able to call themselves Frenchmen Charles VII convoked the states general at Tours to consecrate this alliance On his knees upon the bare stone before the Archbishop of Crete who had just celebrated mass the king laid his hands upon the Gospels and swore the peace saying that It was his duty to imitate the King of kings our divine Saviour who had brought peace amongst men At the chancellor s order the princes and great lords one after the other took the oath the nobles and the people of the third estate swore the peace all together with cries of Long live the king Long live the Duke of Burgundy With this hand said Sire de Lannoy I have thrice sworn peace during this war but I call God to witness that for my part this time it shall be kept and that never will I break it the peace Charles VII in his emotion seized the hands of Duke Philip s ambassadors saying For a long while I have languished for this happy day we must thank God for it And the Te Deum was intoned with enthusiasm Peace was really made amongst Frenchmen and in spite of many internal difficulties and quarrels it was not broken as long as Charles VII and Duke Philip the Good were living But the war with the English went on incessantly They still possessed several of the finest provinces of France and the treaty of Arras which had weakened them very much on the Continent had likewise made them very angry For twenty six years from fourteen thirty five to fourteen sixty one hostilities continued between the two kingdoms at one time actively and at another slackly with occasional suspension by truce but without any formal termination There is no use in recounting the details of their monotonous and barren history Governments and people often persist in maintaining their quarrels and inflicting mutual injuries by the instrumentality of events acts and actors that deserve nothing but oblivion There is no intention here of dwelling upon any events or persons save such as have for good or for evil to its glory or its sorrow exercised a considerable influence upon the condition and fortune of France The peace of Arras brought back to the service of France and her king the constable De Richemont Arthur of Brittany whom the jealousy of George de la Tremoille and the distrustful indolence of Charles VII had so long kept out of it By a somewhat rare privilege he was in reality there is reason to suppose superior to the name he has left behind him in history and it is only justice to reproduce here the portrait given of him by one of his contemporaries who observed him closely and knew him well Never a man of his time says William Gruet loved justice more than he or took more pains to do it according to his ability Never was prince more humble more charitable more compassionate more liberal less avaricious or more open handed in a good fashion and without prodigality He was a proper man chaste and brave as prince can be and there was none of his time of better conduct than lie in conducting a great battle or a great siege and all sorts of approaches in all sorts of ways Every day once at least in the four and twenty hours his conversation was of war and he took more pleasure in it than in aught else Above all things he loved men of valor and good renown and he more than any other loved and supported the people and freely did good to poor mendicants and others of God s poor Nearly all the deeds of Richemont from the time that he became powerful again confirm the truth of this portrait His first thought and his first labor were to restore Paris to France and to the king The unhappy city in subjection to the English was the very image of devastation and ruin The wolves prowled about it by night and there were in it says an eye witness twenty four thousand houses empty The Duke of Bedford in order to get rid of these public tokens of misery attempted to supply the Parisians with bread and amusements panem et circenses but their very diversions were ghastly and melancholy In fourteen twenty five there was painted in the sepulchre of the Innocents a picture called the Dance of Death Death grinning with fleshless jaws was represented taking by the hand all estates of the population in their turn and making them dance In the Hotel Armagnac confiscated as so many others were from its owner a show was exhibited to amuse the people Four blind men armed with staves were shut up with a pig in a little paddock They had to see whether they could kill the said pig and when they thought they were belaboring it most they were belaboring one another The constable resolved to put a stop to this deplorable state of things in the capital of France In April fourteen thirty three when he had just ordered for himself apartments at saint Denis he heard that the English had just got in there and plundered the church He at once gave orders to march The Burgundians who made up nearly all his troop demanded their pay and would not mount Richemont gave them his bond and the march was begun to saint Denis You know the country said the constable to Marshal Isle Adam Yes my lord answered the other and by my faith in the position held by the English you would do nothing to harm or annoy them though you had ten thousand fighting men Ah but we will replied Richemont God will help us Keep pressing forward to support the skirmishers And he occupied saint Denis and drove out the English The population of Paris being informed of this success were greatly moved and encouraged One brave burgess of Paris Michel Laillier master of the exchequer notified to the constable it is said that they were ready and quite able to open one of the gates to him provided that an engagement were entered into in the king s name for a general amnesty and the prevention of all disorder The constable on the king s behalf entered into the required engagement and presented himself the next day the thirteenth of April with a picked force before the saint Michel gate The enterprise was discovered A man posted on the wall made signs to them with his hat crying out Go to the other gate there s no opening this work is going on for you in the Market quarter The picked force followed the course of the ramparts up to the saint Jacques gate Who goes there demanded some burghers who had the guard of it Some of the constable s people He himself came up on his big charger with satisfaction and courtesy in his mien Some little time was required for opening the gate a long ladder was let down and Marshal Isle Adam was the first to mount and planted on the wall the standard of France The fastenings of the drawbridge were burst and when it was let down the constable made his entry on horseback riding calmly down saint Jacques Street in the midst of a joyous and comforted crowd My good friends he said to them the good King Charles and I on his behalf do thank you a hundred thousand times for yielding up to him so quietly the chief city of his kingdom If there be amongst you any of whatsoever condition he may be who hath offended against my lord the king all is forgiven in the case both of the absent and the present Illustration The Constable Made his Entry on Horseback one hundred fifty Then he caused it to be proclaimed by sound of trumpet throughout the streets that none of his people should be so bold on pain of hanging as to take up quarters in the house of any burgher against his will or to use any reproach whatever or do the least displeasure to any At sight of the public joy the English had retired to the Bastille where the constable was disposed to besiege them My lord said the burghers to him they will surrender do not reject their offer it is so far a fine thing enough to have thus recovered Paris often on the contrary many constables and many marshals have been driven out of it Take contentedly what God hath granted you The burghers prediction was not unverified The English sallied out of the Bastille by the gate which opened on the fields and went and took boat in the rear of the Louvre Next day abundance of provisions arrived in Paris and the gates were opened to the country folks The populace freely manifested their joy at being rid of the English It was plain to see was the saving that they were not in France to remain not one of them had been seen to sow a field with corn or build a house they destroyed their quarters without a thought of repairing them they had not restored peradventure a single fireplace There was only their regent the Duke of Bedford who was fond of building and making the poor people work he would have liked peace but the nature of those English is to be always at war with their neighbors and accordingly they all made a bad end thank God there have already died in France more than seventy thousand of them Up to the taking of Paris by the constable the Duke of Burgundy had kept himself in reserve and had maintained a tacit neutrality towards England he had merely been making without noisy demonstration preparations for an enterprise in which he as Count of Flanders was very much interested The success of Richemont inspired him with a hope and perhaps with a jealous desire of showing his power and his patriotism as a Frenchman by making war in his turn upon the English from whom he had by the treaty of Arras effected only a pacific separation In June fourteen thirty six he went and besieged Calais This was attacking England at one of the points she was bent upon defending most obstinately Philip had reckoned on the energetic cooperation of the cities of Flanders and at the first blush the Flemings did display a strong inclination to support him in his enterprise When the English they said know that my lords of Ghent are on the way to attack them with all their might they will not await us they will leave the city and flee away to England Neither the Flemings nor Philip had correctly estimated the importance which was attached in London to the possession of Calais When the Duke of Gloucester lord protector of England found this possession threatened he sent a herald to defy the Duke of Burgundy and declare to him that if he did not wait for battle beneath the walls of Calais Humphrey of Gloucester would go after him even into his own dominions Tell your lord that he will not need to take so much trouble and that he will find me here answered Philip proudly His pride was over confident Whether it were only a people s fickleness or intelligent appreciation of their own commercial interests in their relations with England the Flemings grew speedily disgusted with the siege of Calais complained of the tardiness in arrival of the fleet which Philip had despatched thither to close the port against English vessels and after having suffered several reverses by sorties of the English garrison they ended by retiring with such precipitation that they abandoned part of their supplies and artillery Philip according to the expression of M Henri Martin was reduced to covering their retreat with his cavalry and then he went away sorrowfully to Lille to advise about the means of defending his Flemish lordships exposed to the reprisals of the English Thus the fortune of Burgundy was tottering whilst that of France was recovering itself The constable s easy occupation of Paris led the majority of the small places in the neighborhood saint Denis Chevreuse Marcoussis and Montlhery to decide either upon spontaneous surrender or allowing themselves to be taken after no great resistance Charles VII on his way through France to Lyon in Dauphiny Languedoc Auvergne and along the Loire recovered several other towns for instance Chateau Landon Nemours and Charny He laid siege in person to Montereau an important military post with which a recent and sinister reminiscence was connected A great change now made itself apparent in the king s behavior and disposition He showed activity and vigilance and was ready to expose himself without any care for fatigue or danger On the day of the assault tenth of October fourteen thirty seven he went down into the trenches remained there in water up to his waist mounted the scaling ladder sword in hand and was one of the first assailants who penetrated over the top of the walls right into the place After the surrender of the castle as well as the town of Montereau he marched on Paris and made his solemn re entry there on the twelfth of November fourteen thirty seven for the first time since in fourteen eighteen Tanneguy Duchatel had carried him away whilst still a child wrapped in his bed clothes Charles was received and entertained as became a recovered and a victorious king but he passed only three weeks there and went away once more on the threed of December to go and resume at Orleans first and then at Bourges the serious cares of government It is said to have been at this royal entry into Paris that Agnes Sorel or Soreau who was soon to have the name of Queen of Beauty and to assume in French history an almost glorious though illegitimate position appeared with brilliancy in the train of the queen Mary of Anjou to whom the king had appointed her a maid of honor It is a question whether she did not even then exercise over Charles VII that influence serviceable alike to the honor of the king and of France which was to inspire Francis I a century later with this gallant quatrain If to win back poor captive France be aught More honor gentle Agnes is thy weed Than ere was due to deeds of virtue wrought By cloistered nun or pious hermit breed It is worth while perhaps to remark that in fourteen thirty seven Agnes Sorel was already twenty seven Illustration Agnes Sorel one hundred seventy five One of the best informed most impartial and most sensible historians of that epoch James Duclercq merely says on this subject King Charles before he had peace with Duke Philip of Burgundy led a right holy life and said his canonical hours But after peace was made with the duke though the king continued to serve God he joined himself unto a young woman who was afterwards called Fair Agnes Nothing is gained by ignoring good even when it is found in company with evil and there is no intention here of disputing the share of influence exercised by Agnes Sorel upon Charles VII s regeneration in politics and war after the treaty of Arras Nevertheless in spite of the king s successes at Montereau and during his passage through Central and Northern France the condition of the country was still so bad in fourteen forty the disorder was so great and the king so powerless to apply a remedy that Richemont disconsolate was tempted to rid and disburden himself from the government of France and between the rivers Seine and Loire no doubt and to go or send to the king for that purpose But one day the prior of the Carthusians at Paris called on the constable and found him in his private chapel What need you fair father asked Richemont The prior answered that he wished to speak with my lord the constable Richemont replied that it was he himself Pardon me my lord said the prior I did not know you I wish to speak to you if you please Gladly said Richemont Well my lord you yesterday held counsel and considered about disburdening yourself from the government and office you hold hereabouts How know you that Who told you My lord I do not know it through any person of your council and do not put yourself out to learn who told me for it was one of my brethren My lord do not do this thing and be not troubled for God will help you Ah fair father how can that be The king has no mind to aid me or grant me men or money and the men at arms hate me because I have justice done on them and they have no mind to obey me My lord they will do what you desire and the king will give you orders to go and lay siege to Meaux and will send you men and money Ah fair father Meaux is so strong How can it be done The King of England was there for nine months before it My lord be not you troubled you will not be there so long keep having good hope in God and He will help you Be ever humble and grow not proud you will take Meaux ere long your men will grow proud they will then have somewhat to suffer but you will come out of it to your honor The good prior was right Meaux was taken and when the constable went to tell the news at Paris the king made him great cheer There was a continuance of war to the north of the Loire and amidst many alternations of successes and reverses the national cause made great way there Charles resolved in fourteen forty two to undertake an expedition to the south of the Loire in Aquitaine where the English were still dominant and he was successful He took from the English Tartas Saint Sever Marmande La Reole Blaye and Bourg sur Mer Their ally Count John d Armagnac submitted to the King of France These successes cost Charles VII the brave La Hire who died at Montauban of his wounds On returning to Normandy where he had left Dunois Charles in fourteen forty three conducted a prosperous campaign there The English leaders were getting weary of a war without any definite issue and they had proposals made to Charles for a truce accompanied with a demand on the part of their young king Henry VI for the hand of a French princess Margaret of Anjou daughter of King Rena who wore the three crowns of Naples Sicily and Jerusalem without possessing any one of the kingdoms The truce and the marriage were concluded at Tours in fourteen forty four Neither of the arrangements was popular in England the English people who had only a far off touch of suffering from the war considered that their government made too many concessions to France In France too there was some murmuring the king it was said did not press his advantages with sufficient vigor everybody was in a hurry to see all Aquitaine reconquered But a joy that was boundless and impossible to describe says Thomas Bazin the most intelligent of the contemporary historians spread abroad through the whole population of the Gauls Having been a prey for so long to incessant terrors and shut up within the walls of their towns like convicts in a prison they rejoiced like people restored to freedom after a long and bitter slavery Companies of both sexes were seen going forth into the country and visiting temples or oratories dedicated to the saints to pay the vows which they had made in their distress One fact especially was admirable and the work of God Himself before the truce so violent had been the hatred between the two sides both men at arms and people that none whether soldier or burgher could without risk to life go out and pass from one place to another unless under the protection of a safe conduct But so soon as the truce was proclaimed every one went and came at pleasure in full liberty and security whether in the same district or in districts under divided rule and even those who before the proclamation of the truce seemed to take no pleasure in anything but a savage outpouring of human blood now took delight in the sweets of peace and passed the days in holiday making and dancing with enemies who but lately had been as bloodthirsty as themselves But for all their rejoicing at the peace the French king lords and commons had war still in their hearts national feelings were waking up afresh the successes of late years had revived their hopes and the civil dissensions which were at that time disturbing England let favorable chances peep out Charles VII and his advisers employed the leisure afforded by the truce in preparing for a renewal of the struggle They were the first to begin it again and from fourteen forty nine to fourteen fifty one it was pursued by the French king and nation with ever increasing ardor and with obstinate courage by the veteran English warriors astounded at no longer being victorious Normandy and Aquitaine which was beginning to be called Guyenne only were throughout this period the constant and the chief theatre of war Amongst the greatest number of fights and incidents which distinguished the three campaigns in those two provinces the recapture of Rouen by Dunois in October fourteen forty nine the battle of Formigny won near Bayeux on the fifteenth of April fourteen fifty by the constable De Richemont and the twofold capitulation of Bordeaux first on the twenty eighth of June fourteen fifty one and next on the ninth of October fourteen fifty three in order to submit to Charles VII are the only events to which a place in history is due for those were the days on which the question was solved touching the independence of the nation and the kingship in France The Duke of Somerset and Lord Talbot were commanding in Rouen when Dunois presented himself beneath its walls in hopes that the inhabitants would open the gates to him Some burgesses indeed had him apprised of a certain point in the walls at which they might be able to favor the entry of the French Dunois at the same time making a feint of attacking in another quarter arrived at the spot indicated with four thousand men The archers drew up before the wall the men at arms dismounted the burgesses gave the signal and the planting of scaling ladders began but when hardly as many as fifty or sixty men had reached the top of the wall the banner and troops of Talbot were seen advancing He had been warned in time and had taken his measures The assailants were repulsed and Charles VII who was just arriving at the camp seeing the abortiveness of the attempt went back to Pont de l Arehe But the English had no long joy of their success They were too weak to make any effectual resistance and they had no hope of any aid from England Their leaders authorized the burgesses to demand of the king a safe conduct in order to treat The conditions offered by Charles were agreeable to the burgesses but not to the English and when the archbishop read them out in the hall of the mansion house Somerset and Talbot witnessed an outburst of joy which revealed to them all their peril Fagots and benches at once began to rain down from the windows the English shut themselves up precipitately in the castle in the gate towers and in the great tower of the bridge and the burgesses armed themselves and took possession during the night of the streets and the walls Dunois having received notice arrived in force at the Martainville gate The inhabitants begged him to march into the city as many men as he pleased It shall be as you will said Dunois Three hundred men at arms and archers seemed sufficient Charles VII returned before Rouen the English asked leave to withdraw without loss of life or kit and on condition said the king that they take nothing on the march without paying We have not the wherewithal they answered and the king gave them a hundred francs Negotiations were recommenced The king required that Harfleur and all the places in the district of Caux should be given up to him Ah as for Harfleur that cannot be said the Duke of Somerset it is the first town which surrendered to our glorious king Henry V thirty five years ago There was further parley The French consented to give up the demand for Harfleur but they required that Talbot should remain as a hostage until the conditions were fulfilled The English protested At last however they yielded and undertook to pay fifty thousand golden crowns to settle all accounts which they owed to the tradesmen in the city and to give up all places in the district of Caen except Harfleur The Duchess of Somerset and Lord Talbot remained as hostages and on the tenth of November fourteen forty nine Charles entered Rouen in state with the character of a victor who knew how to use victory with moderation The battle of Formigny was at first very doubtful In order to get from Valognes to Bayeux and Caen the English had to cross at the mouth of the Vire great sands which were passable only at low tide A weak body of French under command of the Count de Clermont had orders to cut them off from this passage The English however succeeded in forcing it but just as they were taking position with the village of Formigny to cover their rear the constable De Richemont was seen coming up with three thousand men in fine order The English were already strongly intrenched when the battle began Let us go and look close in their faces admiral said the constable to Sire de Coetivi I doubt whether they will leave their intrenchments replied the admiral I vow to God that with His grace they will not abide in them rejoined the constable and he gave orders for the most vigorous assault It lasted nearly three hours the English were forced to fly at three points and lost thirty seven hundred men several of their leaders were made prisoners those who were left retired in good order Bayeux Avranches Caen Falaise and Cherbourg fell one after the other into the hands of Charles VII and by the end of August fourteen fifty the whole of Normandy had been completely won back by France The conquest of Guyenne which was undertaken immediately after that of Normandy was at the outset more easy and more speedy Amongst the lords of Southern France several hearty patriots such as John of Blois Count of Perigord and Arnold Amanieu Sire d Albret of their own accord began the strife and on the first of November fourteen fifty inflicted a somewhat severe reverse upon the English near Blanquefort In the spring of the following year Charles VII authorized the Count of Armagnac to take the field and sent Dunois to assume the command in chief An army of twenty thousand men mustered under his orders and in the course of May fourteen fifty one some of the principal places of Guyenne such as saint Emillon Blaye Fronsac Bourg en Mer Libourne and Dax were taken by assault or capitulated Bordeaux and Bayonne held out for some weeks but on the twelfth of June a treaty concluded between the Bordelese and Dunois secured to the three estates of the district the liberties and privileges which they had enjoyed under English supremacy and it was further stipulated that if by the twenty fourth of June the city had not been succored by English forces the estates of Guyenne should recognize the sovereignty of King Charles When the twenty fourth of June came a herald went up to one of the towers of the castle and shouted Succor from the King of England for them of Bordeaux None replied to this appeal so Bordeaux surrendered and on the twenty ninth of June Dunois took possession of it in the name of the King of France The siege of Bayonne which was begun on the sixth of August came to an end on the twentieth by means of a similar treaty Guyenne was thus completely won But the English still had a considerable following there They had held it for three centuries and they had always treated it well in respect of local liberties agriculture and commerce Charles VII on recovering it was less wise He determined to establish there forthwith the taxes the laws and the whole regimen of Northern France and the Bordelese were as prompt in protesting against these measures as the king was in employing them In August fourteen fifty two a deputation from the three estates of the province waited upon Charles at Bourges but did not obtain their demands On their return to Bordeaux an insurrection was organized and Peter de Montferrand Sire de Lesparre repaired to London and proposed to the English government to resume possession of Guyenne On the twenty twod of October fourteen fifty two Talbot appeared before Bordeaux with a body of five thousand men the inhabitants opened their gates to him and he installed himself there as lieutenant of the King of England Henry VI Nearly all the places in the neighborhood with the exception of Bourg and Blaye returned beneath the sway of the English considerable reenforcements were sent to Talbot from England and at the same time an English fleet threatened the coast of Normandy But Charles VII was no longer the blind and indolent king he had been in his youth Nor can the prompt and effectual energy he displayed in fourteen fifty three be any longer attributed to the influence of Agnes Sorel for she died on the ninth of February fourteen fifty Charles left Richemont and Dunois to hold Normandy and in the early days of spring moved in person to the south of France with a strong army and the principal Gascon lords who two years previously had brought Guyenne back under his power On the twod of June fourteen fifty three he opened the campaign at saint Jean d Angely Several places surrendered to him as soon as he appeared before their walls and on the thirteenth of July he laid siege to Castillon on the Dordogne which had shortly before fallen into the hands of the English The Bordelese grew alarmed and urged Talbot to oppose the advance of the French We may very well let them come nearer yet said the old warrior then eighty years of age rest assured that if it please God I will fulfil my promise when I see that the time and the hour have come On the night between the sixteenth and seventeenth of July however Talbot set out with his troops to raise the siege of Castillon He marched all night and came suddenly in the early morning upon the French archers quartered in an abbey who formed the advanced guard of their army which was strongly intrenched before the place A panic set in amongst this small body and some of them took to flight Ha you would desert me then said Sire de Rouault who was in command of them have I not promised you to live and die with you They thereupon rallied and managed to join the camp Talbot content for the time with this petty success sent for a chaplain to come and say mass and whilst waiting for an opportunity to resume the fight he permitted the tapping of some casks of wine which had been found in the abbey and his men set themselves to drinking A countryman of those parts came hurrying up and said to Talbot My lord the French are deserting their park and taking to flight now or never is the hour for fulfilling your promise Talbot arose and left the mass shouting Never may I hear mass again if I put not to rout the French who are in yonder park When he arrived in front of the Frenchmen s intrenchment My lord said Sir Thomas Cunningham an aged gentleman who had for a long time past been his standard bearer they have made a false report to you observe the depth of the ditch and the faces of yonder men they don t look like retreating my opinion is that for the present we should turn back the country is for us we have no lack of provisions and with a little patience we shall starve out the French Talbot flew into a passion gave Sir Thomas a sword cut across the face had his banner planted on the edge of the ditch and began the attack The banner was torn down and Sir Thomas Cunningham killed Dismount shouted Talbot to his men at arms English and Gascon The French camp was defended by a more than usually strong artillery a body of Bretons held in reserve advanced to sustain the shock of the English and a shot from a culverin struck Talbot who was already wounded in the face shattered his thigh and brought him to the ground Lord Lisle his son flew to him to raise him Let me be said Talbot the day is the enemies it will be no shame for thee to fly for this is thy first battle But the son remained with his father and was slain at his side The defeat of the English was complete Talbot s body pierced with wounds was left on the field of battle He was so disfigured that when the dead were removed he was not recognized Notice however was taken of an old man wearing a cuirass covered with red velvet this it was presumed was he and he was placed upon a shield and carried into the camp An English herald came with a request that he might look for Lord Talbot s body Would you know him he was asked Take me to see him joyfully answered the poor servant thinking that his master was a prisoner and alive When he saw him he hesitated to identify him he knelt down put his finger in the mouth of the corpse and recognized Talbot by the loss of a molar tooth Throwing off immediately his coat of arms with the colors and bearings of Talbot Ah my lord and master he cried can this be verily you May God forgive your sins For forty years and more I have been your officer at arms and worn your livery and thus I give it back to you And he covered with his coat of arms the stark stripped body of the old hero The English being beaten and Talbot dead Castillon surrendered and at unequal intervals Libourne saint Emillon Chateau Neuf de Medoc Blanquefort saint Macaire Cadillac c followed the example At the commencement of October fourteen fifty three Bordeaux alone was still holding out The promoters of the insurrection which had been concerted with the English amongst others Sires de Duras and de Lesparre protracted the resistance rather in their own self defence than in response to the wishes of the population the king s artillery threatened the place by land and by sea a king s fleet from Rochelle and the ports of Brittany blockaded the Gironde The majority of the king s officers says the contemporary historian Thomas Basin advised him to punish by at least the destruction of their walls the Bordelese who had recalled the English to their city but Charles more merciful and more soft hearted refused He confined himself to withdrawing from Bordeaux her municipal privileges which however she soon partially recovered and to imposing upon her a fine of a hundred thousand gold crowns afterwards reduced to thirty thousand he caused to be built at the expense of the city two fortresses the Fort of the Ila and the Castle of Trompette to keep in check so bold and fickle a population and an amnesty was proclaimed for all but twenty specified persons who were banished On these conditions the capitulation was concluded and signed on the seventeenth of October the English re embarked and Charles without entering Bordeaux returned to Touraine The English had no longer any possession in France but Calais and Guines the Hundred Years War was over And to whom was the glory Charles VII himself decided the question When in fourteen fifty five twenty four years after the death of Joan of Are he at Rome and at Rouen prosecuted her claims for restoration of character and did for her fame and her memory all that was still possible he was but relieving his conscience from a load of ingratitude and remorse which in general weighs but lightly upon men and especially upon kings and he was discharging towards the Maid of Domremy the debt due by France and the French kingship when he thus proclaimed that to Joan above all they owed their deliverance and their independence Before men and before God Charles was justified in so thinking the moral are not the sole but they are the most powerful forces which decide the fates of people and Joan had roused the feelings of the soul and given to the struggles between France and England its religious and national character At Rheims when she repaired thither for the king s coronation she said of her own banner It has a right to the honor for it has been at the pains She first amongst all had a right to the glory for she had been the first to contribute to the success Next to Joan of Arc the constable De Richemont was the most effective and the most glorious amongst the liberators of France and of the king He was a strict and stern warrior unscrupulous and pitiless towards his enemies especially towards such as he despised severe in regard to himself dignified in his manners never guilty of swearing himself and punishing swearing as a breach of discipline amongst the troops placed under his orders Like a true patriot and royalist he had more at heart his duty towards France and the king than he had his own personal interests He was fond of war and conducted it bravely and skilfully without rashness but without timidity Wherever the constable is said Charles VII there I am free from anxiety he will do all that is possible He set his title and office of constable of France above his rank as a great lord and when after the death of his brother Duke Peter II he himself became Duke of Brittany he always had the constable s sword carried before him saying I wish to honor in my old age a function which did me honor in my youth His good services were not confined to the wars of his time he was one of the principal reformers of the military system in France by the substitution of regular troops for feudal service He has not obtained it is to be feared in the history of the fifteenth century the place which properly belongs to him Dunois La Hire Xaintrailles and Marshals De Boussac and De La Fayette were under Charles VII brilliant warriors and useful servants of the king and of Fiance but in spite of their knightly renown it is questionable if they can be reckoned like the constable De Richemont amongst the liberators of national independence There are degrees of glory and it is the duty of history not to distribute it too readily and as it were by handfuls Besides all these warriors we meet under the sway of Charles VII at first in a humble capacity and afterwards at his court in his diplomatic service and sometimes in his closest confidence a man of quite a different origin and quite another profession but one who nevertheless acquired by peaceful toil great riches and great influence both brought to a melancholy termination by a conviction and a consequent ruin from which at the approach of old age he was still striving to recover by means of fresh ventures Jacques Coeur was born at Bourges at the close of the fourteenth century His father was a furrier already sufficiently well established and sufficiently rich to allow of his son s marrying in fourteen eighteen the provost s daughter of his own city Some years afterwards Jacques Coeur underwent a troublesome trial for infraction of the rules touching the coinage of money but thanks to a commutation of the penalty graciously accorded by Charles VII he got off with a fine and from that time forward directed all his energies towards commerce In fourteen thirty two a squire in the service of the Duke of Burgundy was travelling in the Holy Land and met him at Damascus in company with several Venetians Genoese Florentine and Catalan traders with whom he was doing business He was says his contemporary Thomas Basin a man unlettered and of plebeian family but of great and ingenious mind well versed in the practical affairs of that age He was the first in all France to build and man ships which transported to Africa and the East woollen stuffs and other produce of the kingdom penetrated as far as Egypt and brought back with them silken stuffs and all manner of spices which they distributed not only in France but in Catalonia and the neighboring countries whereas heretofore it was by means of the Venetians the Genoese or the Barcelonese that such supplies found their way into France Illustration Jacques Coeur one hundred sixty five Jacques Coeur temporarily established at Montpellier became a great and a celebrated merchant In fourteen thirty three Charles VII put into his hands the direction of the mint at Paris and began to take his advice as to the administration of the crown s finances In fourteen forty he was appointed moneyman to the king ennobled together with his wife and children commissioned soon afterwards to draw up new regulations for the manufacture of cloth at Bourges and invested on his own private account with numerous commercial privileges He had already at this period it was said three hundred manufacturing hands in his employment and he was working at the same time silver lead and copper mines situated in the environs of Tarare and Lyons Between fourteen forty two and fourteen forty six he had one of his nephews sent as ambassador to Egypt and obtained for the French consuls in the Levant the same advantages as were enjoyed by those of the most favored nations Not only his favor in the eyes of the king but his administrative and even his political appointments went on constantly increasing Between fourteen forty four and fourteen forty six the king several times named him one of his commissioners to the estates of Languedoc and for the installation of the new parliament of Toulouse In fourteen forty six he formed one of an embassy sent to Italy to try and acquire for France the possession of Genoa which was harassed by civil dissensions In fourteen forty seven he received from Charles VII a still more important commission to bring about an arrangement between the two popes elected one under the name of Felix V and the other under that of Nicholas V and he was successful His immense wealth greatly contributed to his influence M Pierre Clement Jacques Coeur et Charles WE ou la France au quinzieme siecle t ii pp one forty six has given a list of thirty two estates and lordships which Jacques Coeur had bought either in Berry or in the neighboring provinces He possessed besides four mansions and two hostels at Lyons mansions at Beaucaire at Beziers at saint Pourcain at Marseilles and at Montpellier and he had built for his own residence at Bourges the celebrated hostel which still exists as an admirable model of Gothic and national art in the fifteenth century attempting combination with the art of Italian renaissance Illustration Jacques Coeur s Hostel at Bourges one hundred sixty nine M Clement in his table of Jacques Coeur s wealth does not count either the mines which he worked at various spots in France nor the vast capital unknown which he turned to profit in his commercial enterprises but on the other hand he names with certain et ceteras forty two court personages or king s officers indebted to Jacques Coeur for large or small sums he had lent them We will quote but two instances of Jacques Coeur s financial connection not with courtiers however but with the royal family and the king himself Margaret of Scotland wife of the dauphin who became Louis XI wrote with her own hand on the twentieth of July fourteen forty five We Margaret dauphiness of Viennois do acknowledge to have received from Master Stephen Petit secretary of my lord the king and receiver general of his finances for Languedoc and Guienne two thousand livres of Tours to us given by my said lord and to us advanced by the hands of Jacques Coeur his moneyman we being but lately in Lorraine for to get silken stuff and sables to make robes for our person In fourteen forty nine when Charles VII determined to drive the English from Normandy his treasury was exhausted and he had recourse to Jacques Coeur Sir said the trader to the king what I have is yours and lent him two hundred thousand crowns the effect of which was says Jacques Duclercq that during this conquest all the men at arms of the King of France and all those who were in his service were paid their wages month by month An original document dated fourteen fifty which exists in the cabinet des titres of the National Library bears upon it a receipt for sixty thousand livres from Jacques Coeur to the king s receiver general in Normandy in restitution of the like sum lent by me in ready money to the said lord in the month of August last past on occasion of the surrendering to his authority of the towns and castle of Cherbourg at that time held by the English the ancient enemies of this realm It was probably a partial repayment of the two hundred thousand crowns lent by Jacques Coeur to the king at this juncture according to all the contemporary chroniclers Enormous and unexpected wealth excites envy and suspicion at the same time that it confers influence and the envious before long become enemies Sullen murmurs against Jacques Coeur were raised in the king s own circle and the way in which he had begun to make his fortune the coinage of questionable money furnished some specious ground for them There is too general an inclination amongst potentates of the earth to give an easy ear to reasons good or bad for dispensing with the gratitude and respect otherwise due to those who serve them Charles VII after having long been the patron and debtor of Jacques Coeur all at once in fourteen fifty one shared the suspicions aroused against him To accusations of grave abuses and malversations in money matters was added one of even more importance Agnes Sorel had died eighteen months previously February nine fourteen fifty and on her death bed she had appointed Jacques Coeur one of the three executors of her will In July fourteen fifty one Jacques was at Taillebourg in Guyenne whence he wrote to his wife that he was in as good case and was as well with the king as ever he had been whatever anybody might say Indeed on the twenty twod of July Charles VII granted him a sum of seven hundred and seventy two livres of Tours to help him to keep up his condition and to be more honorably equipped for his service and nevertheless on the thirty first of July on the information of two persons of the court who accused Jacques Coeur of having poisoned Agnes Sorel Charles ordered his arrest and the seizure of his goods on which he immediately levied a hundred thousand crowns for the purposes of the war Commissioners extraordinary taken from amongst the king s grand council were charged to try him and Charles VII declared it is said that if the said moneyman were not found liable to the charge of having poisoned or caused to be poisoned Agnes Sorel he threw up and forgave all the other cases against him The accusation of poisoning was soon acknowledged to be false and the two informers were condemned as calumniators but the trial was nevertheless proceeded with Jacques Coeur was accused of having sold arms to the infidels of having coined light crowns of having pressed on board of his vessels at Montpellier several individuals of whom one had thrown himself into the sea from desperation and lastly of having appropriated to himself presents made to the king in several towns of Languedoc and of having practised in that country frequent exaction to the prejudice of the king as well as of his subjects After twenty two months of imprisonment Jacques Coeur on the twenty ninth of May fourteen fifty three was convicted in the king s name on divers charges of which several entailed a capital penalty but whereas Pope Nicholas V had issued a rescript and made request in favor of Jacques Coeur and regard also being had to services received from him Charles VII spared his life on condition that he should pay to the king a hundred thousand crowns by way of restitution three hundred thousand by way of fine and should be kept in prison until the whole claim was satisfied and the decree ended as follows We have declared and do declare all the goods of the said Jacques Coeur confiscated to us and we have banished and do banish this Jacques Coeur forever from this realm reserving thereanent our own good pleasure After having spent nearly three years more in prison transported from dungeon to dungeon Jacques Coeur thanks to the faithful and zealous affection of a few friends managed to escape from Beaucaire to embark at Nice and to reach Rome where Pope Nicholas V welcomed him with tokens of lively interest Nicholas died shortly afterwards just when he was preparing an expedition against the Turks His successor Calixtus III carried out his design and equipped a fleet of sixteen galleys This fleet required a commander of energy resolution and celebrity Jacques Coeur had lived and fought with Dunois Xaintrailles La Hire and the most valiant French captains he was known and popular in Italy and the Levant and the pope appointed him captain general of the expedition Charles VII s moneyman ruined convicted and banished from France sailed away at the head of the pope s squadron and of some Catalan pirates to carry help against the Turks to Rhodes Chios Lesbos Lemnos and the whole Grecian archipelago On arriving at Chios in November fourteen fifty six he fell ill there and perceiving his end approaching he wrote to his king to commend to him his children and to beg that considering the great wealth and honors he had in his time enjoyed in the king s service it might be the king s good pleasure to give something to his children in order that they even those of them who were secular might be able to live honestly without coming to want He died at Chits on the twenty fifth of November fourteen fifty six and according to the historian John d Auton who had probably lived in the society of Jacques Coeur s children he remained interred in the church of the Cordeliers in that island at the centre of the choir We have felt bound to represent with some detail the active and energetic life prosperous for a long while and afterwards so grievous and hazardous up to its very last day of this great French merchant at the close of the middle ages who was the first to extend afar in Europe Africa and Asia the commercial relations of France and after the example of the great Italian merchants to make an attempt to combine politics with commerce and to promote at one and the same time the material interests of his country and the influence of his government There can be no doubt but that Jacques Coeur was unscrupulous and frequently visionary as a man of business but at the same time he was inventive able and bold and whilst pushing his own fortunes to the utmost he contributed a great deal to develop in the ways of peace the commercial industrial diplomatic and artistic enterprise of France In his relations towards his king Jacques Coeur was to Charles VII a servant often over adventurous slippery and compromising but often also useful full of resource efficient and devoted in the hour of difficulty Charles VII was to Jacques Coeur a selfish and ungrateful patron who contemptuously deserted the man whose brains he had sucked and ruined him pitilessly after having himself contributed to enrich him unscrupulously We have now reached the end of events under this long reign all that remains is to run over the substantial results of Charles VII s government and the melancholy imbroglios of his latter years with his son the turbulent tricky and wickedly able born conspirator who was to succeed him under the name of Louis XI One fact is at the outset to be remarked upon it at the first blush appears singular but it admits of easy explanation In the first nineteen years of his reign from fourteen twenty three to fourteen forty two Charles VII very frequently convoked the states general at one time of Northern France or Langue d oil at another of Southern France or Langue d oc Twenty four such assemblies took place during this period at Bourges at Selles in Berry at Le Puy in Velay at Mean sur Yevre at Chinon at Sully sur Loire at Tours at Orleans at Nevers at Carcassonne and at different spots in Languedoc It was the time of the great war between France on the one side and England and Burgundy allied on the other the time of intrigues incessantly recurring at court and the time likewise of carelessness and indolence on the part of Charles VII more devoted to his pleasures than regardful of his government He had incessant need of states general to supply him with money and men and support him through the difficulties of his position But when dating from the peace of Arras September twenty one fourteen thirty five Charles VII having become reconciled with the Duke of Burgundy was deliverer from civil war and was at grips with none but England alone already half beaten by the divine inspiration the triumph and the martyrdom of Joan of Arc his posture and his behavior underwent a rare transformation Without ceasing to be coldly selfish and scandalously licentious king he became practical hard working statesman like king jealous and disposed to govern by himself but at the same time watchful and skilful in availing himself of the able advisers who whether it were by a happy accident or by his own choice were grouped around him He had his days and hours for dealing with all sorts of men one hour with the clergy another with the nobles another with foreigners another with mechanical folks armorers and gunners and in respect of all these persons he had a full remembrance of their cases and their appointed day On Monday Tuesday and Thursday he worked with the chancellor and got through all claims connected with justice On Wednesday he first of all gave audience to the marshals captains and men of war On the same day he held a council of finance independently of another council which was also held on the same subject every Friday It was by such assiduous toil that Charles VII in concert with his advisers was able to take in hand and accomplish in the military financial and judicial system of the realm those bold and at the same time prudent reforms which wrested the country from the state of disorder pillage and general insecurity to which it had been a prey and commenced the era of that great monarchical administration which in spite of many troubles and vicissitudes was destined to be during more than three centuries the government of France The constable De Richemont and marshal De la Fayette were in respect of military matters Charles VII s principal advisers and it was by their counsel and with their company operation that he substituted for feudal service and for the bands of wandering mercenaries routiers mustered and maintained by hap hazard a permanent army regularly levied provided for paid and commanded and charged with the duty of keeping order at home and at the same time subserving abroad the interests and policy of the state In connection with and as a natural consequence of this military system Charles VII on his own sole authority established certain permanent imposts with the object of making up any deficiency in the royal treasury whilst waiting for a vote of such taxes extraordinary as might be demanded of the states general Jacques Coeur the two brothers Bureau Martin Gouge Michel Lailler William Cousinot and many other councillors of burgher origin labored zealously to establish this administrative system so prompt and freed from all independent discussion Weary of wars irregularities and sufferings France in the fifteenth century asked for nothing but peace and security and so soon as the kingship showed that it had an intention and was in a condition to provide her with them the nation took little or no trouble about political guarantees which as yet it knew neither how to establish nor how to exercise its right to them was not disputed in principle they were merely permitted to fall into desuetude and Charles VII who during the first half of his reign had twenty four times assembled the states general to ask them for taxes and soldiers was able in the second to raise personally both soldiers and taxes without drawing forth any complaint hardly save from his contemporary historian the Bishop of Lisieux Thomas Basin who said Into such misery and servitude is fallen the realm of France heretofore so noble and free that all the inhabitants are openly declared by the generals of finance and their clerks taxable at the will of the king without anybody s daring to murmur or even ask for mercy There is at every juncture and in all ages of the world a certain amount though varying very much of good order justice and security without which men cannot get on and when they lack it either through the fault of those who govern them or through their own fault they seek after it with the blind eyes of passion and are ready to accept it no matter what power may procure it for them or what price it may cost them Charles VII was a prince neither to be respected nor to be loved and during many years his reign had not been a prosperous one but he re quickened justice which had been a long while dead says a chronicler devoted to the Duke of Burgundy he put an end to the tyrannies and exactions of the men at arms and out of an infinity of murderers and robbers he formed men of resolution and honest life he made regular paths in murderous woods and forests all roads safe all towns peaceful all nationalities of his kingdom tranquil he chastised the evil and honored the good and he was sparing of human blood Let it be added in accordance with contemporary testimony that at the same time that he established an all but arbitrary rule in military and financial matters Charles VII took care that practical justice in the case of every individual was promptly rendered to poor as well as rich to small as well as great he forbade all trafficking in the offices of the magistracy and every time that a place became vacant in a parliament he made no nomination to it save on the presentations of the court Questions of military financial and judicial organization were not the only ones which occupied the government of Charles VII He attacked also ecclesiastical questions which were at that period a subject of passionate discussion in Christian Europe amongst the councils of the Church and in the closets of princes The celebrated ordinance known by the name of Pragmatic Sanction which Charles VII issued at Bourges on the seventh of July fourteen thirty eight with the concurrence of a grand national council laic and ecclesiastical was directed towards the carrying out in the internal regulations of the French Church and in the relations either of the State with the Church in France or of the Church of France with the papacy of reforms long since desired or dreaded by the different powers and interests It would be impossible to touch here upon these difficult and delicate questions without going far beyond the limits imposed upon the writer of this history All that can be said is that there was no lack of a religious spirit or of a liberal spirit in the Pragmatic Sanction of Charles VII and that the majority of the measures contained in it were adopted with the approbation of the greater part of the French clergy as well as of educated laymen in France In whatever light it is regarded the government of Charles VII in the latter part of his reign brought him not only in France but throughout Europe a great deal of fame and power When he had driven the English out of his kingdom he was called Charles the Victorious and when he had introduced into the internal regulations of the state so many important and effective reforms he was called Charles the Well served The sense he had by nature says his historian Chastellain had been increased to twice as much again in his straitened fortunes by long constraint and perilous dangers which sharpened his wits perforce He is the king of kings was said of him by the Doge of Venice Francis Foscari a good judge of policy there is no doing without him Nevertheless at the close so influential and so tranquil of his reign Charles VII was in his individual and private life the most desolate the most harassed and the most unhappy man in his kingdom In fourteen forty two and fourteen fifty he had lost the two women who had been respectively the most devoted and most useful and the most delightful and dearest to him his mother in law Yolande of Arragon Queen of Sicily and his favorite Agnes Sorel His avowed intimacy with Agnes and even independently of her and after her death the scandalous licentiousness of his morals had justly offended his virtuous wife Mary of Anjou the only lady of the royal establishment who survived him She had brought him twelve children and the eldest the dauphin Louis after having from his very youth behaved in a factious harebrained turbulent way towards the king his father had become at one time an open rebel at another a venomous conspirator and a dangerous enemy At his birth in fourteen twenty three he had been named Louis in remembrance of his ancestor saint Louis and in hopes that he would resemble him In fourteen forty at seventeen years of age he allied himself with the great lords who were displeased with the new military system established by Charles VII and allowed himself to be drawn by them into the transient rebellion known by the name of Praguery When the king having put it down refused to receive the rebels to favor the dauphin said to his father My lord I must go back with them then for so I promised them Louis replied the king the gates are open and if they are not high enough I will have sixteen or twenty fathom of wall knocked down for you that you may go whither it seems best to you Charles VII had made his son marry Margaret Stuart of Scotland that charming princess who was so smitten with the language and literature of France that coming one day upon the poet Alan Chartier asleep upon a bench she kissed him on the forehead in the presence of her mightily astonished train for he was very ugly The dauphin rendered his wife so wretched that she died in fourteen forty five at the age of one and twenty with these words upon her lips O fie on life Speak to me no more of it In fourteen forty nine just when the king his father was taking up arms to drive the English out of Normandy the dauphin Louis who was now living entirely in Dauphiny concluded at Briancon a secret league with the Duke of Savoy against the ministers of the King of France his enemies In fourteen fifty six in order to escape from the perils brought upon him by the plots which he in the heart of Dauphiny was incessantly hatching against his father Louis fled from Grenoble and went to take refuge in Brussels with the Duke of Burgundy Philip the Good who willingly received him at the same time excusing himself to Charles VII on the ground of the respect he owed to the son of his suzerain and putting at the disposal of Louis his guest a pension of thirty six thousand livres He has received the fox at his court said Charles he will soon see what will become of his chickens But the pleasantries of the king did not chase away the sorrows of the father Mine enemies have full trust in me said Charles but my son will have none If he had but once spoken with me he would have known full well that he ought to have neither doubts nor fears On my royal word if he will but come to me when he has opened his heart and learned my intentions he may go away again whithersoever it seems good to him Charles in his old age and his sorrow forgot how distrustful and how fearful he himself had been It is ever your pleasure wrote one of his councillors to him in a burst of frankness to be shut up in castles wretched places and all sorts of little closets without showing yourself and listening to the complaints of your poor people Charles VII had shown scarcely more confidence to his son than to his people Louis yielded neither to words nor to sorrows of which proofs were reaching him nearly every day He remained impassive at the Duke of Burgundy s where he seemed to be waiting with scandalous indifference for the news of his father s death Charles sank into a state of profound melancholy and general distrust He had his doctor Adam Fumee put in prison persuaded himself that his son had wished and was still wishing to poison him and refused to take any kind of nourishment No representation no solicitation could win him from his depression and obstinacy It was in vain that Charles Duke of Berry his favorite child offered to first taste the food set before him It was in vain that his servants represented to him with tears says Bossuet what madness it was to cause his own death for fear of dying when at last he would have made an effort to eat it was too late and he must die On the second of July fourteen sixty one he asked what day it was and was told that it was saint Magdalen s day Ah said he I do laud my God and thank Him for that it hath pleased Him that the most sinful man in the world should die on the sinful woman s day Dampmartin said he to the count of that name who was leaning over his bed I do beseech you that after my death you will serve so far as you can the little lord my son Charles He called his confessor received the sacraments gave orders that he should be buried at saint Denis beside the king his father and expired No more than his son Louis though for different reasons was his wife Queen Mary of Anjou at his side She was living at Chinon whither she had removed a long while before by order of the king her husband Thus deserted by them of his own household and disgusted with his own life died that king of whom a contemporary chronicler whilst recommending his soul to God re marked When he was alive he was a right wise and valiant lord and he left his kingdom united and in good case as to justice and tranquillity CHAPTER XXV LOUIS XI fourteen sixty one fourteen eighty three Louis XI was thirty eight years old and had been living for five years in voluntary exile at the castle of Genappe in Hainault beyond the dominions of the king his father and within those of Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy when on the twenty threed of July fourteen sixty one the day after Charles VII s death he learned that he was King of France He started at once to return to his own country and take possession of his kingdom He arrived at Rheims on the fourteenth of August was solemnly crowned there on the eighteenth in presence of the two courts of France and Burgundy and on the thirtieth made his entry into Paris within which he had not set foot for six and twenty years In fourteen eighty two twenty one years afterwards he sick and almost dying in his turn at his castle of Plessis les Tours went nevertheless to Amboise where his son the dauphin who was about to become Charles VIII and whom he had not seen for several years was living I do expressly enjoin upon you said the father to the son as my last counsel and my last instructions not to change a single one of the chief officers of the crown When my father King Charles VII went to God and I myself came to the throne I disappointed i e deprived of their appointments all the good and notable knights of the kingdom who had aided and served my said father in conquering Normandy and Guienne in driving the English out of the kingdom and in restoring it to peace and good order for so I found it and right rich also Therefrom much mischief came to me for thence I had the war called the Common Weal which all but cost me my crown With the experience and paternal care of an old man whom the near prospect of death rendered perfectly disinterested wholly selfish as his own life had been Louis s heart was bent upon saving his son from the first error which he himself had committed on mounting the throne Gentlemen said Dunois on rising from table at the funeral banquet held at the abbey of saint Denis in honor of the obsequies of King Charles VII we have lost our master let each look after himself The old warrior foresaw that the new reign would not be like that which had just ended Charles VII had been a prince of indolent disposition more inclined to pleasure than ambition whom the long and severe trials of his life had moulded to government without his having any passion for governing and who had become in a quiet way a wise and powerful king without any eager desire to be incessantly and everywhere chief actor and master His son Louis on the contrary was completely possessed with a craving for doing talking agitating domineering and reaching no matter by what means the different and manifold ends he proposed to himself Anything but prepossessing in appearance supported on long and thin shanks vulgar in looks and often designedly ill dressed and undignified in his manners though haughty in mind he was powerful by the sheer force of a mind marvellously lively subtle unerring ready and inventive and of a character indefatigably active and pursuing success as a passion without any scruple or embarrassment in the employment of means His contemporaries after observing his reign for some time gave him the name of the universal spider so relentlessly did he labor to weave a web of which he himself occupied the centre and extended the filaments in all directions As soon as he was king he indulged himself with that first piece of vindictive satisfaction of which he was in his last moments obliged to acknowledge the mistake At Rheims at the time of his coronation the aged and judicious Duke Philip of Burgundy had begged him to forgive all those who had offended him Louis promised to do so with the exception however of seven persons whom he did not name They were the most faithful and most able advisers of the king his father those who had best served Charles VII even in his embroilments with the dauphin his conspiring and rebellious son viz Anthony de Chabannes Count of Dampmartin Peter de Breze Andrew de Laval Juvenal des Ursins c Some lost their places and were even for a while subjected to persecution the others remaining still at court received there many marks of the king s disfavor On the other hand Louis made a show of treating graciously the men who had most incurred and deserved disgrace at his father s hands notably the Duke of Alencon and the Count of Armagnac Nor was it only in respect of persons that he departed from paternal tradition he rejected it openly in the case of one of the most important acts of Charles VII s reign the Pragmatic Sanction issued by that prince at Bourses in fourteen thirty eight touching the internal regulations of the Church of France and its relations towards the papacy The popes and especially Pius II Louis XI s contemporary had constantly and vigorously protested against that act Barely four months after his accession on the twenty seventh of November fourteen sixty one Louis in order to gain favor with the pope abrogated the Pragmatic Sanction and informed the pope of the fact in a letter full of devotion There was great joy at Rome and the pope replied to the king s letter in the strongest terms of gratitude and commendation But Louis s courtesy had not been so disinterested as it was prompt He had hoped that Pius II would abandon the cause of Ferdinand of Arragon a claimant to the throne of Naples and would uphold that of his rival the French prince John of Anjou Duke of Calabria whose champion Louis had declared himself He bade his ambassador at Rome to remind the pope of the royal hopes You know said the ambassador to Pius II it is only on this condition that the king my master abolished the Pragmatic he was pleased to desire that in his kingdom full obedience should be rendered to you he demands on the other hand that you should be pleased to be a friend to France otherwise I have orders to bid all the French cardinals withdraw and you cannot doubt but that they will obey But Pius II was more proud than Louis XI dared to be imperious He answered We are under very great obligations to the King of France but that gives him no right to exact from us things contrary to justice and to our honor we have sent aid to Ferdinand by virtue of the treaties we have with him let the king your master compel the Duke of Anjou to lay down arms and prosecute his rights by course of justice and if Ferdinand refuse to submit thereto we will declare against him but we cannot promise more If the French who are at our court wish to withdraw the gates are open to them The king a little ashamed at the fruitlessness of his concession and of his threat had for an instant some desire to re establish the Pragmatic Sanction for which the parliament of Paris had taken up the cudgels but all considered he thought it better to put up in silence with his rebuff and pay the penalty for a rash concession than to get involved with the court of Rome in a struggle of which he could not measure the gravity and he contented himself with letting the parliament maintain in principle and partially keep up the Pragmatic This was his first apprenticeship in that outward resignation and patience amidst his own mistakes of which he was destined to be called upon more than once in the course of his life to make a humble but skilful use At the same time that at the pinnacle of government and in his court Louis was thus making his power felt and was engaging a new set of servants he was zealously endeavoring to win over everywhere the middle classes and the populace He left Rouen in the hands of its own inhabitants in Guienne in Auvergne at Tours he gave the burgesses authority to assemble and his orders to the royal agents were Whatever is done see that it be answered for unto us by two of the most notable burgesses of the principal cities At Rheims the rumor ran that under King Louis there would be no more tax or talliage When deputations went before him to complain of the weight of imposts he would say I thank you my dear and good friends for making such remonstrances to me I have nothing more at heart than to put an end to all sorts of exactions and to re establish my kingdom in its ancient liberties I have just been passing five years in the countries of my uncle of Burgundy and there I saw good cities mighty rich and full of inhabitants and folks well clad well housed well off lacking nothing the commerce there is great and the communes there have fine privileges When I came into my own kingdom I saw on the contrary houses in ruins fields without tillage men and women in rags faces pinched and pale It is a great pity and my soul is filled with sorrow at it All my desire is to apply a remedy thereto and with God s help we will bring it to pass The good folks departed charmed with such familiarity so prodigal of hope but facts before long gave the lie to words When the time came for renewing at Rheims the claim for local taxes the people showed opposition and all the papers were burned in the open street The king employed stratagem In order not to encounter overt resistance he caused a large number of his folks to disguise themselves as tillers or artisans and so entering the town they were masters of it before the people could think of defending themselves The ringleaders of the rebellion were drawn and quartered and about a hundred persons were beheaded or hanged At Angers at Alencon and at Aurillac there were similar outbursts similarly punished From that moment it was easy to prognosticate that with the new king familiarity would not prevent severity or even cruelty According to the requirements of the crisis Louis had no more hesitation about violating than about making promises and all the while that he was seeking after popularity he intended to make his power felt at any price How could he have done without heavy imposts and submission on the part of the tax payers For it was not only at home in his own kingdom that he desired to be chief actor and master He pushed his ambition and his activity abroad into divers European states In Italy he had his own claimant to the throne of Naples in opposition to the King of Arragon s In Spain the Kings of Arragon and of Castile were in a state of rivalry and war A sedition broke out in Catalonia Louis XI lent the King of Arragon three hundred and fifty thousand golden crowns to help him in raising eleven hundred lances and reducing the rebels Civil war was devastating England The houses of York and Lancaster were disputing the crown Louis XI kept up relations with both sides and without embroiling himself with the Duke of York who became Edward IV he received at Chinon the heroic Margaret of Anjou wife of Henry VI and lent twenty thousand pounds sterling to that prince then disthroned who undertook either to repay them within a year or to hand over Calais when he was re established upon his throne to the King of France In the same way John II King of Arragon had put Roussillon and Cerdagne into the hands of Louis XI as a security for the loan of three hundred and fifty thousand crowns he had borrowed Amidst all the plans and enterprises of his personal ambition Louis was seriously concerned for the greatness of France but he drew upon her resources and compromised her far beyond what was compatible with her real interests by mixing himself up at every opportunity and by every sort of intrigue with the affairs and quarrels of the kings and peoples around him In France itself he had quite enough of questions to be solved and perils to be surmounted to absorb and satisfy the most vigilant and most active of men Four princes of very unequal power but all eager for independence and preponderance viz Charles Duke of Berry his brother Francis II Duke of Brittany Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy his uncle and John Duke of Bourbon his brother in law were vassals whom he found very troublesome and ever on the point of becoming dangerous It was not long before he had a proof of it In fourteen sixty three two years after Louis s accession the Duke of Burgundy sent one of his most trusty servants John of Croy Sire de Chimay to complain of certain royal acts contrary he said to the treaty of Arras which in fourteen thirty five had regulated the relations between Burgundy and the crown The envoy had great difficulty in getting audience of the king who would not even listen for more than a single moment and that as he was going out of his room when almost without heeding he said abruptly What manner of man then is this Duke of Burgundy Is he of other metal than the other lords of the realm Yes sir replied Chimay he is of other metal for he protected you and maintained you against the will of your father King Charles and against the opinion of all those who were opposed to you in the kingdom which no other prince or lord would have dared to do Louis went back into his room without a word How dared you speak so to the king said Dunois to Chimay Had I been fifty leagues away from here said the Burgundian and had I thought that the king had an idea only of addressing such words to me I would have come back express to speak to him as I have spoken The Duke of Brittany was less puissant and less proudly served than the Duke of Burgundy but being vain and inconsiderate he was incessantly attempting to exalt himself above his condition of vassal and to raise his duchy into a sovereignty and when his pretensions were rejected he entered at one time with the King of England and at another with the Duke of Burgundy and the malcontents of France upon intrigues which amounted very nearly to treason against the king his suzerain Charles Louis s younger brother was a soft and mediocre but jealous and timidly ambitious prince he remembered moreover the preference and the wishes manifested on his account by Charles VII their common father on his death bed and he considered his position as Duke of Berry very inferior to the hopes he believed himself entitled to nourish Duke John of Bourbon on espousing a sister of Louis XI had flattered himself that this marriage and the remembrance of the valor he had displayed in fourteen fifty at the battle of Formigny would be worth to him at least the sword of constable but Louis had refused to give it him When all these great malcontents saw Louis s popularity on the decline and the king engaged abroad in divers political designs full of onerousness or embarrassment they considered the moment to have come and at the end of fourteen sixty four formed together an alliance for to remonstrate with the king says Commynes upon the bad order and injustice he kept up in his kingdom considering themselves strong enough to force him if he would not mend his ways and this war was called the common weal because it was undertaken under color of being for the common weal of the kingdom the which was soon converted into private weal The aged Duke of Burgundy sensible and weary as he was gave only a hesitating and slack adherence to the league but his son Charles Count of Charolais entered into it passionately and the father was no more in a condition to resist his son than he was inclined to follow him The number of the declared malcontents increased rapidly and the chiefs received at Paris itself in the church of Notre Dame the adhesion and the signatures of those who wished to join them They all wore for recognition s sake a band of red silk round their waists and there were more than five hundred says Oliver de la Marche a confidential servant of the Count of Charolais princes as well as knights dames damsels and esquires who were well acquainted with this alliance without the king s knowing anything as yet about it It is difficult to believe the chronicler s last assertion Louis XI it is true was more distrustful than far sighted and though he placed but little reliance in his advisers and servants he had so much confidence in himself his own sagacity and his own ability that he easily deluded himself about the perils of his position but the facts which have just been set forth were too serious and too patent to have escaped his notice However that may be he had no sooner obtained a clear insight into the league of the princes than he set to work with his usual activity and knowledge of the world to checkmate it To rally together his own partisans and to separate his foes such was the twofold end he pursued at first with some success In a meeting of the princes which was held at Tours and in which friends and enemies were still mingled together he used language which could not fail to meet their views He was powerless he said to remedy the evils of the kingdom without the love and fealty of the princes of the blood and the other lords they were the pillars of the state without their help one man alone could not bear the weight of the crown Many of those present declared their fealty You are our king our sovereign lord said King Rene Duke of Anjou we thank you for the kind gracious and honest words you have just used to us I say to you on behalf of all our lords here present that we will serve you in respect of and against every one according as it may please you to order us Louis by a manifesto addressed himself also to the good towns and to all his kingdom He deplored therein the enticements which had been suffered to draw away his brother the Duke of Berry and other princes churchmen and nobles who would never have consented to this league if they had borne in mind the horrible calamities of the kingdom and especially the English those ancient enemies who might well come down again upon it as heretofore They proclaim said he that they will abolish the imposts that is what has always been declared by the seditious and rebellious but instead of relieving they ruin the poor people Had I been willing to augment their pay and permit them to trample their vassals under foot as in time past they would never have given a thought to the common weal They pretend that they desire to establish order everywhere and yet they cannot endure it anywhere whilst I without drawing from my people more than was drawn by the late king pay my men at arms well and keep them in a good state of discipline Louis in his latter words was a little too boastful He had very much augmented the imposts without assembling the estates and without caring for the old public liberties If he frequently repressed local tyranny on the part of the lords he did not deny himself the practice of it Amongst other tastes he was passionately fond of the chase and wherever he lived he put it down amongst his neighbors noble or other without any regard for rights of lordship Hounds hawking birds nets snares all the implements of hunting were forbidden He even went so far it is said on one occasion as to have two gentlemen s ears cut off for killing a hare on their own property Nevertheless the publication of his manifesto did him good service Auvergne Dauphiny Languedoc Lyon and Bordeaux turned a deaf ear to all temptations from the league of princes Paris above all remained faithful to the king Orders were given at the Hotel de Ville that the principal gates of the city should be walled up and that there should be a night watch on the ramparts and the burgesses were warned to lay in provision of arms and victual Marshal Joachim Rouault lord of Gamaches arrived at Paris on the thirtieth of June fourteen sixty five at the head of a body of men at arms to protect the city against the Count of Charolais who was coming up and the king himself not content with despatching four of his chief officers to thank the Parisians for their loyal zeal wrote to them that he would send the queen to lie in at Paris the city he loved most in the world Louis would have been glad to have nothing to do but to negotiate and talk Though he was personally brave he did not like war and its unforeseen issues He belonged to the class of ambitious despots who prefer stratagem to force But the very ablest speeches and artifices even if they do not remain entirely fruitless are not sufficient to reduce matters promptly to order when great interests are threatened passions violently excited and factions let loose in the arena Between the League of the Common Neal and Louis XI there was a question too great to be at the very outset settled peacefully It was feudalism in decline at grips with the kingship which had been growing greater and greater for two centuries The lords did not trust the king s promises and one amongst those lords was too powerful to yield without a fight At the beginning Louis had in Auvergne and in Berry some successes which decided a few of the rebels the most insignificant to accept truces and enter upon parleys but the great princes the Dukes of Burgundy Brittany and Berry waxed more and more angry The aged Duke of Burgundy Philip the Good himself sobered and wearied as he was threw himself passionately into the struggle Go said he to his son Count Charles of Charolais maintain thine honor well and if thou have need of a hundred thousand more men to deliver thee from difficulty I myself will lead them to thee Charles marched promptly on Paris Louis on his side moved thither with the design and in the hope of getting in there without fighting But the Burgundians posted at saint Denis and the environs barred his approach His seneschal Peter de Breze advised him to first attack the Bretons who were advancing to join the Burgundians Louis looking at him somewhat mistrustfully said You too Sir Seneschal have signed this League of the Common Weal Ay sir answered Brez with a laugh they have my signature but you have myself Would you be afraid to try conclusions with the Burgundians continued the king Nay verily replied the seneschal I will let that be seen in the first battle Louis continued his march on Paris The two armies met at Montlhery on the sixteenth of July fourteen sixty five Breze who commanded the king s advance guard immediately went into action and was one of the first to be killed Louis came up to his assistance with troops in rather loose order the affair became hot and general the French for a moment wavered and a rumor ran through the ranks that the king had just been killed No my friends said Louis taking off his helmet no I am not dead defend your king with good courage The wavering was transferred to the Burgundians Count Charles himself was so closely pressed that a French man at arms laid his hand on him saying Yield you my lord I know you well let not yourself be slain A rescue cried Charles I ll not leave you my friends unless by death I am here to live and die with you He was wounded by a sword thrust which entered his neck between his helmet and his breastplate badly fastened Disorder set in on both sides without either s being certain how things were or being able to consider itself victorious Night came on and French and Burgundians encamped before Montlhery The Count of Charolais sat down on two heaps of straw and had his wound dressed Around him were the stripped corpses of the slain As they were being moved to make room for him a poor wounded creature somewhat revived by the motion recovered consciousness and asked for a drink The count made them pour down his throat a drop of his own mixture for he never drank wine The wounded man came completely to himself and recovered It was one of the archers of his guard Next day news was brought to Charles that the Bretons were coming up with their own duke the Duke of Berry and Count Dunois at their head He went as far as Etampes to meet them and informed them of what had just happened The Duke of Berry was very much distressed it was a great pity he said that so many people had been killed he heartily wished that the war had never been begun Did you hear said the Count of Charolais to his servants how yonder fellow talks He is upset at the sight of seven or eight hundred wounded men going about the town folks who are nothing to him and whom he does not even know he would be still more upset if the matter touched him nearly he is just the sort of fellow to readily make his own terms and leave us stuck in the mud we must secure other friends And he forthwith made one of his people post off to England to draw closer the alliance between Burgundy and Edward IV Louis meanwhile after passing a day at Corbeil had once more on the eighteenth of July entered Paris the object of his chief solicitude He dismounted at his lieutenant s the Sire de Meinn s and asked for some supper Several persons burgesses and their wives took supper with him He excited their lively interest by describing to them the battle of Montlhery the danger he had run there and the scenes which had been enacted adopting at one time a pathetic and at another a bantering tone and exciting by turns the emotion and the laughter of his audience In three days he said he would return to fight his enemies in order to finish the war but he had not enough of men at arms and all had not at that moment such good spirits as he He passed a fortnight in Paris devoting himself solely to the task of winning the hearts of the Parisians reducing imposts giving audience to everybody lending a favorable ear to every opinion offered him making no inquiry as to who had been more or less faithful to him showing clemency without appearing to be aware of it and not punishing with severity even those who had served as guides to the Burgundians in the pillaging of the villages around Paris A crier of the Chatelet who had gone crying about the streets the day on which the Burgundians attacked the gate of saint Denis was sentenced only to a month s imprisonment bread and water and a flogging He was marched through the city in a night man s cart and the king meeting the procession called out as he passed to the executioner Strike hard and spare not that ribald he has well deserved it Meanwhile the Burgundians were approaching Paris and pressing it more closely every day Their different allies in the League were coming up with troops to join them including even some of those who after having suffered reverses in Auvergne had concluded truces with the king The forces scattered around Paris amounted it is said to fifty thousand men and occupied Charenton Conflans saint Maur and saint Denis making ready for a serious attack upon the place Louis notwithstanding his firm persuasion that things always went ill wherever he was not present in person left Paris for Rouen to call out and bring up the regulars and reserves of Normandy In his absence interviews and parleys took place between besiegers and besieged The former found partisans amongst the inhabitants of Paris in the Hotel de Ville itself The Count de Dunois made capital of all the grievances of the League against the king s government and declared that if the city refused to receive the princes the authors of this refusal would have to answer for whatever misery loss and damage might come of it and in spite of all efforts on the part of the king s officers and friends some wavering was manifested in certain quarters But there arrived from Normandy considerable re enforcements announcing the early return of the king And in fact he entered Paris on the twenty eighth of August the mass of the people testifying their joy and singing Noel Louis made as if he knew nothing of what had happened in his absence and gave nobody a black look only four or five burgesses too much compromised by their relations with the besiegers were banished to Orleans Sharp skirmishes were frequent all round the place there was cannonading on both sides and some balls from Paris came tumbling about the quarters of the Count of Charolais and killed a few of his people before his very door But Louis did not care to risk a battle He was much impressed by the enemy s strength and by the weakness of which glimpses had been seen in Paris during his absence Whilst his men of war were fighting here and there he opened negotiations Local and temporary truces were accepted and agents of the king had conferences with others from the chiefs of the League The princes showed so exacting a spirit that there was no treating on such conditions and Louis determined to see whether he could not succeed better than his agents He had an interview of two hours duration in front of the saint Anthony gate with the Count of saint Poi a confidant of the Count of Charolais On his return he found before the gate some burgesses waiting for news Illustration Louis XI and Burgesses waiting for News one hundred ninety three Well my friends said he the Burgundians will not give you so much trouble any more as they have given you in the past That is all very well sir replied an attorney of the Chatelet but meanwhile they eat our grapes and gather our vintage without any hinderance Still said the king that is better than if they were to come and drink your wine in your cellars The month of September passed thus in parleys without result Bad news came from Rouen the League had a party in that city Louis felt that the Count of Charolais was the real head of the opposition and the only one with whom anything definite could he arrived at He resolved to make a direct attempt upon him for he had confidence in the influence he could obtain over people when he chatted and treated in person with them One day he got aboard of a little boat with five of his officers and went over to the left bank of the Seine There the Count of Charolais was awaiting him Will you insure me brother said the king as he stepped ashore Yes my lord as a brother said the count The king embraced him and went on I quite see brother that you are a gentleman and of the house of France How so my lord When I sent my ambassadors lately in fourteen sixty four to Lille on an errand to my uncle your father and yourself and when my chancellor that fool of a Morvilliers made you such a fine speech you sent me word by the Archbishop of Narbonne that I should repent me of the words spoken to you by that Morvilliers and that before a year was over Piques Dieu you ve kept your promise and before the end of the year has come I like to have to do with folks who hold to what they promise This he said laughingly knowing well that this language was just the sort of flattery to touch the Count of Charolais They walked for a long while together on the river s bank to the great curiosity of their people who were surprised to see them conversing on such good terms They talked of possible conditions of peace both of them displaying considerable pliancy save the king touching the duchy of Normandy which he would not at any price he said confer on his brother the Duke of Berry and the Count of Charolais touching his enmity towards the house of Croy with which he was determined not to be reconciled At parting the king invited the count to Paris where he would make him great cheer My lord said Charles I have made a vow not to enter any good town until my return The king smiled gave fifty golden crowns for distribution to drink his health amongst the count s archers and once more got aboard of his boat Shortly after getting back to Paris he learned that Normandy was lost to him The widow of the seneschal De Breze lately killed at Montlhery forgetful of all the king s kindnesses and against the will of her own son whom Louis had appointed seneschal of Normandy after his father s death had just handed over Rouen to the Duke of Bourbon one of the most determined chiefs of the League Louis at once took his course He sent to demand an interview with the Count of Charolais and repaired to Conflans with a hundred Scots of his guard There was a second edition of the walk together Charles knew nothing as yet about the surrender of Rouen and Louis lost no time in telling him of it before he had leisure for reflection and for magnifying his pretensions Since the Normans said he have of themselves felt disposed for such a novelty so be it I should never of my own free will have conferred such an appanage on my brother but as the thing is done I give my consent And he at the same time assented to all the other conditions which had formed the subject of conversation In proportion to the resignation displayed by the king was the joy of the Count of Charolais at seeing himself so near to peace Everything was going wrong with his army provisions were short murmurs and dissensions were setting in and the League of common weal was on the point of ending in a shameful catastrophe Whilst strolling and conversing with cordiality the two princes kept advancing towards Paris Without noticing it they passed within the entrance of a strong palisade which the king had caused to be erected in front of the city walls and which marked the boundary line All on a sudden they stopped both of them disconcerted The Burgundian found himself within the hostile camp but he kept a good countenance and simply continued the conversation Amongst his army however when he was observed to be away so long there was already a feeling of deep anxiety The chieftains had met together If this young prince said the marshal of Burgundy has gone to his own ruin like a fool let us not ruin his house Let every man retire to his quarters and hold himself in readiness without disturbing himself about what may happen By keeping together we are in a condition to fall back on the marches of Hainault Picardy or Burgundy The veteran warrior mounted his horse and rode forward in the direction of Paris to see whether Count Charles were coming back or not It was not long before he saw a troop of forty or fifty horse moving towards him They were the Burgundian prince and an escort of the king s own guard Charles dismissed the escort and came up to the marshal saying Don t say a word I acknowledge my folly but I saw it too late I was already close to the works Everybody can see that I was not there said the marshal if I had been it would never have happened You know your highness that I am only on loan to you as long as your father lives Charles made no reply and returned to his own camp where all congratulated him and rendered homage to the king s honorable conduct Negotiations for peace were opened forthwith There was no difficulty about them Louis was ready to make sacrifices as soon as be recognized the necessity for them being quite determined however in his heart to recall them as soon as fortune came back to him Two distinct treaties were concluded one at Conflans on the fifth of October fourteen sixty five between Louis and the Count of Charolais and the other at saint Maur on the twenty ninth of October between Louis and the other princes of the League By one or the other of the treaties the king granted nearly every demand that had been made upon him to the Count of Charolais he gave up all the towns of importance in Picardy to the Duke of Berry he gave the duchy of Normandy with entire sovereignty and the other princes independently of the different territories that had been conceded to them all received large sums in ready money The conditions of peace had already been agreed to when the Burgundians went so far as to summon into the bargain the strong place of Beauvais Louis quietly complained to Charles If you wanted this town said he you should have asked me for it and I would have given it to you but peace is made and it ought to be observed Charles openly disavowed the deed When peace was proclaimed on the thirtieth of October the king went to Vincennes to receive the homage of his brother Charles for the duchy of Normandy and that of the Count of Charolais for the lands of Picardy The count asked the king to give up to him for that day the castle of Vincennes for the security of all Louis made no objection and the gate and apartments of the castle were guarded by the count s own people But the Parisians whose favor Louis had won were alarmed on his account Twenty two thousand men of the city militia marched towards the outskirts of Vincennes and obliged the king to return and sleep at Paris He went almost alone to the grand review which the Count of Charolais held of his army before giving the word for marching away and passed from rank to rank speaking graciously to his late enemies The king and the count on separating embraced one another the count saying in a loud voice Gentlemen you and I are at the command of the king my sovereign lord who is here present to serve him whensoever there shall be need When the treaties of Conflans and saint Maur were put before the parliament to be registered the parliament at first refused and the exchequer chamber followed suit but the king insisted in the name of necessity and the registration took place subject to a declaration on the part of the parliament that it was forced to obey Louis at bottom was not sorry for this resistance and himself made a secret protest against the treaties he had just signed At the outset of the negotiations it had been agreed that thirty six notables twelve prelates twelve knights and twelve members of the council should assemble to inquire into the errors committed in the government of the kingdom and to apply remedies They were to meet on the fifteenth of December and to have terminated their labors in two months at the least and in three months and ten days at the most The king promised on his word to abide firmly and stably by what they should decree But this commission was nearly a year behind time in assembling and even when it was assembled its labors were so slow and so futile that the Count de Dampmartin was quite justified in writing to the Count of Charolais become by his father s death Duke of Burgundy The League of common weal has become nothing but the League of common woe Scarcely were the treaties signed and the princes returned each to his own dominions when a quarrel arose between the Duke of Brittany and the new Duke of Normandy Louis who was watching for dissensions between his enemies went at once to see the Duke of Brittany and made with him a private convention for mutual security Then having his movements free he suddenly entered Normandy to retake possession of it as a province which notwithstanding the cession of it just made to his brother the King of France could not dispense with Evreux Gisors Gournay Louviers and even Rouen fell without much resistance again into his power The Duke of Berry made a vigorous appeal for support to his late ally the Duke of Burgundy in order to remain master of the new duchy which had been conferred upon him under the late treaties The Count of Charolais was at that time taking up little by little the government of the Burgundian dominions in the name of his father the aged Duke Philip who was ill and near his end but by pleading his own engagements and especially his ever renewed struggle with his Flemish subjects the Liegese the count escaped from the necessity of satisfying the Duke of Berry In order to be safe in the direction of Burgundy as well as that of Brittany Louis had entered into negotiations with Edward IV King of England and had made him offers perhaps even promises which seemed to trench upon the rights ceded by the treaty of Conflans to the Duke of Burgundy as to certain districts of Picardy The Count of Charolais was informed of it and in his impetuous wrath he wrote to King Louis dubbing him simply Sir instead of giving him according to the usage between vassal and suzerain the title of My most dread lord May it please you to wit that some time ago I was apprised of a matter at which I cannot be too much astounded It is with great sorrow that I name it to you when I remember the fair expressions I have all through this year had from you both in writing and by word of mouth It is certain that parley has been held between your people and those of the King of England that you have thought proper to assign to them the district of Caux and the city of Rouen that you have promised to obtain from them Abbeville and the count ship of Ponthieu and that you have concluded with them certain alliances against me and my country whilst making them large offers to my prejudice Of what is yours sir you may dispose according to your pleasure but it seems to me that you might do better than wish to take from my hands what is mine in order to give it to the English or to any other foreign nation I pray you therefore sir if such overtures have been made by your people to be pleased not to consent thereto in any way but to put a stop to the whole to the end that I may remain your most humble servant as I desire to be Louis returned no answer to this letter He contented him self with sending to the commission of thirty six notables then in session at Etampes for the purpose of considering the reform of the kingdom a request to represent to the Count of Charolais the impropriety of such language and to appeal for the punishment of the persons who had suggested it to him The count made some awkward excuses at the same time that he persisted in complaining of the king s obstinate pretensions and underhand ways A serious incident now happened which for a while distracted the attention of the two rivals from their mutual recriminations Duke Philip the Good who had for some time past been visibly declining in body and mind was visited at Bruges by a stroke of apoplexy soon discovered to be fatal His son the Count of Charolais was at Ghent At the first whisper of danger he mounted his horse and without a moment s halt arrived at Bruges on the fifteenth of June fourteen sixty seven and ran to his father s room who had already lost speech and consciousness Father father cried the count on his knees and sobbing give me your blessing and if I have offended you forgive me My lord added the Bishop of Bethlehem the dying man s confessor if you only hear us bear witness by some sign The duke turned his eyes a little towards his son and seemed to feebly press his hand This was his last effort of life and in the evening after some hours of passive agony he died His son flung himself upon the bed He shrieked he wept he wrung his hands says George Chatelain one of the aged duke s oldest and most trusted servants and for many a long day tears were mingled with all his words every time he spoke to those who had been in the service of the dead so much so that every one marvelled at his immeasurable grief it had never heretofore been thought that he could feel a quarter of the sorrow he showed for he was thought to have a sterner heart whatever cause there might have been but nature overcame him Nor was it to his son alone that Duke Philip had been so good and left so many grounds for sorrow With you we lose was the saying amongst the crowd that followed the procession through the streets with you we lose our good old duke the best the gentlest the friendliest of princes our peace and eke our joy Amidst such fearful storms you at last brought us out into tranquillity and good order you set justice on her seat and gave free course to commerce And now you are dead and we are orphans Many voices it is said added in a lower tone You leave us in hands whereof the weight is unknown to us we know not into what perils we may be brought by the power that is to be over us over us so accustomed to yours under which we most of us were born and grew up What the people were anxiously forecasting Louis foresaw with certainty and took his measures accordingly A few days after the death of Philip the Good several of the principal Flemish cities Ghent first and then Liege rose against the new Duke of Burgundy in defence of their liberties already ignored or threatened The intrigues of Louis were not unconnected with these solicitations He would undoubtedly have been very glad to have seen his most formidable enemy beset at the very commencement of his ducal reign by serious embarrassments and obliged to let the king of France settle without trouble his differences with his brother Duke Charles of Berry and with the Duke of Brittany But the new Duke of Burgundy was speedily triumphant over the Flemish insurrections and after these successes at the close of the year fourteen sixty seven he was so powerful and so unfettered in his movements that Louis might with good reason fear the formation of a fresh league amongst his great neighbors in coalition against him and perhaps even in communication with the English who were ever ready to seek in France allies for the furtherance of their attempts to regain there the fortunes wrested from them by Joan of Arc and Charles VII In view of such a position Louis formed a resolution unpalatable no doubt to one so jealous of his own power but indicative of intelligence and boldness he confronted the difficulties of home government in order to prevent perils from without The remembrance had not yet faded of the energy displayed and the services rendered in the first part of Charles VII s reign by the states general a wish was manifested for their resuscitation and they were spoken of even in the popular doggerel as the most effectual remedy for the evils of the period But what says Paris She is deaf and dumb Dares she not speak Nor she nor parliament The clergy O the clergy are kept mum Upon your oath Yes on the sacrament The nobles then The nobles are still worse And justice Hath nor balances nor weights Who then may hope to mitigate this curse Who prithee who Why France s three estates Be pleased O prince to grant alleviation To whom To the good citizen who waits For what The right of governing the nation Through whom pray whom Why France s three estates In the face of the evil Louis felt no fear of the remedy He summoned the states general to a meeting at Tours on the first of April fourteen sixty eight Twenty eight lords in person besides representatives of several others who were unable to be there themselves and a hundred and ninety two deputies elected by sixty four towns met in session The chancellor Juvenal des Ursins explained in presence of the king the object of the meeting It is to take cognizance of the differences which have arisen between the king and Sir Charles his brother in respect of the duchy of Normandy and the appanage of the said Sir Charles likewise the great excesses and encroachments which the Duke of Brittany hath committed against the king by seizing his places and subjects and making open war upon him and thirdly the communication which is said to be kept up by the Duke of Brittany with the English in order to bring them down upon this country and hand over to them the places he doth hold in Normandy Whereupon we are of opinion that the people of the three estates should give their good advice and council After this official programme the king and his councillors withdrew The estates deliberated during seven or eight sessions and came to an agreement without any opposition or difficulty whatever that as touching the duchy of Normandy it ought not to and cannot be separated from the crown in any way whatsoever but must remain united annexed and conjoined thereto inseparably Further any arrangement of the Duke of Brittany with the English is a thing damnable pernicious and of most evil consequences and one which is not to be permitted suffered or tolerated in any way Lastly if Sir Charles the Duke of Brittany or others did make war on the king our sovereign lord or have any treaty or connection with his enemies the king is bound to proceed against them who should do so according to what must be done in such case for the tranquillity and security of the realm And as often soever as the said cases may occur the people of the estates have agreed and consented do agree and consent that without waiting for other assemblage or congregation of the estates the king have power to do all that comports with order and justice the said estates promising and agreeing to serve and aid the king touching these matters to obey him with all their might and to live and die with him in this quarrel Louis XI himself could demand no more Had they been more experienced and far sighted the states general of fourteen sixty eight would not have been disposed to resign even temporarily into the hands of the kingship their rights and their part in the government of the country but they showed patriotism and good sense in defending the integrity of the kingdom national unity and public order against the selfish ambition and disorderly violence of feudalism Fortified by their burst of attachment Louis by the treaty of Ancenis signed on the tenth of September fourteen sixty eight put an end to his differences with Francis II Duke of Brittany who gave up his alliance with the house of Burgundy and undertook to prevail upon Duke Charles of France to accept an arbitration for the purpose of settling before two years were over the question of his territorial appanage in the place of Normandy In the meanwhile a pension of sixty thousand livres was to be paid by the crown to that prince Thus Louis was left with the new duke Charles of Burgundy as the only adversary he had to face His advisers were divided as to the course to be taken with this formidable vassal Was he to be dealt with by war or by negotiation Count de Dampmartin Marshal de Rouault and nearly all the military men earnestly advised war Leave it to us they said we will give the king a good account of this Duke of Burgundy Plague upon it what do these Burgundians mean They have called in the English and made alliance with them in order to give us battle they have handed over the country to fire and sword they have driven the king from his lordship We have suffered too much we must have revenge down upon them in the name of the devil down upon them The king makes a sheep of himself and bargains for his wool and his skin as if he had not wherewithal to defend himself Sdeath if we were in his place we would rather risk the whole kingdom than let ourselves be treated in this fashion But the king did not like to risk the kingdom and he had more confidence in negotiation than in war Two of his principal advisers the constable De saint Pol and the cardinal De la Balue Bishop of Evreux were of his opinion and urged him to the top of his bent Of them he especially made use in his more or less secret relations with the Duke of Burgundy and he charged them to sound him with respect to a personal interview between himself and the duke It has been very well remarked by M de Barante in his Histoire des Dues de Bourgogne that Louis had a great idea of the influence he gained over people by his wits and his language he was always convinced that people never said what ought to be said and that they did not set to work the right way It was a certain way of pleasing him to give him promise of a success which he would owe to himself alone and the constable and the cardinal did not fail to do so They found the Duke of Burgundy very little disposed to accept the king s overtures By saint George said he I ask nothing but what is just and reasonable I desire the fulfilment of the treaties of Arras and of Conflans to which the king has sworn I make no war on him it is he who is coming to make it on me but should he bring all the forces of his kingdom I will not budge from here or recoil the length of my foot My predecessors have seen themselves in worse plight and have not been dismayed Neither the constable De saint Pol nor the cardinal De la Balue said anything to the king about this rough disposition on the part of Duke Charles they both in their own personal interest desired the interview and did not care to bring to light anything that might be an obstacle to it Louis persisted in his desire and sent to ask the duke for a letter of safe conduct Charles wrote with his own hand on the eighth of October fourteen sixty eight as follows My lord if it is your pleasure to come to this town of Peronne for to see us I swear to you and promise you by my faith and on my honor that you may come remain sojourn and go back safely to the places of Chauny and Noy on at your pleasure as many times as it may please you freely and frankly without any hinderance to you or to any of your folks from me or others in any case whatever and whatsoever may happen Illustration Charles the Rash two hundred three When this letter arrived at Noyon extreme surprise and alarm were displayed about Louis the interview appeared to be a mad idea the vicegerent vidam of Amiens came hurrying up with a countryman who declared on his life that mylord of Burgundy wished for it only to make an attempt upon the king s person the king s greatest enemies it was said were already or soon would be with the duke and the captains vehemently reiterated their objections But Louis held to his purpose and started for Noyon on the twod of October taking with him the constable the cardinal his confessor and for all his escort fourscore of his faithful Scots and sixty men at arms This knowing gossip as his contemporaries called him had fits of rashness and audacious vanity Duke Charles went to meet him outside the town They embraced one another and returned on foot to Peronne chatting familiarly and the king with his hand resting on the duke s shoulder in token of amity Louis had quarters at the house of the chamberlain of the town the castle of Peronne being it was said in too bad a state and too ill furnished for his reception On the very day that the king entered Peronne the duke s army commanded by the Marshal of Burgundy arrived from the opposite side and encamped beneath the walls Several former servants of the king now not on good terms with him accompanied the Burgundian army As soon as the king was apprised of the arrival of these folks says Commynes he had a great fright and sent to beg of the Duke of Burgundy that he might be lodged at the castle seeing that all those who had come were evil disposed towards him The duke was very much rejoiced thereat had him lodged there and stoutly assured him that he had no cause for doubt Next day parleys began between the councillors of the two princes They did not appear much disposed to come to an understanding and a little sourness of spirit was beginning to show itself on both sides when there came news which excited a grand commotion King Louis on coming to Peronne had not considered says Commynes that he had sent two ambassadors to the folks of Liege to excite them against the duke Nevertheless the said ambassadors had advanced matters so well that they had already made a great mass of rebels The Liegese came and took by surprise the town of Tongres wherein were the Bishop of Liege and the Lord of Humbercourt whom they took also slaying moreover some servants of the said bishop The fugitives who reported this news at Peronne made the matter a great deal worse than it was they had no doubt they said but that the bishop and Sire d Humbercourt had also been murdered and Charles had no more doubt about it than they His fury was extreme he strode to and fro everywhere relating the news from Liege So the king said he came here only to deceive me it is he who by his ambassadors excited these bad folks of Liege but by saint George they shall be severely punished for it and he himself shall have cause to repent He gave immediate orders to have the gates of the town and of the castle closed and guarded by the archers but being a little troubled nevertheless as to the effect which would be produced by this order he gave as his reason for it that he was quite determined to have recovered a box full of gold and jewels which had been stolen from him I verily believe says Commynes that if just then the duke had found those whom he addressed ready to encourage him or advise him to do the king a bad turn he would have done it but at that time I was still with the said duke I served him as chamberlain and I slept in his room when I pleased for such was the usage of that house With me was there none at this speech of the duke s save two grooms of the chamber one called Charles de Visen a native of Dijon an honest man and one who had great credit with his master and we exasperated nought but assuaged according to our power Whilst Duke Charles was thus abandoning himself to the first outburst of his wrath King Louis remained impassive in the castle of Peronne quite close to the great tower wherein about the year nine hundred twenty five King Charles the Simple had been confined by Herbert Count of Vermandois and died a prisoner in nine hundred twenty nine None of Louis s people had been removed from him but the gate of the castle was strictly guarded There was no entering on his service but by the wicket and none of the duke s people came to visit him he had no occasion to parley explain himself and guess what it was expedient for him to say or do he was alone wrestling with his imagination and his lively impressions with the feeling upon him of the recent mistakes he had committed especially in exciting the Liegese to rebellion and forgetting the fact just when he was coming to place himself in his enemy s hands Far however from losing his head Louis displayed in this perilous trial all the penetration activity and shrewdness of his mind together with all the suppleness of his character he sent by his own servants questions offers and promises to all the duke s servants from whom he could hope for any help or any good advice Fifteen thousand golden crowns with which he had provided himself at starting were given by him to be distributed amongst the household of the Duke of Burgundy a liberality which was perhaps useless since it is said that he to whom he had intrusted the sum kept a good portion of it for himself The king passed two days in this state of gloomy expectancy as to what was in preparation against him On the eleventh of October Duke Charles having cooled down a little assembled his council The sitting lasted all the day and part of the night Louis had sent to make an offer to swear a peace such as at the moment of his arrival had been proposed to him without any reservation or difficulty on his part He engaged to join the duke in making war upon the Liegese and chastising them for their rebellion He would leave as hostages his nearest relatives and his most intimate advisers At the beginning of the council his proposals were not even listened to there was no talk but of keeping the king a prisoner and sending after his brother the Prince Charles with whom the entire government of the kingdom should be arranged the messenger had orders to be in readiness to start at once his horse was in the court yard he was only waiting for the letters which the duke was writing to Brittany The chancellor of Burgundy and some of the wiser councillors besought the duke to reflect The king had come to Peronne on the faith of his safe conduct it would be an eternal dishonor for the house of Burgundy if he broke his word to his sovereign lord and the conditions which the king was prepared to grant would put an end with advantage to Burgundy to serious and difficult business The duke gave heed to these honest and prudent counsels the news from Liege turned out to be less serious than the first rumors had represented the bishop and Sire d Humbercourt had been set at liberty Charles retired to his chamber and there without thinking of undressing he walked to and fro with long strides threw himself upon his bed got up again and soliloquized out loud addressing himself occasionally to Commynes who lay close by him Towards morning though he still showed signs of irritation his language was less threatening He has promised me said he to come with me to reinstate the Bishop of Liege who is my brother in law and a relation of his also he shall certainly come I shall not scruple to hold him to his word that he gave me and he at once sent Sires de Crequi de Charni and de la Roche to tell the king that he was about to come and swear peace with him Commynes had only just time to tell Louis in what frame of mind the duke was and in what danger he would place himself if he hesitated either to swear peace or to march against the Liegese As soon as it was broad day the duke entered the apartment of the castle where the king was a prisoner His look was courteous but his voice trembled with choler his words were short and bitter his manner was threatening A little troubled at his aspect Louis said Brother I am safe am I not in your house and your country Yes sir answered the duke so safe that if I saw an arrow from a bow coming towards you I would throw myself in the way to protect you But will you not be pleased to swear the treaty just as it is written Yes said the king and I thank you for your good will And will you not be pleased to come with me to Liege to help me punish the treason committed against me by these Lidgese all through you and your journey hither The bishop is your near relative of the house of Bourbon Yes Padues Dieu replied Louis and I am much astounded at their wickedness But begin we by swearing this treaty and then I will start with as many or as few of my people as you please Forthwith was taken out from the king s boxes the wood of the so called true cross which was named the cross of saint Laud because it had been preserved in the church of saint Laud at Angers It was supposed to have formerly belonged to Charlemagne and it was the relic which Louis regarded as the most sacred The treaty was immediately signed without any change being made in that of Conflans The Duke of Burgundy merely engaged to use his influence with Prince Charles of France to induce him to be content with Brie and Champagne as appanage The storm was weathered and Louis almost rejoiced at seeing himself called upon to chastise in person the Liegese who had made him commit such a mistake and run such a risk Next day the two princes set out together Charles with his army and Louis with his modest train increased by three hundred men at arms whom he had sent for from France On the twenty seventh of October they arrived before Liege Since Duke Charles s late victories the city had no longer any ramparts or ditches nothing seemed easier than to get into it but the besieged could not persuade themselves that Louis was sincerely allied with the Duke of Burgundy and they made a sortie shouting Hurrah for the king Hurrah for France Great was their surprise when they saw Louis advancing in person wearing in his hat the cross of saint Andrew of Burgundy and shouting Hurrah for Burgundy Some even amongst the French who surrounded the king were shocked they could not reconcile themselves to so little pride and such brazen falsehood Louis took no heed of their temper and never ceased to repeat When pride rides before shame and hurt follow close after The surprise of the Liegese was transformed into indignation Illustration Louis XI and Charles the Rash at Peronne two hundred nine They made a more energetic and a longer resistance than had been expected The besiegers confident in their strength kept careless watch and the sorties of the besieged became more numerous One night Charles received notice that his men had just been attacked in a suburb which they had held and were flying He mounted his horse gave orders not to awake the king repaired by himself to the place where the fight was put everything to rights and came back and told the whole affair to Louis who exhibited great joy Another time one dark and rainy night there was an alarm about midnight of a general attack upon the whole Burgundian camp The duke was soon up and a moment afterwards the king arrived There was great disorder The Liegese sallied by this gate said some No said others it was by that gate there was nothing known for certain and there were no orders given Charles was impetuous and brave but he was easily disconcerted and his servants were somewhat vexed not to see him putting a better countenance on things before the king Louis on the other hand was cool and calm giving commands firmly and ready to assume responsibility wherever he happened to be Take what men you have said he to the constable saint Poi who was at his side and go in this direction if they are really coming upon us they will pass that way It was discovered to be a false alarm Two days afterwards there was a more serious affair The inhabitants of a canton which was close to the city and was called Franchemont resolved to make a desperate effort and go and fall suddenly upon the very spot where the two princes were quartered One night about ten P M six hundred men sallied out by one of the breaches all men of stout hearts and well armed The duke s quarters were first attacked Only twelve archers were on guard below and they were playing at dice Charles was in bed Commynes put on him as quickly as possible his breastplate and helmet and they went down stairs The archers were with great difficulty defending the doorway but help arrived and the danger was over The quarters of King Louis had also been attacked but at the first sound the Scottish archers had hurried up surrounded their master and repulsed the attack without caring whether their arrows killed Liegese or such Burgundians as had come up with assistance The gallant fellows from Franchemont fell almost to a man The duke and his principal captains held a council the next day and the duke was for delivering the assault The king was not present at this council and when he was informed of the resolution taken he was not in favor of an assault You see said he the courage of these people you know how murderous and uncertain is street fighting you will lose many brave men to no purpose Wait two or three days and the Liegese will infallibly come to terms Nearly all the Burgundian captains sided with the king The duke got angry He wishes to spare the Liegese said he what danger is there in this assault There are no walls they can t put a single gun in position I certainly will not give up the assault if the king is afraid let him get him gone to Namur Such an insult shocked even the Burgundians Louis was informed of it but said nothing Next day the thirtieth of October fourteen sixty eight the assault was ordered and the duke marched at the head of his troops Up came the king but Bide said Charles put not yourself uselessly in danger I will send you word when it is time Lead on brother replied Louis you are the most fortunate prince alive I will follow you And he continued marching with him But the assault was unnecessary Discouragement had taken possession of the Liegese the bravest of whom had fallen It was Sunday and the people who remained were not expecting an attack the cloth was laid in every house and all were preparing for dinner The Burgundians moved forward through the empty streets and Louis marched quietly along surrounded by his own escort and shouting Hurrah for Burgundy The duke turned back to meet him and they went together to give thanks to God in the cathedral of saint Lambert It was the only church which had escaped from the fury and the pillaging of the Burgundians by midday there was nothing left to take in the houses or in the churches Louis loaded Duke Charles with felicitations and commendations He knew how to turn them in a fashion so courteous and amiable that the duke was charmed and softened The next day as they were talking together Brother said the king to the duke if you have still need of my help do not spare me but if you have nothing more for me to do it would be well for me to go back to Paris to make public in my court of parliament the arrangement we have come to together otherwise it would run a risk of becoming of no avail you know that such is the custom of France Next summer we must meet again you will come into your duchy of Burgundy and I will go and pay you a visit and we will pass a week joyously together in making good cheer Charles made no answer and sent for the treaty lately concluded between them at Peronne leaving it to the king s choice to confirm or to renounce it and excusing himself in covert terms for having thus constrained him and brought him away The king made a show of being satisfied with the treaty and on the twod of November fourteen sixty eight the day but one after the capture of Liege set out for France The duke bore him company to within half a league of the city As they were taking leave of one another the king said to him If peradventure my brother Charles who is in Brittany should be discontented with the assignment I make him for love of you what would you have me do If he do not please to take it answered the duke but would have you satisfy him I leave it to you two Louis desired no more he returned home free and confident in himself after having passed the most trying three weeks of his life But Louis XI s deliverance after his quasi captivity at Peronne and the new treaty he had concluded with Duke Charles were and could be only a temporary break in the struggle between these two princes destined as they were both by character and position to irremediable incompatibility They were too powerful and too different to live at peace when they were such close neighbors and when their relations were so complicated We find in the chronicle of George Chastelain a Flemish burgher and a servant on familiar terms with Duke Charles as he had been with his father Duke Philip a judicious picture of this incompatibility and the causes of it There had been he says at all times a rancor between these two princes and whatever pacification might have been effected to day everything returned to morrow to the old condition and no real love could be established They suffered from incompatibility of temperament and perpetual discordance of will and the more they advanced in years the deeper they plunged into a state of serious difference and hopeless bitterness The king was a man of subtlety and full of fence he knew how to recoil for a better spring how to affect humility and gentleness in his deep designs how to yield and to give up in order to receive double and how to bear and tolerate for a time his own grievances in hopes of being able at last to have his revenge He was therefore very much to be feared for his practical knowledge showing the greatest skill and penetration in the world Duke Charles was to be feared for his great courage which he evinced and displayed in his actions making no account of king or emperor Thus whilst the king had great sense and great ability which he used with dissimulation and suppleness in order to succeed in his views the duke on his side had a great sense of another sort and to another purpose which he displayed by a public ostentation of his pride without any fear of putting himself in a false position Between fourteen sixty eight and fourteen seventy seven from the incident at Peronne to the death of Charles at the siege of Nancy the history of the two princes was nothing but one constant alternation between ruptures and re adjustments hostilities and truces wherein both were constantly changing their posture their language and their allies It was at one time the affairs of the Duke of Brittany or those of Prince Charles of France become Duke of Guienne at another it was the relations with the different claimants to the throne of England or the fate of the towns in Picardy handed over to the Duke of Burgundy by the treaties of Conflans and Peronne which served as a ground or pretext for the frequent recurrences of war In fourteen seventy one saint Quentin opened its gates to Count Louis of saint Poi constable of France and Duke Charles complained with threats about it to the Count of Dampmartin who was in commend on that frontier of Louis XI s army and had a good understanding with the constable Dampmartin one of the bravest men of his time says Duclos Histoire de Louis XI in the Enures completes of Duclos t ii p four hundred twenty nine sincere and faithful a warm friend and an implacable foe at once replied to the duke Most high and puissant prince I suppose your letters to have been dictated by your council and highest clerics who are folks better at letter making than I am for I have not lived by quill driving If I write you matter that displeases you and you have a desire to revenge yourself upon me you shall find me so near to your army that you will know how little fear I have of you Be assured that if it be your will to go on long making war upon the king it will at last be found out by all the world that as a soldier you have mistaken your calling The next year fourteen seventy two war broke out Duke Charles went and laid siege to Beauvais and on the twenty seventh of June delivered the first assault The inhabitants were at this moment left almost alone to defend their town A young girl of eighteen Joan Fourquet whom a burgher s wife of Beauvais Madame Laisne her mother by adoption had bred up in the history still so recent of Joan of Arc threw herself into the midst of the throng holding up her little axe hachette before the image of saint Angadresme patroness of the town and crying O glorious virgin come to my aid to arms to arms The assault was repulsed re enforcements came up from Noyon Amiens and Paris under the orders of the Marshal de Rouault and the mayor of Beauvais presented Joan to him Sir said the young girl to him you have everywhere been victor and you will be so with us On the ninth of July the Duke of Burgundy delivered a second assault which lasted four hours Some Burgundians had escaladed a part of the ramparts Joan Hachette arrived there just as one of them was planting his flag on the spot she pushed him over the side into the ditch and went down in pursuit of him the man fell on one knee Joan struck him down took possession of the flag and mounted up to the ramparts again crying Victory The same cry resounded at all points of the wall the assault was everywhere repulsed The vexation of Charles was great the day before he had been almost alone in advocating the assault in the evening as he lay on his camp bed according to his custom he had asked several of his people whether they thought the townsmen were prepared for it Yes certainly was the answer there are a great number of them You will not find a soul there to morrow said Charles with a sneer He remained for twelve days longer before the place looking for a better chance but on the twelfth of July he decided upon raising the siege and took the road to Normandy Some days before attacking Beauvais he had taken not without difficulty Nesle in the Vermandois There it was says Commynes that he first committed a horrible and wicked deed of war which had never been his wont this was burning everything everywhere those who were taken alive were hanged a pretty large number had their hands cut off It mislikes me to speak of such cruelty but I was on the spot and must needs say something about it Commynes undoubtedly said something about it to Charles himself who answered It is the fruit borne by the tree of war it would have been the fate of Beauvais if I could have taken the town Between the two rivals in France relations with England were a subject of constant manoeuvring and strife In spite of reverses on the Continent and civil wars in their own island the Kings of England had not abandoned their claims to the crown of France they were still in possession of Calais and the memory of the battles of Crecy Poitiers and Agincourt was still a tower of strength to them Between fourteen seventy and fourteen seventy two the house of York had triumphed over the house of Lancaster and Edward IV was undisputed king In his views touching France he found a natural ally in the Duke of Burgundy and it was in concert with Charles that Edward was incessantly concocting and attempting plots and campaigns against Louis XI In fourteen seventy four he by a herald called upon Louis to give up to him Normandy and Guienne else he told him he would cross over to France with his army Tell your master answered Louis coolly that I should not advise him to Next year the herald returned to tell Louis that the King of England on the point of embarking called upon him to give up to him the kingdom of France Louis had a conversation with the herald Your king said he is undertaking this war against his own grain at the solicitation of the Duke of Burgundy he would do much better to live in peace with me instead of devoting himself to allies who cannot but compromise him without doing him any service and he had three hundred golden crowns presented to the herald with a promise of considerably more if peace were made The herald thus won over promised in his turn to do all he could saying that he believed that his master would lend a willing ear but that before mentioning the subject they must wait until Edward had crossed the sea and formed some idea of the difficulties in the way of his enterprise and he advised Louis to establish communications with my lord Howard and my lord Stanley who had great influence with King Edward Whilst the king was parleying with the said herald there were many folks in the hall says Commynes who were waiting and had great longing to know what the king was saying to him and what countenance he would wear when he came from within The king when he had made an end called me and told me to keep the said herald talking so that none might speak to him and to have delivered unto him a piece of crimson velvet containing thirty ells So did I and the king was right joyous at that which he had got out of the said herald Illustration Philip de Commynes two hundred seventeen It was now three years since Philip de Commynes had left the Duke of Burgundy s service to enter that of Louis XI In fourteen seventy one Charles had none knows why rashly authorized an interview between Louis and De Commynes The king s speech says the chronicler Molinet in the Duke of Burgundy s service was so sweet and full of virtue that it entranced siren like all those who gave ear to it Of all princes says Commynes himself he was the one who was at most pains to gain over a man who was able to serve him and able to injure him and he was not put out at being refused once by one whom he was working to gain over but continued thereat making him large promises and actually giving money and estate when he made acquaintances that were pleasing to him Commynes spoke according to his own experience Louis from the moment of making his acquaintance had guessed his value and as early as fourteen sixty eight in the course of his disagreeable adventure at Peronne he had found the good offices of Commynes of great service to him It was probably from this very time that he applied himself assiduously to the task of gaining him over Commynes hesitated a long while but Louis was even more perseveringly persistent than Commynes was hesitating The king backed up his handsome offers by substantial and present gifts In fourteen seventy one according to what appears he lent Commynes six thousand livres of Tours which the Duke of Burgundy s councillor lodged with a banker at Tours The next year the king seeing that Commynes was still slow to decide bade one of his councillors to go to Tours in his name and seize at the banker s the six thousand livres intrusted to the latter by Commynes This says the learned editor of the last edition of Commynes Memoires was an able and decisive blow The effect of the seizure could not but be and indeed was to put Commynes in the awkward dilemma of seeing his practices as the saying was at that time divulged without reaping the fruit of them or of securing the advantages only by setting aside the scruples which held him back He chose the latter course which had become the safer and during the night between the seventh and eighth of August fourteen seventy two he left Burgundy forever The king was at that time at Ponts de Ce and there his new servant joined him The very day of his departure at six A M Duke Charles had a seizure made of all the goods and all the rights belonging to the fugitive but what Commynes lost on one side says his editor he was about to recover a hundred fold on the other scarcely had he arrived at the court of Louis XI when he received at once the title of councillor and chamberlain to the king soon afterwards a pension of six thousand livres of Tours was secured to him by way of giving him wherewithal to honorably maintain his position he was put into the place of captain of the castle and keep of the town of Chinon and lastly a present was made to him of the rich principality of Talmont Six months later in January fourteen seventy three Commynes married Helen de Chambes daughter of the lord of Montsoreau who brought him as dowry twenty seven thousand five hundred livres of Tours which enabled him to purchase the castle town barony land and lordship of Argenton arrondissement of Bressuire department of Deux Sevres the title of which he thenceforward assumed Half a page or so can hardly be thought too much space to devote in a History of France to the task of tracing to their origin the conduct and fortunes of one of the most eminent French politicians who after having taken a chief part in the affairs of their country and their epoch have dedicated themselves to the work of narrating them in a spirit of liberal and admirable comprehension both of persons and events But we will return to Louis XI The King of England readily entertained the overtures announced to him by his herald He had landed at Calais on the twenty twod of June fourteen seventy five with an army of from sixteen to eighteen thousand men thirsting for conquest and pillage in France and the Duke of Burgundy had promised to go and join him with a considerable force but the latter after having appeared for a moment at Calais to concert measures with his ally returned no more and even hesitated about admitting the English into his towns of Artois and Picardy Edward waited for him nearly two months at Peronne but in vain During this time Louis continued his attempts at negotiation He fixed his quarters at Amiens and Edward came and encamped half a league from the town The king sent to him it is said three hundred wagons laden with the best wines he could find the which train says Commynes was almost an army as big as the English at the entrance of the gate of Amiens Louis had caused to be set out two large tables laden with all sorts of good eatables and good wines and at each of these two tables he had caused to be seated five or six men of good family stout and fat to make better sport for them who had a mind to drink When the English went into the town wherever they put up they had nothing to pay there were nine or ten taverns well supplied whither they went to eat and drink and asked for what they pleased And this lasted three or four days An agreement was soon come to as to the terms of peace King Edward bound himself to withdraw with his army to England so soon as Louis XI should have paid him seventy five thousand crowns Louis promised besides to pay annually to King Edward fifty thousand crowns in two payments during the time that both princes were alive A truce for seven years was concluded they made mutual promises to lend each other aid if they were attacked by their enemies or by their own subjects in rebellion and Prince Charles the eldest son of Louis XI was to marry Elizabeth Edward s daughter when both should be of marriageable age Lastly Queen Margaret of Anjou who had been a prisoner in England since the death of her husband Henry VI was to be set at liberty and removed to France on renouncing all claim to the crown of England These conditions having been formulated it was agreed that the two kings should meet and sign them at Pecquigny on the Somme three leagues from Amiens Thither accordingly they repaired on the twenty ninth of August fourteen seventy five Edward as he drew near doffed his bonnet of black velvet whereon was a large fleur de lis in jewels and bowed down to within half a foot of the ground Louis made an equally deep reverence saying Sir my cousin right welcome there is no man in the world I could more desire to see than I do you and praised be God that we are here assembled with such good intent The King of England answered this speech in good French enough says Commynes The missal was brought the two kings swore and signed four distinct treaties and then they engaged in a long private conversation after which Louis went away to Amiens and Edward to his army whither Louis sent to him all that he had need of even to torches and candles As he went chatting along the road with Commynes Louis told him that he had found the King of England so desirous of paying a visit to Paris that he had been anything but pleased He is a right handsome king said he he is very fond of women and he might well meet at Paris some smitten one who would know how to make him such pretty speeches as to render him desirous of another visit His predecessors were far too much in Normandy and Paris his comradeship is worth nothing on our side of the sea on the other side over yonder I should like very well to have him for good brother and good friend Throughout the whole course of the negotiation Louis had shown pliancy and magnificence he had laden Edward s chief courtiers with presents two thousand crowns by way of pension had been allowed to his grand chamberlain Lord Hastings who would not give an acknowledgment This gift comes of the king your master s good pleasure and not at my request said he to Louis s steward if you would have me take it you shall slip it here inside my sleeve and have no letter or voucher beyond I do not wish to have people saying The grand chamberlain of England was the King of France s pensioner or to have my acknowledgments found in his exchequer chamber Lord Hastings had not always been so scrupulous for on the fifteenth of May fourteen seventy one he had received from the Duke of Burgundy a pension for which he had given an acknowledgment Another Englishman whose name is not given by Commynes waxed wroth at hearing some one say Six hundred pipes of wine and a pension given you by the king soon sent you back to England That is certainly what everybody said answered the Englishman that you might have the laugh against us But call you the money the king gives us pension Why it is tribute and by saint George you may perhaps talk so much about it as to bring us down upon you again There was nothing in the world says Commynes of which the king was more fearful than lest any word should escape him to make the English think that they were being derided at the same time that he was laboring to gain them over he was careful to humor their susceptibilities and Commynes under his schooling had learned to understand them well They are rather slow goers says he but you must have a little patience with them and not lose your temper I fancy that to many it might appear that the king abased himself too much but the wise might well hold that the kingdom was in great danger save for the intervention of God who did dispose the king s mind to choose so wise a course and did greatly trouble that of the Duke of Burgundy Our king knew well the nature of the King of England who was very fond of his ease and his pleasures when he had concluded these treaties with him he ordered that the money should be found with the greatest expedition and every one had to lend somewhat to help to supply it on the spot The king said that there was nothing in the world he would not do to thrust the King of England out of the realm save only that he would never consent that the English should have a bit of territory there and rather than suffer that he would put everything to jeopardy and risk Commynes had good reason to say that the kingdom was in great peril The intentions of Charles the Rash tended to nothing short of bringing back the English into France in order to share it with them He made no concealment of it I am so fond of the kingdom said he that I would make six of it in France He was passionately eager for the title of king He had put out feelers for it in the direction of Germany and the emperor Frederic III had promised it to him together with that of vicar general of the empire on condition that his daughter Mary of Burgundy married Duke Maximilian Frederic s son Having been unsuccessful on the Rhine Charles turned once more towards the Thames and made alliance with Edward IV King of England with a view of renewing the English invasion of France flattering himself of course that he would profit by it To destroy the work of Joan of Arc and Charles VII such was the design a criminal and a shameful one for a French prince which was checkmated by the peace of Peequigny Charles himself acknowledged as much when in his wrath at this treaty he said He had not sought to bring over the English into France for any need he had of them but to enable them to recover what belonged to them and Louis XI was a patriotic king when he declared that there was nothing in the world he would not do to thrust the King of England out of the realm and rather than suffer the English to have a bit of territory in France he would put everything to jeopardy and risk The Duke of Burgundy as soon as he found out that the King of France had under the name of truce made peace for seven years with the King of England and that Edward IV had recrossed the Channel with his army saw that his attempts so far were a failure Accordingly he too lost no time in signing on the thirteenth of September fourteen seventy five a truce with King Louis for nine years and directing his ambition and aiming his blows against other quarters than Western France Two little states his neighbors on the east Lorraine and Switzerland became the object and the theatre of his passion for war Lorraine had at that time for its duke Rene II of the house of Anjou through his mother Yolande a young prince who was wavering as so many others were between France and Burgundy Charles suddenly entered Lorraine took possession of several castles had the inhabitants who resisted hanged besieged Nancy which made a valiant defence and ended by conquering the capital as well as the country places leaving Duke Rene no asylum but the court of Louis XI of whom the Lorraine prince had begged a support which Louis after his custom had promised without rendering it effectual Charles did not stop there He had already been more than once engaged in hostilities with his neighbors the Swiss and he now learned that they had just made a sanguinary raid upon the district of Vaud the domain of a petty prince of the house of Savoy and a devoted servant of the Duke of Burgundy Scarcely two months after the capture of Nancy Charles set out on the eleventh of June fourteen seventy six to go and avenge his client and wreak his haughty and turbulent humor upon these bold peasants of the Alps In spite of the truce he had but lately concluded with Charles the Rash the prudent Louis did not cease to keep an attentive watch upon him and to reap advantage against him from the leisure secured to the King of France by his peace with the King of England and the Duke of Brittany A late occurrence had still further strengthened his position his brother Charles who became Duke of Guienne in fourteen sixty nine after the treaty of Peronne had died on the twenty fourth of May fourteen seventy two There were sinister rumors abroad touching his death Louis was suspected and even accused to the Duke of Brittany an intimate friend of the deceased prince of having poisoned his brother He caused an inquiry to be instituted into the matter but the inquiry itself was accused of being incomplete and inconclusive King Louis did not possibly cause his brother s death says M de Barante but nobody thought him incapable of it The will which Prince Charles had dictated a little before his death increased the horror inspired by such a suspicion He manifested in it a feeling of affection and confidence towards the king his brother he requested him to treat his servants kindly and if in any way he added we have ever offended our right dread and right well beloved brother we do beg him to be pleased to forgive us since for our part if ever in any matter he hath offended us we do affectionately pray the Divine Majesty to forgive him and with good courage and good will do we on our part forgive him The Duke of Guienne at the same time appointed the king executor of his will If we acknowledge however that Louis was not incapable of such a crime it must be admitted that there is no trust worthy proof of his guilt At any rate his brother s death had important results for him Not only did it set him free from all fresh embarrassment in that direction but it also restored to him the beautiful province of Guienne and many a royal client He treated the friends of Prince Charles whether they had or had not been heretofore his own with marked attention He re established at Bordeaux the parliament he had removed to Poitiers he pardoned the towns of Pdzenas and Montignac for some late seditions and lastly he took advantage of this incident to pacify and satisfy this portion of the kingdom Of the great feudal chieftains who in fourteen sixty four had formed against him the League of the common weal the Duke of Burgundy was the only one left on the scene and in a condition to put him in peril But though here was for the future his only real adversary Louis XI continued and with reason to regard the Duke of Burgundy as his most formidable foe and never ceased to look about for means and allies wherewith to encounter him He could no longer count upon the company operation more or less general of the Flemings His behavior to the Liegese after the incident at Peronne and his share in the disaster which befell Liege had lost him all his credit in the Flemish cities The Flemings besides had been disheartened and disgusted at the idea of compromising themselves for or against their Burgundian prince When they saw him entering upon the campaign in Lorraine and Switzerland they themselves declared to him what he might or might not expect from them If he were pressed they said by the Germans or the Swiss and had not with him enough men to make his way back freely to his own borders he had only to let them know and they would expose their persons and their property to go after him and fetch him back safely within his said borders but as for making war again at his instance they were not free to aid him any more with either men or money Louis XI then had nothing to expect from the Flemings any more but for two years past and so soon as he observed the commencement of hostilities between the Duke of Burgundy and the Swiss he had paved the way for other alliances in that quarter In fourteen seventy three he had sent to the most high and mighty lords and most dear friends of ours them of the league and city of Berne and of the great and little league of Germany ambassadors charged to make proposals to them if they would come to an understanding to be friends of friends and foes of foes make an offensive and defensive alliance The proposal was brought before the diet of the cantons assembled at Lucerne The King of France regretted that the Duke of Burgundy would not leave the Swiss in peace he promised that his advice and support whether in men or in money should not be wanting to them he offered to each canton an annual friendly donation of two thousand livres and he engaged not to summon their valiant warriors to take service save in case of pressing need and unless Switzerland were herself at war The question was discussed with animation the cantons were divided some would have nothing to do with either the alliance or the money of Louis XI of whom they spoke with great distrust and antipathy others insisted upon the importance of being supported by the King of France in their quarrels with the Duke of Burgundy and scornfully repudiated the fear that the influence and money of Louis would bring a taint upon the independence and the good morals of their country The latter opinion carried the day and on the twod of October fourteen seventy four conformably with a treaty concluded on the tenth of the previous January between the King of France and the league of Swiss cantons the canton of Berne made to the French legation the following announcement If in the future the said lords of the league asked help from the King of France against the Duke of Burgundy and if the said lord king being engaged in his own wars could not help them with men in this case he should cause to be lodged and handed over to them in the city of Lyons twenty thousand Rhenish florins every quarter of a year as long as the war actually continued and we on our part do promise on our faith and honor that every time and however many times the said lord king shall ask help from the said lords of the league we will take care that they do help him and aid him with six thousand men in his wars and expeditions according to the tenor of the late alliance and union made between them howbeit on payment A Bernese messenger carried this announcement to the Burgundian camp before the fortress of Neuss and delivered it into the hands of Duke Charles himself whose only remark as he ground his teeth was Ah Berne Berne At the be ginning of January fourteen seventy six he left Nancy of which he had recently gained possession returned to Besancon and started thence on the sixth of February to take the field with an army amounting it is said to thirty or forty thousand men provided with a powerful artillery and accompanied by an immense baggage train wherein Charles delighted to display his riches and magnificence in contrast with the simplicity and roughness of his personal habits At the rumor of such an armament the Swiss attempted to keep off the war from their country I have heard tell says Commynes by a knight of theirs who had been sent by them to the said duke that he told him that against them he could gain nothing for that their country was very barren and poor that there were no good prisoners to make and that the spurs and the horses bits in his own army were worth more money than all the people of their territory could pay in ransom even if they were taken Charles however gave no heed saw nothing in their representations but an additional reason for hurrying on his movements with confidence and on the nineteenth of February arrived before Granson a little town in the district of Vaud where war had already begun Louis XI watched all these incidents closely keeping agents everywhere treating secretly with everybody with the Duke of Burgundy as well as with the Swiss knowing perfectly well what he wanted but holding himself ready to face anything no matter what the event might be When he saw that the crisis was coming he started from Tours and went to take up his quarters at Lyons close to the theatre of war and within an easy distance for speedy information and prompt action Scarcely had he arrived on the fourth of March when he learned that on the day but one before Duke Charles had been tremendously beaten by the Swiss at Granson the squadrons of his chivalry had not been able to make any impression upon the battalions of Berne Schwitz Soleure and Fribourg armed with pikes eighteen feet long and at sight of the mountaineers marching with huge strides and lowered heads upon their foes and heralding their advance by the lowings of the bull of Uri and the cow of Unterwalden two enormous instruments made of buffalo horn and given it was said to their ancestors by Charlemagne the whole Burgundian army seized with panic had dispersed in all directions like smoke before the northern blast Charles himself had been forced to fly with only five horsemen it is said for escort leaving all his camp artillery treasure oratory jewels down to his very cap garnished with precious stones and his collar of the Golden Fleece in the hands of the poor Swiss astounded at their booty and having no suspicion of its value They sold the silver plate for a few pence taking it for pewter says M de Barante Those magnificent silks and velvets that cloth of gold and damask that Flanders lace and those carpets from Arras which were found heaped up in chests were cut in pieces and distributed by the ell like common canvas in a village shop The duke s large diamond which he wore round his neck and which had once upon a time glittered in the crown of the Great Mogul was found on the road inside a little box set with fine pearls The man who picked it up kept the box and threw away the diamond as a mere bit of glass Afterwards he thought better of it went to look for the stone found it under a wagon and sold it for a crown to a clergyman of the neighborhood There was nothing saved but the bare life says Commynes That even the bare life was saved was a source of sorrow to Louis XI in the very midst of his joy at the defeat He was nevertheless most proper in his behavior and language towards Duke Charles who sent to him Sire de Contay with humble and gracious words which was contrary to his nature and his custom says Commynes but see how an hour s time changed him he prayed the king to be pleased to observe loyally the truce concluded between them he excused himself for not having appeared at the interview which was to have taken place at Auxerre and he bound himself to be present shortly either there or elsewhere according to the king s good pleasure Louis promised him all he asked for adds Commynes it did not seem to him time as yet to do other wise and he gave the duke the good advice to return home and bide there quietly rather than go on stubbornly warring with yon folks of the Alps so poor that there was nought to gain by taking their lands but valiant and obstinate in battle Louis might give this advice fearlessly being quite certain that Charles would not follow it The latter s defeat at Granson had thrown him into a state of gloomy irritation At Lausanne where he staid for some time he had a great sickness proceeding says Commynes from grief and sadness on account of this shame that he had suffered and to tell the truth I think that never since was his understanding so good as it had been before this battle Before he fell ill on the twelfth of March Charles issued orders from his camp before Lausanne to his lieutenant at Luxembourg to put under arrest and visit with the extreme penalty of death without waiting for other command from us all the men at arms archers cross bowmen infantry or other soldiery who had fled or dispersed after the disaster at Granson and as to those who be newly coming into our service it is ordered by us that they on pain of the same punishment do march towards us with all diligence and if they make any delay our pleasure is that you proceed against them in the manner hereinabove declared without fail in any way With such fiery and ruthless energy Charles collected a fresh army having a strength it is said of from twenty five to thirty thousand men Burgundians Flemings Italians and English and after having reviewed it on the platform above Lausanne he set out on the twenty seventh of May fourteen seventy six and pitched his camp on the tenth of June before the little town of Morat six leagues from Berne giving notice everywhere that it was war to the death that he intended The Swiss were expecting it and were prepared for it The energy of pride was going to be pitted against the energy of patriotism The Duke of Burgundy is here with all his forces his Italian mercenaries and some traitors of Germans said the letter written to the Bernese by the governor of Morat Adrian of Bubenberg the gentlemen of the magistracy of the council and of the burgherhood may be free from fear and hurry and may set at rest the minds of all our confederates I will defend Morat and he swore to the garrison and the inhabitants that he would put to death the first who should speak of surrender Morat had been for ten days holding out against the whole army of the Burgundians the confederate Swiss were arriving successively at Berne and the men of Zurich alone were late Their fellow countryman Hans Waldmann wrote to them We positively must give battle or we are lost every one of us The Burgundians are three times more numerous than they were at Granson but we shall manage to pull through With God s help great honor awaits us Do not fail to come as quickly as possible On the twenty first of June in the evening the Zurichers arrived Ha the duke was just saying have these hounds lost heart pray I was told that we were about to get at them Next day the twenty twod of June after a pelting rain and with the first gleams of the returning sun the Swiss attacked the Burgundian camp A man at arms came and told the duke who would not believe it and dismissed the messenger with a coarse insult but hurried nevertheless to the point of attack The battle was desperate but before the close of the day it was hopelessly lost by the Burgundians Charles had still three thousand horse but he saw them break up and he himself had great difficulty in getting away with merely a dozen men behind him and reaching Merges twelve leagues from Morat Eight or ten thousand of his men had fallen more than half it is said killed in cold blood after the fight Never had the Swiss been so dead set against their foes and as cruel as at Morat was for a long while a common expression The king says Commynes always willingly gave somewhat to him who was the first to bring him some great news without forgetting the messenger and he took pleasure in speaking thereof before the news came saying I will give so much to him who first brings me such and such news My lord of Bouchage and I being together had the first message about the battle of Morat and told it both together to the king who gave each of us two hundred marks of silver Next day Louis as prudent in the hour of joy as of reverse wrote to Count de Dampmartin who was in command of his troops concentrated at Senlis with orders to hold himself in readiness for any event but still carefully observe the truce with the Duke of Burgundy Charles at that time was thinking but little of Louis and their truce driven to despair by the disaster at Morat but more dead set than ever on the struggle he repaired from Morges to Gex and from Gex to Salins and summoned successively in July and August at Salins at Dijon at Brussels and at Luxembourg the estates of his various domains making to all of them an appeal at the same time supplicatory and imperious calling upon them for a fresh army with which to recommence the war with the Swiss and fresh subsidies with which to pay it If ever said he you have desired to serve us and do us pleasure see to doing and accomplishing all that is bidden you make no default in anything whatsoever and he henceforth in dread of the punishments which may ensue But there was everywhere a feeling of disgust with the service of Duke Charles there was no more desire of serving him and no more fear of disobeying him he encountered almost everywhere nothing but objections complaints and refusals or else a silence and an inactivity which were still worse Indignant dismayed and dumbfounded at such desertion Charles retired to his castle of La Riviere between Pontarlier and Joux and shut himself up there for more than six weeks without however giving up the attempt to collect soldiers Howbeit says Commynes he made but little of it he kept himself quite solitary and he seemed to do it from sheer obstinacy more than anything else His natural heat was so great that he used to drink no wine generally took barley water in the morning and ate preserved rose leaves to keep himself cool but sorrow changed his complexion so much that he was obliged to drink good strong wine without water and to bring the blood back to his heart burning tow was put into cupping glasses and they were applied thus heated to the region of the heart Such are the passions of those who have never felt adversity especially of proud princes who know not how to discover any remedy The first refuge in such a case is to have recourse to God to consider whether one have offended Him in aught and to confess one s misdeeds After that what does great good is to converse with some friend and not be ashamed to show one s grief before him for that lightens and comforts the heart and not at any rate to take the course the duke took of concealing himself and keeping himself solitary he was so terrible to his own folks that none durst come forward to give him any comfort or counsel but all left him to do as he pleased feeling that if they made him any remonstrance it would be the worse for them But events take no account of the fears and weaknesses of men Charles learned before long that the Swiss were not his most threatening foes and that he had something else to do instead of going after them amongst their mountains During his two campaigns against them the Duke of Lorraine Rend II whom he had despoiled of his dominions and driven from Nancy had been wandering amongst neighboring princes and people in France Germany and Switzerland at the courts of Louis XI and the Emperor Frederic III on visits to the patricians of Berne and in the free towns of the Rhine He was young sprightly amiable and brave he had nowhere met with great assistance but he had been well received and certain promises had been made him When he saw the contest so hotly commenced between the Duke of Burgundy and the Swiss he resolutely put himself at the service of the republican mountaineers fought for them in their ranks and powerfully contributed to their victory at Morat The defeat of Charles and his retreat to his castle of La Riviere gave Rend new hopes and gained him some credit amongst the powers which had hitherto merely testified towards him a good will of but little value and his partisans in Lorraine recovered confidence in his for tunes One day as he was at his prayers in a church a rich widow Madame Walther came up to him in her mantle and hood made him a deep reverence and handed him a purse of gold to help him in winning back his duchy The city of Strasbourg gave him some cannon four hundred cavalry and eight hundred infantry Louis XI lent him some money and Rend before long found himself in a position to raise a small army and retake Epinal Saint Did Vaudemont and the majority of the small towns in Lorraine He then went and laid siege to Nancy The Duke of Burgundy had left there as governor John de Rubemprd lord of Bievres with a feeble garrison which numbered amongst its ranks three hundred English picked men Sire de Bievres sent message after message to Charles who did not even reply to him The town was short of provisions the garrison was dispirited and the commander of the English was killed Sire de Bievres a loyal servant but a soldier of but little energy determined to capitulate On the sixth of October fourteen seventy six he evacuated the place at the head of his men all safe in person and property At sight of him Rend dismounted and handsomely went forward to meet him saying Sir my good uncle I thank you for having so courteously governed my duchy if you find it agreeable to remain with me you shall fare the same as myself Sir answered Sire de Bievres I hope that you will not think ill of me for this war I very much wish that my lord of Burgundy had never begun it and I am much afraid that neither he nor I will see the end of it Sire de Bievres had no idea how true a prophet he was Almost at the very moment when he was capitulating Duke Charles throwing off his sombre apathy was once more entering Lorraine with all the troops he could collect and on the twenty twod of October he in his turn went and laid siege to Nancy Duke Rend not considering himself in a position to maintain the contest with only such forces as he had with him determined to quit Nancy in person and go in search of re enforcements at a distance at the same time leaving in the town a not very numerous but a devoted garrison which together with the inhabitants promised to hold out for two months And it did hold out whilst Rend was visiting Strasbourg Berne Zurich and Lucerne presenting himself before the councils of these petty republics with in order to please them a tame bear behind him which he left at the doors and promising thanks to Louis XI s agents in Switzerland extraordinary pay He thus obtained auxiliaries to the number of eight thousand fighting men He had moreover in the very camp of the Duke of Burgundy a secret ally an Italian condottiere the Count of Campo Basso who either from personal hatred or on grounds of interest was betraying the master to whom he had bound himself The year before he had made an offer to Louis XI to go over to him with his troops during a battle or to hand over to him the Duke of Burgundy dead or alive Louis mistrusted the traitor and sent Charles notice of the offers made by Campo Basso But Charles mistrusted Louis s information and kept Campo Basso in his service A little before the battle of Morat Louis had thought better of his scruples or his doubts and had accepted with the compensation of a pension the kind offices of Campo Basso When the war took place in Lorraine the condottiere whom Duke Charles had one day grossly insulted entered into communication with Duke Rend also and took secret measures for insuring the failure of the Burgundian attempts upon Nancy Such was the position of the two princes and the two armies when on the fourth of June fourteen seventy seven Rend having returned with re enforcements to Lorraine found himself confronted with Charles who was still intent upon the siege of Nancy The Duke of Burgundy assembled his captains Well said he since these drunken scoundrels are upon us and are coming here to look for meat and drink what ought we to do The majority of those present were of opinion that the right thing to do was to fall back into the duchy of Luxembourg there to recruit the enfeebled army Duke Rene they said is poor he will not be able to bear very long the expense of the war and his allies will leave him as soon as he has no more money wait but a little and success is certain Charles flew into a passion My father and I said he knew how to thrash these Lorrainers and we will make them remember it By saint George I will not fly before a boy before Rend of Vaudemont who is coming at the head of this scum He has not so many men with him as people think the Germans have no idea of leaving their stoves in winter This evening we will deliver the assault against the town and to morrow we will give battle And the next day January the fifth the battle did take place in the plain of Nancy The Duke of Burgundy assumed his armor very early in the morning When he put on his helmet the gilt lion which formed the crest of it fell off That is a sign from God said he but nevertheless he went and drew up his army in line of battle The day but one before Campo Basso had drawn off his troops to a considerable distance and he presented himself before Duke Rene having taken off his red scarf and his cross of saint Andrew and being quite ready he said to give proofs of his zeal on the spot Rene spoke about it to his Swiss captains We have no mind said they to have this traitor of an Italian fighting beside us our fathers never made use of such folk or such practices in order to conquer And Campo Basso held aloof The battle began in gloomy weather and beneath heavy flakes of snow lasted but a short time and was not at all murderous in the actual conflict but the pursuit was terrible Campo Basso and his troops held the bridge of Bouxieres by which the Burgundian fugitives would want to pass and the Lorrainerss of Rend and his Swiss and German allies scoured the country killing all with whom they fell in Rend returned to Nancy in the midst of a population whom his victory had delivered from famine as well as war To show him what sufferings they had endured says M de Barante they conceived the idea of piling up in a heap before the door of his hostel the heads of the horses dogs mules cats and other unclean animals which had for several weeks past been the only food of the besieged When the first burst of joy was over the question was what had become of the Duke of Burgundy nobody had a notion and his body was not found amongst the dead in any of the places where his most valiant and faithful warriors had fallen The rumor ran that he was not dead some said that one of his servants had picked him up wounded on the field of battle and was taking care of him none knew where and according to others a German lord had made him prisoner and carried him off beyond the Rhine Take good heed said many people how ye comport yourselves otherwise than if he were still alive for his vengeance would be terrible on his return On the evening of the day after the battle the Count of Campo Basso brought to Duke Rend a young Roman page who he said had from a distance seen his master fall and could easily find the spot again Under his guidance a move was made towards a pond hard by the town and there half buried in the slush of the pond were some dead bodies lying stripped A poor washerwoman amongst the rest had joined in the search she saw the glitter of a jewel in the ring upon one of the fingers of a corpse whose face was not visible she went forward turned the body over and at once cried Ah my prince There was a rush to the spot immediately As the head was being detached from the ice to which it stuck the skin came off and a large wound was discovered On examining the body with care it was unhesitatingly recognized to be that of Charles by his doctor by his chaplain by Oliver de la Marche his chamberlain and by several grooms of the chamber and certain marks such as the scar of the wound he had received at Montlhery and the loss of two teeth put their assertion beyond a doubt As soon as Duke Rend knew that they had at last found the body of the Duke of Burgundy he had it removed to the town and laid on a bed of state of black velvet under a canopy of black satin It was dressed in a garment of white satin a ducal crown set with precious stones was placed on the disfigured brow the lower limbs were cased in scarlet and on the heels were gilded spurs The Duke of Lorraine went and sprinkled holy water on the corpse of his unhappy rival and taking the dead hand beneath the pall Ah dear cousin said he with tears in his eyes For the time that I knew him he was not cruel but he became so before his death and that was a bad omen for a long existence He was very sumptuous in dress and in all other matters and a little too much so He showed very great honor to ambassadors and foreign folks they were right well feasted and entertained by him He was desirous of great glory and it was that more than ought else that brought him into his wars he would have been right glad to be like to those ancient princes of whom there has been so much talk after their death he was as bold a man as any that reigned in his day After the long felicity and great riches of this house of Burgundy and after three great princes good and wise who had lasted six score years and more in good sense and virtue God gave this people the Duke Charles who kept them constantly in great war travail and expense and almost as much in winter as in summer Many rich and comfortable folks were dead or ruined in prison during these wars The great losses began in front of Neuss and continued through three or four battles up to the hour of his death and at that hour all the strength of his country was sapped and dead or ruined or captive were all who could or would have defended the dominions and the honor of his house Thus it seems that this loss was an equal set off to the time of their felicity Please God to forgive Duke Charles his sins Illustration The Corpse of Charles the Rash Discovered two hundred thirty six To this pious wish of Commynes after so judicious a sketch we may add another Please God that people may no more suffer themselves to be taken captive by the corrupting and ruinous pleasures procured for them by their masters grand but wicked or foolish enterprises and may learn to give to the men who govern them a glory in proportion to the wisdom and justice of their deeds and by no means to the noise they make and the risks they sow broadcast around them The news of the death of Charles the Rash was for Louis XI an unexpected and unhoped for blessing and one in which he could scarcely believe The news reached him on the ninth of January at the castle of Plessis les Tours by the medium of a courier sent to him by George de la Tremoille Sire de Craon commanding his troops on the frontier of Lorraine Insomuch as this house of Burgundy was greater and more powerful than the others says Commynes was the pleasure great for the king more than all the others together it was the joy of seeing himself set above all those he hated and above his principal foes it might well seem to him that he would never in his life meet any to gainsay him in his kingdom or in the neighborhood near him He replied the same day to Sire de Craon Sir Count my good friend I have received your letters and the good news you have brought to my knowledge for which I thank you as much as I am able Now is the time for you to employ all your five natural wits to put the duchy and countship of Burgundy in my hands And to that end place yourself with your band and the governor of Champagne if so be that the Duke of Burgundy is dead within the said country and take care for the dear love you bear me that you maintain amongst the men of war the best order just as if you were inside Paris and make known to them that I am minded to treat them and keep them better than any in my kingdom and that in respect of our god daughter I have an intention of completing the marriage that I have already had in contemplation between my lord the dauphin and her Sir Count I consider it understood that you will not enter the said country or make mention of that which is written above unless the Duke of Burgundy be dead And in any case I pray you to serve me in accordance with the confidence I have in you And adieu Beneath the discreet reserve inspired by a remnant of doubt concerning the death of his enemy this letter contained the essence of Louis XI s grand and very natural stroke of policy Charles the Rash had left only a daughter Mary of Burgundy sole heiress of all his dominions To annex this magnificent heritage to the crown of France by the marriage of the heiress with the dauphin who was one day to be Charles VIII was clearly for the best interests of the nation as well as of the French kingship and such had accordingly been Louis XI s first idea When the Duke of Burgundy was still alive says Commynes many a time spoke the king to me of what he would do if the duke should happen to die and he spoke most reasonably saying that he would try to make a match between his son who is now our king and the said duke s daughter who was afterwards Duchess of Austria and if she were not minded to hear of it for that my lord the dauphin was much younger than she he would essay to get her married to some younger lord of this realm for to keep her and her subjects in amity and to recover without dispute that which he claimed as his and still was the said lord on this subject a week before he knew of the said duke s death Howbeit it seems that the king our master took not hold of matters by the end by which he should have taken hold for to come out triumphant and to add to his crown all those great lordships either by sound title or by marriage as easily he might have done Commynes does not explain or specify clearly the mistake with which he reproaches his master Louis XI in spite of his sound sense and correct appreciation generally of the political interests of France and of his crown allowed himself on this great occasion to be swayed by secondary considerations and personal questions His son s marriage with the heiress of Burgundy might cause some embarrassment in his relations with Edward IV King of England to whom he had promised the dauphin as a husband for his daughter Elizabeth who was already sometimes called in England the Dauphiness In fourteen seventy seven at the death of the duke her father Mary of Burgundy was twenty years old and Charles the dauphin was barely eight There was another question a point of feudal law as to whether Burgundy properly so called was a fief which women could inherit or a fief which in default of a male heir must lapse to the suzerain Several of the Flemish towns which belonged to the Duke of Burgundy were weary of his wars and his violence and showed an inclination to pass over to the sway of the King of France All these facts offered pretexts opportunities and chances of success for that course of egotistical pretension and cunning intrigue in which Louis delighted and felt confident of his ability and into it he plunged after the death of Charles the Rash Though he still spoke of his desire of marrying his son the dauphin to Mary of Burgundy it was no longer his dominant and ever present idea Instead of taking pains to win the good will and the heart of Mary herself he labored with his usual zeal and address to dispute her rights to despoil her brusquely of one or another town in her dominions to tamper with her servants or excite against them the wrath of the populace Two of the most devoted and most able amongst them Hugonet chancellor of Burgundy and Sire d Humbercourt were the victims of Louis XI s hostile manoeuvres and of blind hatred on the part of the Ghentese and all the Princess Mary s passionate entreaties were powerless both with the king and with the Flemings to save them from the scaffold And so Mary alternately threatened or duped attacked in her just rights or outraged in her affections being driven to extremity exhibited a resolution never to become the daughter of a prince unworthy of the confidence she poor orphan had placed in the spiritual tie which marked him out as her protector I understand said she that my father had arranged my marriage with the emperor s son I have no mind for any other Louis in his alarm tried all sorts of means seductive and violent to prevent such a reverse He went in person amongst the Walloon and Flemish provinces belonging to Mary That I come into this country said he to the inhabitants of Quesnoy is for nothing but the interests of Mdlle de Burgundy my well beloved cousin and god daughter Of her wicked advisers some would have her espouse the son of the Duke of Cleves but he is a prince of far too little lustre for so illustrious a princess I know that he has a bad sore on his leg he is a drunkard like all Germans and after drinking he will break his glass over her head and beat her Others would ally her with the English the kingdom s old enemies who all lead bad lives there are some who would give her for her husband the emperor s son but those princes of the imperial house are the most avaricious in the world they will carry off Mdlle de Burgundy to Germany a strange land and a coarse where she will know no consolation whilst your land of Hainault will be left without any lord to govern and defend it If my fair cousin were well advised she would espouse the dauphin you speak French you Walloon people you want a prince of France not a German As for me I esteem the folks of Hainault more than any nation in the world there is none more noble and in my sight a hind of Hainault is worth more than a grand gentleman of any other country At the very time that he was using such flattering language to the good folks of Hainault he was writing to the Count de Dampmartin whom he had charged with the repression of insurrection in the country parts of Ghent and Bruges Sir Grand Master I send you some mowers to cut down the crop you wot off put them I pray you to work and spare not some casks of wine to set them drinking and to make them drunk I pray you my friend let there be no need to return a second time to do the mowing for you are as much crown officer as I am and if I am king you are grand master Dampmartin executed the king s orders without scruple and at the season of harvest the Flemish country places were devastated Little birds of heaven cries the Flemish chronicler Molinet ye who are wont to haunt our fields and rejoice our hearts with your amorous notes now seek out other countries get ye hence from our tillages for the king of the mowers of France hath done worse to us than do the tempests All the efforts of Louis XI his winning speeches and his ruinous deeds did not succeed in averting the serious check he dreaded On the eighteenth of August fourteen seventy seven seven months after the battle of Nancy and the death of Charles the Rash Arch duke Maximilian son of the Emperor Frederick III arrived at Ghent to wed Mary of Burgundy The moment he caught sight of his betrothed say the Flemish chroniclers they both bent down to the ground and turned as pale as death a sign of mutual love according to some an omen of unhappiness according to others Next day August nineteen the marriage was celebrated with great simplicity in the chapel of the Hotel de Ville and Maximilian swore to respect the privileges of Ghent A few days afterwards he renewed the same oath at Bruges in the midst of decorations bearing the modest device Most glorious prince defend us lest we perish Gloriosissime princeps defende nos ne pereamus Not only did Louis XI thus fail in his first wise design of incorporating with France by means of a marriage between his son the dauphin and Princess Mary the heritage of the Dukes of Burgundy but he suffered the heiress and a great part of the heritage to pass into the hands of the son of the German emperor and thereby he paved the way for that determined rivalry between the houses of France and Austria which was a source of so many dangers and woes to both states during three centuries It is said that in seventeen forty five when Louis XV after the battle of Fontenoy entered Bruges cathedral he remarked as he gazed on the tombs of the Austro Burgundian princes There is the origin of all our wars In vain when the marriage of Maximilian and Mary was completed did Louis XI attempt to struggle against his new and dangerous neighbor his campaigns in the Flemish provinces in fourteen seventy eight and fourteen seventy nine had no great result he lost on the seventh of August fourteen seventy nine the battle of Guinegate between saint Omer and Therouanne and before long tired of war which was not his favorite theatre for the display of his abilities he ended by concluding with Maximilian a truce at first and then a peace which in spite of some conditionals favorable to France left the principal and the fatal consequences of the Austro Burgundian marriage to take full effect This event marked the stoppage of that great national policy which had prevailed during the first part of Louis XI s reign Joan of Arc and Charles VII had driven the English from France and for sixteen years Louis XI had by fighting and gradually destroying the great vassals who made alliance with them prevented them from regaining a footing there That was work as salutary as it was glorious for the nation and the French kingship At the death of Charles the Rash the work was accomplished Louis XI was the only power left in France without any great peril from without and without any great rival within but he then fell under the sway of mistaken ideas and a vicious spirit The infinite resources of his mind the agreeableness of his conversation his perseverance combined with the pliancy of his will the services he was rendering France the successes he in the long ruin frequently obtained and his ready apparent resignation under his reverses for a while made up for or palliated his faults his falsehoods his perfidies his iniquities but when evil is predominant at the bottom of a man s soul he cannot do without youth and success he cannot make head against age and decay reverse of fortune and the approach of death and so Louis XI when old in years master power still though beaten in his last game of policy appeared to all as he really was and as he had been prediscerned to be by only such eminent observers as Commynes that is a crooked swindling utterly selfish vindictive cruel man Not only did he hunt down implacably the men who after having served him had betrayed or deserted him he revelled in the vengeance he took and the sufferings he inflicted on them He had raised to the highest rank both in state and church the son of a cobbler or according to others of a tailor one John de Balue born in fourteen twenty one at the market town of Angles in Poitou After having chosen him as an intelligent and a clever young priest for his secretary and almoner Louis made him successively clerical councillor in the parliament of Paris then Bishop of Evreux and afterwards cardinal and he employed him in his most private affairs It was a hobby of his thus to make the fortunes of men born in the lowest stations hoping that since they would owe everything to him they would never depend on any but him It is scarcely credible that so keen and contemptuous a judge of human nature could have reckoned on dependence as a pledge of fidelity And in this case Louis was at any rate mistaken Balue was a traitor to him and in fourteen sixty eight at the very time of the incident at Peronne he was secretly in the service of Duke Charles of Burgundy and betrayed to him the interests and secrets of his master and benefactor In fourteen sixty nine Louis obtained material proof of the treachery and he immediately had Balue arrested and put on his trial The cardinal confessed everything asking only to see the king Louis gave him an interview on the way from Amboise to Notre Dame de Clery and they were observed it is said conversing for two hours as they walked together on the road The trial and condemnation of a cardinal by a civil tribunal was a serious business with the court of Rome The king sent commissioners to Pope Paul II the pope complained of the procedure but amicably and without persistence The cardinal was in prison at Loches and Louis resolved to leave him there forever without any more fuss But at the same time that out of regard for the dignity of cardinal which he had himself requested of the pope for the culprit he dispensed with the legal condemnation to capital punishment he was bent upon satisfying his vengeance and upon making Balue suffer in person for his crime He therefore had him confined in a cage eight feet broad says Commynes and only one foot higher than a man s stature covered with iron plates outside and inside and fitted with terrible bars There is still to be seen in Loches castle under the name of the Balue cage that instrument of prison torture which the cardinal it is said himself invented In it he passed eleven years and it was not until fourteen eighty that he was let out at the solicitation of Pope Sixtus IV to whom Louis XI being old and ill thought he could not possibly refuse this favor He remembered perhaps at that time how that sixteen years before in writing to his lieutenant general in Poitou to hand over to Balue Bishop of Evreux the property of a certain abbey he said He is a devilish good bishop just now I know not what he will be here after Illustration The Balue Cage two hundred forty five He was still more pitiless towards a man more formidable and less subordinate both in character and origin than Cardinal Balue Louis of Luxembourg Count of saint Pol had been from his youth up engaged in the wars and intrigues of the sovereigns and great feudal lords of Western Europe France England Germany Burgundy Brittany and Lorraine From fourteen thirty three to fourteen seventy five he served and betrayed them all in turn seeking and obtaining favors incurring and braving rancor at one time on one side and at another time on another acting as constable of France and as diplomatic agent for the Duke of Burgundy raising troops and taking towns for Louis XI for Charles the Rash for Edward IV for the German emperor and trying nearly always to keep for himself what he had taken on another s account The truth is that he was constantly occupied with the idea of making for himself an independent dominion and becoming a great sovereign He was says Duclos powerful from his possessions a great captain more ambitious than politic and from his ingratitude and his perfidies worthy of his tragic end His various patrons grew tired at last of being incessantly taken up with and then abandoned served and then betrayed and they mutually interchanged proofs of the desertions and treasons to which they had been victims In fourteen seventy five Louis of Luxembourg saw a storm threatening and he made application for a safe conduct to Charles the Rash who had been the friend of his youth Tell him replied Charles to the messenger that he has forfeited his paper and his hope as well and he gave orders to detain him As soon as Louis XI knew whither the constable had retired he demanded of the Duke of Burgundy to give him up as had been agreed between them I have need said he for my heavy business of a head like his and he added with a ghastly smile it is only the head I want the body may stay where it is On the twenty fourth of November fourteen seventy five the constable was accordingly given up to the king and on the twenty seventh was brought to Paris His trial begun forthwith was soon over he himself acknowledged the greater part of what was imputed to him and on the nineteenth of December he was brought up from the Bastille before the parliament My lord of saint Pol said the chancellor to him you have always passed for being the firmest lord in the realm you must not belie yourself to day when you have more need than ever of firmness and courage and he read to him the decree which sentenced him to lose his head that very day on the Place de Greve That is a mighty hard sentence said the constable I pray God that I may see Him to day And he underwent execution with serene and pious firmness He was of an epoch when the most criminal enterprises did not always preclude piety Louis XI did not look after the constable s accomplices He flew at the heads says Duclos and was set on making great examples he was convinced that noble blood when it is guilty should be shed rather than common blood Nevertheless there was considered to be something indecent in the cession by the king to the Duke of Burgundy of the constable s possessions It seemed like the price of the blood of an unhappy man who being rightfully sacrificed only to justice and public tranquillity appeared to be so to vengeance ambition and avarice In August fourteen seventy seven the battle of Nancy had been fought Charles the Rash had been killed and the line of the Dukes of Burgundy had been extinguished Louis XI remained master of the battle field on which the great risks and great scenes of his life had been passed through It seemed as if he ought to fear nothing now and that the day for clemency had come But such was not the king s opinion two cruel passions suspicion and vengeance had taken possession of his soul he remained convinced not without reason that nearly all the great feudal lords who had been his foes were continuing to conspire against him and that he ought not on his side ever to cease from striving against thorn The trial of the constable saint Pol had confirmed all his suspicions he had discovered thereby traces and almost proofs of a design for a long time past conceived and pursued by the constable and his associates the design of seizing the king keeping him prisoner and setting his son the dauphin on the throne with a regency composed of a council of lords Amongst the declared or presumed adherents of this project the king had found James d Armagnac Duke of Nemours the companion and friend of his youth for his father the Count of Pardiac had been governor to Louis at that time dauphin Louis on becoming king had loaded James d Armagnac with favors had raised his countship of Nemours to a duchy peerage of France had married him to Louise of Anjou daughter of the Count of Maine and niece of King Rend The new Duke of Nemours entered nevertheless into the League of Common Weal against the king Having been included in fourteen sixty five with the other chiefs of the league in the treaty of Conflans and reconciled with the king the Duke of Nemours made oath to him in the Sainte Chapelle to always be to him a good faithful and loyal subject and thereby obtained the governorship of Paris and Ile de France But in fourteen sixty nine he took part in the revolt of his cousin Count John d Armagnac who was supposed to be in communication with the English and having been vanquished by the Count de Dampmartin he had need of a fresh pardon from the king which he obtained on renouncing the privileges of the peerage if he should offend again He then withdrew within his own domains and there lived in tranquillity and popularity but still keeping up secret relations with his old associates especially with the Duke of Burgundy and the constable of saint Pol In fourteen seventy six during the Duke of Burgundy s first campaign against the Swiss the more or less active participation of the Duke of Nemours with the king s enemies appeared to Louis so grave that he gave orders to his son in law Peter of Bourbon Sire de Beaujeu to go and besiege him in his castle of Carlat in Auvergne The Duke of Nemours was taken prisoner there and carried off to Vienne in Dauphiny where the king then happened to be In spite of the prisoner s entreaties Louis absolutely refused to see him and had him confined in the tower of Pierre Encise The Duke of Nemours was so disquieted at his position and the king s wrath that his wife Louise of Anjou who was in her confinement at Carlat had a fit of terror and died there and he himself shut up at Pierre Encise in a dark and damp dungeon found his hair turn white in a few days He was not mistaken about the gravity of the danger Louis was both alarmed at these incessantly renewed conspiracies of the great lords and vexed at the futility of his pardons He was determined to intimidate his enemies by a grand example and avenge his kingly self respect by bringing his power home to the ingrates who made no account of his indulgence He ordered that the Duke of Nemours should be removed from Pierre Encise to Paris and put in the Bastille where he arrived on the fourth of August fourteen seventy six and that commissioners should set about his trial The king complained of the gentleness with which the prisoner had been treated on arrival and wrote to one of the commissioners It seems to me that you have but one thing to do that is to find out what guarantees the Duke of Nemours had given the constable of being at one with him in making the Duke of Burgundy regent putting me to death seizing my lord the dauphin and taking the authority and government of the realm He must he made to speak clearly on this point and must get hell be put to the torture in good earnest I am not pleased at what you tell me as to the irons having been taken off his legs as to his being let out from his cage and as to his being taken to the mass to which the women go Whatever the chancellor or others may say take care that he budge not from his cage that he be never let out save to give him hell torture him and that he suffer hell torture in his own chamber The Duke of Nemours protested against the choice of commissioners and claimed as a peer of the realm his right to be tried by the parliament When put to the torture he ended by saying I wish to conceal nothing from the king I will tell him the truth as to all I know My most dread and sovereign lord he himself wrote to Louis I have been so misdoing towards you and towards God that I quite see that I am undone unless your grace and pity be extended to me the which accordingly most humbly and in great bitterness and contrition of heart I do beseech you to bestow upon me liberally and he put the simple signature Poor James He confessed that he had been cognizant of the constable s designs but he added that whilst thanking him for the kind offers made to himself and whilst testifying his desire that the lords might at last get their guarantees he had declared what great obligations and great oaths he was under to the king against the which he would not go he moreover had told the constable he had no money at the moment to dispose of no relative to whom he was inclined to trust himself or whom he could exert himself to win over not even M d Albret his cousin In such confessions there was enough to stop upright and fair judges from the infliction of capital punishment but not enough to reassure and move the heart of Louis XI On the chancellor s representations he consented to have the business sent before the parliament but the peers of the realm were not invited to it The king summoned the parliament to Noyon to be nearer his own residence and he ordered that the trial should be brought to a conclusion in that town and that the original commissioners who had commenced proceedings as well as thirteen other magistrates and officers of the king denoted by their posts should sit with the lords of the parliament and deliberate with them In spite of so many arbitrary precautions and violations of justice the will of Louis XI met even in a parliament thus distorted with some resistance Three of the commissioners added to the court abstained from taking any part in the proceedings three of the councillors pronounced against the penalty of death and the king s own son in law Sire de Beaujeu who presided confined himself to collecting the votes without delivering an opinion and to announcing the decision It was to the effect that James d Armagnac Duke of Nemours was guilty of high treason and as such deprived of all honors dignities and prerogatives and sentenced to be beheaded and executed according to justice Furthermore the court declared all his possessions confiscated and lapsed to the king The sentence determined upon at Noyon on the tenth of July fourteen seventy seven was made known to the Duke of Nemours on the fourth of August in the Bastille and carried out the same day in front of the market place A disgusting detail reproduced by several modern writers has almost been received into history Louis XI it is said ordered the children of the Duke of Nemours to be placed under the scaffold and be sprinkled with their father s blood None of his contemporaries even the most hostile to Louis XI and even amongst those who at the states general held in fourteen eighty four one of them after his death raised their voices against the trial of the Duke of Nemours and in favor of his children has made any mention of this pretended atrocity Amongst the men who have reigned and governed ably Louis XI is one of those who could be most justly taxed with cruel indifference when cruelty might be useful to him but the more ground there is for severe judgment upon the chieftains of nations the stronger is the interdict against overstepping the limit justified and authorized by facts The same rule of historical equity makes it incumbent upon us to remark that in spite of his feelings of suspicion and revenge Louis XI could perfectly well appreciate the men of honor in whom he was able to have confidence and would actually confide in them even contrary to ordinary probabilities He numbered amongst his most distinguished servants three men who had begun by serving his enemies and whom he conquered so to speak by his penetration and his firm mental grasp of policy The first was Philip of Chabannes Count de Dampmartin an able and faithful military leader under Charles VII so suspected by Louis XI at his accession that when weary of living in apprehension and retirement he came in fourteen sixty three and presented himself to the king who was on his way to Bordeaux Ask you justice or mercy demanded Louis Justice sir was the answer Very well then replied the king I banish you forever from the kingdom And he issued an order to that effect at the same time giving Dampmartin a large sum to supply the wants of exile It is credible that Louis already knew the worth of the man and wished in this way to render their reconciliation more easy Three years afterwards in fourteen sixty six he restored to Dampmartin his possessions together with express marks of royal favor and twelve years later in fourteen seventy eight in spite of certain gusts of doubt and disquietude which had passed across his mind as to Dampmartin under circumstances critical for both of them the king wrote to him Sir Grand Master I have received your letters and I do assure you by the faith of my body that I am right joyous that you provided so well for your affair at Quesnoy for one would have said that you and the rest of the old ones were no longer any good in an affair of war and we and the rest of the young ones would have gotten the honor for ourselves Search I pray you to the very roots the case of those who would have betrayed us and punish them so well that they shall never do you harm I have always told you that you have no need to ask me for leave to go and do your business for I am sure that you would not abandon mine without having provided for everything Wherefore I put myself in your hands and you can go away without leave All goes well and I am much better pleased at your holding your own so well than if you had risked a loss of two to one And so farewell In fourteen sixty five another man of war Odet d Aydie Lord of Lescun in Warn had commanded at Montlhery the troops of the Dukes of Berry and Brittany against Louis XI and in fourteen sixty nine the king who had found means of making his acquaintance and who was wiser says Commynes in the conduct of such treaties than any other prince of his time resolved to employ him in his difficult relations with his brother Charles then Duke of Guienne promising him that he and his servants and he especially should profit thereby Three years afterwards in fourteen seventy two Louis made Lescun Count of Comminges wherein he showed good judgment adds Commynes saying that no peril would come of putting in his hands that which he did put for never during those past dissensions had the said Lescun a mind to have any communication with the English or to consent that the places of Normandy should be handed over to them and to the end of his life Louis XI kept up the confidence which Lescun had inspired by his judicious fidelity in the case of this great question There is no need to make any addition to the name of Philip de Commynes the most precious of the politic conquests made by Louis in the matter of eminent counsellors to whom he remained as faithful as they were themselves faithful and useful to him The Memoires of Commynes are the most striking proof of the rare and unfettered political intellect placed by the future historian at the king s service and of the estimation in which the king had wit enough to hold it Louis XI rendered to France four centuries ago during a reign of twenty two years three great services the traces and influence of which exist to this day He prosecuted steadily the work of Joan of Arc and Charles VII the expulsion of a foreign kingship and the triumph of national independence and national dignity By means of the provinces which he successively won wholly or partly Burgundy Franche Comte Artois Provence Anjou Roussillon and Barrois he caused France to make a great stride towards territorial unity within her natural boundaries By the defeat he inflicted on the great vassals the favor he showed the middle classes and the use he had the sense to make of this new social force he contributed powerfully to the formation of the French nation and to its unity under a national government Feudal society had not an idea of how to form itself into a nation or discipline its forces under one head Louis XI proved its political weakness determined its fall and labored to place in its stead France and monarchy Herein are the great facts of his reign and the proofs of his superior mind But side by side with these powerful symptoms of a new regimen appeared also the vices of which that regimen contained the germ and those of the man himself who was laboring to found it Feudal society perceiving itself to be threatened at one time attacked Louis XI with passion at another entered into violent disputes against him and Louis in order to struggle with it employed all the practices at one time crafty and at another violent that belong to absolute power Craft usually predominated in his proceedings violence being often too perilous for him to risk it he did not consider himself in a condition to say brazen facedly Might before right but he disregarded right in the case of his adversaries and he did not deny himself any artifice any lie any baseness however specious in order to trick them or ruin them secretly when he did not feel himself in a position to crush them at a blow The end justifies the means that was his maxim and the end in his case was sometimes a great and legitimate political object nothing less than the dominant interest of France but far more often his own personal interest something necessary to his own success or his own gratification No loftiness no greatness of soul was natural to him and the more experience of life he had the more he became selfish and devoid of moral sense and of sympathy with other men whether rivals tools or subjects All found out before long not only how little account he made of them but also what cruel pleasure he sometimes took in making them conscious of his disdain and his power He was familiar but not by no means vulgar he was in conversation able and agreeable with a mixture however of petulance and indiscretion even when he was meditating some perfidy and there is much need he used to say that my tongue should sometimes serve me it has hurt me often enough The most puerile superstitions as well as those most akin to a blind piety found their way into his mind When he received any bad news he would cast aside forever the dress he was wearing when the news came and of death he had a dread which was carried to the extent of pusillanimity and ridiculousness Whilst he was every day says M de Barante becoming more suspicious more absolute more terrible to his children to the princes of the blood to his old servants and to his wisest counsellors there was one man who without any fear of his wrath treated him with brutal rudeness This was James Cattier his doctor When the king would sometimes complain of it before certain confidential servants I know very well Cattier would say that some fine morning you ll send me where you ve sent so many others but sdeath you ll not live a week after Then the king would coax him overwhelm him with caresses raise his salary to ten thousand crowns a month make him a present of rich lordships and he ended by making him premier president of the Court of Exchequer All churches and all sanctuaries of any small celebrity were recipients of his oblations and it was not the salvation of his soul but life and health that he asked for in return One day there was being repeated on his account and in his presence an orison to saint Eutropius who was implored to grant health to the soul and health to the body The latter will be enough said the king it is not right to bother the saint for too many things at once He showed great devotion for images which had received benediction and often had one of them sewn upon his hat Hawkers used to come and bring them to him and one day he gave a hundred and sixty livres to a pedler who had in his pack one that had received benediction at Aix la Chapelle Illustration Louis XI at his Devotions two hundred fifty five Whatever may have been in the middle ages the taste and the custom in respect of such practices they were regarded with less respect in the fifteenth than in the twelfth century and many people scoffed at the trust that Louis XI placed in them or doubted his sincerity Whether they were sincere or assumed the superstitions of Louis XI did not prevent him from appreciating and promoting the progress of civilization towards which the fifteenth century saw the first real general impulse He favored the free development of industry and trade he protected printing in its infancy and scientific studies especially the study of medicine by his authorization it is said the operation for the stone was tried for the first time in France upon a criminal under sentence of death who recovered and was pardoned and he welcomed the philological scholars who were at this time laboring to diffuse through Western Europe the works of Greek and Roman antiquity He instituted at first for his own and before long for the public service post horses and the letter post within his kingdom Towards intellectual and social movement he had not the mistrust and antipathy of an old one grooved worn out unproductive despotism his kingly despotism was new and one might almost say innovational for it sprang and was growing up from the ruins of feudal rights and liberties which had inevitably ended in monarchy But despotism s good services are short lived it has no need to last long before it generates iniquity and tyranny and that of Louis XI in the latter part of his reign bore its natural unavoidable fruits His mistrust says M de Barante became horrible and almost insane every year he had surrounded his castle of Plessis with more walls ditches and rails On the towers were iron sheds a shelter from arrows and even artillery More than eighteen hundred of those planks bristling with nails called caltrops were distributed over the yonder side of the ditch There were every day four hundred crossbow men on duty with orders to fire on whosoever approached Every suspected passer by was seized and carried off to Tristan l Hermite the provost marshal No great proofs were required for a swing on the gibbet or for the inside of a sack and a plunge in the Loire Men who like Sire de Commynes had been the king s servants and who had lived in his confidence had no doubt but that he had committed cruelties and perpetrated the blackest treachery still they asked themselves whether there had not been a necessity and whether he had not in the first instance been the object of criminal machinations against which he had to defend himself But throughout the kingdom the multitude of his subjects who had not received kindnesses from him nor lived in familiarity with him nor known of the ability displayed in his plans nor enjoyed the wit of his conversation judged only by that which came out before their eyes the imposts had been made much heavier without any consent on the part of the states general the talliages which under Charles VII brought in only eighteen hundred thousand livres rose under Louis XI to thirty seven hundred thousand the kingdom was ruined and the people were at the last extremity of misery the prisons were full none was secure of life or property the greatest in the land and even the princes of the blood were not safe in their own houses An unexpected event occurred at this time to give a little more heart to Louis XI who was now very ill and to mingle with his gloomy broodings a gleam of future prospects Mary of Burgundy daughter of Charles the Rash died at Bruges on the twenty seventh of March fourteen eighty two leaving to her husband Maximilian of Austria a daughter hardly three years of age Princess Marguerite by name heiress to the Burgundian Flemish dominions which had not come into the possession of the King of France Louis as soon as he heard the news conceived the idea and the hope of making up for the reverse he had experienced five years previously through the marriage of Mary of Burgundy He would arrange espousals between his son the dauphin Charles thirteen years old and the infant princess left by Mary and thus recover for the crown of France the beautiful domains he had allowed to slip from him A negotiation was opened at once on the subject between Louis Maximilian and the estates of Flanders and on the twenty threed of December fourteen eighty two it resulted in a treaty concluded at Arras which arranged for the marriage and regulated the mutual conditions In January fourteen eighty three the ambassadors from the estates of Flanders and from Maximilian who then for the first time assumed the title of archduke came to France for the ratification of the treaty Having been first received with great marks of satisfaction at Paris they repaired to Plessis les Tours Great was their surprise at seeing this melancholy abode this sort of prison into which there was no admittance save after so many formalities and precautions When they had waited a while they were introduced in the evening into a room badly lighted In a dark corner was the king seated in an arm chair They moved towards him and then in a weak and trembling voice but still as it seemed in a bantering tone Louis asked pardon of the Abbot of saint Peter of Ghent and of the other ambassadors for not being able to rise and greet them After having heard what they had to say and having held a short conversation with them he sent for the Gospels for to make oath He excused himself for being obliged to take the holy volume in his left hand for his right was paralyzed and his arm supported in a sling Then holding the volume of the Gospels he raised it up painfully and placing upon it the elbow of his right arm he made oath Thus appeared in the eyes of the Flemings that king who had done them so much harm and who was obtaining of them so good a treaty by the fear with which he inspired them all dying as he was On the twod of June following the infant princess Marguerite of Austria was brought by a solemn embassy to Paris first and then on the twenty threed of June to Amboise where her betrothal to the dauphin Charles was celebrated Louis XI did not feel fit for removal to Amboise and he would not even receive at Plessis les Tours the new Flemish embassy Assuredly neither the king nor any of the actors in this regal scene foresaw that this marriage which they with reason looked upon as a triumph of French policy would never be consummated that at the request of the court of France the pope would annul the betrothal and that nine years after its celebration in fourteen ninety two the Austrian princess after having been brought up at Amboise under the guardianship of the Duchess of Bourbon Anne eldest daughter of Louis XI would be sent back to her father Emperor Maximilian by her affianced Charles VIII then King of France who preferred to become the husband of a French princess with a French province for dowry Anne Duchess of Brittany Illustration Views of the Castle of Plessis les Tours two hundred fifty eight It was in March fourteen eighty one that Louis XI had his first attack of that apoplexy which after several repeated strokes reduced him to such a state of weakness that in June fourteen eighty three he felt himself and declared himself not in a fit state to be present at his son s betrothal Two months afterwards on the twenty fifth of August saint Louis s day he had a fresh stroke and lost all consciousness and speech He soon recovered them but remained so weak that he could not raise his hand to his mouth and under the conviction that he was a dead man he sent for his son in law Peter of Bourbon Sire de Beaujeu and Go said he to Amboise to the king my son I have intrusted him as well as the government of the kingdom to your charge and my daughter s care You know all I have enjoined upon him watch and see that it be observed Let him show favor and confidence towards those who have done me good service and whom I have named to him You know too of whom he should beware and who must not be suffered to come near him He sent for the chancellor from Paris and bade him go and take the seals to the king Go to the king he said to the captains of his guards to his archers to his huntsmen to all his household His speech never failed him after it had come back to him says Commynes nor his senses he was constantly saying something of great sense and never in all his illness which lasted from Monday to Saturday evening did he complain as do all sorts of folk when they feel ill Notwithstanding all those commands he recovered heart adds Commynes and had good hope of escaping In conversation at odd times with some of his servants and even with Commynes himself he had begged them whenever they saw that he was very ill not to mention that cruel word death he had even made a covenant with them that they should say no more to him than Don t talk much which would be sufficient warning But his doctor James Coettier and his barber Oliver the Devil whom he had ennobled and enriched under the name of Oliver le Daim did not treat him with so much indulgence They notified his death to him in brief and harsh terms says Commynes Sir we must do our duty have no longer hope in your holy man of Calabria or in other matters for assuredly all is over with you think of your soul there is no help for it I have hope in God that He will aid me answered Louis coldly peradventure I am not so ill as you think He endured with manly virtue so cruel a sentence says Commynes and everything even to death more than any man I ever saw die he spoke as coolly as if he had never been ill He gave minute orders about his funeral sepulchre and tomb He would be laid at Notre Dame de Clery and not like his ancestors at saint Denis his statue was to be gilt bronze kneeling face to the altar head uncovered and hands clasped within his hat as was his ordinary custom Not having died on the battle field and sword in hand he would be dressed in hunting garb with jack boots a hunting horn slung over his shoulder his hound lying beside him his order of saint Michael round his neck and his sword at his side As to the likeness he asked to be represented not as he was in his latter days bald bow backed and wasted but as he was in his youth and in the vigor of his age face pretty full nose aquiline hair long and falling down behind to his shoulders After having taken all these pains about himself after his death he gave his chief remaining thoughts to France and his son Orders must be sent said he to M d Esquerdes Philip de Crevecoeur Baron d Esquerdes a distinguished warrior who after the death of Charles the Rash had through the agency of Commynes gone over to the service of Louis XI and was in command of his army to attempt no doings as to Calais We had thought to drive out the English from this the last corner they hold in the kingdom but such matters are too weighty all that business ends with me M d Esquerdes must give up such designs and come and guard my son without budging from his side for at least six months Let an end be put also to all our disputes with Brittany and let this Duke Francis be allowed to live in peace without any more causing him trouble or fear This is the way in which we must now deal with all our neighbors Five or six good years of peace are needful for the kingdom My poor people have suffered too much they are in great desolation If God had been pleased to grant me life I should have put it all to rights it was my thought and my desire let my son be strictly charged to remain at peace especially whilst he is so young At a later time when he is older and when the kingdom is in good case he shall do as he pleases about it Illustration Louis XI two hundred sixty On Saturday August thirty fourteen eighty three between seven and eight in the evening Louis XI expired saying Our Lady of Embrun my good mistress have pity upon me the mercies of the Lord will I sing forever misericordias Domini in ceternum cantabo It was a great cause of joy throughout the kingdom says M de Barante with truth in his Histoire des Dues de Bourgogne this moment had been impatiently waited for as a deliverance and as the ending of so many woes and fears For a long time past no King of France had been so heavy on his people or so hated by them This was certainly just and at the same time ungrateful Louis XI had rendered France great service but in a manner void of frankness dignity or lustre he had made the contemporary generation pay dearly for it by reason of the spectacle he presented of trickery perfidy and vindictive cruelty and by his arbitrary and tyrannical exercise of kingly power People are not content to have useful service they must admire or love and Louis XI inspired France with neither of those sentiments He has had the good fortune to be described and appraised in his own day too by the most distinguished and independent of his councillors Philip de Commynes and three centuries afterwards by one of the most thoughtful and the soundest intellects amongst the philosophers of the eighteenth century Duclos who moreover had the advantage of being historiographer of France and of having studied the history of that reign in authentic documents We reproduce here the two judgments the agreement of which is remarkable God says Commynes had created our king more wise liberal and full of manly virtue than the princes who reigned with him and in his day and who were his enemies and neighbors In all there was good and evil for they were men but without flattery in him were more things appertaining to the office of king than in any of the rest I saw them nearly all and knew what they could do Louis XI says Duclos was far from being without reproach few princes have deserved so much but it may be said that he was equally celebrated for his vices and his virtues and that everything being put in the balance he was a king We will be more exacting than Commynes and Duclos we will not consent to apply to Louis XI the words liberal virtuous and virtue he had nor greatness of soul nor uprightness of character nor kindness of heart he was neither a great king nor a good king but we may assent to Duclos last word he was a king CHAPTER XXVI THE WARS OF ITALY CHARLES VIII fourteen eighty three fourteen ninety eight Illustration CHARLES VIII two hundred sixty three Louis XI had by the queen his wife Charlotte of Savoy six children three of them survived him Charles VIII his successor Anne his eldest daughter who had espoused Peter of Bourbon Sire de Beaujeu and Joan whom he had married to the Duke of Orleans who became Louis XII At their father s death Charles was thirteen Anne twenty two or twenty three and Joan nineteen According to Charles V s decree which had fixed fourteen as the age for the king s majority Charles VIII on his accession was very nearly a major but Louis XI with good reason considered him very far from capable of reigning as yet On the other hand he had a very high opinion of his daughter Anne and it was to her far more than to Sire de Beaujeu her husband that six days before his death and by his last instructions he intrusted the guardian ship of his son to whom he already gave the title of King and the government of the realm They were oral instructions not set forth in or confirmed by any regular testament but the words of Louis XI had great weight even after his death Opposition to his last wishes was not wanting Louis Duke of Orleans was a natural claimant to the regency but Anne de Beaujeu immediately and without consulting anybody took up the position which had been intrusted to her by her father and the fact was accepted without ceasing to be questioned Louis XI had not been mistaken in his choice there was none more fitted than his daughter Anne to continue his policy under the reign and in the name of his successor a shrewd and clever woman if ever there was one says Brantome and the true image in everything of King Louis her father Illustration Anne de Beaujeu two hundred sixty four She began by acts of intelligent discretion She tried not to subdue by force the rivals and malcontents but to put them in the wrong in the eyes of the public and to cause embarrassment to themselves by treating them with fearless favor Her brother in law the Duke of Bourbon was vexed at being only in appearance and name the head of his own house and she made him constable of France and lieutenant general of the kingdom The friends of Duke Louis of Orleans amongst others his chief confidant George of Amboise Bishop of Montauban and Count Dunois son of Charles VII s hero persistently supported the duke s rights to the regency and Madame the title Anne de Beaujeu had assumed made Duke Louis governor of Ile de France and of Champagne and sent Dunois as governor to Dauphiny She kept those of Louis XI s advisers for whom the public had not conceived a perfect hatred like that felt for their master and Commynes alone was set aside as having received from the late king too many personal favors and as having too much inclination towards independent criticism of the new regency Two of Louis XI s subordinate and detested servants Oliver de Daim and John Doyac were prosecuted and one was hanged and the other banished and his doctor James Cattier was condemned to disgorge fifty thousand crowns out of the enormous presents he had received from his patient At the same time that she thus gave some satisfaction to the cravings of popular wrath Anne de Beaujeu threw open the prisons recalled exiles forgave the people a quarter of the talliage cut down expenses by dismissing six thousand Swiss whom the late king had taken into his pay re established some sort of order in the administration of the domains of the crown and in fine whether in general measures or in respect of persons displayed impartiality without paying court and firmness without using severity Here was in fact a young and gracious woman who gloried solely in signing herself simply Anne of France whilst respectfully following out the policy of her father a veteran king able mistrustful and pitiless Anne s discretion was soon put to a great trial A general cry was raised for the convocation of the states general The ambitious hoped thus to open a road to power the public looked forward to it for a return to legalized government No doubt Anne would have preferred to remain more free and less responsible in the exercise of her authority for it was still very far from the time when national assemblies could be considered as a permanent power and a regular means of government But Anne and her advisers did not waver they were too wise and too weak to oppose a great public wish The states general were convoked at Tours for the fifth of January fourteen eighty four On the fifteenth they met in the great hall of the arch bishop s palace Around the king s throne sat two hundred and fifty deputies whom the successive arrivals of absentees raised to two hundred and eighty four France in all its entirety says M Picot found itself for the first time represented Flanders alone sent no deputies until the end of the session but Provence Roussillon Burgundy and Dauphiny were eager to join their commissioners to the delegates from the provinces united from the oldest times to the crown Histoire des Etats Generaux from thirteen fifty five to sixteen fourteen by George Picot t i p three hundred sixty We have the journal of these states general drawn up with precision and detail by one of the chief actors John Masselin canon of and deputy for Rouen an eminent speaker says a contemporary Norman chronicle who delivered on behalf of the common weal in the presence of kings and princes speeches full of elegance We may agree that compared with the pompous pedantry of most speakers of his day the oratorical style of John Masselin is not without a certain elegance but that is not his great and his original distinction what marks him out and gives him so high a place in the history of the fifteenth century is the judicious and firm political spirit displayed in his conduct as deputy and in his narrative as historian The Journal written by the author in Latin was translated into French and published original and translation by M A Bernier in eighteen thirty five in the Collection des Documents inedits relatifs d l Histoire de France And it is not John Masselin only but the very assembly itself in which he sat that appears to us at the end of five centuries seriously moved by a desire for a free government and not far from comprehending and following out the essential conditions of it France had no lack of states general full of brilliancy and power between thirteen fifty six and seventeen eighty nine from the reign of Charles V to that of Louis XVI but in the majority of these assemblies for all the ambitious soarings of liberty it was at one time religious party spirit and at another the spirit of revolution that ruled and determined both acts and events Nothing of that kind appeared in the states general assembled at Tours in fourteen eighty four the assembly was profoundly monarchical not only on general principles but in respect of the reigning house and the young king seated on the throne There was no fierce struggle either between the aristocracy and the democracy of the day between the ecclesiastical body and the secular body although widely differing and widely separated the clergy the nobility and the third estate were not at war even in their hearts between themselves One and the same idea one and the same desire animated the three orders to such a degree that as has been well pointed out by M Picot in the majority of the towns they proceeded in common to the choice of deputies the clergy nobles and commons who arrived at Tours were not the representatives exclusively of the clergy the nobles or the third estate they combined in their persons a triple commission and when after having examined together their different memorials by the agency of a committee of thirty six members taken in equal numbers from the three orders they came to a conclusion to bring their grievances and their wishes before the government of Charles VIII they decided that a single spokesman should be commissioned to sum up in a speech delivered in solemn session the report of the committee of Thirty six and it was the canon Master John Masselin who received the commission to speak in the name of all They all had at heart one and the same idea they desired to turn the old and undisputed monarchy into a legalized and free government Clergy nobles and third estate there was not in any of their minds any revolutionary yearning or any thought of social war It is the peculiar and the beautiful characteristic of the states general of fourteen eighty four that they had an eye to nothing but a great political reform a regimen of legality and freedom Two men one a Norman and the other a Burgundian the canon John Masselin and Philip Pot lord of la Roche a former counsellor of Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy were the exponents of this political spirit at once bold and prudent conservative and reformative The nation s sovereignty and the right of the estates not only to vote imposts but to exercise a real influence over the choice and conduct of the officers of the crown this was what they affirmed in principle and what in fact they labored to get established I should like said Philip de la Roche to see you quite convinced that the government of the state is the people s affair and by the people I mean not only the multitude of those who are simply subjects of this crown but indeed all persons of each estate including the princes also Since you consider yourselves deputies from all the estates of the kingdom why are you afraid to conclude that you have been especially summoned to direct by your counsels the commonwealth during its quasi interregnum caused by the king s minority Far be it from me to say that the reigning properly so called the dominion in fact passes into any hands but those of the king it is only the administration the guardianship of the kingdom which is conferred for a time upon the people or their elect Why tremble at the idea of taking in hand the regulation arrangement and nomination of the council of the crown You are here to say and to advise freely that which by inspiration of God and your conscience you believe to be useful for the realm What is the obstacle that prevents you from accomplishing so excellent and meritorious a work I can find none unless it be your own weakness and the pusillanimity which causes fear in your minds Come then most illustrious lords have great confidence in yourselves have great hopes have great manly virtue and let not this liberty of the estates that your ancestors were so zealous in defending be imperilled by reason of your soft heartedness This speech says Masselin was listened to by the whole assembly very attentively and very favorably Masselin being called upon to give the king in his privy chamber before the Dukes of Orleans and Lorraine and a numerous company of nobles an exact account of the estates first deliberations held in his turn language more reserved than but similar to that of Lord Philip de la Roche whose views he shared and whose proud openness he admired The question touching the composition of the king s council and the part to be taken in it by the estates was for five weeks the absorbing idea with the government and with the assembly There were made on both sides concessions which satisfied neither the estates nor the court for their object was always on the part of the estates to exercise a real influence on the government and on the part of the court to escape being under any real influence of the estates Side by side with the question of the king s council was ranged that of the imposts and here it was no easier to effect an understanding the crown asked more than the estates thought they ought or were able to vote and after a long and obscure controversy about expenses and receipts Masselin was again commissioned to set before the king s council the views of the assembly and its ultimate resolution When we saw said he that the aforesaid accounts or estimates contained elements of extreme difficulty and that to balance and verify them would subject us to interminable discussions and longer labor than would be to our and the people s advantage we hastened to adopt by way of expedient but nevertheless resolutely the decision I am about to declare to you Wishing to meet liberally the king s and your desires we offer to pay the sum that King Charles VII used to take for the impost of talliages provided however that this sum be equally and proportionately distributed between the provinces of the kingdom and that in the shape of an aid And this contribution be only for two years after which the estates shall be assembled as they are to day to discuss the public needs and if at that time or previously they see the advantage thereof the said sum shall be diminished or augmented Further the said my lords the deputies do demand that their next meeting be now appointed and declared and that an irrevocable decision do fix and decree that assembly This was providing at one and the same time for the wants of the present and the rights of the future The impost of talliage was indeed voted just as it had stood under Charles VII but it became a temporary aid granted for two years only at the end of them the estates were to be convoked and the tax augmented or diminished according to the public wants The great question appeared decided by means of the vote necessary and at the same time temporary in the case of the impost the states general entered into real possession of a decisive influence in the government but the behavior and language of the officers of the crown and of the great lords of the court rendered the situation as difficult as ever In a long and confused harangue the chancellor William de Rochefort did not confine himself to declaring the sum voted twelve hundred thousand livres to be insufficient and demanding three hundred thousand livres more he passed over in complete silence the limitation to two years of the tax voted and the requirement that at the end of that time the states general should be convoked Whilst the chancellor was thus speaking says Masselin many deputies of a more independent spirit kept groaning and all the hall resounded with a slight murmuring because it seemed that he was not expressing himself well as to the power and liberty of the people The deputies asked leave to deliberate in the afternoon promising a speedy answer As you wish to deliberate do so but briefly said the chancellor it would be better for you to hold counsel now so as to answer in the afternoon The deputies took their time and the discussion was a long and a hot one We see quite well how it is said the princes and the majority of the great lords to curtail the king s power and pare down his nails to the quick is the object of your efforts you forbid the subjects to pay their prince as much as the wants of the state require are they masters pray and no longer subjects You would set up the laws of some fanciful monarchy and abolish the old ones I know the rascals said one of the great lords according to one historian it was the Duke of Bourbon Anne de Beaujeu s brother in law if they are not kept down by over weighting them they will soon become insolent for my part I consider this tax the surest curb for holding them in Strange words says Masselin unworthy of utterance from the mouth of a man so eminent but in his soul as in that of all old men covetousness had increased with age and he appeared to fear a diminution of his pension After having deliberated upon it the states general persisted in their vote of a tax of twelve hundred thousand livres at which figure it had stood under King Charles VII but for two years only and as a gift or grant not as a permanent talliage any more and on condition that at the end of that time the states should be necessarily convoked At the same time however and over and above this the said estates who do desire the well being honor prosperity and augmentation of the lord king and of his kingdom and in order to obey him and please him in all ways possible do grant him the sum of three hundred thousand livres of Tours for this once only and without being a precedent on account of his late joyful accession to the throne of France and for to aid and support the outlay which it is suitable to make for his holy consecration coronation and entry into Paris On this fresh vote full of fidelity to the monarchy and at the same time of patriotic independence negotiations began between the estates and the court and they lasted from the twenty eighth of February to the twelfth of March but without result At bottom the question lay between absolute power and free government between arbitrariness and legality and on this field both parties were determined not to accept a serious and final defeat Unmoved by the loyal concessions and assurances they received the advisers of the crown thought no longer of anything but getting speedily rid of the presence of the estates so as to be free from the trouble of maintaining the discussion with them The deputies saw through the device their speeches were stifled and the necessity of replying was eluded My lord chancellor said they at an interview on the twod of March fourteen eighty four if we are not to have a hearing why are we here Why have you summoned us Let us withdraw If you behave thus you do not require our presence We did not at all expect to see the fruits of our vigils and the decisions adopted after so much trouble by so illustrious an assembly rejected so carelessly The complaints were not always so temperate A theologian whom Masselin quotes without giving his name a bold and fiery partisan of the people says he added these almost insulting words As soon as our consent had been obtained for raising the money there is no doubt but that we have been cajoled that everything has been treated with contempt the demands set down in our memorials our final resolutions and the limits we fixed Speak we of the money On this point our decisions have been conformed to only so far as to tell us This impost shall no longer be called talliage it shall be a free grant Is it in words pray and not in things that our labor and the well being of the state consist Verily we would rather still call this impost talliage and even blackmail maltote or give it a still viler name if there be any than see it increasing immeasurably and crushing the people The curse of God and the execration of men upon those whose deeds and plots have caused such woes They are the most dangerous foes of the people and of the commonwealth The theologian burned with a desire to continue adds Masselin but though he had not wandered far from the truth many deputies chid him and constrained him to be silent Already lethargy had fallen upon the most notable amongst us glutted with favors and promises they no longer possessed that ardor of will which had animated them at first when we were prosecuting our business they remained motionless at home when we spoke before them they held their peace or added but a few feeble words We were wasting our time On the twelfth of March fourteen eighty four the deputies from Normandy twenty five in number happened to hold a meeting at Montils les Tours The Bishop of Coutances told them that there was no occasion for the estates to hold any more meetings that it would be enough if each of the six sections appointed three or four delegates to follow the course of affairs and that moreover the compensation granted to all the deputies of the estates would cease on the fourteenth of March and after that would be granted only to their delegates This compensation had already amongst the estates been the subject of a long discussion The clergy and the nobility had attempted to throw the whole burden of it upon the third estate the third estate had very properly claimed that each of the three orders should share proportionately in this expense and the chancellor had with some difficulty got it decided that the matter should stand so On the fourteenth of March accordingly the six sections of the estates met and elected three or four deputies apiece The deputies were a little surprised on entering their sessions hall to find it completely dismantled carpets hangings benches table all had been removed so certainly did the government consider the session over Some members in disgust thought and maintained that the estates ought not to separate without carrying away with them the resolutions set down in their general memorial formally approved and accompanied by an order to the judges to have them executed But a much larger number says Masselin were afraid of remaining too long and many of our colleagues in spite of the zeal which they had once shown had a burning desire to depart according to the princes good pleasure and orders As for us we enjoined upon the three deputies of our Norman nationality not to devote themselves solely to certain special affairs which had not yet been terminated but to use redoubled care and diligence in all that concerned the general memorial and the aggregate of the estates And having thus left our commissioners at Tours and put matters to rights we went away well content and we pray God that our labors and all that has been done may be useful for the people s welfare Neither Masselin nor his descendants for more than three centuries were destined to see the labors of the states general of fourteen eighty four obtain substantial and durable results The work they had conceived and attempted was premature The establishment of a free government demands either spontaneous and simple virtues such as may be found in a young and small community or the lights the scientific method and the wisdom painfully acquired and still so imperfect of great and civilized nations France of the fifteenth century was in neither of these conditions But it is a crown of glory to have felt that honest and patriotic ambition which animated Masselin and his friends at their exodus from the corrupt and corrupting despotism of Louis XI Who would dare to say that their attempt vain as it was for them was so also for generations separated from them by centuries Time and space are as nothing in the mysterious development of God s designs towards men and it is the privilege of mankind to get instruction and example from far off memories of their own history It was a duty to render to the states general of fourteen eighty four the homage to which they have a right by reason of their intentions and their efforts on behalf of the good cause and in spite of their unsuccess When the states general had separated Anne de Beaujeu without difficulty or uproar resumed as she had assumed on her father s death the government of France and she kept it yet for seven years from fourteen eighty four to fourteen ninety one During all this time she had a rival and foe in Louis Duke of Orleans who was one day to be Louis XII I have heard tell says Brantome how that at the first she showed affection towards him nay even love in such sort that if M d Orleans had been minded to give heed thereto he might have done well as I know from a good source but he could not bring himself to it especially as he found her too ambitious and he would that she should be dependent on him as premier prince and nearest to the throne and not he on her whereas she desired the contrary for she was minded to have the high place and rule everything They used to have adds Brantome prickings of jealousy love and ambition If Brantome s anecdote is true as one is inclined to believe though several historians have cast doubts upon it Anne de Beaujeu had in their prickings of jealousy love and ambition a great advantage over Louis of Orleans They were both young and exactly of the same age but Louis had all the defects of youth whilst Anne had all the qualities of mature age He was handsome volatile inconsiderate impudent brave and of a generous open nature combined with kindliness she was thoughtful judicious persistent and probably a little cold and hard such in fact as she must needs have become in the school of her father Louis XI As soon as the struggle between them began the diversity of their characters appeared and bore fruit The Duke of Orleans plunged into all sorts of intrigues and ventures against the fair regent exciting civil war and when he was too much compromised or too hard pressed withdrawing to the court of Francis II Duke of Brittany an unruly vassal of the King of France Louis of Orleans even made alliance at need with foreign princes Henry VII King of England Ferdinand the Catholic King of Arragon and Maximilian archduke of Austria without much regard for the interests of his own kingly house and his own country Anne on the contrary in possession of official and legal authority wielded it and guarded it with prudence and moderation in the interests of France and of the crown never taking the initiative in war but having the wit to foresee maintain and after victory end it She encountered from time to time at her own court and in her own immediate circle a serious difficulty the young king Charles was charmed by the Duke of Orleans s brilliant qualities especially by the skill and bravery that Louis displayed at tournaments One day interrupting the Bishop of Montauban George of Amboise who was reading the breviary to him Send word to the Duke of Orleans said the king to go on with his enterprise and that I would fain be with him Another day he said to Count Dunois Do take me away uncle I m longing to be out of this company Dunois and George of Amboise both of them partisans of the Duke of Orleans carefully encouraged the king in sentiments so favorable to the fair regent s rival Incidents of another sort occurred to still further embarrass the position for Anne de Beaujeu The eldest daughter of Francis II Duke of Brittany herself also named Anne would inherit his duchy and on this ground she was ardently wooed by many competitors She was born in fourteen seventy seven and at four years of age in fourteen eighty one she had been promised in marriage to Edward Prince of Wales son of Edward IV King of England But two years afterwards in fourteen eighty three this young prince was murdered or according to other accounts imprisoned by his uncle Richard III who seized the crown and the Breton promise vanished with him The number of claimants to the hand of Anne of Brittany increased rapidly and the policy of the duke her father consisted it was said in making for himself five or six sons in law by means of one daughter Towards the end of fourteen eighty four the Duke of Orleans having embroiled himself with Anne de Beaujeu sought refuge in Brittany and many historians have said that he not only at that time aspired to the hand of Anne of Brittany but that he paid her assiduous court and obtained from her marks of tender interest Count Darn in his Histoire de Bretagne t iii p eighty two has put the falsehood of this assertion beyond a doubt the Breton princess was then only seven and the Duke of Orleans had been eight years married to Joan of France younger daughter of Louis XI But in succeeding years and amidst the continual alternations of war and negotiation between the King of France and the Duke of Brittany Anne de Beaujeu and the Duke of Orleans competition and strife between the various claimants to the hand of Anne of Brittany became very active Alan Sire d Albret called the Great because of his reputation for being the richest lord of the realm Viscount James de Rohan and Archduke Maximilian of Austria all three believed themselves to have hopes of success and prosecuted them assiduously Sire d Albret a widower and the father of eight children already was forty five with a pimply face a hard eye a hoarse voice and a quarrelsome and gloomy temper and Anne being pressed to answer his suit finally declared that she would turn nun rather than marry him James de Rohan in spite of his powerful backers at the court of Rennes was likewise dismissed his father Viscount John II was in the service of the King of France Archduke Maximilian remained the only claimant with any pretensions He was nine and twenty of gigantic stature justly renowned for valor and ability in war and of more literary culture than any of the princes his contemporaries a trait he had in common with Princess Anne whose education had been very carefully attended to She showed herself to be favorably disposed towards him and the Duke of Orleans whose name married though he was was still sometimes associated with that of the Breton princess formally declared on the twenty sixth of January fourteen eighty six that when he came to the Duke of Brittany s it was solely to visit him and advise him on certain points touching the defence of his duchy and not to talk to him of marriage with the princesses his daughters But whilst the negotiation was thus inclining towards the Austrian prince Anne de Beaujeu ever far sighted and energetic was vigorously pushing on the war against the Duke of Brittany and his allies She had found in Louis de la Tremoille an able and a bold warrior whom Guicciardini calls the greatest captain in the world In July fourteen eighty eight he came suddenly down upon Brittany took one after the other Chateaubriant Ancenis and Fougeres and on the twenty eighth gained at saint Aubin du Cormier near Rennes over the army of the Duke of Brittany and his English German and Gascon allies a victory which decided the campaign six thousand of the Breton army were killed and Duke Louis of Orleans the Prince of Orange and several French lords his friends were made prisoners On receiving at Angers the news of this victory Charles VIII gave orders that the two captive princes should be brought to him but Anne de Beaujeu fearing some ebullition on his part of a too prompt and too gratuitous generosity caused delay in their arrival and the Duke of Orleans who was taken first to the castle of Sable and then to Lusignan went ultimately to the Tower of Bourges where he was to await the king s decision It was a great success for Anne de Beaujeu She had beaten her united foes and the most formidable of them all the Duke of Orleans was her prisoner Two incidents that supervened one a little before and the other a little after the battle of saint Aubin du Cormier occurred to both embarrass the position and at the same time call forth all the energy of Anne Her brother in law Duke John of Bourbon the head of his house died on the first of April fourteen eighty eight leaving to his younger brother Peter his title and domains Having thus become Duchess of Bourbon and being well content with this elevation in rank and fortune Madame the Great as Anne de Beaujeu was popularly called was somewhat less eagerly occupied with the business of the realm was less constant at the king s council and went occasionally with her husband to stay a while in their own territories Charles VIII moreover having nearly arrived at man s estate made more frequent manifestations of his own personal will and Anne clear sighted and discreet though ambitious was little by little changing her dominion into influence But some weeks after the battle of saint Aubin du Cormier on the seventh or ninth of September fourteen eighty eight the death of Francis II Duke of Brittany rendered the active intervention of the Duchess of Bourbon natural and necessary for he left his daughter the Princess Anne barely eighteen years old exposed to all the difficulties attendant upon the government of her inheritance and to all the intrigues of the claimants to her hand In the summer of fourteen eighty nine Charles VIII and his advisers learned that the Count of Nassau having arrived in Brittany with the proxy of Archduke Maximilian had by a mock ceremony espoused the Breton princess in his master s name This strange mode of celebration could not give the marriage a real and indissoluble character but the concern in the court of France was profound In Brittany there was no mystery any longer made about the young duchess s engagement she already took the title of Queen of the Romans Charles VIII loudly protested against this pretended marriage and to give still more weight to his protest he sent to Henry VII King of England who was much mixed up with the affairs of Brittany ambassadors charged to explain to him the right which France had to oppose the marriage of the young Duchess with Archduke Maximilian at the same time taking care not to give occasion for thinking that Charles had any views on his own account in that quarter The king my master said the ambassador doth propose to assert by arms his plain rights over the kingdom of Naples now occupied by some usurper or other a bastard of the house of Arragon He doth consider moreover the conquest of Naples only as a bridge thrown down before him for to take him into Greece there he is resolved to lavish his blood and his treasure though he should have to pawn his crown and drain his kingdom for to overthrow the tyranny of the Ottomans and open to himself in this way the kingdom of Heaven The King of England gave a somewhat ironical reply to this chivalrous address merely asking whether the King of France would consent not to dispose of the heiress of Brittany s hand save on the condition of not marrying her himself The ambassadors shuffled out of the question by saying that their master was so far from any such idea that it had not been foreseen in their instructions Whether it had or had not been foreseen and meditated upon so soon as the reunion of Brittany with France by the marriage of the young duchess Anne with King Charles VIII appeared on the horizon as a possible and peradventure probable fact it became the common desire aim and labor of all the French politicians who up to that time had been opposed persecuted and proscribed Since the battle of saint Aubin du Cormier Duke Louis of Orleans had been a prisoner in the Tower of Bourges and so strictly guarded that he was confined at night in an iron cage like Cardinal Balue s for fear he should escape In vain had his wife Joan of France an unhappy and virtuous princess ugly and deformed who had never been able to gain her husband s affections implored her all powerful sister Anne of Bourbon to set him at liberty As I am incessantly thinking she wrote to her about my husband s release I have conceived the idea of setting down in writing the fashion in which peace might be had and my said husband be released I am writing it out for the king and you will see it all I pray you sister to look to it that I may get a few words in answer it has been a very sad thing for me that I never see you now There is no trace of any answer from Anne to her sister Charles VIII had a heart more easily touched When Joan in mourning came and threw herself at his feet saying Brother my husband is dragging on his life in prison and I am in such trouble that I know not what I ought to say in his defence If he has had aught wherewith to reproach himself I am the only one whom he has outraged Pardon him brother you will never have so happy a chance of being generous You shall have him sister said Charles kissing her grant Heaven that you may not repent one day of that which you are doing for him to day Some days after this interview in May fourteen ninety one Charles without saying anything about it to the duchess Anne of Bourbon set off one evening from Plessis du Pare on pretence of going a hunting and on reaching Berry sent for the Duke of Orleans from the Tower of Bourges Louis in raptures at breathing the air of freedom at the farthest glimpse he caught of the king leaped down from his horse and knelt weeping on the ground Charles says the chronicler sprang upon his neck and knew not what cheer reception to give him to make it understood that he was acting of his own motion and free will Charles ill understood his sister Anne and could scarcely make her out But two convictions had found their way into that straightforward and steady mind of hers one that a favorable time had arrived for uniting Brittany with France and must be seized the other that the period of her personal dominion was over and that all she had to do was to get herself well established in her new position She wrote to the king her brother to warn him against the accusations and wicked rumors of which she might possibly be the object He replied to her on the twenty first of June fourteen ninety one My good sister my dear Louis de Pesclins has informed me that you have knowledge that certain matters have been reported to me against you whereupon I answered him that nought of the kind had been reported to me and I assure you that none would dare so to speak to me for in whatsoever fashion it might I would not put faith therein as I hope to tell you when we are together bidding you adieu my good sister my dear After having re assured his sister Charles set about reconciling her as well as her husband the Duke of Bourbon with her brother in law the Duke of Orleans Louis who was of a frank and by no means rancorous disposition as he himself said and proved at a later period submitted with a good grace and on the fourth of September fourteen ninety one at La Fleche the princes jointly made oath by their baptism and with their hands on the book of the Gospels to hold one another once more in perpetual affection and to forget all old rancor hatred and ill will for to well and loyally serve King Charles guard his person and authority and help him to comfort the people and set in order his household and his kingdom Councillors and servants were included in this reconciliation of the masters and Philip de Commynes and the Bishop of Montauban ere long Archbishop of Rouen Governor of Normandy and Cardinal d Amboise went out of disgrace took their places again in the king s councils and set themselves loyally to the work of accomplishing that union between Charles VIII and Anne of Brittany whereby France was to achieve the pacific conquest of Brittany Pacific as it was this conquest cost some pains and gave some trouble In person Charles VIII was far from charming he was short and badly built he had an enormous head great blank looking eyes an aquiline nose bigger and thicker than was becoming thick lips too and everlastingly open nervous twitchings disagreeable to see and slow speech In my judgment adds the ambassador from Venice Zachary Contarini who had come to Paris in May fourteen ninety two I should hold that body and mind he is not worth much however they all sing his praises in Paris as a right lusty gallant at playing of tennis and at hunting and at jousting exercises to the which in season and out of season he doth devote a great deal of time The same ambassador says of Anne of Brittany who had then been for four months Queen of France The queen is short also thin lame of one foot and perceptibly so though she does what she can for herself by means of boots with high heels a brunette and very pretty in the face and for her age very knowing in such sort that what she has once taken into her head she will obtain somehow or other whether it be smiles or tears that be needed for it La Diplomatic Venitienne au Seizieme Siecle by M Armand Baschet p three hundred twenty five Paris eighteen sixty two Knowing as she was Anne was at the same time proud and headstrong she had a cultivated mind she was fond of the arts of poetry and of ancient literature she knew Latin and even a little Greek and having been united though by proxy and at a distance to a prince whom she had never seen but whom she knew to be tall well made and a friend to the sciences she revolted at the idea of giving him up for a prince without beauty and to such an extent without education that it is said Charles VIII when he ascended the throne was unable to read When he was spoken of to the young princess I am engaged in the bonds of matrimony to Archduke Maximilian said Anne and the King of France on his side is affianced to the Princess Marguerite of Austria we are not free either of us She went so far as to say that she would set out and go and join Maximilian Her advisers who had nearly all of them become advocates of the French marriage did their best to combat this obstinacy on the part of their princess and they proposed to her other marriages Anne answered I will marry none but a king or a king s son Whilst the question was thus being disputed at the little court of Rennes the army of Charles VIII was pressing the city more closely every day Parleys took place between the leaders of the two hosts and the Duke of Orleans made his way into Rennes had an interview with the Duchess Anne and succeeded in shaking her in her refusal of any French marriage Many maintain says Count Philip de Segur Histoire de Charles VIII t i p two hundred seventeen that Charles VIII himself entered alone and without escort into the town he was besieging had a conversation with the young duchess and left to her the decision of their common fate declaring to her that she was free and he her captive that all roads would be open to her to go to England or to Germany and that for himself he would go to Touraine to await the decision whereon depended together with the happiness of his own future that of all the kingdom Whatever may be the truth about these chivalrous traditions there was concluded on the fifteenth of September fourteen ninety one a treaty whereby the two parties submitted themselves for an examination of all questions that concerned them to twenty four commissioners taken half and half from the two hosts and in order to give the preconcerted resolution an appearance of mutual liberty authority was given to the young Duchess Anne to go if she pleased and join Maximilian in Germany Charles VIII accompanied by a hundred men at arms and fifty archers of his guard again entered Rennes and three days afterwards the King of France and the Duchess of Brittany were secretly affianced in the chapel of Notre Dame The Duke of Orleans the Duchess of Bourbon the Prince of Orange Count Dunois and some Breton lords were the sole witnesses of the ceremony Next day Charles VIII left Rennes and repaired to the castle of Langeais in Touraine There the Duchess Anne joined him a fortnight afterwards The young Princess Marguerite of Austria who had for eight years been under guardianship and education at Amboise as the future wife of the King of France was removed from France and taken back into Flanders to her father Archduke Maximilian with all the external honors that could alleviate such an insult On the thirteenth of December fourteen ninety one the contract of marriage between Charles VIII and Anne of Brittany was drawn up in the great hall of the castle of Langeais in two drafts one in French and the other in Breton The Bishop of Alby celebrated the nuptial ceremony By that deed if my Lady Anne were to die before King Charles and his children issue of their marriage she ceded and transferred irrevocably to him and his successors kings of France all her rights to the duchy of Brittany King Charles ceded in like manner to my Lady Anne his rights to the possession of the said duchy if he were to die before her with out children born of their marriage My Lady Anne could not in case of widowhood contract a second marriage save with the future king if it were his pleasure and were possible or with other near and presumptive future successor to the throne who should be bound to make to the king regnant on account of the said duchy the same acknowledgments that the predecessors of the said Lady Anne had made On the seventh of February fourteen ninety two Anne was crowned at saint Denis and next day the eighth of February she made her entry in state into Paris amidst the joyful and earnest acclamations of the public A sensible and a legitimate joy for the reunion of Brittany to France was the consolidation of the peace which in this same century on the seventeenth of September fourteen fifty three had put an end to the Hundred Years War between France and England and was the greatest act that remained to be accomplished to insure the definitive victory and the territorial constitution of French nationality Illustration Meeting between Charles VIII and Anne of Brittany two hundred eighty two Charles VIII was pleased with and proud of himself He had achieved a brilliant and a difficult marriage In Europe and within his own household he had made a display of power and independence In order to espouse Anne of Brittany he had sent back Marguerite of Austria to her father He had gone in person and withdrawn from prison his cousin Louis of Orleans whom his sister Anne de Beaujeu had put there and so far from having got embroiled with her he saw all the royal family reconciled around him This was no little success for a young prince of twenty one He thereupon devoted himself with ardor and confidence to his desire of winning back the kingdom of Naples which Alphonso I King of Arragon had wrested from the house of France and of thereby re opening for himself in the East and against Islamry that career of Christian glory which had made a saint of his ancestor Louis IX Mediocre men are not safe from the great dreams which have more than once seduced and ruined the greatest men The very mediocre son of Louis XI on renouncing his father s prudent and by no means chivalrous policy had no chance of becoming a great warrior and a saint but not the less did he take the initiative as to those wars in Italy which were to be so costly to his successors and to France By two treaties concluded in fourteen ninety three one at Barcelona on the nineteenth of January and the other at Senlis on the twenty threed of May he gave up Roussillon and Cerdagne to Ferdinand the Catholic King of Arragon and Franche Comte Artois and Charolais to the house of Austria and after having at such a lamentable price purchased freedom of movement he went and took up his quarters at Lyons to prepare for his Neapolitan venture In his council he found loyal and able opponents On the undertaking of this trip says Philip de Commynes one of those present there was many a discussion for it seemed to all folks of wisdom and experience very dangerous all things necessary for so great a purpose were wanting the king was very young a poor creature wilful and with but a small attendance of wise folk and good leaders no ready money neither tents nor pavilions for wintering in Lombardy One thing good they had a lusty company full of young men of family but little under control The chiefest warrior of France at this time Philip de Crevecoeur Marshal d Esquerdes threw into the opposition the weight of his age and of his recognized ability The greatness and tranquillity of the realm said he depend on possession of the Low Countries that is the direction in which we must use all our exertions rather than against a state the possession of which so far from being advantageous to us could not but weaken us Unhappily says the latest learned historian of Charles VIII Histoire de Charles VIII by the late M de Cherrier t i p three hundred ninety three the veteran marshal died on the twenty twod of April fourteen ninety four in a small town some few leagues from Lyons and thenceforth all hope of checking the current became visionary On the eighth of September fourteen ninety four Charles VIII started from Grenoble crossed Mount Genevre and went and slept at Oulx which was territory of Piedmont In the evening a peasant who was accused of being a master of Vaudery i e one of the Vaudois a small population of reformers in the Alps between Piedmont and Dauphiny was brought before him the king gave him audience and then handed him over to the provost who had him hanged on a tree By such an act of severity perpetrated in a foreign country and on the person of one who was not his own subject did Charles VIII distinguish his first entry into Italy Illustration Charles VIII crossing the Alps two hundred eighty five It were out of place to follow out here in all its details a war which belongs to the history of Italy far more than to that of France it will suffice to point out with precision the positions of the principal Italian states at this period and the different shares of influence they exercised on the fate of the French expedition Six principal states Piedmont the kingdom of the Dukes of Savoy the duchy of Milan the republic of Venice the republic of Florence Rome and the pope and the kingdom of Naples company existed in Italy at the end of the fifteenth century In August fourteen ninety four when Charles VIII started from Lyons on his Italian expedition Piedmout was governed by Blanche of Montferrat widow of Charles the Warrior Duke of Savoy in the name of her son Charles John Amadeo a child only six years old In the duchy of Milan the power was in the hands of Ludovic Sforza called the Moor who being ambitious faithless lawless unscrupulous employed it in banishing to Pavia the lawful duke his own nephew John Galeas Mario Sforza of whom the Florentine ambassador said to Ludovic himself This young man seems to me a good young man and animated by good sentiments but very deficient in wits He was destined to die ere long probably by poison The republic of Venice had at this period for its doge Augustin Barbarigo and it was to the council of Ten that in respect of foreign affairs as well as of the home department the power really belonged Peter de Medici son of Lorenzo de Medici the father of the Muses was feebly and stupidly though with all the airs and pretensions of a despot governing the republic of Florence Rome had for pope Alexander VI Poderigo Borgia a prince who was covetous licentious and brazen facedly fickle and disloyal in his policy and who would be regarded as one of the most utterly demoralized men of the fifteenth century only that he had for son a Caesar Borgia Finally at Naples in fourteen ninety four three months before the day on which Charles VIII entered Italy King Alphonso II ascended the throne No man says Commynes was ever more cruel than he or more wicked or more vicious and tainted or more gluttonous less dangerous however than his father King Ferdinand the which did take in and betray folks whilst giving them good cheer kindly welcome as hath been told to me by his relatives and friends and who did never have any pity or compassion for his poor people Such in Italy whether in her kingdoms or her republics were the Heads with whom Charles VIII had to deal when he went in the name of a disputed right three hundred leagues away from his own kingdom in quest of a bootless and ephemeral conquest The reception he met with at the outset of his enterprise could not but confirm him in his illusory hopes Whilst he was at Lyons engaged in preparations for his departure Duke Charles of Savoy whose territories were the first he would have to cross came to see him on a personal matter Cousin my good friend said the king to him I am delighted to see you at Lyons for if you had delayed your coming I had intended to go myself to see you with a very numerous company in your own dominions where it is likely such a visit could not but have caused you loss My lord answered the duke my only regret at your arrival in my dominions would be that I should be unable to give you such welcome there as is due to so great a prince However whether here or elsewhere I shall be always ready to beg that you will dispose of me and all that pertains to me just as of all that might belong to your own subjects Duke Charles of Savoy had scarcely exaggerated he was no longer living in September fourteen ninety four when Charles VIII demanded of his widow Blanche regent in the name of her infant son a free passage for the French army over her territory and she not only granted his request but when he entered Turin she had him received exactly as he might have been in the greatest cities of France He admired the magnificent jewels she wore and she offered to lend them to him He accepted them and soon afterwards borrowed on the strength of them twelve thousand golden ducats so ill provided was he with money The fair regent besides made him a present of a fine black horse which Commynes calls the best in the world and which ten months later Charles rode at the battle of Fornovo the only victory he was to gain on retiring from this sorry campaign On entering the country of the Milanese he did not experience the same feeling of confidence that Piedmont had inspired him with Not that Ludovic the Moor hesitated to lavish upon him assurances of devotion Sir said he have no fear for this enterprise there are in Italy three powers which we consider great and of which you have one which is Milan another which is the Venetians does not stir so you have to do only with that of Naples and many of your predecessors have beaten us when we were all united If you will trust me I will help to make you greater than ever was Charlemagne and when you have in your hands this kingdom of Naples we shall easily drive yon Turk out of that empire of Constantinople These words pleased Charles VIII mightily and he would have readily pinned his faith to them but he had at his side some persons more clear sighted and Ludovic had enemies who did not deny themselves the pleasure of enlightening the king concerning him He invited Charles to visit Milan he desired to parade before the eyes of the people his alliance and intimate friendship with the powerful King of France but Charles who had at first treated him as a friend all at once changed his demeanor and refused to go to Milan so as not to lose time Ludovic was too good a judge to make any mistake in the matter but he did not press the point Charles resumed his road to Piacenza where his army awaited him At Pavia vows harangues felicitations protestations of devotion were lavished upon him without restoring his confidence quarters had been assigned to him within the city he determined to occupy the castle which was in a state of defence his own guard took possession of the guard posts and the watch was doubled during the night Ludovic appeared to take no notice and continued to accompany the king as far as Piacenza the last town in the state of Milan Into it Charles entered with seventy eight hundred horse many Swiss foot and many artillerymen and bombardiers The Italian population regarded this army with an admiration tinged with timidity and anxiety News was heard there to the effect that young John Galeas nephew of Ludovic the Moor and lawful Duke of Milan was dead He left a son five years old for whom he had at Pavia implored the king s protection and I will look upon him as my own King Charles had answered as he fondled the child Ludovic set out in haste for Milan and it was not long before it was known that he had been proclaimed duke and put in possession of the duchy Distrust became general throughout the army Those who ought to have known best told me says Commynes that several who had at first commended the trip now found fault with it and that there was a great inclination to turn back However the march was continued forward and on the twenty ninth of October fourteen ninety four the French army encamped before Sarzana a Florentine town Ludovic the Moor suddenly arrived in the camp with new proposals of alliance on new conditions Charles accepted some of them and rejected the principal ones Ludovic went away again on the threed of November never to return From this day the King of France might reckon him amongst his enemies With the republic of Florence was henceforth to be Charles s business Its head Peter de Medici went to the camp at Sarzana and Philip de Commynes started on an embassy to go and negotiate with the doge and senate of Venice which was the chiefest of the Italian powers and the territory of which lay far out of the line of march of the King of France and his army In the presence of the King of France and in the midst of his troops Peter de Medici grew embarrassed and confused He had gone to meet the king without the knowledge of the Florentines and was already alarmed at the gravity of his situation and he offered more concession and submission than was demanded of him Those who treated with him says Commynes told me turning him to scorn and ridicule that they were dumbfounded at his so readily granting so great a matter and what they were not prepared for Feelings were raised to the highest pitch at Florence when his weaknesses were known There was a numerous and powerful party consisting of the republicans and the envious hostile to the Medicis and they eagerly seized the opportunity of attacking them A deputation comprising the most considerable men of the city was sent on the fifth of November to the King of France with a commission to obtain from him more favorable conditions The Dominican Jerome Savonarola at that time the popular oracle of Florence was one of them With a pious hauteur that was natural and habitual to him he adopted the same tone towards Charles as towards the people of Florence Hearken thou to my words said he and grave them upon thy heart I warn thee in God s name that thou must show thyself merciful and forbearing to the people of Florence if thou wouldest that He should aid thee in thy enterprise Charles who scarcely knew Savonarola by name answered simply that he did not wish to do the Florentines any harm but that he demanded a free passage and all that had been promised him I wish to be received at Florence he added to sign there a definitive treaty which shall settle everything At these cold expressions the ambassadors withdrew in some disquietude Peter de Medici who was lightly confident returned to Florence on the eighth of November and attempted again to seize the supreme power A violent outbreak took place Peter was as weak before the Florentine populace as he had been before the King of France and having been harried in his very palace which was given up to pillage it was only in the disguise of a monk that he was able on the ninth of November to get out of the city in company with his two brothers Julian and Cardinal John de Medici of whom the latter was to be ten years later Pope Leo X Peter and his brothers having been driven out the Florentines were anxious to be reconciled with Charles VIII Both by political tradition and popular bias the Florentine republic was favorable to France Charles annoyed at what had just taken place showed but slight inclination to enter into negotiation with them but his wisest advisers represented to him that in order to accomplish his enterprise and march securely on Naples he needed the good will of Florence and the new Florentine authorities promised him the best of receptions in their city Into it Charles entered on the seventeenth of November fourteen ninety four at the head of all his army His reception on the part of officials and populace was really magnificent Negotiation was resumed Charles was at first very exacting the Florentine negotiators protested one of them Peter Capponi a man of great wits and great courage says Guiceiardini highly esteemed for those qualities in Florence and issue of a family which had been very powerful in the republic when he heard read the exorbitant conditions proposed to them on the king s behalf started up suddenly took the paper from the secretary s hands and tore it up before the king s eyes saying Since you impose upon us things so dishonorable have your trumpets sounded and we will have our bells rung and he went forth from the chamber together with his comrades Charles and his advisers thought better of it mutual concessions were made a treaty concluded on the twenty fifth of November secured to the King of France a free passage through the whole extent of the republic and a sum of one hundred and twenty thousand golden florins to help towards the success of the expedition against Naples the commune of Florence engaged to revoke the order putting a price upon the head of Peter de Medici as well as confiscating his goods and not to enforce against him any penalty beyond proscription from the territory and the honor as well as the security of both the contracting parties having thus been provided for Charles VIII left Florence and took with his army the road towards the Roman States Having on the seventh of December fourteen ninety four entered Acquapendente and on the tenth Viterbo he there received on the following day a message from Pope Alexander VI who in his own name and that of Alphonso II King of Naples made him an offer of a million ducats to defray the expenses of the war and a hundred thousand livres annually on condition that he would abandon his enterprise against the kingdom of Naples I have no mind to make terms with the Arragonese usurper answered Charles I will treat directly with the pope when I am in Rome which I reckon upon entering about Christmas I have already made known to him my intentions I will forthwith send him ambassadors commissioned to repeat them to him And he did send to him the most valiant of his warriors Louis de la Tremoille the which was there says the contemporary chronicler John Bouchet with certain speakers who after having pompously reminded the pope of the whole history of the French kingship in its relations with the papacy ended up in the following strain prayeth you then our sovereign lord the king not to give him occasion to be to his great sorrow the first of his lineage who ever had war and discord with the Roman Church whereof he and the Christian Kings of France his predecessors have been protectors and augmenters More briefly and with an affectation of sorrowful graciousness the pope made answer to the ambassador If it please King Charles my eldest spiritual son to enter into my city without arms in all humility he will be most welcome but much would it annoy me if the army of thy king should enter because that under shadow of it which is said to be great and riotous the factions and bands of Rome might rise up and cause uproar and scandal wherefrom great discomforts might happen to the citizens For three weeks the king and the pope offered the spectacle only too common in history of the hypocrisy of might pitted against the hypocrisy of religion At last the pope saw the necessity of yielding he sent for Prince Ferdinand son of the King of Naples and told him that he must no longer remain at Rome with the Neapolitan troops for that the King of France was absolute about entering and he at the same time handed him a safe conduct under Charles s own hand Ferdinand refused the safe conduct and threw himself upon his knees before the pope asking him for his blessing Rise my dear son said the pope go and have good hope God will come to our aid The Neapolitans departed and on the first of January fourteen ninety five Charles VIII entered Rome with his army saying gentlewise according to Brantome that a while agone he had made a vow to my lord saint Peter of Rome and that of necessity he must accomplish it at the peril of his life Behold him then entered into Rome continues Brantome in bravery and triumph himself armed at all points with lance on thigh as if he would fain pick forward to the charge Marching in this fine and furious order of battle with trumpets a sounding and drums a beating he enters in and takes his lodging by the means of his harbingers wheresoever it seems to him good has his bodies of guards set posts his sentinels about the places and districts of the noble city with no end of rounds and patrols has his tribunals and his gallows planted in five or six different spots his edicts and ordinances being published and proclaimed by sound of trumpet as if he had been in Paris Go find me ever a King of France who did such things save Charlemagne yet trow I he did not bear himself with authority so superb and imperious What remained then more for this great king if not to make himself full master of this glorious city which had subdued all the world in days of yore as it was in his power to do and as he perchance would fain have done in accordance with his ambition and with some of his council who urged him mightily thereto if it were only for to keep himself secure But far from this violation of holy religion gave him pause and the reproach that might have been brought against him of having done offence to his Holiness though reason enough had been given him on the contrary he rendered him all honor and obedience even to kissing in all humility his slipper Oeuvres de Brantome Paris eighteen twenty two t ii p three No excuse is required for quoting this fragment of Brantome for it gives the truest and most striking picture of the conditions of facts and sentiments during this transitory encounter between a madly adventurous king and a brazen facedly dishonest pope Thus they passed four weeks at Rome the pope having retired at first to the Vatican and afterwards to the castle of saint Angelo and Charles remaining master of the city which in a fit of mutual ill humor and mistrust was for one day given over to pillage and the violence of the soldiery At last on the fifteenth of January a treaty was concluded which regulated pacific relations between the two sovereigns and secured to the French army a free passage through the States of the Church both going to Naples and also returning and provisional possession of the town of Civita Vecchia on condition that it should be restored to the pope when the king returned to France On the sixteenth and nineteenth of January the pope and the king had two interviews one private and the other public at which they renewed their engagements and paid one another the stipulated honors It was announced that on the twenty threed of January the Arragonese King of Naples Alphonso II had abdicated in favor of his son Ferdinand II and on the twenty eighth of January Charles VIII took solemn leave of the pope received his blessing and left Rome as he had entered it at the head of his army and more confident than ever in the success of the expedition he was going to carry out Illustration Charles VIII two hundred ninety three Ferdinand II the new King of Naples who had no lack of energy or courage was looking everywhere at home and abroad for forces and allies to oppose the imminent invasion To the Duke of Milan he wrote Remember that we two are of the same blood It is much to be desired that a league should at once be formed between the pope the kings of the Romans and Spain you and Venice If these powers are united Italy would have nought to fear from any Give me your support I have the greatest need of it If you back me I shall owe to you the preservation of my throne and I will honor you as my father He

influence his ardor caused fear instead of sympathy Charles kept advancing along the kingdom through the midst of people that remained impassive when they did not give him a warm reception The garrison of Monte San Giovanni the strongest place on the frontier determined to resist The place was carried by assault in a few hours and the assailants says a French chronicler without pity or compassion made short work of all those plunderers and malefactors whose bodies they hurled down from the walls The carnage lasted eight whole hours A few days afterwards Charles with his guard arrived in front of San Germano The clergy awaited him at the gate with cross and banner men of note carried a dais under the which he took his place behind him followed men women and children chanting this versicle from the Psalms Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord The town of Capua was supposed to be very much attached to the house of Arragon John James Trivulzio a valiant Milanese captain who had found asylum and fortune in Naples had the command there and thither King Ferdinand hurried I am going to Naples for troops said he to the inhabitants wait for me confidently and if by to morrow evening you do not see me return make your own terms with King Charles you have my full authority On arriving at Naples he said to the Neapolitans Hold out for a fortnight I will not expose the capital of my kingdom to be stormed by barbarians if within a fort night hence I have not prevented the enemy from crossing the Volturno you may ask him for terms of capitulation and back he went to Capua When he was within sight of the ramparts he heard that on the previous evening before it was night the French had been admitted into the town Trivulzio had been to visit King Charles at Teano and had offered in the name of his troops and of the Capuans to surrender Capua he had even added says Guicciardini that he did not despair of bringing King Ferdinand himself to an arrangement if a suitable provision were guaranteed to him I willingly accept the offer you make me in the name of your troops and of the Capuans answered Charles as for the Arragonese prince he shall be well received if he come to me but let him understand that not an inch of ground shall be left to him in this kingdom in France he shall have honors and beautiful domains On the eighteenth of February Charles entered Capua amidst the cheers of the people and on the same day Trivulzio went over to his service with a hundred lances On returning to Naples Ferdinand found the gates closed and could not get into Castel Nuovo save by a postern At that very moment the mob was pillaging his stables he went down from the fortress addressed the crowd collected beneath the ramparts in a few sad and bitter words into which he tried to infuse some leaven of hope took certain measures to enable the two forts of Naples Castel Nuovo and Castel dell Uovo to defend themselves for a few days longer and on the twenty threed of February went for refuge to the island of Ischia repeating out loud as long as he had Naples in sight this versicle from the Psalms Except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain At Ischia itself he had a fresh trial to make says Guicciardini of his courage and of the ungrateful faithlessness displayed towards those whom Fortune deserts The governor of the island refused to admit him accompanied by more than one man The prince so soon as he got in flung himself upon him poniard in hand with such fury and such an outburst of kingly authority that all the garrison astounded submitted to him and gave up to him the fort and its rock On the very eve of the day on which King Ferdinand II was thus seeking his last refuge in the island of Ischia Charles VIII was entering Naples in triumph at the head of his troops on horseback beneath a pall of cloth of gold borne by four great Neapolitan lords and received says Guicciardini with cheers and a joy of which it would be vain to attempt a description the incredible exultation of a crowd of both sexes of every age of every condition of every quality of every party as if he had been the father and first founder of the city And the great French historian bears similar witness to that of the great Italian historian Never says Commynes did people show so much affection to king or nation as they showed to the king and thought all of them to be free of tyranny At the news hereof the disquietude and vexation of the principal Italian powers were displayed at Venice as well as at Milan and at Rome The Venetian senate as prudent as it was vigilant had hitherto maintained a demeanor of expectancy and almost of good will towards France they hoped that Charles VIII would be stopped or would stop of himself in his mad enterprise without their being obliged to interfere The doge Augustin Barbarigo lived on very good terms with Commynes who was as desirous as he was that the king should recover his senses Commynes was destined to learn how difficult and sorry a thing it is to have to promote a policy of which you disapprove When he perceived that a league was near to being formed in Italy against the King of France he at once informed his master of it and attempted to dissuade the Venetians from it They denied that they had any such design and showed a disposition to form in concert with the Kings of France Spain and the Romans and with the whole of Italy a league against the Turks provided that Charles VIII would consent to leave the King of Naples in possession of his kingdom at the same time keeping for himself three places therein and accepting a sum in ready money which Venice would advance Would to God says Commynes that the king had been pleased to listen then Of all did I give him notice and I got bare answer When the Venetians heard that the king was in Naples and that the strong fort which they had great hopes would hold out was surrendered they sent for me one morning and I found them in great number about fifty or sixty in the apartment of the prince the doge who was ill Some were sitting upon a staircase leading to the benches and had their heads resting upon their hands others otherwise all showing that they had great sadness at heart And I trow that when news came to Rome of the battle lost at Cannae against Hannibal the senators who had remained there were not more dumbfounded and dismayed than these were for not a single one made sign of seeing me or spoke to me one word save the duke the doge who asked me if the king would keep to that of which he had constantly sent them word and which I had said to them I assured them stoutly that he would and I opened up ways for to remain at sound peace hoping to remove their suspicions and then I did get me gone The league was concluded on the thirty first of March fourteen ninety five between Pope Alexander VI Emperor Maximilian I as King of the Romans the King of Spain the Venetians and the Duke of Milan To three ends says Commynes for to defend Christendom against the Turks for the defence of Italy and for the preservation of their Estates There was nothing in it against the king they told me but it was to secure themselves from him they did not like his so deluding the world with words by saying that all he wanted was the kingdom and then to march against the Turk and all the while he was showing quite the contrary I remained in the city about a month after that being as well treated as before and then I went my way having been summoned by the king and being conducted in perfect security at their expense to Ferrara whence I went to Florence for to await the king When Ferdinand II took refuge in the island of Ischia and Castel Nuovo and Castel dell Uovo had surrendered at Naples Charles VIII considering himself in possession of the kingdom announced his intention and there is reason to believe actually harbored the design of returning to France without asserting any further his pretensions as a conqueror On the twentieth of March before the Italian league had been definitively concluded Briconnet Cardinal of saint Malo who had attended the king throughout his expedition wrote to the queen Anne of Brittany His Majesty is using diligence as best he can to return over yonder and has expressly charged me for my part to hasten his affairs I hope he will be able to start hence about the eighth of April He will leave over here as lieutenant my lord de Montpensier with a thousand or twelve hundred lances partly French and partly of this country fifteen hundred Swiss and a thousand French crossbow men Charles himself wrote on the twenty eighth of March to his brother in law the Duke of Bourbon that he would mount his horse immediately after Quasimodo the first Sunday after Easter to return to France without halting or staying in any place But Charles whilst so speaking and projecting was forgetful of his giddy indolence his frivolous tastes and his passion for theatrical display and licentious pleasure The climate the country the customs of Naples charmed him You would never believe he wrote to the Duke of Bourbon what beautiful gardens I have in this city on my faith they seem to me to lack only Adam and Eve to make of them an earthly paradise so beautiful are they and full of nice and curious things as I hope to tell you soon To add to that I have found in this country the best of painters and I will send you some of them to make the most beautiful ceilings possible The ceilings at Beauce Lyons and other places in France do not approach those of this place in beauty and richness Wherefore I shall provide myself with them and bring them with me for to have some done at Arnboise Politics were forgotten in the presence of these royal fancies Charles VIII remained nearly two months at Naples after the Italian league had been concluded and whilst it was making its preparations against him was solely concerned about enjoying in his beautiful but precarious kingdom all sorts of mundane pleasaunces as his councillor the Cardinal of saint Malo says and giving entertainments to his new subjects as much disposed as himself to forget everything in amusement On the twelfth of May fourteen ninety five all the population of Naples and of the neighboring country was afoot early to see their new king make his entry in state as King of Naples Sicily and Jerusalem with his Neapolitan court and his French army Charles was on horseback beneath a rich dais borne by great Neapolitan lords he had a close crown on his head the sceptre in his right hand and a golden globe in his left in front of this brilliant train he took his way through the principal streets of the city halting at the five knots of the noblesse where the gentlemen and their wives who had assembled there detained him a long while requesting him to be pleased to confer with his own hand the order of knighthood on their sons which he willingly did At last he reached the cathedral church of saint Januarius which had recently been rebuilt by Alphonso I of Arragon after the earth quake of fourteen fifty six The archbishop at the head of his clergy came out to meet him and conducted him to the front of the high altar where the head of saint Januarius was exhibited When all these solemnities had been accomplished to the great satisfaction of the populace bonfires were lighted up for three days the city was illuminated and only a week afterwards on the twentieth of May fourteen ninety five Charles VIII started from Naples to return to France with an army at the most from twelve to fifteen thousand strong leaving for guardian of his new kingdom his cousin Gilbert of Bourbon Count de Montpensier a brave but indolent knight who never rose it was said until noon with eight or ten thousand men scattered for the most part throughout the provinces During the months of April and May thus wasted by Charles VIII the Italian league and especially the Venetians and the Duke of Milan Ludovic the Moor had vigorously pushed forward their preparations for war and had already collected an army more numerous than that with which the King of France in order to return home would have to traverse the whole of Italy He took more than six weeks to traverse it passing three days at Rome four at Siena the same number at Pisa and three at Lucca though he had declared that he would not halt anywhere He evaded entering Florence where he had made promises which he could neither retract nor fulfil The Dominican Savonarola who had always preached greatly in the king s favor says Commynes and by his words had kept the Florentines from turning against us came to see him on his way at Poggibonsi I asked him said Commynes whether the king would be able to cross without danger to his person seeing the great muster that was being made by the Venetians He answered me that the king would have trouble on the road but that the honor would remain his though he had but a hundred men at his back but seeing that he had not done well for the reformation of the Church as he ought and had suffered his men to plunder and rob the people God had given sentence against him and in short he would have a touch of the scourge Several contemporary historians affirm that if the Italian army formed by the Venetians and the Duke of Milan had opposed the march of the French army they might have put it in great peril but nothing of the kind was attempted It was at the passage of the Appennines so as to cross them and descend into the duchy of Parma that Charles VIII had for the first time to overcome resistance not from men but from nature He had in his train a numerous and powerful artillery from which he promised himself a great deal when the day of battle came and he had to get it up and down by steep paths Here never says the chronicle of La Tremoille had car or carriage gone The king knowing that the lord of La Tremoille such was his boldness and his strong will thought nothing impossible gave to him this duty which he willingly undertook and to the end that the footmen Swiss German and others might labor thereat without fearing the heat he addressed them as follows The proper nature of us Gauls is strength boldness and ferocity We triumphed at our coming better would it be for us to die than to lose by cowardice the delight of such praise we are all in the flower of our age and the vigor of our years let each lend a hand to the work of dragging the gun carriages and carrying the cannon balls ten crowns to the first man that reaches the top of the mountain before me Throwing off his armor La Tremoille in hose and shirt himself lent a hand to the work by dint of pulling and pushing the artillery was got to the brow of the mountain it was then harder still to get it down the other side along a very narrow and rugged incline and five whole days were spent on this rough work which luckily the generals of the enemy did not attempt to molest La Tremoille black as a Moor says the chronicle by reason of the murderous heat he had endured made his report to the king who said By the light of this day cousin you have done more than ever could Annibal of Carthage or Caesar have done to the peril of your person whereof you have not been sparing to serve me me and mine I vow to God that if I may only see you back in France the recompense I hope to make you shall be so great that others shall conceive fresh desire to serve me Charles VIII was wise to treat his brave men well for the day was at hand when he would need them and all their bravery It was in the duchy of Parma near the town of Fornovo on the right bank of the Taro an affluent of the Po that the French and Italian armies met on the fifth of July fourteen ninety five The French army was nine or ten thousand strong with five or six thousand camp followers servants or drivers the Italian army numbered at least thirty thousand men well supplied and well rested whereas the French were fatigued with their long march and very badly off for supplies During the night between the fifth and sixth of July a violent storm burst over the country rain lightnings and thunder so mighty says Commynes that none could say more seemed that heaven and earth would dissolve or that it portended some great disaster to come Next day at six in the morning Charles VIII heard mass received the communion mounted on horseback and set out to join his own division I went to him says Commynes and found him armed at all points and mounted upon the finest horse I had ever seen in my life called Savoy Duke Charles of Savoy the Duchess of Savoy v p two hundred eighty eight had given it him it was black and had but one eye it was a middle sized horse of good height for him who was upon it Seemed that this young man was quite other than either his nature his stature or his complexion bespoke him for he was very timid in speaking and is so to this day That horse made him look tall and he had a good countenance and of good color and speech bold and sensible On perceiving Commynes the king said to him Go and see if yonder folks would fain parley Sir answered Commynes I will do so willingly but I never saw two so great hosts so near to one another and yet go their ways without fighting He went nevertheless to the Venetian advanced posts and his trumpeter was admitted to the presence of the Marquis of Mantua who commanded the Italian army but skirmishing had already commenced in all quarters and the first boom of the cannon was heard just as the marquis was reading Commynes letter It is too late to speak of peace said he and the trumpeter was sent back The king had joined the division which he was to lead to battle Gentlemen said he to the men at arms who pressed around him you will live or die here with me will you not And then raising his voice that he might be heard by the troops They are ten times as many as we he said but you are ten times better than they God loves the French He is with us and will do battle for us As far as Naples I have had the victory over my enemies I have brought you hither without shame or blame with God s help I will lead you back into France to our honor and that of our kingdom The men at arms made the sign of the cross the foot soldiers kissed the ground and the king made several knights according to custom before going into action The Marquis of Mantua s squadrons were approaching Sir said the bastard of Bourbon there is no longer time for the amusement of making knights the enemy is coming on in force go we at him The king gave orders to charge and the battle began at all points Illustration Battle of Fornovo three hundred three It was very hotly contested but did not last long with alternations of success and reverse on both sides The two principal commanders in the king s army Louis de la Tremoille and John James Trivulzio sustained without recoiling the shock of troops far more numerous than their own At the throat at the throat shouted La Tremoille after the first onset and his three hundred men at arms burst upon the enemy and broke their line In the midst of the melley the French baggage was attacked by the Stradiots a sort of light infantry composed of Greeks recruited and paid by the Venetians Let them be said Trivulzio to his men their zeal for plunder will make them forget all and we shall give the better account of them At one moment the king had advanced before the main body of his guard without looking to see if they were close behind him and was not more than a hundred paces from the Marquis of Mantua who seeing him scantily attended bore down at the head of his cavalry Not possible is it says Commynes to do more doughtily than was done on both sides The king being very hard pressed defended himself fiercely against those who would have taken him the bastard Matthew of Bourbon his brother in arms and one of the bravest knights in the army had thrown himself twenty paces in front of him to cover him and had just been taken prisoner by the Marquis of Mantua in person when a mass of the royal troops came to their aid and released them from all peril Here it was that Peter du Terrail the Chevalier de Bayard who was barely twenty years of age and destined to so glorious a renown made his first essay in arms he had two horses killed under him and took a standard which he presented to the king who after the battle made him a present of five hundred crowns Charles VIII remained master of the battle field There were still to be seen says Commynes outside their camp a great number of men at arms whose lances and heads only were visible and likewise foot soldiers The king put it to the council whether he ought to give chase to them or not some were for marching against them but the French were not of this opinion they said that enough had been done that it was late and that it was time to get lodged Night was coming on the host which had been in front of us withdrew into their camp and we went to get lodged a quarter of a league from where the battle had been The king put up at a poorly built farm house but he found there an infinite quantity of corn in sheaves whereby the whole army profited Some other bits of houses there were hard by which did for a few and every one lodged as he could without making any cantonment I know well enough that I lay in a vineyard at full length on the bare ground without anything else and without cloak for the king had borrowed mine in the morning Whoever had the wherewith made a meal but few had save a hunch of bread from a varlet s knapsack I went to see the king in his chamber where there were some wounded whom he was having dressed he wore a good mien and every one kept a good face and we were not so boastful as a little before the battle because we saw the enemy near us Six days after the battle on the twelfth of July the king wrote to his sister the Duchess Anne of Bourbon Sister my dear I commend myself to you right heartily I wrote to my brother how that I found in my way a big army that Lord Ludovic the Venetians and their allies had got ready against me thinking to keep me from passing Against which with God s help such resistance was made that I am come hither without any loss Furthermore I am using the greatest diligence that can be to get right away and I hope shortly to see you which is my desire in order to tell you at good length all about my trip And so God bless you sister my dear and may He have you in His keeping Both armies might and did claim the victory for they had each of them partly succeeded in their design The Italians wished to unmistakably drive out of Italy Charles VIII who was withdrawing voluntarily but to make it an unmistakable retreat he ought to have been defeated his army beaten and himself perhaps a prisoner With that view they attempted to bar his passage and beat him on Italian ground in that they failed Charles remaining master of the battle field went on his way in freedom and covered with glory he and his army He certainly left Italy but he left it with the feeling of superiority in arms and with the intention of returning thither better informed and better supplied The Italian allies were triumphant but without any ground of security or any lustre the expedition of Charles VIII was plainly only the beginning of the foreigner s ambitious projects invasions and wars against their own beautiful land The King of France and his men of war had not succeeded in conquering it but they had been charmed with such an abode they had displayed in their campaign knightly qualities more brilliant and more masterful than the studied duplicity and elegant effeminacy of the Italians of the fifteenth century and after the battle of Fornovo they returned to France justly proud and foolishly confident notwithstanding the incompleteness of their success Illustration CASTLE OF AMBOISE three hundred eight Charles VIII reigned for nearly three years longer after his return to his kingdom and for the first two of them he passed his time in indolently dreaming of his plans for a fresh invasion of Italy and in frivolous abandonment to his pleasures and the entertainments at his court which he moved about from Lyons to Moulins to Paris to Tours and to Amboise The news which came to him from Italy was worse and worse every day The Count de Montpensier whom he had left at Naples could not hold his own there and died a prisoner there on the eleventh of November fourteen ninety six after having found himself driven from place to place by Ferdinand II who by degrees recovered possession of nearly all his kingdom merely himself also to die there on the sixth of October leaving for his uncle and successor Frederick III the honor of recovering the last four places held by the French Charles ordered a fresh army of invasion to be formed and the Duke of Orleans was singled out to command it but he evaded this commission The young dauphin Charles Orlando three years old had just died a fine child and bold of speech says Commynes and one that feared not the things that other children are wont to fear Duke Louis of Orleans having thus become heir to the throne did not care to go and run risks at a distance He nevertheless declared his readiness to obey an express command from the king if the title of lieutenant general were given him but I will never send him to war on compulsion said Charles and nothing more was said about it Whilst still constantly talking of the war he had in view Charles attended more often and more earnestly than he hitherto had to the internal affairs of his kingdom He had gotten it into his head says Commynes that he would fain live according to God s commandments and set justice and the Church in good order He would also revise his finances in such sort as to levy on the people but twelve hundred thousand francs and that in form of talliage besides his own property on which he would live as did the kings of old His two immediate predecessors Charles VII and Louis IX had decreed the collation and revision of local customs so often the rule of civil jurisdiction but the work made no progress Charles VIII by a decree dated March fifteen fourteen ninety seven abridged the formalities and urged on the execution of it though it was not completed until the reign of Charles IX By another decree dated August two fourteen ninety seven he organized and regulated as to its powers as well as its composition the king s grand council the supreme administrative body which was a fixture at Paris He began even to contemplate a reformation of his own life he had inquiries made as to how saint Louis used to proceed in giving audience to the lower orders his intention he said was to henceforth follow the footsteps of the most justice loving of French kings He set up says Commynes a public audience whereat he gave ear to everybody and especially to the poor I saw him thereat a week before his death for two good hours and I never saw him again He did not much business at this audience but at least it was enough to keep folks in awe and especially his own officers of whom he had suspended some for extortion It is but too often a man s fate to have his life slip from him just as he was beginning to make a better use of it On the seventh of April fourteen ninety eight Charles VIII was pleased after dinner to go down with the queen into the fosses of the castle of Amboise to see a game of tennis Their way lay through a gallery the opening of which was very low and the king short as he was hit his forehead Though he was a little dizzy with the blow he did not stop watched the players for some time and even conversed with several persons but about two in the afternoon whilst he was a second time traversing this passage on his way back to the castle he fell backwards and lost consciousness He was laid upon a paltry paillasse in that gallery where everybody went in and out at pleasure and in that wretched place after a lapse of nine hours expired he says Commynes who had so many fine houses and who was making so fine an one at Amboise so small a matter is our miserable life which giveth us so much trouble for the things of the world and kings cannot help themselves any more than peasants I arrived at Amboise two days after his decease I went to say mine orison at the spot where was the corpse and there I was for five or six hours And of a verity there was never seen the like mourning nor that lasted so long he was so good that better creature cannot be seen the most humane and gentle address that ever was was his I trow that to never a man spake he aught that could displease and at a better hour could he never have died for to remain of great renown in histories and regretted by those that served him I trow I was the man to whom he showed most roughness but knowing that it was in his youth and that it did not proceed from him I never bore him ill will for it Probably no king was ever thus praised for his goodness and his goodness alone by a man whom he had so maltreated and who as judicious and independent as he was just said of this same king He was not better off for sense than for money and he thought of nothing but pastime and his pleasures CHAPTER XXVII THE WARS IN ITALY LOUIS XII fourteen ninety eight fifteen fifteen On ascending the throne Louis XII reduced the public taxes and confirmed in their posts his predecessor s chief advisers using to Louis de la Tremoille who had been one of his most energetic foes that celebrated expression The King of France avenges not the wrongs of the Duke of Orleans At the same time on the day of his coronation at Rheims May twenty seven fourteen ninety two he assumed besides his title of King of France the titles of King of Naples and of Jerusalem and Duke of Milan This was as much as to say that he would pursue a pacific and conservative policy at home and a warlike and adventurous policy abroad

none	none	By his policy at home Louis XII deserved and obtained the name of Father of the People by his enterprises and wars abroad he involved France still more deeply than Charles VIII had in that mad course of distant reckless and incoherent conquests for which his successor Francis I was destined to pay by capture at Pavia and by the lamentable treaty of Madrid in fifteen twenty six as the price of his release

some disquietude on the part of Bayard s captor a courteous gentleman who feared that Lord Ludovico might do him some displeasure He resolved himself to be his conductor after having dressed him in one of his own robes and made him look like a gentleman Marvelling to see Bayard so young Come hither my gentleman said Ludovico who brought you into the city By my faith my lord answered Bayard who was not a whit abashed I never imagined I was entering all alone and thought surely I was being followed of my comrades who knew more about war than I for if they had done as I did they would like me be prisoners Howbeit after my mishap I laud the fortune which caused me to fall into the hands of so valiant and discreet a knight as he who has me in holding By your faith asked Ludovico of how many is the army of the King of France On my soul my lord answered Bayard so far as I can hear there are fourteen or fifteen hundred men at arms and sixteen or eighteen thousand foot but they are all picked men who are resolved to busy themselves so well this bout that they will assure the state of Milan to the king our master and meseems my lord that you would surely be in as great safety in Germany as you are here for your folks are not the sort to fight us With such assurance spoke the good knight that Lord Ludovico took pleasure there in though his say was enough to astound him On my

heritage for I see no other way to it By my sacred oath my lord said the good knight I would that it might be to morrow provided that I were out of captivity Verily that shall not stand in your way said Ludovico for I will let you go forth and that presently Moreover ask of me what you will and I will give it you The good knight who on bended knee thanked Lord Ludovico for the offers he made him as there was good reason he should then said to him My lord I ask of you nothing save only that you may be pleased to extend your courtesy so far as to get me back my horse and my arms that I brought into this city and so send me away to my garrison which is twenty miles hence you would do me a very great kindness for which I shall all my life feel bounden to you and barring my duty to the king my master and saving my honor I would show my gratitude for it in whatsoever it might please you to command me In good faith said Lord Ludovico you shall have presently that which you do ask for And then he said to the Lord John Bernardino At once Sir Captain let his horse be found his arms and all that is his My lord answered the captain it is right easy to find it is all at my quarters He sent forthwith two or three servants who brought the arms and led up the horse of the good young knight and Lord Ludovico had him armed before his eyes When he was accoutred the young knight leaped upon his horse without putting foot to stirrup then he asked for a lance which was handed to him and raising his eyes he said to Lord Ludovico My lord I thank you for the courtesy you have done me please God to pay it back to you He was in a fine large court yard then he began to set spurs to his horse the which gave four or five jumps so gayly that it could not be better done then the young knight gave him a little run in the which he broke the lance against the ground into five or six pieces whereat Lord Ludovico was not over pleased and said out loud If all the men at arms of France were like

those who were in Louis XII s service had no mind to fight one another and the former capitulated surrendered the strong place of Novara and promised to evacuate the country on condition of a safe conduct for themselves and their booty Ludovic in extreme anxiety for his own safety was on the point of giving himself up to the French but whether by his own free will or by the advice of the Swiss who were but lately in his pay and who were now withdrawing he concealed himself amongst them putting on a disguise with his hair turned up under a coif a collaret round his neck a doublet of crimson satin scarlet hose and a halberd in his fist but whether it were that he was betrayed or that he was recognized he on the tenth of April fifteen hundred fell into the hands of the French and was

lighted together with devotional processions giving thanks to the Prince of princes for the happy victory he had by the divine aid obtained over his enemies Ludovic was taken to Lyons At the entrance into the city a great number of gentlemen from the king s household were present to meet him and the provost of the household conducted him all along the high street to the castle of Pierre Encise where he was lodged and placed in security There he passed a fortnight Louis refused to see him but had him questioned as to several matters by the lords of his grand council and granted that he had committed nought but follies still he spoke right wisely He was conducted from Pierre Encise to the castle of Loches in Touraine where he was at first kept in very strict captivity without books paper or ink but it was afterwards less severe He plays at tennis and at cards says a despatch of the Venetian ambassador Dominic of Treviso and he is fatter than ever La Diplomatic Venitienne by M Armand

Far from setting forth the grievances of the nation as the spokesman of the estates had always done Thomas Bricot canon of Notre Dame de Paris delivered an address enumerating in simple and touching terms the benefits conferred by Louis XII and describing to him the nation s gratitude To him they owed peace and the tranquillity of the realm complete respect for private property release from a quarter of the talliages reform in the administration of justice and the appointment of enlightened and incorruptible judges For these causes the speaker added and for others which it would take too long to recount he was destined to be known as Louis XII father of the people At these last words loud cheers rang out emotion was general and reached the king himself who shed tears at hearing the title which posterity and history were forever to attach to his name Then the deputies having dropped on their knees the speaker resumed his speech saying that they were come to prefer a request for the general good of the realm the king s subjects entreating him to be pleased to give his only daughter in marriage to my lord Francis here present who is every whit French When this declaration was ended the king called Cardinal d Amboise and the chancellor with whom he conferred for some time and then the chancellor turning to the deputies made answer that the king had given due ear and heed to their request and representation that if he had done well he desired to do still better and that as to the request touching the marriage he had never heard talk of it but that as to that matter he would communicate with the princes of the blood so as to have their opinion The day after this session the king received an embassy which could not but crown his joy the estates of the duchy of Burgundy more interested than any other province in the rupture of the Austrian marriage had sent deputies to join their most urgent prayers to the entreaties of the estates of France On Monday May eighteen the king assembled about him his chief councillors to learn if the demand of the estates was profitable and reasonable for him and his kingdom Thereon continues the report the first to deliver an opinion was my lord the Bishop of Paris after him the premier president of the parliament of Paris and of that of Bordeaux Their speeches produced such effect that quite with one voice and one mind those present agreed that the request of the estates was sound just and reasonable and with one consent entreated the king to agree to the said marriage The most enlightened councillors and the princes of the blood found themselves in agreement with the commons There was no ambiguity about the reply On the Tuesday May nineteen the king held a session in state for the purpose of announcing to the estates that their wishes should be fully gratified and that the betrothal of his daughter to the heir to the throne should take place next day but one May twenty one in order that the deputies might report the news of it to their constituents After that the estates had returned thanks the chancellor gave notice that as municipal affairs imperatively demanded the return of the deputies the king gave them leave to go retaining only one burgess from each town to inform him of their wants and their business if such there be in any case wherein the king will give them good and short despatch The session was brought to a close by the festivities of the betrothal and by the oath taken by the deputies who before their departure swore to bring about with all their might even to the risk of body and goods the marriage which had just been decided upon by the common advice of all those who represented France Histoire des Etats Generaux from thirteen fifty five to sixteen

have been caused to the Emperor of Germany and to the King of Spain by this resolution on the part of France and her king it did not show itself either in acts of hostility or even in complaints of a more or less threatening kind Italy remained for some years longer the sole theatre of rivalry and strife between these three great powers and during this strife the utter diversity of the combinations whether in the way of alliance or of rupture bore witness to the extreme changeability of the interests passions and designs of the actors From fifteen oh six to fifteen fifteen between Louis XII s will and his death we find in the history of his career in Italy five coalitions and as many great battles of a profoundly contradictory character In fifteen oh eight Pope Julius II Louis XII Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand the Catholic King of Spain form together against the Venetians the League of Cambrai In fifteen ten Julius II Ferdinand the Venetians and the Swiss make a coalition against Louis XII In fifteen twelve this coalition decomposed for a while re unites under the name of the League of the Holy Union between the pope the Venetians the Swiss and the Kings of Arragon and Naples against Louis XII minus the Emperor Maximilian and plus Henry VIII King of England On the fourteenth of May fifteen oh nine Louis XII in the name of the League of Cambrai gains the battle of Agnadello against the Venetians On the eleventh of April fifteen twelve it is against Pope Julius II Ferdinand the Catholic and the Venetians that he gains the battle of Ravenna On the fourteenth of March fifteen thirteen he is in alliance with the Venetians and it is against the Swiss that he loses the battle of Novara In fifteen ten fifteen eleven and fifteen twelve in the course of all these incessant changes of political allies and adversaries three councils met at Tours at Pisa and at saint John Lateran with views still more discordant and irreconcilable than those of all these laic coalitions We merely point out here the principal traits of the nascent sixteenth century we have no intention of tracing with a certain amount of detail any incidents but those that refer to Louis XII and to France to their procedure and their fortunes Jealousy ambition secret resentment and the prospect of despoiling them caused the formation of the League of Cambrai against the Venetians Their far reaching greatness on the seas their steady progress on land their riches their cool assumption of independence towards the papacy their renown for ability and their profoundly selfish but singularly prosperous policy had excited in Italy and even beyond the Alps that feeling of envy and ill will which is caused amongst men whether kings or people by the spectacle of strange brilliant and unexpected good fortune though it be the fruits of rare merit As the Venetians were as much dreaded as they were little beloved great care was taken to conceal from them the projects that were being formed against them According to their historian Cardinal Bembo they owed to chance the first notice they had It happened one day that a Piedmontese at Milan in presence of the Resident of Venice allowed to escape from his lips the words I should have the pleasure then of seeing the crime punished of those who put to death the most illustrious man of my country He alluded to Carmagnola a celebrated Piedmontese condottiere who had been accused of treason and beheaded at Venice on the threed of May fourteen thirty two The Venetian ambassador at Louis XII s court suspecting what had taken place at Cambrai tried to dissuade the king Sir said he it were folly to attack them of Venice their wisdom renders them invincible I believe they are prudent and wise answered Louis but all the wrong way of the hair inopportunely if it must come to war I will bring upon them so many fools that your wiseacres will not have leisure to teach them reason for my fools hit all round without looking where When the league was decisively formed Louis sent to Venice a herald to officially proclaim war After having replied to the grievances alleged in support of that proclamation We should never have believed said the Doge Loredano that so great a prince would have given ear to the envenomed words of a pope whom he ought to know better and to the insinuations of another priest whom we forbear to mention Cardinal d Amboise In order to please them he declares himself the foe of a republic which has rendered him great services We will try to defend ourselves and to prove to him that he has not kept faith with us God shall judge betwixt us Father herald and you trumpeter ye have heard what we had to say to you report it to your master Away Independently of their natural haughtiness the Venetians were puffed up with the advantages they had obtained in a separate campaign against the Emperor Maximilian and flattered themselves that they would manage to conquer one after the other or to split up or to tire out their enemies and they prepared energetically for war Louis XII on his side got together an army with a strength of twenty three hundred lances about thirteen thousand mounted troops ten to twelve thousand French foot and six or eight thousand Swiss He sent for Chevalier Bayard already famous though still quite a youth Bayard said he you know that I am about to cross the mountains for to bring to reason the Venetians who by great wrong withhold from me the countship of Cremona and other districts I give to you from this present time the company of Captain Chatelard who they tell me is dead whereat I am distressed but I desire that in this enterprise you have under your charge men afoot your lieutenant captain Pierrepont Pierre de Pont d Albi a Savoyard gentle man and Bayard s nephew who is a very good man shall lead your men at arms Sir answered Bayard I will do what pleaseth you but how many men afoot will you be pleased to hand over to me to lead A thousand said the king there is no man that hath more Sir replied Bayard it is a many for my poor wits I do entreat you to be content that I have five hundred and I pledge you my faith sir that I will take pains to choose such as shall do you service meseems that for one man it is a very heavy charge if he would fain do his duty therewith Good said the king go then quickly into Dauphiny and take heed that you be in my duchy of Milan by the end of March Bayard forthwith set out to raise and choose his foot a proof of the growing importance of infantry and of the care taken by Louis XII to have it commanded by men of war of experience and popularity Illustration Battle of Agnadello three hundred thirty four On the fourteenth of May fifteen oh nine the French army and the Venetian army of nearly equal strength encountered near the village of Agnadello in the province of Lodi on the banks of the Adda Louis XII commanded his in person with Louis de la Tremoille and James Trivulzio for his principal lieutenants the Venetians were under the orders of two generals the Count of Petigliano and Barthelemy d Alviano both members of the Roman family of the Orsini but not on good terms with one another The French had to cross the Adda to reach the enemy who kept in his camp Trivulzio seeing that the Venetians did not dispute their passage cried out to the king To day sir the victory is ours The French advance guard engaged with the troops of Alviano When apprised of this fight Louis to whom word was at this same time brought that the enemy was already occupying the point towards which he was moving with the main body of the army said briskly Forward all the same we will halt upon their bellies The action became general and hot The king sword in hand hurried from one corps to another under fire from the Venetian artillery which struck several men near him He was urged to place himself under cover a little so as to give his orders thence but It is no odds said he they who are afraid have only to put themselves behind me A body of Gascons showed signs of wavering Lads shouted La Tremoille the king sees you They dashed forward and the Venetians were broken in spite of the brave resistance of Alviano who was taken and brought all covered with blood and with one eye out into the presence of the king Louis said to him courteously You shall have fair treatment and fair captivity have fair patience So I will answered the condottiere if I had won the battle I had been the most victorious man in the world and though I have lost it still have I the great honor of having had against me a King of France in person Louis who had often heard talk of the warrior s intrepid presence of mind had a fancy for putting it to further proof and all the time chatting with him gave secret orders to have the alarm sounded not far from them What is this pray Sir Barthelemy asked the king your folks are very difficult to please is it that they want to begin again Sir said Alviano if there is fighting still it must be that the French are fighting one another as for my folks I assure you on my life they will not pay you a visit this fortnight The Venetian army in fact withdrew with a precipitation which resembled a rout for to rally it its general the Count of Petigliano appointed for its gathering point the ground beneath the walls of Brescia forty miles from the field of battle Few men at arms says Guicciardini were slain in this affair the great loss fell upon the Venetians infantry which lost according to some eight thousand men others say that the number of dead on both sides did not amount to more than six thousand The territorial results of the victory were greater than the numerical losses of the armies Within a fortnight the towns of Caravaggio Bergamo Brescia Crema Cremona and Pizzighitone surrendered to the French Peschiera alone a strong fortress at the southern extremity of the Lake of Garda resisted and was carried by assault It was a bad thing for those within says the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard for all or nearly all perished there amongst the which was the governor of the Signory and his son who were willing to pay good and heavy ransom but that served them not at all for on one tree were both of them hanged which to me did seem great cruelty a very lusty gentleman called the Lorrainer had their parole and he had big words about it with the grand master lieutenant general of the king but he got no good thereby The Memoires of Robert de la Marck lord of Fleuranges and a warrior of the day confirm as to this sad incident the story of the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard When the French volunteers says he entered by the breach into the castle of Peschiera they cut to pieces all those who were therein and there were left only the captain the proveditore and the podesta the which stowed themselves away in a tower surrendered to the good pleasure of the king and being brought before him offered him for ransom a hundred thousand ducats but the king swore If ever I eat or drink till they be hanged and strangled Nor even for all the prayer they could make could the grand master Chaumont and even his uncle Cardinal d Amboise find any help for it but the king would have them hanged that very hour Some chroniclers attribute this violence on Louis XII s part to a low and coarse reply returned by those in command at Peschiera to the summons to surrender Guicciardini whilst also recording the fact explains it otherwise than by a fit of anger on Louis s part The king he says was led to such cruelty in order that dismayed at such punishment those who were still holding out in the fortress of Cremona might not defend themselves to the last extremity Guicciardini Istoria d Italia liv viii t i p five hundred twenty one So that the Italian historian is less severe on this act of cruelty than the French knight is Louis XII s victory at Agnadello had for him consequences very different from what he had no doubt expected The king says Guicciardini departed from Italy carrying away with him to France great glory by reason of so complete and so rapidly won a victory over the Venetians nevertheless as in the case of things obtained after hope long deferred men scarcely ever feel such joy and happiness as they had at first imagined they would the king took not back with him either greater peace of mind or greater security in respect of his affairs The beaten Venetians accepted their defeat with such a mixture of humility and dignity as soon changed their position in Italy They began by providing all that was necessary for the defence of Venice herself foreigners but only idle foreigners were expelled those who had any business which secured them means of existence received orders to continue their labors Mills were built cisterns were dug corn was gathered in the condition of the canals was examined bars were removed the citizens were armed the law which did not allow vessels laden with provisions to touch at Venice was repealed and rewards were decreed to officers who had done their duty Having taken all this care for their own homes and their fatherland on the sea the Venetian senate passed a decree by which the republic releasing from their oath of fidelity the subjects it could not defend authorized its continental provinces to treat with the enemy with a view to their own interests and ordered its commandants to evacuate such places as they still held Nearly all such submitted without a struggle to the victor of Agnadello and his allies of Cambrai but at Treviso when Emperor Maximilian s commissioner presented himself in order to take possession of it a shoemaker named Caligaro went running through the streets shouting Hurrah for saint Mark The people rose pillaged the houses of those who had summoned the foreigner and declared that it would not separate its lot from that of the republic So Treviso remained Venetian

4839_15307_000002_000001	train-clean-360	The doge Leonardo Loredano the same who had but lately opposed the surprisal of Padua rose up and delivered in the senate a long speech of which only the essential and characteristic points can be quoted here 
4839_15307_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Everybody knows excellent gentlemen of the senate said he that on the preservation of Padua depends all hope not only of recovering our empire but of maintaining our own liberty

none	none	And though the forces already there were sufficient is not our honor also concerned therein The fortune of our city so willed it that in the space of a few days our empire slipped from our hands the opportunity has come back to us of recovering what we have lost by spontaneously facing the changes and chances of fate we shall prove that our disasters have not been our fault or our shame but one of those fatal storms which no wisdom and no firmness of man can resist If it were permitted us all in one mass to set out for Padua if we might without neglecting the defence of our own homes and our urgent public affairs leave our city for some days deserted I would not await your deliberation I would be the first on the road to Padua for how could I better expend the last days of my old age than in going to be present at and take part in such a victory But Venice may not be deserted by her public bodies which protect and defend Padua by their forethought and their orders just as others do by their arms and a useless mob of graybeards would be a burden much more than a reenforcement there Nor do I ask that Venice be drained of all her youth but I advise I exhort that we choose two hundred young gentlemen from the chiefest of our families and that they all with such friends and following as their means will permit them to get together go forth to Padua to do all that shall be necessary for her defence My two sons with many a comrade will be the first to carry out what I their father and your chief am the first to propose Thus Padua will be placed in security and when the mercenary soldiers who are there see how prompt are our youth to guard the gates and everywhere face the battle they will be moved thereby to zeal and alacrity incalculable and not only will Padua thus be defended and saved but all nations will see that we we too as our fathers were are men enough to defend at the peril of our lives the freedom and th safety of the noblest country in the world This generous advice was accepted by the fathers and carried out by the sons with that earnest prompt and effective ardor which accompanies the resolution of great souls When the Paduans before their city was as yet invested saw the arrival within their walls of these chosen youths of the Venetian patriciate with their numerous troop of friends and followers they considered Padua as good as saved and when the imperial army posted before the place commenced their attacks upon it they soon perceived that they had formidable defenders to deal with Five hundred years it was since in prince s camp had ever been seen such wealth as there was there and never was a day but there filed off some three or four hundred lanzknechts who took away to Germany oxen and kine beds corn silk for sewing and other articles in such sort that to the said country of Padua was damage done to the amount of two millions of crowns in movables and in houses and palaces burnt and destroyed For three days the imperial artillery fired upon the town and made in its walls three breaches knocked into one and still the defenders kept up their resistance with the same vigor One morning says the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard the Emperor Maximilian accompanied by his princes and lords from Germany went thither to look and he marvelled and thought it great shame to him with the number of men he had that he had not sooner delivered the assault 
4839_15307_000004_000004	train-clean-360	On returning to his quarters he sent for a French secretary of his whom he bade write to the lord of La Palisse a letter whereof this was the substance Dear cousin I have this morning been to look at the breach which I find more than practicable for whoever would do his duty

When once he was himself in possession of this puissant title he showed himself as he really was ambitious audacious imperious energetic stubborn and combining the egotism of the absolute sovereign with the patriotism of an Italian pope When the League of Cambrai had attained success through the victory of Louis XII over the Venetians Cardinal d Amboise in course of conversation with the two envoys from Florence at the king s court let them have an inkling that he was not without suspicion of some new design and when Louis XII announced his approaching departure for France the two Florentines wrote to their government that this departure might have very evil results for the power of Emperor Maximilian in Italy the position of Ferdinand the Catholic the despair of the Venetians and the character and dissatisfaction of the pope seemed to foreshadow some fresh understanding against the Most Christian king Louis XII and his minister were very confident Take Spain the king of the Romans or whom you please said Cardinal d Amboise to the two Florentines there is none who has observed and kept the alliance more faithfully than the king has he has done everything at the moment he promised he has borne upon his shoulders the whole weight of this affair and I tell you he added with a fixed look at those whom he was addressing that his army is a large one which he will keep up and augment every day Louis for his part treated the Florentines with great good will as friends on whom he counted and who were concerned in his success You have become the first power in Italy he said to then one day before a crowd of people how are you addressed just now Are you Most Serene or Most Illustrious And when he was notified that distinguished Venetians were going to meet Emperor Maximilian on his arrival in Italy No matter said Louis let them go whither they will The Florentines did not the less nourish their mistrustful presentiments and one of Louis XII s most intelligent advisers his finance minister Florimond Robertet was not slow to share them The pope said he to them one day July one fifteen oh nine is behaving very ill towards us he seeks on every occasion to sow enmity between the princes especially between the emperor and the Most Christian king and some weeks later whilst speaking of the money aids which the new King of England was sending it was said to

address to the pope ceded to him the places they but lately possessed in the Romagna and conjured him to relieve them from the excommunication he had pronounced against them Julius II after some little waiting accorded the favor demanded of him Louis XII committed the mistake of embroiling himself with the Swiss by refusing to add twenty thousand livres to the pay of sixty thousand he was giving them already and by styling them wretched mountain shepherds who presumed to impose upon him a tax he was not disposed to submit to The pope conferred the investiture of the kingdom of Naples upon Ferdinand the Catholic who at first promised only his neutrality but could not fail to be drawn in still farther when war was rekindled in Italy In all these negotiations with the Venetians the Swiss the Kings of Spain and England and the Emperor Maximilian Julius II took a bold initiative Maximilian alone remained for some time at peace with the King of France In October fifteen eleven a league was formally concluded between the pope the Venetians the Swiss and King Ferdinand against Louis XII A place was reserved in it for the King of England Henry VIII who on ascending the throne had sent word to the King of France that he desired to abide in the same friendship that the king his father had kept up but who at the bottom of his heart burned to resume on the Continent an active and a prominent part The coalition thus formed was called the League of Holy Union I said Louis XII am the Saracen against whom this league is directed He had just lost a few months previously the intimate and faithful adviser and friend of his whole life Cardinal George d Amboise seized at Milan with a fit of the gout during which Louis tended him with the assiduity and care of an affectionate brother died at Lyons on the twenty fifth of May fifteen ten at fifty years of age He was one not of the greatest but of the most honest ministers who ever enjoyed a powerful monarch s constant favor and employed it we will not say with complete disinterestedness but with a predominant anxiety for the public weal In the matter of external policy the influence of Cardinal d Amboise was neither skilfully nor salutarily exercised he like his master indulged in those views of distant incoherent and improvident conquests which caused the reign of Louis XII to be wasted in ceaseless wars with which the cardinal s desire of becoming pope was not altogether unconnected and which after having resulted in nothing but reverses were a heavy heritage for the succeeding reign But at home in his relations with his king and in his civil and religious administration Cardinal d Amboise was an earnest and effective friend of justice of sound social order and of regard for morality in the practice of power It is said that in his latter days he virtuously weary of the dignities of this world said to the infirmary brother who was attending him Ah Brother John why did I not always remain Brother John A pious regret the sincerity and modesty whereof are rare amongst men of high estate Illustration Cardinal d Amboise three hundred forty seven At last then I am the only pope cried Julius II when he heard that Cardinal d Amboise was dead But his joy was misplaced the cardinal s death was a great loss to him between the king and the pope the cardinal had been an intelligent mediator who understood the two positions and the two characters and who though most faithful and devoted to the king had nevertheless a place in his heart for the papacy also and labored earnestly on every occasion to bring about between the two rivals a policy of moderation and peace One thing you may be certain of said Louis s finance minister Robertet to the ambassador from Florence that the king s character is not an easy one to deal with he is not readily brought round to what is not his own opinion which is not always a correct one he is irritated against the pope and the cardinal to whom that causes great displeasure does not always succeed in spite of all influence in getting him to do as he would like If our Lord God were to remove the cardinal either by death or in any other manner from public life there would arise in this court and in the fashion of conducting affairs such confusion that nothing equal to it would ever have been seen in our day Negociations Diplomatiques de la France avec la Toscane t ii pp four hundred twenty eight and four hundred sixty And the confusion did in fact arise and war was rekindled or to speak more correctly resumed its course after the cardinal s death Julius II plunged into it in person moving to every point where it was going on living in the midst of camps himself in military costume besieging towns having his guns pointed and assaults delivered under his own eyes Men expressed astonishment not unmixed with admiration at the indomitable energy of this soldier pope at seventy years of age It was said that he had cast into the Tiber the keys of saint Peter to gird on the sword of saint Paul His answer to everything was The barbarians must be driven from Italy Louis XII became more and more irritated and undecided To reassure his people says Bossuet to which we may add and to reassure himself he assembled at Tours in September fifteen ten the prelates of his kingdom to consult them as to what he could do at so disagreeable a crisis without wounding his conscience Thereupon it was said that the pope being unjustly the aggressor and having even violated an agreement made with the king ought to be treated as an enemy and that the king might not only defend himself but might even attack him without fear of excommunication Not considering this quite strong enough yet Louis resolved to assemble a council against the pope The general council was the desire of the whole church since the election of Martin V at the council of Constance November eleven fourteen seventeen for though that council had done great good by putting an end to the schism which had lasted for forty years it had not accomplished what it had projected which was a reformation of the Church in its head and in its members but for the doing of so holy a work it had ordained on separating that there should be held a fresh council This one was opened at Pisa November one fifteen eleven with but little solemnity by the proxies of the cardinals who had caused its convocation The pope had deposed them and had placed under interdict the town of Pisa where the council was to be held and even Florence because the Florentines had granted Pisa for the assemblage Thereupon the religious brotherhoods were unwilling to put in an appearance at the opening of the council and the priests of the Church refused the necessary paraphernalia The people rose and the cardinals having arrived did not consider their position safe insomuch that after the first session they removed the council to Milan where they met with no better reception Gaston de Foix nephew of Louis XII who had just appointed him governor of Milaness could certainly force the clergy to proceed and the people to be quiet but he could not force them to have for the council the respect due to so great a name there were not seen at it according to usage the legates of the Holy See there were scarcely fifteen or sixteen French prelates there the Emperor Maximilian had either not influence enough or no inclination to send to it a single one from Germany and in a word there was not to be seen in this assembly anything that savored of the majesty of a general council and it was understood to be held for political purposes Bossuet Abrege de l Histoire de France pour l Education du dauphin OEuvres completes eighteen twenty eight t xvii pp five hundred forty one five hundred forty five Bossuet had good grounds for speaking so Louis XII himself said in fifteen eleven to the ambassador of Spain that this pretended council was only a scarecrow which he had no idea of employing save for the purpose of bringing the pope to reason Amidst these vain attempts at ecclesiastical influence the war was continued with passionateness on the part of Julius II with hesitation on the part of Louis XII and with some disquietude on the part of the French commanders although with their wonted bravery and loyalty Chaumont d Amboise the cardinal s nephew held the command in chief in the king s army He fell ill the pope had excommunicated him and Chaumont sent to beg him with instance to give him absolution which did not arrive until he was on his death bed This is the worst says Bossuet of wars against the Church they cause scruples not only in weak minds but even at certain moments in the very strongest Alphonso d Este Duke of Ferrara was almost the only great Italian lord who remained faithful to France Julius II who was besieging Ferrara tried to win over the duke who rejected all his offers and instead won over the negotiator who offered his services to poison the pope Bayard when informed of this proposal indignantly declared that he would go and have the traitor hanged and warning sent to the pope Why said the duke he would have been very glad to do as much for you and me That is no odds to me said the knight he is God s lieutenant on earth and as for having him put to death in such sort I will never consent to it The duke shrugged his shoulders and spitting on the ground said Od s body Sir Bayard I would like to get rid of all my enemies in that way but since you do not think it well the matter shall stand over whereof unless God apply a remedy both you and I will repent us Assuredly Bayard did not repent of his honest indignation but finding about the same time January fifteen eleven an opportunity of surprising and carrying off the pope he did not care to miss it he placed himself in ambush before day break with a hundred picked men at arms close to a village from which the pope was to issue The pope who was pretty early mounted his litter so soon as he saw the dawn and the clerics and officers of all kinds went before without a thought of anything When the good knight heard them he sallied forth from his ambush and went charging down upon the rustics who sore dismayed turned back again pricking along with loosened rein and shouting Alarm alarm But all that would have been of no use but for an accident very lucky for the holy father and very unfortunate for the good knight When the pope had mounted his litter he was not a stone s throw gone when there fell from heaven the most sharp and violent shower that had been seen for a hundred years Holy father said the Cardinal of Pavia to the pope it is not possible to go along this country so long as this lasts meseems you must turn back again to which the pope agreed but just as he was arriving at saint Felix and was barely entering within the castle he heard the shouts of the fugitives whom the good knight was pursuing as hard as he could spur whereupon he had such a fright that suddenly and without help he leaped out of his litter and himself did aid in hauling up the bridge which was doing like a man of wits for had he waited until one could say a Pater noster he had been snapped up Who was right down grieved that was the good knight never man turned back so melancholic as he was to have missed so fair a take and the pope from the good fright he had gotten shook like a palsy the live long day Histoire du ben Chevalier Ballard t i pp three hundred forty six three hundred forty nine Illustration Chaumont d Amboise three hundred fifty From fifteen ten to fifteen twelve the war in Italy was thus proceeding but with no great results when Gaston de Foix Duke of Nemours came to take the command of the French army He was scarcely twenty three and had hitherto only served under Trivulzio and La Palisse but he had already a character for bravery and intelligence in war Louis XII loved this son of his sister Mary of Orleans and gladly elevated him to the highest rank Gaston from the very first justified this favor Instead of seeking for glory in the field only he began by shutting himself up in Milan which the Swiss were besieging They made him an offer to take the road back to Switzerland if he would give them a month s pay the sum was discussed Gaston considered that they asked too much for their withdrawal the Swiss broke off the negotiation but to the great astonishment of everybody says Guicciardini they raised the siege and returned to their own country The pope was besieging Bologna Gaston arrived there suddenly with a body of troops whom he had marched out at night through a tempest of wind and snow and he was safe inside the place whilst the besiegers were still ignorant of his movement The siege of Bologna was raised Gaston left it immediately to march on Brescia which the Venetians had taken possession of for the Holy League He retook the town by a vigorous assault gave it up to pillage punished with death Count Louis Avogaro and his two sons who had excited the inhabitants against France and gave a beating to the Venetian army before its walls All these successes had been gained in a fortnight According to universal opinion says Guicciardini Italy for several centuries had seen nothing like these military operations We are not proof against the pleasure of giving a place in this history to a deed of virtue and chivalrous kindness on Bayard s part the story of which has been told and retold many times in various works It is honorable to human kind and especially to the middle ages that such men and such deeds are met with here and there amidst the violence of war and the general barbarity of manners Bayard had been grievously wounded at the assault of Brescia so grievously that he said to his neighbor the lord of Molart Comrade march your men forward the town is ours as for me I cannot pull on farther for I am a dead man When the town was taken two of his archers bare him to a house the most conspicuous they saw thereabouts It was the abode of a very rich gentleman but he had fled away to a monastery and his wife had remained at the abode under the care of Our Lord together with two fair daughters she had the which were hidden in a granary beneath some hay When there came a knocking at her door she saw the good knight who was being brought in thus wounded the which had the door shut incontinently and set at the entrance the two archers to the which he said Take heed for your lives that none enter herein unless it be any of my own folk I am certified that when it is known to be my quarters none will try to force a way in and if by your aiding me I be the cause that ye lose a chance of gaining somewhat never ye mind ye shall lose nought thereby The archers did as they were bid and he was borne into a mighty fine chamber into the which the lady of the house herself conducted him and throwing herself upon her knees before him she spoke after this fashion being interpreted Noble sir I present unto you this house and all that is therein for well I know it is yours by right of war but may it be your pleasure to spare me my honor and life and those of two young daughters that I and my husband have who are ready for marriage The good knight who never thought wickedness replied to her Madam I know not whether I can escape from the wound that I have but so long as I live you and your daughters shall be done no displeasure any more than to my own person Only keep them in your chambers let them not be seen and I assure you that there is no man in the house who would take upon himself to enter any place against your will When the good lady heard him so virtuously speak she was all assured Afterwards he prayed her to give instructions to some good surgeon who might quickly come to tend him which she did and herself went in quest of him with one of the archers He having arrived did probe the good knight s wound which was great and deep howbeit he certified him that there was no danger of death At the second dressing came to see him the Duke of Nemours surgeon called Master Claude the which did thenceforward have the healing of him and right well he did his devoir in such sort that in less than a month he was ready to mount a horseback The good knight when he was dressed asked his hostess where her husband was and the good lady all in tears said to him By my faith my lord I know not whether he be dead or alive but I have a shrewd idea that if he be living he will be in a large monastery where be hath large acquaintance Lady said the good knight have him fetched and I will send in quest of him in such sort that he shall have no harm She set herself to inquire where he was and found him then were sent in quest of him the good knight s steward and two archers who brought him away in safety and on his arrival he had joyous cheer reception from his guest the good knight the which did tell him not to be melancholic and that there was quartered upon him none but friends For about a month or five weeks was the good knight ill of his wound without leaving his couch One day he was minded to get up and he walked across his chamber not being sure whether he could keep his legs somewhat weak he found himself but the great heart he had gave him not leisure to think long thereon He sent to fetch the surgeon who had the healing of him and said to him My friend tell me I pray you if there be any danger in setting me on the march me seems that I am well or all but so and I give you my faith that in my judgment the biding will henceforth harm me more than mend me for I do marvellously fret The good knight s servitors had already told the surgeon the great desire he had to be at the battle for every day he had news from the camp of the French how that they were getting nigh the Spaniards and there were hopes from day to day of the battle which would to his great sorrow have been delivered without him Having knowledge whereof and also knowing his complexion the surgeon said in his own language My lord your wound is not yet closed up howbeit inside it is quite healed Your barber shall see to dressing you this once more and provided that every day morning and evening he put on a little piece of lint and a plaister for which I will deliver to him the ointment it will not increase your hurt and there is no danger for the worst of the wound is a top and will not touch the saddle of your horse Whoso had given him ten thousand crowns the good knight had not been so glad He determined to set out in two days commanding his people to put in order all his gear The lady with whom he lodged who held herself all the while his prisoner together with her husband and her children had many imaginings Thinking to herself that if her guest were minded to treat with rigor herself and her husband he might get out of them ten or twelve thousand crowns for they had two thousand a year she made up her mind to make him some worthy present and she had found him so good a man and of so gentle a heart that to her thinking he would be graciously content On the morning of the day whereon the good knight was to dislodge after dinner his hostess with one of her servitors carrying a little box made of steel entered his chamber where she found that he was resting in a chair after having walked about a great deal so as continually little by little to try his leg She threw herself upon both knees but incontinently he raised her up and would never suffer her to speak a word until she was first seated beside him She began her speech in this manner My lord the grace which God did me at the taking of this town in directing you to this our house was not less than the saving to me of my husband s life and my own and my two daughters together with their honor which they ought to hold dearer still And more from the time that you arrived here there hath not been done to me or to the least of my people a single insult but all courtesy and there hath not been taken by your folks of the goods they found here the value of a farthing without paying for it My lord I am well aware that my husband and I and my children and all of this household are your prisoners for to do with and dispose of at your good pleasure as well as the goods that are herein but knowing the nobleness of your heart I am come for to entreat you right humbly that it may please you to have pity upon us extending your wonted generosity Here is a little present we make you you will be pleased to take it in good part Then she took the box which the servitor was holding and opened it before the good knight who saw it full of beautiful ducats The gentle lord who never in his life made any case of money burst out laughing and said Madam how many ducats are there in this box The poor soul was afraid that he was angry at seeing so few and said to him My lord there are but two thousand five hundred ducats but if you are not content we will find a larger sum Then said he By my faith madam though you should give me a hundred thousand crowns you would not do so well towards me as you have done by the good cheer I have had here and the kind tendance you have given me in whatsoever place I may happen to be you will have so long as God shall grant me life a gentleman at your bidding As for your ducats I will none of them and yet I thank you take them back all my life I have always loved people much better than crowns And think not in any wise that I do not go away as well pleased with you as if this town were at your disposal and you had given it to me The good lady was much astounded at finding herself put off My lord said she I should feel myself forever the most wretched creature in the world if you did not take away with you so small a present as I make you which is nothing in comparison with the courtesy you have shown me heretofore and still show me now by your great kindness When the knight saw her so firm he said to her Well then madam I will take it for love of you but go and fetch me your two daughters for I would fain bid them farewell The poor soul who thought herself in paradise now that her present was at last accepted went to fetch her daughters the which were very fair good and well educated and had afforded the good knight much pastime during his illness for right well could they sing and play on the lute and spinet and right well work with the needle They were brought before the good knight who whilst they were attiring themselves had caused the ducats to be placed in three lots two of a thousand each and the other of five hundred They having arrived would have fallen on their knees but were incontinently raised up and the elder of the two began to say My lord these two poor girls to whom you have done so much honor as to guard them are come to take leave of you humbly thanking your lordship for the favor they have received for which having nothing else in their power they will be for ever bound to pray God for you The good knight half weeping to see so much sweetness and humility in those two fair girls made answer Dear demoisels you have done what I ought to do that is thank you for the good company you have made me and for which I feel myself much beholden and bounden You know that fighting men are not likely to be laden with pretty things for to present to ladies and for my part I am sore displeased that I am in no wise well provided for making you such present as I am bound to make Here is your lady mother who has given me two thousand five hundred ducats which you see on this table of them I give to each of you a thousand towards your marriage and for my recompense you shall an if it please you pray God for me He put the ducats into their aprons whether they would or not and then turning to his hostess he said to her Madam I will take these five hundred ducats for mine own profit to distribute them amongst the poor sisterhoods which have been plundered and to you I commit the charge of them for you better than any other will understand where there is need thereof and thereupon I take my leave of you Then he touched them all upon the hand after the Italian manner and they fell upon their knees weeping so bitterly that it seemed as if they were to be led out to their deaths Afterwards they withdrew to their chambers and it was time for dinner After dinner there was little sitting ere the good knight called for the horses for much he longed to be in the company so yearned for by him having fine fear lest the battle should be delivered before he was there As he was coming out of his chamber to mount a horseback the two fair daughters of the house came down and made him each of them a present which they had worked during his illness one was two pretty and delicate bracelets made of beautiful tresses of gold and silver thread so neatly that it was a marvel the other was a purse of crimson satin worked right cunningly Greatly did he thank them saying that the present came from hand so fair that he valued it at ten thousand crowns and in order to do them the more honor he had the bracelets put upon his arms and he put the purse in his sleeve assuring them that so long as they lasted he would wear them for love of the givers Illustration Bayard s Farewell three hundred fifty eight Bayard had good reason for being in such a hurry to rejoin his comrades in arms and not miss the battle he foresaw All were as full of it as he was After the capture of Brescia Gaston de Foix passed seven or eight days more there whilst Bayard was confined by his wound to his bed The prince went once at least every day to see the good knight the which he comforted as best he might and often said to him Hey Sir Bayard my friend think about getting cured for well I know that we shall have to give the Spaniards battle between this and a month and if so it should be I had rather have lost all I am worth than not have you there so great confidence have I in you Believe me my lord answered Bayard that if so it is that there is to be a battle I would as well for the service of the king my master as for love of you and for mine own honor which is before everything rather have myself carried thither in a litter than not be there at all The Duke of Nemours made him a load of presents according to his power and one day sent him five hundred crowns the which the good knight gave to the two archers who had staid with him when he was wounded Louis XII was as impatient to have the battle delivered as Bayard was to be in it He wrote time after time to his nephew Gaston that the moment was critical that Emperor Maximilian harbored a design of recalling the five thousand lanzknechts he had sent as auxiliaries to the French army and that they must be made use of whilst they were still to be had that on the other hand Henry VIII King of England was preparing for an invasion of France and so was Ferdinand King of Spain in the south a victory in the field was indispensable to baffle all these hostile plans It was Louis XII s mania to direct from Paris or from Lyons the war which he was making at a distance and to regulate its movements as well as its expenses The Florentine ambassador Pandolfini was struck with the perilousness of this mania and Cardinal d Amboise was no longer by to oppose it Gaston de Foix asked for nothing better than to act with vigor He set out to march on Ravenna in hopes that by laying siege to this important place he would force a battle upon the Spanish army which sought to avoid it There was a current rumor in Italy that this army much reduced in numbers and cooled in ardor would not hold its own against the French if it encountered them Some weeks previously after the siege of Bologna had been raised by the Spaniards there were distributed about at Rome little bits of paper having on them If anybody knows where the Spanish army happens to be let him inform the sacristan of peace he shall receive as reward a lump of cheese Gaston de Foix arrived on the eighth of April fifteen twelve before Ravenna He there learned that on the ninth of March the ambassador of France had been sent away from London by Henry VIII Another hint came to him from his own camp A German captain named Jacob went and told Chevalier Bayard with whom he had contracted a friendship that the emperor had sent orders to the captain of the lanzknechts that they were to withdraw incontinently on seeing his letter and that they were not to fight the Spaniards As for me said he I have taken oath to the King of France and I have his pay if I were to die a hundred thousand deaths I would not do this wickedness of not fighting but there must be haste The good knight who well knew the gentle heart of Captain Jacob commended him marvellously and said to him by the mouth of his interpreter My dear comrade and friend never did your heart imagine wickedness Here is my lord of Nemours who has ordered to his quarters all the captains to hold a council go we thither you and I and we will show him privately what you have told me It is well thought on said Captain Jacob go we thither So they went thither There were dissensions at the council some said that they had three or four rivers to cross that everybody was against them the pope the King of Spain the Venetians and the Swiss that the emperor was anything but certain and that the best thing would be to temporize others said that there was nothing for it but to fight or die of hunger like good for noughts and cowards The good Duke of Nemours who had already spoken with the good knight and with Captain Jacob desired to have the opinion of the former the which said My lord the longer we sojourn the more miserable too will become our plight for our men have no victual and our horses must needs live on what the willows shoot forth at the present time Besides you know that the king our master is writing to you every day to give battle and that in your hands rests not only the safety of his duchy of Milan but also all his dominion of France seeing the enemies he has to day Wherefore as for me I am of opinion that we ought to give battle and proceed to it discreetly for we have to do with cunning folks and good fighters That there is peril in it is true but one thing gives me comfort the Spaniards for a year past have in this Romagna been always living like fish in the water and are fat and full fed our men have had and still have great lack of victual whereby they will have longer breath and we have no need of ought else for whoso fights the longest to him will remain the field The leaders of note in the army sided with the good knight and notice thereof was at once given to all the captains of horse and foot The battle took place on the next day but one April eleven The gentle Duke of Nemours set out pretty early from his quarters armed at all points As he went forth he looked at the sun already risen which was mighty red Look my lords how red the sun is said he to the company about him There was there a gentleman whom he loved exceedingly a right gentle comrade whose name was Haubourdin the which replied Know you pray what that means my lord To day will die some prince or great captain it must needs be you or the Spanish viceroy The Duke of Nemours burst out a laughing at this speech and went on as far as the bridge to finish the passing in review of his army which was showing marvellous diligence As he was conversing with Bayard who had come in search of him they noticed not far from them a troop of twenty or thirty Spanish gentlemen all mounted amongst whom was Captain Pedro de Paz leader of all their jennettiers light cavalry mounted on Spanish horses called jennets The good knight advanced twenty or thirty paces and saluted them saying Gentlemen you are diverting your selves as we are whilst waiting for the regular game to begin I pray you let there be no firing of arquebuses on your side and there shall be no firing at you on ours The courtesy was reciprocated Sir Bayard asked Don Pedro de Paz who is yon lord in such goodly array and to whom your folks show so much honor It is our chief the Duke of Nemours answered Bayard nephew of our prince and brother of your queen Germaine de Foix Gaston de Foix s sister had married as his second wife Ferdinand the Catholic Hardly had he finished speaking when Captain Pedro de Paz and all those who were with him dismounted and addressed the noble prince in these words Sir save the honor and service due to the king our master we declare to you that we are and wish forever to remain your servants The Duke of Nemours thanked them gallantly for their gallant homage and after a short chivalrous exchange of conversation they went respectively to their own posts The artillery began by causing great havoc on both sides Od s body said a Spanish captain shut up in a fort which the French were attacking and which he had been charged to defend we are being killed here by bolts that fall from heaven go we and fight with men and he sallied from the fort with all his people to go and take part in the general battle Since God created heaven and earth says the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard was never seen a more cruel and rough assault than that which French and Spaniards made upon one another and for more than a long half hour lasted this fight They rested before one another s eyes to recover their breath then they let down their vizors and so began all over again shouting France and Spain the most imperiously in the world At last the Spaniards were utterly broken and constrained to abandon their camp whereon and between two ditches died three or four hundred men at arms Every one would fain have set out in pursuit but the good knight said to the Duke of Nemours who was all covered with blood and brains from one of his men at arms that had been carried off by a cannon ball My lord are you wounded No said the duke but I have wounded a many others Now God be praised said Bayard you have gained the battle and abide this day the most honored prince in the world but push not farther forward reassemble your men at arms in this spot let none set on to pillage yet for it is not time Captain Louis d Ars and I are off after these fugitives that they may not retire behind their foot but stir not for any man living from here unless Captain Louis d Ars or I come hither to fetch you The Duke of Nemours promised but whilst he was biding on his ground awaiting Bayard s return he said to the Baron du Chimay an honest gentleman who had knowledge says Fleuranges of things to come and who before the battle had announced to Gaston that he would gain it but he would be in danger of being left there if God did not do him grace Well Sir Dotard am I left there as you said Here I am still Sir it is not all over yet answered Chimay whereupon there arrived an archer who came and said to the duke My lord yonder be two thousand Spaniards who are going off all orderly along the causeway Certes said Gaston I cannot suffer that whoso loves me follow me And resuming his arms he pushed forward Wait for your men said Sire de Lautrec to him but Gaston took no heed and followed by only twenty or thirty men at arms he threw himself upon those retreating troops He was immediately surrounded thrown from his horse and defending himself all the while like Roland at Roncesvalles say the chroniclers he fell pierced with wounds Do not kill him shouted Lautrec it is the brother of your queen Lautrec himself was so severely handled and wounded that he was thought to be dead Gaston really was though the news spread but slowly Bayard returning with his comrades from pursuing the fugitives met on his road the Spanish force that Gaston had so rashly attacked and that continued to retire in good order Bayard was all but charging them when a Spanish captain came out of the ranks and said to him in his own language What would you do sir You are not powerful enough to beat us you have won the battle let the honor thereof suffice you and let us go with our lives for by God s will are we escaped Bayard felt that the Spaniard spoke truly he had but a handful of men with him and his own horse could not carry him any longer the Spaniards opened their ranks and he passed through the middle of them and let them go Las says his Loyal Serviteur he knew not that the good Duke of Nemours was dead or that those yonder were they who had slain him he had died ten thousand deaths but he would have avenged him if he had known it When the fatal news was known the consternation and grief were profound At the age of twenty three Gaston de Foix had in less than six months won the confidence and affection of the army of the king and of France It was one of those sudden and undisputed reputations which seem to mark out men for the highest destinies I would fain said Louis XIL when he heard of his death have no longer an inch of land in Italy and be able at that price to bring back to life my nephew Gaston and all the gallants who perished with him God keep us from often gaining such victories In the battle of Ravenna says Guicciardini fell at least ten thousand men a third of them French and two thirds their enemies but in respect of chosen men and men of renown the loss of the victors was by much the greater and the loss of Gaston de Foix alone surpassed all the others put together with him went all the vigor and furious onset of the French army La Palisse a warrior valiant and honored assumed the command of this victorious army but under pressure of repeated attacks from the Spaniards the Venetians and the Swiss he gave up first the Romagna then Milanes withdrew from place to place and ended by falling back on Piedmont Julius II won back all he had won and lost Maximilian Sforza son of Ludovic the Moor after twelve years of exile in Germany returned to Milan to resume possession of his father s duchy By the end of June fifteen twelve less than three months after the victory of Ravenna the domination of the French had disappeared from Italy Illustration Gaston de Foix three hundred sixty four Louis XII had indeed something else to do besides crossing the Alps to go to the protection of such precarious conquests Into France itself war was about to make its way it was his own kingdom and his own country that he had to defend In vain after the death of Isabella of Castile had he married his niece Germaine de Foix to Ferdinand the Catholic whilst giving up to him all pretensions to the kingdom of Naples In fifteen twelve Ferdinand invaded Navarre took possession of the Spanish portion of that little kingdom and thence threatened Gascony Henry VIII King of England sent him a fleet which did not withdraw until after it had appeared before Bayonne and thrown the south west of France into a state of alarm In the north Henry VIII continued his preparations for an expedition into France obtained from his Parliament subsidies for that purpose and concerted plans with Emperor Maximilian who renounced his doubtful neutrality and engaged himself at last in the Holy League Louis XII had in Germany an enemy as zealous almost as Julius II was in Italy Maximilian s daughter Princess Marguerite of Austria had never forgiven France or its king whether he were called Charles VIII or Louis XII the treatment she had received from that court when after having been kept there and brought up for eight years to become Queen of France she had been sent away and handed back to her father to make way for Anne of Brittany She was ruler of the Low Countries active able full of passion and in continual correspondence with her father the emperor over whom she exercised a great deal of influence This correspondence was published in eighteen thirty nine by the Societe de l Histoire de France two vols eightvo from the originals which exist in the archives of Lille The Swiss on their side continuing to smart under the contemptuous language which Louis had imprudently applied to them became more and more pronounced against him rudely dismissed Louis de la Tremoille who attempted to negotiate with them re established Maximilian Sforza in the duchy of Milan and haughtily styled themselves vanquishers of kings and defenders of the holy Roman Church And the Roman Church made a good defender of herself Julius II had convoked at Rome at saint John Lateran a council which met on the threed of May fifteen twelve and in presence of which the council of Pisa and Milan after an attempt at removing to Lyons vanished away like a phantom Everywhere things were turning out according to the wishes and for the profit of the pope and France and her king were reduced to defending themselves on their own soil against a coalition of all their great neighbors Man proposes and God disposes Not a step can be made in history without meeting with some corroboration of that modest pious grand truth On the twenty first of February fifteen thirteen ten months since Gaston de Foix the victor of Ravenna had perished in the hour of his victory Pope Julius II died at Rome at the very moment when he seemed invited to enjoy all the triumph of his policy He died without bluster and without disquietude disavowing nought of his past life and relinquishing none of his designs as to the future He had been impassioned and skilful in the employment of moral force whereby alone he could become master of material forces a rare order of genius and one which never lacks grandeur even when the man who possesses it abuses it His constant thought was how he might free Italy from the barbarians and he liked to hear himself called by the name of liberator which was commonly given him One day the outspoken Cardinal Grimani said to him that nevertheless the kingdom of Naples one of the greatest and richest portions of Italy was still under the foreign yoke whereupon Julius II brandishing the staff on which he was leaning said wrathfully Assuredly if Heaven had not otherwise ordained the Neapolitans too would have shaken off the yoke which lies heavy on them Guicciardini has summed up with equal justice and sound judgment the principal traits of his character He was a prince says the historian of incalculable courage and firmness full of boundless imaginings which would have brought him headlong to ruin if the respect borne to the Church the dissensions of princes and the conditions of the times far more than his own moderation and prudence had not supported him he would have been worthy of higher glory had he been a laic prince or had it been in order to elevate the Church in spiritual rank and by processes of peace that he put in practice the diligence and zeal he displayed for the purpose of augmenting his temporal greatness by the arts of war Nevertheless he has left above all his predecessors a memory full of fame and honor especially amongst those men who can no longer call things by their right names or appreciate them at their true value and who think that it is the duty of the sovereign pontiffs to extend by means of arms and the blood of Christians the power of the Holy See rather than to wear themselves out in setting good examples of a Christian s life and in reforming manners and customs pernicious to the salvation of souls that aim of aims for which they assert that Christ has appointed them His vicars on earth The death of Julius II seemed to Louis XII a favorable opportunity for once more setting foot in Italy and recovering at least that which he regarded as his hereditary right the duchy of Milan He commissioned Louis de la Tremoille to go and renew the conquest and whilst thus reopening the Italian war he commenced negotiations with certain of the coalitionists of the Holy League in the hope of causing division amongst them or even of attracting some one of them to himself He knew that the Venetians were dissatisfied and disquieted about their allies especially Emperor Maximilian the new Duke of Milan Maximilian Sforza and the Swiss He had little difficulty in coming to an understanding with the Venetian senate and on the fourteenth of May fifteen thirteen a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive was signed at Blois between the King of France and the republic of Venice Louis hoped also to find at Rome in the new pope Leo X Cardinal John de Medici elected pope March eleven fifteen thirteen favorable inclinations but they were at first very ambiguously and reservedly manifested As a Florentine Leo X had a leaning towards France but as pope he was not disposed to relinquish or disavow the policy of Julius II as to the independence of Italy in respect of any foreign sovereign and as to the extension of the power of the Holy See and he wanted time to make up his mind to infuse into his relations with Louis XII good will instead of his predecessor s impassioned hostility Louis had not and could not have any confidence in Ferdinand the Catholic but he knew him to be as prudent as he was rascally and he concluded with him at Orthez on the first of April fifteen thirteen a year s truce which Ferdinand took great care not to make known to his allies Henry VIII King of England and the Emperor Maximilian the former of whom was very hot tempered and the latter very deeply involved through his daughter Marguerite of Austria in the warlike league against France Madam the name given to Marguerite as ruler of the Low Countries wrote the Florentine minister to Lorenzo de Medici asks for nought but war against the Most Christian king she thinks of nought but keeping up and fanning the kindled fire and she has all the game in her hands for the King of England and the emperor have full confidence in her and she does with them just as she pleases This was all that was gained during the year of Julius II s death by Louis XII s attempts to break up or weaken the coalition against France and these feeble diplomatic advantages were soon nullified by the unsuccess of the French expedition in Milaness Louis de la Tremoille had once more entered it with a strong army but he was on bad terms with his principal lieutenant John James Trivulzio over whom he had not the authority wielded by the young and brilliant Gaston de Foix the French were close to Novara the siege of which they were about to commence they heard that a body of Swiss was advancing to enter the place La Tremoille shifted his position to oppose them and on the fifth of June fifteen thirteen he told all his captains in the evening that they might go to their sleeping quarters and make good cheer for the Swiss were not yet ready to fight not having all their men assembled but early next morning the Swiss attacked the French camp La Tremoille had hardly time to rise and with half his armor on mount his horse the Swiss outposts and those of the French were already at work pell mell over against his quarters The battle was hot and bravely contested on both sides but the Swiss by a vigorous effort got possession of the French artillery and turned it against the infantry of the lanzknechts which was driven in and broken The French army abandoned the siege of Novara and put itself in retreat first of all on Verceil a town of Piedmont and then on France itself And I do assure you says Fleuranges an eye witness and partaker in the battle that there was great need of it of the men at arms there were but few lost or of the French foot which turned out a marvellous good thing for the king and the kingdom for they found him very much embroiled with the English and other nations War between France and England had recommenced at sea in fifteen twelve two squadrons one French of twenty sail and the other English of more than forty met on the tenth of August somewhere off the island of Ushant a brave Breton Admiral Herve Primoguet aboard of the great ship of the Queen of France named the Cordeliere commanded the French squadron and Sir Thomas Knyvet a young sailor of more bravery than experience according to the historians of his own country commanded on board of a vessel named the Regent the English squadron The two admirals vessels engaged in a deadly duel but the French admiral finding himself surrounded by superior forces threw his grappling irons on to the English vessel and rather than surrender set fire to the two admirals ships which blew up at the same time together with their crews of two thousand men The sight of heroism and death has a powerful effect upon men and sometimes suspends their quarrels The English squadron went out again to sea and the French went back to Brest Next year the struggle recommenced but on land and with nothing so striking An English army started from Calais and went and blockaded on the seventeenth of June fifteen thirteen the fortress of Therouanne in Artois It was a fortnight afterwards before Henry VIII himself quitted Calais where festivities and tournaments had detained him too long for what he had in hand and set out on the march with twelve thousand foot to go and join his army before Therouanne He met on his road near Thournehem a body of twelve hundred French men at arms with their followers a horseback and in the midst of them Bayard Sire de Piennes governor of Picardy was in command of them My lord said Bayard to him let us charge them no harm can come of it to us or very little if at the first charge we make an opening in them they are broken if they repulse us we shall still get away they are on foot and we a horseback and nearly all the French were of this opinion continues the chronicler but Sire de Piennes said Gentlemen I have orders on my life from the king our master to risk nothing but only hold his country Do as you please for my part I shall not consent thereto Thus was this matter stayed and the King of England passed with his band under the noses of the French Henry VIII arrived quietly with his army before Therouanne the garrison of which defended itself valiantly though short of provisions Louis XII sent orders to Sire de Piennes to revictual Therouanne at any price The French men at arms to the number of fourteen hundred lances at whose head marched La Palisse Bayard the Duke de Longueville grandson of the great Dunois and Sire de Piennes himself set out on the sixteenth of August to go and make from the direction of Guinegate a sham attack upon the English camp whilst eight hundred Albanian light cavalry were to burst from another direction upon the enemies lines cut their way through at a gallop penetrate to the very fosses of the fortress and throw into them munitions of war and of the stomach hung to their horses necks The Albanians carried out their orders successfully The French men at arms after having skirmished for some time with the cavalry of Henry VIII and Maximilian began to fall back a little carelessly and in some disorder towards their own camp when they perceived two large masses of infantry and artillery English and German preparing to cut off their retreat Surprise led to confusion the confusion took the form of panic the French men at arms broke into a gallop and dispersing in all directions thought of nothing but regaining the main body and the camp at Blangy This sudden rout of so many gallants received the sorry name of the affair of spurs for spurs did more service than the sword Many a chosen captain the Duke de Longueville Sire de la Palisse and Bayard whilst trying to rally the fugitives were taken by the enemy Emperor Maximilian who had arrived at the English camp three or four days before the affair was of opinion that the allies should march straight upon the French camp to take advantage of the panic and disorder but Henry VIII and his lords did not agree with him They contented themselves with pressing on the siege of Therouanne which capitulated on the twenty twod of August for want of provisions The garrison was allowed to go free the men at arms with lance on thigh and the foot with pike on shoulder with their harness and all that they could carry But in spite of an article in the capitulation the town was completely dismantled and burnt and by the advice of Emperor Maximilian Henry VIII made all haste to go and lay siege to Tournai a French fortress between Flanders and Hainault the capture of which was of great importance to the Low Countries and to Marguerite of Austria their ruler On hearing these sad tidings Louis XII though suffering from an attack of gout had himself moved in a litter from Paris to Amiens and ordered Prince Francis of Angouleme heir to the throne to go and take command of the army march it back to the defensive line of the Somme and send a garrison to Tournai It was one of that town s privileges to have no garrison and the inhabitants were unwilling to admit one saying that Tournai never had turned and never would turn tail and if the English came they would find some one to talk to them Howbeit says Fleuranges not a single captain was there nor likewise the said lord duke but understood well how it was with people besieged as indeed came to pass for at the end of three days during which the people of Tournai were besieged they treated for appointment terms with the King of England Other bad news came to Amiens The Swiss puffed up with their victory at Novara and egged on by Emperor Maximilian had to the number of thirty thousand entered Burgundy and on the seventh of September laid siege to Dijon which was rather badly fortified La Tremoille governor of Burgundy shut himself up in the place and bravely repulsed a first assault but sent post haste to warn the king to send him aid whereto the king made no reply beyond that he could not send him aid and that La Tremoille should do the best he could for the advantage and service of the kingdom La Tremoille applied to the Swiss for a safe conduct and without arms and scantily attended he went to them to try whether in consideration of a certain sum of money for the expenses of their army they could be packed off to their own country without doing further displeasure or damage He found them proud and arrogant of heart for they styled themselves chastisers of princes and all he could obtain from them was that the king should give up the duchy of Milan and all the castles appertaining thereto that he should restore to the pope all the towns castles lands and lordships which belonged to him and that he should pay the Swiss four hundred thousand crowns to wit two hundred thousand down and two hundred thousand at Martinmas in the following winter Corps Diplomatique du Droit des Gens by Dumont t vi part one p one hundred seventy five As brave in undertaking a heavy responsibility as he was in delivering a battle La Tremoille did not hesitate to sign on the thirteenth of September this harsh treaty and as he had not two hundred thousand crowns down to give the Swiss he prevailed upon them to be content with receiving twenty thousand at once and he left with them as hostage in pledge of his promise his nephew Rend d Anjou lord of Mezieres one of the boldest and discreetest knights in France But for this honorable defeat the veteran warrior thought the kingdom of France had been then undone for assailed at all its extremities with its neighbors for its foes it could not without great risk of final ruin have borne the burden and defended itself through so many battles La Tremoille sent one of the gentlemen of his house the chevalier Reginald de Moussy to the king to give an account of what he had done and of his motives Some gentlemen about the persons of the king and the queen had implanted some seeds of murmuring and evil thinking in the mind of the queen and through her in that of the king who readily gave ear to her words because good and discreet was she The said Reginald de Moussy having warning of the fact and without borrowing aid of a soul for bold man was he by reason of his virtues entered the king s chamber and falling on one knee announced according to order the service which his master had done and without which the kingdom of France was in danger of ruin whereof he set forth the reasons The whole was said in presence of them who had brought the king to that evil way of thinking and who knew not what to reply to the king when he said to them By the faith of my body I think and do know by experience that my cousin the lord of La Tremoille is the most faithful and loyal servant that I have in my kingdom and the one to whom I am most bounden to the best of his abilities Go Reginald and tell him that I will do all that he has promised and if he has done well let him do better The queen heard of this kind answer made by the king and was not pleased at it but afterwards the truth being known she judged contrariwise to what she through false report had imagined and thought Memoires de la Tremoille in the Petitot collection t xiv pp four hundred seventy six four hundred ninety two Word was brought at the same time to Amiens that Tournai invested on the fifteenth of September by the English had capitulated that Henry VIII had entered it on the twenty first and that he had immediately treated it as a conquest of which he was taking possession for he had confirmed it in all its privileges except that of having no garrison Such was the situation in which France after a reign of fifteen years and in spite of so many brave and devoted servants had been placed by Louis XII s foreign policy Had he managed the home affairs of his kingdom as badly and with as little success as he had matters abroad is it necessary to say what would have been his people s feelings towards him and what name he would have left in history Happily for France and for the memory of Louis XII his home government was more sensible more clear sighted more able more moral and more productive of good results than his foreign policy was When we consider this reign from this new point of view we are at once struck by two facts first the great number of legislative and administrative acts that we meet with bearing upon the general interests of the country interests political judicial financial and commercial the Recueil des Ordonnances des Rois de France contains forty three important acts of this sort owing their origin to Louis XII it was clearly a government full of watchfulness activity and attention to good order and the public weal twod the profound remembrance remaining in succeeding ages of this reign and its deserts a remembrance which was manifested in fifteen sixty amongst the states general of Orleans in fifteen seventy six and fifteen eighty eight amongst the states of Blois in fifteen ninety three amongst the states of the League and even down to sixteen fourteen amongst the states of Paris During more than a hundred years France called to mind and took pleasure in calling to mind the administration of Louis XII as the type of a wise intelligent and effective regimen Confidence may be felt in a people s memory when it inspires them for so long afterwards with sentiment of justice and gratitude If from the simple table of the acts of Louis XII s home government we pass to an examination of their practical results it is plain that they were good and salutary A contemporary historian earnest and truthful though panegyrical Claude do Seyssel describes in the following terms the state of France at that time It is says he a patent fact that the revenue of benefices lands and lordships has generally much increased And in like manner the proceeds of gabels turnpikes law fees and other revenues have been augmented very greatly The traffic too in merchandise whether by sea or land has multiplied exceedingly For by the blessing of peace all folks except the nobles and even them I do not except altogether engage in merchandise For one trader that was in Louis XI s time to be found rich and portly at Paris Rouen Lyons and other good towns of the kingdom there are to be found in this reign more than fifty and there are in the small towns greater number than the great and principal cities were wont to have So much so that scarcely a house is made on any street without having a shop for merchandise or for mechanical art And less difficulty is now made about going to Rome Naples London and elsewhere over sea than was made formally about going to Lyons or to Geneva So much so that there are some who have gone by sea to seek and have found new homes The renown and authority of the king now reigning are so great that his subjects are honored and upheld in every country as well at sea as on land Foreigners were not less impressed than the French themselves with this advance in order activity and prosperity amongst the French community Machiavelli admits it and with the melancholy of an Italian politician acting in the midst of rivalries amongst the Italian republics he attributes it above all to French unity superior to that of any other state in Europe As to the question to whom reverts the honor of the good government at home under Louis XII and of so much progress in the social condition of France M George Picot in his Histoire des Etats Generaux t i pp five hundred thirty two five hundred thirty six attributes it especially to the influence of the states assembled at Tours in fourteen eighty four at the beginning of the reign of Charles VIII They employed he says the greatest efforts to reduce the figure of the impost they claimed the voting of subsidies and took care not to allow them save by way of gift and grant They did not hesitate to revise certain taxes and when they were engaged upon the subject of collecting of them they energetically stood out for the establishment of a unique classified body of receivers royal and demanded the formation of all the provinces into districts of estates voting and apportioning their imposts every year as in the cases of Languedoc Normandy and Dauphiny The dangers of want of discipline in an ill organized standing army and the evils caused to agriculture by roving bands drove the states back to reminiscences of Charles VII s armies and they called for a mixed organization in which gratuitous service commingled in just proportion with that of paid troops would prevent absorption of the national element To reform the abuses of the law to suppress extraordinary commissions to reduce to a powerful unity with parliaments to crown all that multitude of jurisdictions which were degenerate and corrupt products of the feudal system in its decay such was the constant aim of the states general of fourteen eighty four They saw that a judicial hierarchy would be vain without fixity of laws and they demanded a summarization of customs and a consolidation of ordinances in a collection placed within reach of all Lastly they made a claim which they were as qualified to make as they were intelligent in making for the removal of the commercial barriers which divided the provinces and prevented the free transport of merchandise They pointed out the repairing of the roads and the placing of them in good condition as the first means of increasing the general prosperity Not a single branch of the administration of the kingdom escaped their conscientious scrutiny law finance and commerce by turns engaged their attention and in all these different matters they sought to ameliorate institutions but never to usurp power They did not come forward like the shrievalty of the University of Paris in fourteen thirteen with a new system of administration the reign of Louis XI had left nothing that was important or possible in that way to conceive there was nothing more to be done than to glean after him to relax those appliances of government which he had stretched at all points and to demand the accomplishment of such of his projects as were left in arrear and the cure of the evils he had caused by the frenzy and the aberrations of his absolute will We do not care to question the merits of the states general of fourteen eighty four we have but lately striven to bring them to light and we doubt not but that the enduring influence of their example and their sufferings counted for much in the progress of good government during the reign of Louis XII It is an honor to France to have always resumed and pursued from crisis to crisis through a course of many sufferings mistakes and tedious gaps the work of her political enfranchisement and the foundation of a regimen of freedom and legality in the midst of the sole monarchy which so powerfully contributed to her strength and her greatness The states general of fourteen eighty four in spite of their rebuffs and long years after their separation held an honorable place in the history of this difficult and tardy work but Louis XII s personal share in the good home government of France during his reign was also great and meritorious His chief merit a rare one amongst the powerful of the earth especially when there is a question of reforms and of liberty was that he understood and entertained the requirements and wishes of his day he was a mere young prince of the blood when the states of fourteen eighty four were sitting at Tours but he did not forget them when he was king and far from repudiating their patriotic and modest work in the cause of reform and progress he entered into it sincerely and earnestly with the aid of Cardinal d Amboise his honest faithful and ever influential councillor The character and natural instincts of Louis XII inclined him towards the same views as his intelligence and moderation in politics suggested He was kind sympathetic towards his people and anxious to spare them every burden and every suffering that was unnecessary and to have justice real and independent justice rendered to all He reduced the talliages a tenth at first and a third at a later period He refused to accept the dues usual on a joyful accession When the wars in Italy caused him some extraordinary expense he disposed of a portion of the royal possessions strictly administered as they were before imposing fresh burdens upon the people His court was inexpensive and he had no favorites to enrich His economy became proverbial it was sometimes made a reproach to him and things were carried so far that he was represented on the stage of a popular theatre ill pale and surrounded by doctors who were holding a consultation as to the nature of his malady they at last agreed to give him a potion of gold to take the sick man at once sat up complaining of nothing more than a burning thirst When informed of this scandalous piece of buffoonery Louis contented himself with saying I had rather make courtiers laugh by my stinginess than my people weep by my extravagance He was pressed to punish some insolent comedians but No said he amongst their ribaldries they may sometimes tell us useful truths let them amuse themselves provided that they respect the honor of women In the administration of justice he accomplished important reforms called for by the states general of fourteen eighty four and promised by Louis XI and Charles VIII but nearly all of them left in suspense The purchase of offices was abolished and replaced by a two fold election in all grades of the magistracy when an office was vacant the judges were to assemble to select three persons from whom the king should be bound to choose The irremovability of the magistrates which had been accepted but often violated by Louis XI became under Louis XII a fundamental rule It was forbidden to every one of the king magistrates from the premier president to the lowest provost to accept any place or pension from any lord under pain of suspension from their office or loss of their salary The annual Mercurials Wednesday meetings became in the supreme courts a general and standing usage The expenses of the law were reduced In fifteen oh one Louis XII instituted at Aix in Provence a new parliament in fourteen ninety nine the court of exchequer a Rouen hitherto a supreme but movable and temporary court became a fixed and permanent court which afterwards received under Francis I the title of parliament Being convinced before long by facts themselves that these reforms were seriously meant by their author and were practically effective the people conceived in consequence towards the king and the magistrates a general sentiment of gratitude and respect In fifteen seventy Louis made a journey from Paris to Lyons by Champaigne and Burgundy and wherever he passed says saint Gelais men and women assembled from all parts and ran after him for three or four leagues And when they were able to touch his mule or his robe or anything that was his they kissed their hands with as great devotion as they would have shown to a reliquary And the Burgundians showed as much enthusiasm as the real old French Louis XII s private life also contributed to win for him we will not say the respect and admiration but the good will of the public He was not like Louis IX a model of austerity and sanctity but after the licentious court of Charles VII the coarse habits of Louis XI and the easy morals of Charles VIII the French public was not exacting Louis XII was thrice married His first wife Joan daughter of Louis XI was an excellent and worthy princess but ugly ungraceful and hump backed He had been almost forced to marry her and he had no child by her On ascending the throne he begged Pope Alexander VI to annul his marriage the negotiation was anything but honorable either to the king or to the pope and the pope granted his bull in consideration of the favors shown to his unworthy son Caesar Borgia by the king Joan alone behaved with a virtuous as well as modest pride and ended her life in sanctity within a convent at Bourges being wholly devoted to pious works regarded by the people as a saint spoken of by bold preachers as a martyr and still the true and legitimate Queen of France and treated at a distance with profound respect by the king who had put her away Louis married in fourteen ninety nine his predecessor s widow Anne Duchess of Brittany twenty three years of age short pretty a little lame witty able and firm It was on both sides a marriage of policy though romantic tales have been mixed up with it it was a suitable and honorable royal arrangement without any lively affection on one side or the other but with mutual esteem and regard As queen Anne was haughty imperious sharp tempered and too much inclined to mix in intrigues and negotiations at Rome and Madrid sometimes without regard for the king s policy but she kept up her court with spirit and dignity being respected by her ladies whom she treated well and favorably regarded by the public who were well disposed towards her for having given Brittany to France Some courtiers showed their astonishment that the king should so patiently bear with a character so far from agreeable but one must surely put up with something from a woman said Louis when she loves her honor and her husband After a union of fifteen years Anne of Brittany died on the ninth of January fifteen fourteen at the castle of Blois nearly thirty seven years old Louis was then fifty two He seemed very much to regret his wife but some few months after her death another marriage of policy was put on his behalf in course of negotiation It was in connection with Princess Mary of England sister of Henry VIII with whom it was very important for Louis XII and for France to be once more at peace and on good terms The Duke de Longueville made prisoner by the English at the battle of Guinegate had by his agreeable wit and his easy chivalrous grace won Henry VIII s favor in London and he perceived that that prince discontented with his allies the Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain was disposed to make peace with the King of France A few months probably only a few weeks after Anne of Brittany s death De Longueville no doubt with Louis XII s privity suggested to Henry VIII the idea of a marriage between his young sister and the King o France Henry liked to do sudden and striking things he gladly seized the opportunity of avenging himself upon his two allies who in fact had not been very faithful to him and he welcomed De Longueville s idea Mary was sixteen pretty already betrothed to Archduke Charles of Austria and further passionately smitten with Charles Brandon the favorite of Henry VIII who had made him Duke of Suffolk and according to English historians the handsomest nobleman in England These two difficulties were surmounted Mary herself formally declared her intention of breaking a promise of marriage which had been made during her minority and which Emperor Maximilian had shown himself in no hurry to get fulfilled and Louis XII formally demanded her hand Three treaties were concluded on the seventh of August fifteen fourteen between the Kings of France and England in order to regulate the conditions of their political and matrimonial alliance on the thirteenth of August the Duke de Longueville in his sovereign s name espoused the Princess Mary at Greenwich and she escorted to France by brilliant embassy arrived on the eighth of October at Abbeville where Louis XII was awaiting her Three days afterwards the marriage was solemnized there in state and Louis who had suffered from gout during the ceremony carried off his young queen to Paris after having had her crowned at saint Denis Mary Tudor had given up the German prince who was destined to become Charles V but not the handsome English nobleman she loved The Duke of Suffolk went to France to see her after her marriage and in her train she had as maid of honor a young girl a beauty as well who was one day to be Queen of England Anne Boleyn Less than three months after this marriage on the first of January fifteen fifteen the death bell men were traversing the streets of Paris ringing their bells and crying The good King Louis father of the people is dead Louis XII in fact had died that very day at midnight from an attack of gout and a rapid decline He had no great need to be married for many reasons says the Loyal Serviteur of Bayard and he likewise had no great desire that way but because he found himself on every side at war which he could not maintain without pressing very hard upon his people he behaved like the pelican After that Queen Mary had made her entry which was mighty triumphant into Paris and that there had taken place many jousts and tourneys which lasted more than six weeks the good king because of his wife changed all his manner of living he had been wont to dine at eight and he now dined at midday he had been wont to go to bed at six in the evening and he often now went to bed at midnight He fell ill at the end of December from the which illness nought could save him He was whilst he lived a good prince wise and virtuous who maintained his people in peace without pressing hard upon them in any way save by constraint He had in his time much of good and of evil whereby he got ample knowledge of the world He obtained many victories over his enemies but towards the end of his days Fortune gave him a little turn of her frowning face He was borne to his grave at saint Denis amongst his good predecessors with great weeping and wailing and to the great regret of his subjects He was a gentle prince says Robert de la Marck lord of Fleuranges both in war and otherwise and in all matters wherein he was required to take part It was pity when this malady of gout attacked him for he was not an old man To the last of his days Louis XII was animated by earnest sympathy and active solicitude for his people It cost him a great deal to make with the King of England the treaties of August seven fifteen fourteen to cede Tournai to the English and to agree to the payment to them of a hundred thousand crowns a year for ten years He did it to restore peace to France attacked on her own soil and feeling her prosperity threatened For the same reason he negotiated with Pope Leo X Emperor Maximilian and Ferdinand the Catholic and he had very nearly attained the same end by entering once more upon pacific relations with them when death came and struck him down at the age of fifty three He died sorrowing over the concessions he had made from a patriotic sense of duty as much as from necessity and full of disquietude about the future He felt a sincere affection for Francis de Valois Count of Angouleme his son law and successor the marriage between his daughter Claude and that prince had been the chief and most difficult affair connected with his domestic life and it was only after the death of the queen Anne of Brittany that he had it proclaimed and celebrated The bravery the brilliant parts the amiable character and the easy grace of Francis I delighted him but he dreaded his presumptuous inexperience his reckless levity and his ruinous extravagance and in his anxiety as a king and father he said We are laboring in vain this big boy will

he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
