Loin five Hind Loin six Leg PREFACE The writer does not deem any apology necessary for adding another to the long list of gastronomic works provided she has accomplished the desirable object of producing a Cook Book which shall commend itself to all persons of true taste that is to say those whose taste has not been vitiated by a mode of cooking contrary to her own Although not a Ude or a Kitchener she does profess to have sufficient knowledge of the culinary art as practised by good American cooks to instruct those not versed in this truly interesting science The inefficiency of most works of this kind are well known to all experienced housekeepers they being generally a mere compilation of receipts by those who have no practical knowledge of the subject and are consequently unable to judge of their correctness or to give the necessary directions for putting the ingredients together in the right manner A conviction that a good practical Cook Book was much needed induced the writer to exert herself to supply the deficiency She does not pretend to infallibility but having taken a great deal of pains to have each receipt as correct and nice as possible she trusts that they will generally give satisfaction The mode of cooking is such as is generally practised by good American housekeepers and the receipts embrace all the various branches of the culinary science from preparing the most simple vegetables or broths to making the most delicate cake creams sweetmeats c The writer has endeavored to combine both economy and that which will be agreeable to the palate but she has never suffered the former to supersede the latter This book is intended for all classes of society embracing receipts both for rich and plain cooking and written in such a plain manner that the most unskilled need not err Placed in the hands of any servant of common capacity who can read it will set aside the necessity of those frequent applications for directions with which the patience of housekeepers is often tried The experienced cook may smile at the minuteness of the directions but if she has witnessed as much good food spoiled by improper cooking as the writer of these receipts she will not think she has been too explicit In regard to the seasoning of food it has been found impossible to give any exact rules as so much depends upon the quality of the seasoning and food The cook should be careful not to have the natural flavor of the food overpowered by the seasoning and where a variety of spices are used no one of them should predominate Independent of the receipts for cookery we have annexed a collection of miscellaneous receipts relative to housekeeping which together with the copious illustrations and directions for carving we trust will render it of superior usefulness In conclusion the writer would give her sincere thanks to those of her friends who have kindly furnished her with their choice and valuable receipts and to those into whose hands the book may fall she would ask a fair trial of them before passing judgment CONTENTS NO PAGE MEAT one Observations respecting Meat nine two Roast Beef ten three Beefsteak ten four Alamode Beef eleven five

COOKERY one Observations respecting Meat Meat to be in perfection should be kept a number of days when the weather will admit of it Beef and mutton should be kept at least a week in cold weather and poultry three or four days 
4226_12707_000006_000002	train-clean-360	If the weather is hot it will keep but a short time 
4226_12707_000006_000003	train-clean-360	It should be kept in a cool airy place away from the flies and if there is any danger of its spoiling a little salt should be rubbed over it 
none	none	When meat is frozen it should be put into lukewarm water and not taken out till the frost is extracted If there is any frost in it when put to the fire it will not cook well The best way to boil it is to put it in cold water and boil it gently with just water enough to cover it as it hardens by furious boiling The part that is to be up on the table should be down in the pot as the scum that rises is apt to make the meat look dark the scum should be taken off as soon as it rises The liquor in which all kinds of fresh meat is boiled makes a good soup when thickened and seasoned 
4226_12707_000006_000006	train-clean-360	Boiling is the cheapest way of cooking meat provided you make a soup of the liquor if not it is the dearest as most of the gelatine is extracted by the process of boiling which is the most nourishing part and if not used for soup is completely lost 
none	none	In roasting meat only the juices and fat are extracted but not lost as the juices make good gravy and the fat is good for various culinary purposes 
4226_12707_000006_000008	train-clean-360	When it is put down to roast there should be a little water in the dripping pan 
none	none	For broiling the bars of the gridiron should be perfectly clean and greased with lard or butter otherwise the meat will retain the impression of the bars 
4226_12707_000006_000010	train-clean-360	The bars of the gridiron should be concave and terminate in a trough to catch the juices or they will drop in the fire and smoke the meat 
none	none	A good fire of hot coals is necessary to have the meat broil as quick as possible without burning The gridiron should be put on the fire and well heated before the meat is laid on it 
4226_12707_000006_000013	train-clean-360	The dish should be very hot on which broiled meat is put and it should not be seasoned till taken up 
4226_12707_000006_000014	train-clean-360	If you wish to fry meat cut a small piece of pork into slices and fry them a light brown then take them up and put in your meat which should be perfectly dry 
4226_12707_000006_000015	train-clean-360	When the meat is sufficiently fried take it up remove the frying pan from the fire to cool when so turn in a little cold water for the gravy put it on the fire when it boils stir in a little mixed flour and water let it boil then turn it over the meat 
none	none	If not rich enough add butter and catsup if you like two Roast Beef 
4226_12707_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The tender loin and first and second cuts off the rack are the best roasting pieces the third and fourth cuts are good 
none	none	When the meat is put to the fire a little salt should be sprinkled on it and the bony side turned towards the fire first 
4226_12707_000008_000002	train-clean-360	When the bones get well heated through turn the meat and keep a brisk fire baste it frequently while roasting 
none	none	There should be a little water put into the dripping pan when the meat is put down to roast 
4226_12707_000008_000004	train-clean-360	If it is a thick piece allow fifteen minutes to each pound to roast it in if thin less time will be required 
none	none	three Beef Steak 
4226_12707_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The tender loin is the best piece for broiling a steak from the round or shoulder clod is good and comes cheaper 
4226_12707_000010_000001	train-clean-360	If the beef is not very tender it should be laid on a board and pounded before broiling or frying it 
none	none	Wash it in cold water then lay it on a gridiron place it on a hot bed of coals and broil it as quick as possible without burning it 
4226_12707_000010_000003	train-clean-360	If broiled slow it will not be good 
4226_12707_000010_000004	train-clean-360	It takes from fifteen to twenty minutes to broil a steak 
4226_12707_000010_000005	train-clean-360	For seven or eight pounds of beef cut up about a quarter of a pound of butter 
4226_12707_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Heat the platter very hot that the steak is to be put on lay the butter on it take up the steak salt and pepper it on both sides 
4226_12707_000010_000007	train-clean-360	Beef steak to be good should be eaten as soon as cooked 
none	none	A few slices of salt pork broiled with the steak makes a rich gravy with a very little butter 
4226_12707_000010_000009	train-clean-360	There should always be a trough to catch the juices of the meat when broiled

like them a little salt petre tends to preserve them To tell whether they are seasoned enough do up a little into a cake and fry it If not seasoned enough add more seasoning and fill your skins which should be previously cleaned thoroughly A little flour mixed in with the meat tends to prevent the fat from running out when cooked Sausage meat is good done up in small cakes and fried In summer when fresh pork cannot be procured very good sausage cakes may be made of raw beef chopped fine with salt pork and seasoned with pepper and sage When sausages are fried they should not be pricked and they will cook nicer to have a little fat put in the frying pan with them They should be cooked slowly If you do not like them very fat take them out of the pan when nearly done and finish cooking them on a gridiron Bologna sausages are made of equal weight each of ham veal and pork chopped very fine seasoned high and boiled in casings till tender then dried thirty two Ham A ham that weighs ten pounds should be boiled four or five hours if very salt the water should be changed Before it is put on the table take off the rind If you wish to ornament it put whole cloves or pepper in the form of diamonds over it The Virginia method of curing hams which is considered very superior is to dissolve two ounces of salt petre two tea spoonsful of saleratus in a salt pickle as strong as possible for every sixteen pounds of ham add molasses in the proportion of a gallon to a hogshead of brine then put in the hams and let them remain three or four weeks Then take them out of the brine and smoke them with the hocks downwards to preserve the juices They will smoke tolerably well in the course of a month but they will be much better to remain in the smoke house two or three months Hams cured in this manner are very fine flavored and will keep good a long time thirty three Tongues Cut off the roots of the tongues they are not good smoked but they make nice pies Take out the pipes and veins boil them till tender mince them fine season the meat with salt cloves mace and cinnamon put in a little sugar and molasses moisten the whole with brandy put it in a cool place and it will keep good several months in cold weather and is good to make pies of at any time with the addition of apples chopped fine and a little butter melted For the remainder of the tongues make a brine in the following manner to a gallon of cold water put a quart of rock salt an ounce of salt petre quarter of a pound of sugar and a couple of table spoonsful of blown salt Put in the tongues let them remain

jointed Boil the meat till tender in just sufficient water to cover it and add a little salt Just before the meat is boiled enough to take up fry three or four slices of pork till brown take them up and put in the chickens Let them brown then add part of the liquor in which they were boiled one or two tea spoonsful of curry powder and the fried pork Mix a tea spoonful of curry powder with a tea

made of chickens joint them boil the meat until about half done Take the meat out of the liquor in which it was boiled and put it in a pot with a layer of crust to each layer of meat having a layer of

glass into cakes and baked in a moderate oven on buttered flat tins one hundred sixty eight Rules to be observed in making nice Cake Cake to be good must be made of nice materials The butter eggs and flour should not be stale and the sugar should be of a light color and dry Brown sugar answers very well for most kinds of cake if rolled free from lumps and stirred to a cream with the butter The flour should be sifted and if damp dried perfectly otherwise it will make the cake heavy The eggs should be beaten to a froth and the cake will be more delicate if the yelks and whites are beaten separately Saleratus and soda should be perfectly dissolved and strained before they are stirred into the cake Raisins for cake should have the seeds taken out Zante currants should be rinsed in several waters to cleanse them rubbed in a dry cloth to get out the sticks and then spread on platters and dried perfectly before they are put into the cake Almonds should be blanched which is done by turning boiling water on them and letting them remain in it till the skins will rub off easily When blanched dry them then pound them fine with rosewater to prevent their oiling When the weather is cold the materials for cake should be moderately warmed before mixing them together All kinds of cake that are made without yeast are better for being stirred till just before they are baked The butter and sugar should be stirred together till white then the eggs flour and spice added Saleratus and cream should not be put in till just before the cake is baked add the fruit last Butter the cake pans well The cake will be less liable to burn if the pans are lined with white buttered paper The cake should not be moved while baking if it can be avoided as moving it is apt to make it heavy The quicker most kinds of cake are baked the lighter and better they will be but the oven should not be of such a furious heat as to burn them It is impossible to give any exact rules as to the time to be allowed for baking various kinds of cake as so much depends on the heat of the oven It should be narrowly watched while in the oven and if it browns too fast it should be covered with a thick paper To ascertain when rich cake is sufficiently baked stick a clean broom splinter through the thickest part of the loaf if none of the cake adheres to the splinter it is sufficiently baked When

with a fork so that the crust will not burst while baking and let out the juices of the pie Rhubarb pies should be baked about an hour in a slow oven it will not do to bake them quick Some cooks stew

grapes a thick layer of sugar and a table spoonful of water two hundred forty nine Currant and Gooseberry Pie Currants and gooseberries are the best for pies when of a full growth just before they begin to turn red they are tolerably good when ripe Currants mixed with ripe raspberries or mulberries make very nice pies Green currants and gooseberries for pies are not apt to be sweet enough without the sugar is scalded in before they are baked as the juice of the currants is apt to run out while they are baking and leave the fruit dry Stew them on a moderate fire with a tea cup of water to a couple of quarts of currants as soon as they begin to break add the sugar and let it scald in a few minutes When baked without stewing put to each layer of fruit a thick layer of sugar There

answer for a quart of the pumpkin if very little milk is used Sweeten the pumpkin with sugar and very little molasses the sugar and eggs should be beaten together Ginger the grated rind of a lemon or nutmeg is good spice for the pies Pumpkin pies require a very hot oven The rim of the pies is apt to get burnt before the inside is baked sufficiently On this account it is a good plan to heat the pumpkin scalding hot when prepared for pies before turning it into the pie plates The pies should be baked as soon as the plates are filled or the under crust to the pies will be clammy The more the number of eggs in the pies the less time will be required to bake them If you have pumpkins that have begun to decay or those that are frozen they can be kept several months in cold weather by cutting the good part up stewing it till soft then stirring it and adding sugar and molasses to make it very sweet Make it strong of ginger then scald the seasoning in well Keep it in a stone jar in a cool

with less than an equal weight of sugar White sugar makes the most delicate sweetmeats nice brown sugar answers very well for most kinds of fruit The West India sugar house syrup is better than sugar to preserve fruit on account of its never fermenting When brown sugar is used clarify it as in direction for clarifying syrup No three hundred three then put in the fruit Nice white sugar does not need clarifying All kinds of fire proof ware will do to preserve in excepting iron ware The fruit should not be crowded while preserving and should boil gently The fruit should be turned out of the preserving kettles as soon as done and set away in a cool place otherwise they will not be nice Keep the sweetmeats in stone or china jars that have never been used for other purposes Glass jars are the best for delicate sweetmeats such as strawberries or cherries Preserves should be covered tight and kept in a cool place A paper wet in brandy and laid over the sweetmeats has a tendency to keep them from fermenting They should be looked to frequently to see that they do not ferment Whenever they do the syrup should be turned from them scalded and turned back on them while hot three hundred

fruit Quinces preserved in this manner retain their natural flavor better than when preserved in any other manner but they must be very ripe to preserve in this way otherwise they will not be tender When not very ripe pare and cut them either in rings or quarters take out the cores and boil the quinces in fair water till they begin to grow tender take them up and strain the water in which they are boiled put in either brown or white sugar add a little cold water When lukewarm put in the whites of eggs and clarify it let it cool then put in the quinces and boil them slowly for half an hour

see if they have fermented if so turn the syrup from them boil it and turn it back while hot The parings and cores of the quinces can be used for marmalade with a few whole ones Some people preserve the quinces with the cores in but the syrup will not look clear The following is a cheap method of preserving quinces and answers very well for common use Pare halve and take out the cores of the quinces and boil the parings in new cider till soft Strain the cider and for five pounds of quinces put in a pound of brown sugar a quart of molasses the beaten white of an egg clarify it then put in the quinces There should be rather more than enough cider to cover the quinces as it wastes a good deal while the quinces are boiling The peel of an orange cut in small pieces and boiled with them

hours set the pot on a hot bed of coals and stir it constantly until sufficiently roasted which is ascertained by biting one of the lightest colored kernels if it is brittle the whole is done Turn it out of the pot immediately into a box cover it tight to keep in the steam A coffee roaster is better than a pot to roast coffee in as it preserves the fine aromatic flavor of the coffee which in a great measure escapes with the steam of the coffee when roasted in an open pot To make good common coffee allow a table spoonful of it when ground to each pint of water Turn on the water boiling hot and boil the coffee in a tin pot from twenty to twenty five minutes if boiled longer it will not taste fresh and lively Let it stand after being taken from the fire four or five minutes to settle then turn it off carefully from the grounds into a coffee pot or urn When the coffee is put on the fire to boil a piece of fish skin or isinglass of the size of a nine pence should be put in or else the white and shell of half an egg to a couple of quarts of coffee Many persons dislike to clear coffee with fish skin thinking that it imparts an unpleasant taste to coffee but it will not if properly prepared The skin should be taken from mild codfish that has not been soaked as the skin loses its clearing properties by soaking Rinse it in cold water and dry it perfectly When dried cut it into pieces of the size of a nine pence If torn off as it is wanted for use too much is apt to be put in at once and give the coffee a bad taste A piece of the size of a twelve and a half cent piece is sufficient to settle a couple of quarts of water French coffee is made in a German filter the water is turned on boiling hot and one third more coffee is necessary than when boiled in the common way

hops to three or four gallons of water and two or three raw potatoes pared and cut in slices The strength of the roots and hops is obtained more thoroughly by boiling them in two waters for when the liquor is strongly saturated with the hops it will rather bind up the roots than extract their juices The roots should be boiled five or six hours the liquor should then be strained and a quart of molasses put to three gallons of the beer If you wish to have the beer very rich brown half a pound of bread and put it into the liquor If the liquor is too thick dilute it with cold water When just lukewarm put in a pint of fresh lively yeast that has no salt in it The salt has a tendency to keep it from fermenting Keep it in a temperate situation covered over but not so tight as to exclude the

may not curdle It is difficult to distinguish the taste from fresh cream three hundred eighty seven To keep Eggs several months It is a good plan to buy eggs for family use when cheap and preserve them in the following manner Mix half a pint of unslaked lime with the same quantity of salt a couple of gallons of water The water should be turned on boiling hot When cold put in the eggs which should be perfectly fresh and care should be taken not to crack any of them if cracked they will spoil directly The eggs should be entirely covered with the lime water and kept in a stone pot and the pot set in a cool place If the above directions are strictly attended to the eggs will keep good five months The lime water should not be so strong as to eat the shell and all the eggs should be perfectly fresh when put in as one bad one will spoil the whole three hundred eighty eight To melt Fat for Shortening The fat of all kinds of meat excepting that of ham and mutton makes good shortening Roast meat drippings and the liquor in which meat is boiled should stand until cold to have the fat congeal so that it can be taken off easily When taken up scrape off the sediment which adheres to the under side of the fat cut the fat into small pieces together with any scraps of fat from broiled meat that you may happen to have Melt the fat slowly then strain it and let it remain till cold When formed into a hard cake take it up if any sediment adheres to the under side scrape it off Melt the fat again when partly cooled sprinkle in salt in the proportion of a tea spoonful to a pound of the shortening The dregs of the fat are good for soap grease This shortening answers all the various purposes of lard very well excepting in the hottest weather The fat of cooked meat should not be suffered to remain more than a week in winter and three days in summer without being melted Ham fat if boiled in fresh water and then clarified answers very well to fry in Mutton fat if melted into hard cakes will fetch a good price at the tallow chandler s The leaves and thin pieces of pork should be used for lard Cut them in small bits and melt them slowly then strain them through a cullender with a thick cloth laid in it As soon as the fat cools and thickens sprinkle in salt in the proportion of a tea cup full to twenty weight of the lard Stir it in well then set the pot that contains it in a cool place Some people have an idea that the pork scraps must be on the fire until they become brown in order to have the lard kept sweet the year round but it is not necessary if salt is mixed with it three hundred eighty nine To keep Vegetables through the Winter Succulent vegetables are preserved best in a cool shady place that is damp Turnips Irish potatoes and similar vegetables should be protected from the air and frost by being buried up in sand and in very severe cold weather covered over with a linen cloth It is said that the dust of charcoal sprinkled over potatoes will keep them from sprouting I have also heard it said that Carolina potatoes may be kept a number of months if treated in the following manner Take those that are large and perfectly free from decay pack them in boxes of dry sand and set the boxes in a place exposed to the influence of smoke and inaccessible to frost three hundred ninety To preserve Herbs All kinds of herbs should be gathered on a dry day just before or while in blossom Tie them in bundles and suspend them in a dry airy place with the blossoms downwards When perfectly dry wrap the medicinal ones in paper and keep them from the air Pick off the leaves of those which are to be used in cooking pound and sift them fine and keep the powder in bottles corked up tight three hundred ninety one To preserve various kinds of Fruit through the Winter Apples can be kept till June by taking only those that are hard and sound wiping them dry then packing them in tight barrels with a layer of bran to each layer of apples Envelope the barrel in a linen cloth to protect it from frost and keep it in a cool place but not so cold as to freeze the apples It is said that mortar laid over the top of a barrel of apples is a good thing to preserve them as it draws the air from them which is the principal cause of their decaying Care should be taken not to have it come in contact with the apples To preserve oranges and lemons several months take those that are perfectly fresh and wrap each one in soft paper put them in glass jars or a very tight box with white sand that has been previously dried in an oven a few hours after it has been baked in The sand should be strewed thick over each one of the oranges as they are laid in the jar and the whole covered with a thick layer of it Close the jar up tight and keep it in a cool dry place but not so cool as to freeze the fruit To preserve grapes gather them on a dry day when they are not quite dead ripe and pick those that are not fair off from the stems Lay the bunches of grapes in a glass jar and sprinkle around each of them a thick layer of dry bran so that they will not touch each other Have a thick layer of bran on the top and cork and seal the jar very tight so that the air may be entirely excluded Whenever they are to be eaten restore them to their freshness by cutting off a small piece from the end of the stalks and immerse the stalks of each bunch in sweet wine for a few minutes The stalks will imbibe the wine and make the grapes fresh and juicy Various kinds of fruit taken when green such as grapes gooseberries currants and plums can be kept through the winter by being treated in the following manner Fill junk bottles with them and set them in an oven six or seven hours after having baked in it Let them remain till they begin to shrink then take the fruit from one bottle to fill the others quite full Cork and seal up the bottles Whenever you wish to make pies of them put the quantity you wish to use into a tin pan turn on boiling water sufficient to cover them and stew them in it till soft then sweeten and make them into pies Ripe blackberries and whortleberries to be kept long should be dried perfectly in the sun then tied up in bags that are thick enough to exclude the air When used for pies treat them in the same manner as the green fruit Ripe currants dried on the stalks then picked off and put in bags will keep nice for pies during the winter They also make a fine tea for persons that have a fever particularly the hectic fever it is also an excellent thing to counteract the effects of opium three hundred ninety two To keep Pickles and Sweetmeats Pickles should be kept in unglazed earthen jars or wooden kegs Sweetmeats keep best in glass jars unglazed stone pots answer very well for common fruit A paper wet in brandy or proof spirit and laid on the preserved fruit tends to keep it from fermenting Both pickles and sweetmeats should be watched to see that they do not ferment particularly when the weather is warm Whenever they ferment turn off the vinegar or syrup scald and turn it back while hot When pickles grow soft it is owing to the vinegar being too weak To strengthen it heat it scalding hot turn it back on the pickles and when lukewarm put in a little alum and a brown paper wet in molasses If it does not grow sharp in the course of three weeks it is past recovery and should be thrown away and fresh vinegar turned on scalding hot to the pickles three hundred ninety three Cautions relative to the use of Brass and Copper Cooking Utensils Cleanliness has been aptly styled the cardinal virtue of cooks Food is more healthy as well as palatable cooked in a cleanly manner Many lives have been lost in consequence of carelessness in using brass copper and glazed earthen cooking utensils The two first should be thoroughly cleansed with salt and hot vinegar before cooking in them and no oily or acid substance after being cooked should be allowed to cool or remain in any of them three hundred ninety four Durable Ink for Marking Linen Dissolve a couple of drachms of lunar caustic and half an ounce of gum arabic in a gill of rain water Dip whatever is to be marked in strong pearl ash

of sealing wax the same quantity of rosin a couple of ounces of bees wax When it froths stir it with a tallow candle As soon as it melts dip the mouths of the corked bottles into it This is an excellent thing to exclude the air from such things as are injured by being exposed to it three hundred ninety eight Cement for broken China Glass and Earthenware Rub the edge of the china or glass with the beaten white of an egg Tie very finely powdered quick lime in a muslin bag and sift it thick over the edges of the dishes that have been previously rubbed with the egg Match and bind the pieces together and let it remain bound several weeks This is good cement for every kind of crockery but thick heavy glass and coarse earthenware the former cannot be cemented with any thing for the latter white paint will answer Paint and match the broken edges bind them tight together and let them remain until the paint becomes dry and hard Milk is a good cement for crockery the pieces should be matched and bound together tight then put in cold milk and the milk set where it will boil for half an hour then take it from the fire and let the crockery remain till the milk is cold Let the crockery remain bound for several weeks The Chinese method of mending broken china is to grind flint glass on a painter s stone till it is reduced to an impalpable powder then beat it with the white of an egg to a froth and lay it on the edge of the broken pieces match and bind them together firmly and let them remain several weeks It is said that no art will then be able to break it in the same place three hundred ninety nine Japanese Cement or Rice Glue Mix rice flour with cold water to a smooth paste and boil it gently It answers all the purposes of wheat flour paste while it is far superior in point of transparency and smoothness This composition made with so small a proportion of water as to have it of the consistence of plastic clay may be used to form models busts basso relievos and similar articles When made of it they are susceptible of a very high polish Poland starch is a nice cement for pasting layers of paper together or any fancy articles four hundred Cement for Alabaster Take of white bees wax one pound of rosin a pound and three quarters of alabaster Melt the wax and rosin then strew the alabaster over it lightly which should be previously reduced to a fine powder Stir the whole well together then knead the mass in water in order to incorporate the alabaster thoroughly with the rosin and wax The alabaster when mended should be perfectly dry and heated The cement when applied should also be heated Join the broken pieces bind them and let them remain a week This composition when properly managed forms an extremely strong cement four hundred one To clean Alabaster or any other kinds of Marble Pound pumice stone to a fine powder and mix it with verjuice Let it remain several hours then dip in a perfectly clean sponge and rub the marble with it till clean Rinse it off with clear fresh water and rub it dry with a clean linen cloth four hundred two Cement for Iron ware Beat the whites of eggs to a froth then stir into them enough quicklime to make a consistent paste then add iron file dust to make a thick paste The quicklime should be reduced to a fine powder before mixing it with the eggs Fill the cracks in iron ware with

rub it round the stopple close to the mouth of the bottle then put the bottle about a couple of feet from the fire having the mouth towards it The heat will cause the oil to run down between the stopple and mouth of the bottle When warm strike the bottle gently on both sides with any light wooden instrument that you may happen to have If the stopple cannot be taken out with the hand at the end of this process repeat it and you will finally succeed by persevering in it however firmly it may be wedged in four hundred four Lip Salve Dissolve a small lump of white sugar in a table spoonful

placing it where the sun will shine on it hot Where soap and salt will not remove stains lemon juice and salt will generally answer The above things will only remove stains in warm clear weather when the sun is hot Sulphuric acid diluted with water is very effectual in removing fruit stains Care should be taken not to have it so strong as to eat a hole in the garment and as soon as the stain is out it should be rinsed in pearl ash water and then in fair water Colored cotton goods that have common ink spilt on them should be soaked in lukewarm sour milk four hundred twelve Directions for Washing Calicoes Calico clothes before they are put in water should have the grease spots rubbed out as they cannot be seen when the whole of the garment is wet They should never be washed in very hot soap suds that which is mildly warm will cleanse them quite as well and will not extract the colors so much Soft soap should never be used for calicoes excepting for the various shades of yellow which look the best washed with soft soap and not rinsed in fair water Other colors should be rinsed in fair water and dried in the shade When calicoes incline to fade the colors can be set by washing them in lukewarm water with beef s gall in the proportion of a tea cup full to four or five gallons of water Rinse them in fair water no soap is necessary without the clothes are very dirty If so wash them in lukewarm suds after they have been first rubbed out in beef s gall water The beef s gall can be kept several months by squeezing it out of the skin in which it is enclosed adding salt to it and

think it not improbable that it may be an excellent way to set the colors as rinsing calicoes in cold salt and water serves to set the colors particularly of black blue and green colors A little vinegar in the rinsing water of pink red and green calicoes is good to brighten the colors and keep them from mixing All kinds of calicoes but black look better for starching but black calicoes will not look clear if starched On this account potato water is an excellent thing to wash them if boiled down to a thick consistence as it stiffens them without showing four hundred thirteen Directions

verdigris in the rinsing water fawn and browns should be rinsed in pure water Dip the silks up and down in the rinsing water take them out of it without wringing and dry them in the shade Fold them up while damp let them remain to have the dampness strike through all parts of them alike then put them in a mangler if you have not one iron them on the wrong side with an iron only just hot enough to smooth them A little isinglass or gum arabic dissolved in the rinsing water of gauze shawls and ribbons is good to stiffen them The water in which pared potatoes have been boiled is an excellent thing

have coffee or fruit stains on them before being put into soap suds should have boiling water turned on them and remain in it till the water is cold the spots should be then rubbed out in it If they are put into soap suds with the stains in they will be set by it so that no subsequent washing will remove them Table cloths will be less likely to get stained up if they are always rinsed in thin starch water as it tends to keep coffee and fruit from sinking into the texture of the cloth White clothes that are very dirty will come clean easily if put into strong cool suds and hung on the fire the night previous to the day in which they are to be washed If they get to boiling it will not do them any harm provided the suds is cool when they are put in if it is hot at first it will set the dirt in The following method of washing clothes is a saving of a great deal of labor Soak the clothes in lukewarm soap suds if they are quite dirty soak them over night To every three pails of water put a pint of soft soap and a table spoonful of the salts of soda Heat it till mildly warm then put in the clothes without any rubbing and boil them an hour Drain the suds out of them as much as possible as it is bad for the hands then add water till cool enough for the hands The dirt will be loose so that they will require but a little rubbing Rinse them thoroughly in clear water then in indigo water The soda can be procured cheap by purchasing it in large quantities soda is an excellent thing to soften hard water The soda suds will not do to wash calicoes in It is a good plan to save

being tied up in a bag the water in which it is boiled is as good as Poland starch for clear starching muslins if boiled to a thick consistency after it is turned off from the boiled rice and then strained Muslins to look clear should be starched and clapped dry while the starch is hot then folded in a very damp cloth and suffered to remain in it till they become quite damp before ironing them

times in a year as the dirt that collects underneath them wears them out very fast Straw kept under carpets will make them wear much longer as the dirt will sift through and keep it from grinding out Carpets should be taken up as often as once a year even if not much used as there is danger of moths getting into them If there is any appearance of moths in carpets when they are taken up sprinkle tobacco or black pepper on the floor before the carpets are put down and let it remain after they are laid down When the dust is well shaken out of carpets if there are any grease spots on them grate on potter s clay very thick cover them with a brown paper and set on a warm iron It will be necessary to repeat this process several times to get out all the grease If the carpets are so much soiled

woollen cloth dipped in oil of vitriol and water mixed being careful not to touch any part of the furniture that is not spotted As soon as the ink is extracted rinse the spot with pearl ash water and then with fair water It is said that blotting paper alone will extract the ink if rolled up tight and rubbed hard on the spots If it answers the purpose it is altogether best to use it as there is always danger attending the use of oil of vitriol it being so powerful as to corrode whatever it may get dropped on without its effects are destroyed by the use of an alkali four hundred twenty two To

fall on them When thoroughly soaked let them dry in a hot sun for six or seven successive days shaking them up well and turning them over each day They should be covered over with a thick cloth during the night if exposed to the night air they will become damp and mildew This way of washing the bed ticking and feathers makes them very fresh and light and is much easier than the old fashioned way of emptying the beds and washing the feathers separately while it answers quite as well Care must be taken to dry the bed perfectly before sleeping on it Hair mattresses that have become hard and dirty

fire kept up in them half a day As soon as the wood is removed put up the lid of the oven It should not be used for baking until it has been heated the second time If not treated in this manner it will never retain the heat well New flat irons should be heated half a day before they are used in order to retain heat well Iron cooking utensils when new will be less liable to crack if heated gradually five or six hours and then cooled slowly before being used to cook in Cold water should never be turned into hot iron utensils as it will crack them by cooling the surface too suddenly four

knife should be light of middling size and of a fine edge Strength is less required than skill in the manner of using it and to facilitate this the butcher should be directed to divide the joints of the bones of all carcass joints of mutton lamb and veal such as neck breast and loin which then may easily be cut into thin slices attached to the bones If the whole of the meat belonging to each bone should be too thick a small slice may be taken off between every two bones The more fleshy joints as fillets of veal leg or saddle of mutton and beef are to be helped in thin slices neatly cut and smooth Observe to let the knife pass down to the bone in the mutton and beef joints The dish should not be too far off the carver as it gives an awkward appearance and makes the task more difficult Attention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such articles as are considered best In helping fish take care not to break the flakes which in cod and very fresh salmon are large and contribute much to the beauty of its appearance A fish knife not being sharp divides it best Help a part of the roe milt or liver to each person The heads of carp part of those of cod and salmon sounds of cod and fins of turbot are likewise esteemed niceties and are to be attended to accordingly In cutting up any wild fowl duck goose or turkey for a large party if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion without making wings there will be more handsome pieces one Sirloin of Beef This may be begun at either end or by cutting in the middle It is usual to inquire whether the outside or inside is preferred For the outside the slice should be cut down to the bones and the same with every following helping Slice the inside likewise and give with each piece some of the soft fat The inside done in the following manner is excellent Have ready some shalot vinegar boiling hot mince the meat large and a good deal of the fat sprinkle it with salt and pour the vinegar and the gravy on it Help with a spoon as quick as possible on hot plates two Aitch or Edgebone of Beef Illustration Cut off a slice an inch thick all the length from a to b and then help The soft fat which resembles marrow lies at the back of the bone below d the firm fat must be cut in horizontal slices at the edge of the meat c The skewer used in keeping the meat together while boiling is shown at a which should be drawn out before served up or if necessary to leave it in place instead one of silver three Shoulder of Mutton Illustration This is a very good joint and by many preferred to the leg for if properly roasted it abounds in gravy and produces many nice bits The figure annexed represents it as laid in the dish with its back uppermost It should first be cut in the hollow part in the direction a b and the knife passed deep to the bone The best part of the fat lies on the outer edge and it is to be cut out in thin slices in the direction f If many are at the table and the hollow part cut in the line a b is eaten some very good and delicate slices may be cut out on each side the ridge of the blade bone in the direction c d The line between these two dotted lines is that in the direction of which the edge or ridge of the blade bone lies and cannot be cut across It is necessary to wind writing paper around the shank as in the leg provided you wish to handle it The lower side of the shoulder has two cuts abounding in gravy The part in the direction i k is lean the other g h is very fat Illustration four Knuckle of Veal Illustration A knuckle of veal cuts in neat slices only in one direction viz from a to b The line d c divides two bones which it is necessary to separate in order to get at the best marrowy fat portion also cut asunder the knuckle bones five Roasted Breast of Veal Illustration Cut to the left on the first line d c then cross from c to the most distant a The lines a d a d c represent the directions in which the brisket or gristly part should be divided d c show the course of the ribs and e is the sweetbread six A Spare Rib Illustration Cut out first a slice from the fleshy portion following the line a b This will give a due proportion of fat and lean After this part is taken away the bone lying in the direction d b c should be separated breaking it off at the joint c seven Saddle of Mutton Illustration Cut long thin slices from the tail to the end viz from a to b beginning close to the back bone If a large joint the slice may be divided Cut some fat from the sides eight Pig Illustration The cook usually divides the body before it is sent to the table and garnishes the dish with the jaws and ears The first thing is to separate the shoulder from the carcass on one side and then the leg according to the direction given by the dotted line a b c The ribs are then to be divided into about two helpings and an ear or jaw presented with them and plenty of sauce The joints may either be divided into two each or pieces may be cut from them The ribs are reckoned the finest part but some people prefer the neck and between the shoulders nine Half a Calf s Head boiled Illustration Be careful and get a young one as they look much handsomer served up and besides are more tender First cut in the direction c b The throat bread is considered the choicest part it lies in the fleshy portion near the termination of the jaw bone and the line c d shows the direction to cut into it On the under part of the lower jaw there is some very nice meat and about the ear g some fat rather gristly but highly esteemed The part near the neck is very inferior Sometimes the bone in the line f e is cut off but this is a coarse part The sweet tooth is quite a delicacy it lies back of all the rest and in a young calf is easily extracted with the knife Many like the eye which you must cut out with the point of your knife and divide in two Under the head is the palate which is reckoned a nicety ten Leg of Mutton Illustration A leg of wether mutton which is best flavored may be known at the market by a round lump of fat at the edge of the broadest part a little above the letter a The best part is midway between the knuckle and farther end Begin to help there by cutting thin slices to b If the outside is not fat enough help some from the side at the broad end in slices from e to f This part is most juicy but many prefer the knuckle which in fine mutton will be very tender though dry There are very fine slices in the back of the leg turn it up and cut the broad end not in the direction you did the other side but lengthwise To cut out the cramp bone take hold of the shank which should be previously wound round with half a sheet of fool s cap paper with your left hand and cut down to the thigh bone at g then pass the knife under the cramp bone in the direction g d eleven Ham Illustration Ham may be cut three ways the common method is to begin in the middle by long slices from b to c from the centre through the thick fat This brings to the prime at first which is likewise accomplished by cutting a small round hole on the top of the ham as at a and with a sharp knife enlarging that by cutting successive thin circles this preserves the gravy and keeps the meat moist The last and most saving way is to begin at the hock end which many are most fond of and proceed onward Ham that is used for pies c should be cut from the under side twelve Fore Quarter of Lamb Illustration Separate the shoulder from the breast and ribs by passing the knife under in the direction of a b c and d Be careful to keep it towards you horizontally to prevent cutting the meat too much off the bones If grass lamb the shoulder being large put it into a another dish Squeeze the juice of half a Seville orange or lemon on the other part and sprinkle a little salt and pepper then separate the gristly part from the ribs in the line e c and help either from that or from the ribs as may be chosen thirteen Haunch of Venison Illustration First cut it down to the bone in the line d c a then turn the dish with the end a towards you put in the point of the knife at c and cut it down as deep as you can in the direction c b Thus cut you may take out as many slices as you please on the right or left As the fat lies deeper on the left between b and a to those who are fond of fat as most venison eaters are the best flavored and fattest slices will be found on the left of the line c b supposing the end a turned towards you Slices of venison should not be cut too thick nor too thin and plenty of gravy given with them fourteen Round of Beef This is cut in the same way as a fillet of veal It should be kept even all over When helping the fat be careful not to hack it but cut it smooth A deep slice should be taken off before you begin to help as directed in the edge bone fifteen Brisket of Beef This must be cut lengthwise quite down to the bone after separating the outside or first slice which must be cut pretty thick sixteen Leg of Pork This joint is sent to the table whether boiled or roasted as a leg of mutton roasted and cut up in the same manner The close firm flesh about the knuckle is by many reckoned best seventeen Haunch of Mutton This is formed by the leg and part of the loin cut so as to resemble a haunch of venison and is to be helped at table in the same manner eighteen Goose Illustration Turn the neck end of the goose towards you and cut the whole breast in slices on each side of the bird but only remove them as you help each person unless the company is so large as to require the legs likewise Turn the goose on one side and then take off the leg by putting the fork into the small end of the leg bone pressing it close to the body and having passed the knife in the line e d turn the leg back and if a young bird it will easily separate To take off the wing put your fork into the small end of the pinion and press it close to the body then put in the knife at c and divide the joint taking it down in the direction c d Nothing but practice will enable people to hit the joint exactly at the first trial When the leg and wing of one side are done go on to the other cut off the apron in the line f e g then take off the merry thought in the line o i The neck bones are next to be separated as in a fowl and all other parts divided the same nineteen A Fowl Illustration A boiled fowl s legs are bent inwards but before it is served the skewers are to be removed Lay the fowl on your plate and place the joints as cut off on the dish Take the wing off in the direction of a to b in the annexed engraving only dividing the joint with your knife and then with your fork lift up the pinion and draw the wings towards the legs and the muscles will separate in a more complete form than if cut Slip the knife between the leg and body and cut to the bone then with the fork turn the leg back and if the bird is not old the joint will give way When the four quarters are thus removed take off the merry thought from a and the neck bones these last by putting in the knife at c and pressing it under the long broad part of the bone in the line c b then lift it up and break it off from the part that sticks to the breast The next thing is to divide the breast from the carcass by cutting through the tender ribs close to the breast quite down to the end of the fowl lay the back up put your knife into the bone half way from the neck to the rump and on raising the lower part it will readily separate Turn the neck towards you and very neatly take off the two sidesmen and the whole will be done As each part is taken off it should be turned neatly on the dish and care should be taken that what is left should go properly from the table The breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts but the legs are most juicy in young fowls After all more advantage will be gained by observing those who carve well and a little practice than by any written directions whatever twenty Partridge This bird is cut up in the same way as a fowl The best parts are the wings breast and merry thought but the bird being small the two latter are not often divided The wing is considered the best and the tip is reckoned the most delicate morsel of the whole twenty one Pigeons Pigeons are considered very fine eating It is usual to cut them in half either from top to bottom or across The lower part is generally thought best twenty two Turkey Fix your fork firmly in the lower part of the breast so as to have full command of the turkey Slice down on each side of the centre of the breast two or three lines lengthwise with the body then take off the leg on one side holding the knife in a sloping direction the point turned towards the end of the body This done cut off the wing on the same side in a line nearly parallel with the length of the turkey When you have thus separated the wings and legs take off from the breast bone the parts you before sliced down Be very attentive in separating the wing not to cut too near the neck or you will find yourself interrupted by the neck bone from which the wing must be taken twenty three Cod s Head Illustration Fish in general requires very little carving the fleshy parts being those principally esteemed A cod s head and shoulders when in season and properly boiled is a very genteel and handsome dish When cut it should be done with a fish trowel the parts about the back bone or the shoulders are by far the firmest and best Take off a piece quite down to the bone in the direction a b c d putting in the spoon at a c and with each slice of the fish give a piece of the round which lies underneath the back bone and lines it the meat of which is thin and a little darker colored than the body of the fish itself This may be got by passing a spoon under it in the direction d f About the head are many delicate parts and a great deal of the jelly kind The jelly part lies about the jaw bone and the firm parts within the head Some are fond of the palate and others the tongue which likewise may be got by putting a spoon into the mouth Transcriber s Note The following typographical errors were corrected Page Error five PICKLES changed to PICKLES seven
