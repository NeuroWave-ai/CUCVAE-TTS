none	none	 otherwise frequently they would not only clash with reason and experience 
243-12956-0001	train-other-500	but interfere thwart and supplant one another Issac Barrow The very essence of an aphorism is that slight exaggeration which makes it more biting whilst less rigidly accurate Leslie Stephen

243-12956-0003	train-other-500	But this is a thorny subject Suffice it to say that all men love all girls the maid of sweet sixteen equally with the maid of untold age There is something exasperatingly something or otherish about girls And they know it
243-12956-0004	train-other-500	which makes them more something or otherish still there is no other word for it A girl is a complicated thing It is made up of clothes smiles a pompadour things of which space and prudence forbid the enumeration here
243-12956-0005	train-other-500	These things by themselves do not constitute a girl which is obvious nor is any one girl without these things which is not too obvious Where the things end and the girl begins many men have tried to find out
243-12956-0006	train-other-500	Many girls would like to be men except on occasions At least so they say but perhaps this is just a part of their something or otherishness Why they should want to be men men cannot conceive Men pale before them
none	none	 grow hot and cold before them 
243-12956-0007	train-other-500	run before them and after them swear by them and at them and a bit of a chit of a thing in short skirts and lisle thread stockings will twist able bodied males round her little finger It is an open secret that girls are fonder of men
243-12956-0008	train-other-500	than they are of one another which is very lucky for the men Girls differ and the same girl is different at different times When she is by herself she is one thing When she is with other girls she is another thing When she is with a lot of men
243-12956-0009	train-other-500	she is a third sort of thing When she is with a man But this baffled even Agur the son of Jakeh As a rule a man prefers a girl by herself This is natural
243-12956-0010	train-other-500	And yet is said that you cannot have too much of a good thing If this were true a bevy of girls would be the height of happiness Yet some men would sooner face the bulls of Bashan Some foolish men probably poets
243-12956-0011	train-other-500	have sought for and asserted the existence of the ideal girl This is sheer nonsense there is no such thing And if there were she could not compare with the real girl
none	none	 the girl of flesh and blood which 
243-12956-0012	train-other-500	as some one ought to have said are excellent things in woman Other men equally foolish have regarded girls as playthings I wish these men had tried to play with them They would have found that they were playing with fire and brimstone
none	none	 Yet the veriest spit fire can be wondrous sweet Sweet Yes On the whole a girl is the sweetest thing known or knowable On the six whole of this terrestrial sphere Nature has produced nothing more adorable 
243-12956-0013	train-other-500	than the high spirited high bred girl Of this she is quite aware to our cost I speak as a man The consequence is her price has gone up and man has to pay high and pay all sorts of things
243-12956-0014	train-other-500	ices sweets champagne drives church goings and sometimes spot cash Men are always wishing they knew all about girls It is a precious good thing that they don t
243-12956-0015	train-other-500	Not that this is in any way disparaging to the girls The fact is A girl is an infinite puzzle and it is this puzzle that among other things
none	none	 tickles the men and rouses their curiosity 
243-12956-0016	train-other-500	What a man doesn t know about a girl would fill a Saratoga trunk
none	none	 what her does know about her 
243-12956-0017	train-other-500	would go into her work box The littlest girl is a little women No boy knows this and precious few grown up men Thus Many a grown up man plays with a girl then finds himself in love with her As to the girl
243-12956-0018	train-other-500	Always the girl knows whether the play is leading she probably chooses the game Very late in life does a man learn the truth and significance of that ancient proverb that Kissing goes by Favour For
243-12956-0019	train-other-500	The masculine mind is the slave of Law and Justice Aphrodite never heard of Law or Justice she was born at sea That is to say Few are the men who at some time in their lives have not wondered at the vagaries
none	none	 of girlish complaisance the foolish the ne er do well the bully the careless the cruel it is to these often that a girls caress is given And Curiously enough that is curiously enough as it seems to purblind law loving man 
243-12956-0020	train-other-500	should the favored one be openly convicted that alters not one whit his statue with the girl for A girl having given her heart never recalls it not wholly she may regret she never recoils In other words
243-12956-0021	train-other-500	To the man of her own free lawless choice a girl is always loyal to subsequent and subordinate attachments she is dutiful So Even the renegade if loved by a girl will be upheld by that girl through thick and thin
243-12956-0022	train-other-500	secretly it may be for often the girl nevertheless devotedly and only under compulsion will he listen to the detractor he may desert her or if he sticks to her he may beat her no matter he holds her heart
243-12956-0023	train-other-500	in the hollow of his hand But But Few things mystify poor law abiding man than this that the central the profoundest the most portentous puzzle of the universe the weal of woe of two high aspiring
243-12956-0024	train-other-500	much enduring youthful human souls should be the sport of what seems to him
none	none	 the veriest and merest chance The unconscious search of sweet sixteen is for 
243-12956-0025	train-other-500	in mathematical language which will not sophisticate her the integral of love Yet In the short years between sixteen and twenty a girl s love will undergo rapid and startling developments
none	none	 A girl with lots of brothers has more chances of matrimony 
243-12956-0026	train-other-500	than a girl with none she knows more of men especially of their weaknesses and idiosyncrasies And To know the weaknesses and idiosyncrasies of men is perhaps a wife s chief task unless it be to put up with them
243-12956-0027	train-other-500	Often enough the freckled and fringrant girl wins over the professional beauty Sometimes grown up girls are just as shy as little ones and for the same reasons because there is no one who knows how to play with them Girls often play with love
243-12956-0028	train-other-500	as if it were one of the amusements of life but a day comes when love proves itself the most sensuous thing on earth And A girl is quick to discover the kind of love that is required of her As a rule Many a girl who has been sore put to it
243-12956-0029	train-other-500	to prove herself whole hearted For of course Always every suitor expects whole heartedness And this every girl instinctively knows Indeed Is not a half hearted love or a half hearted acceptress of love a contradiction in terms
243-12956-0030	train-other-500	A certain measure of the sophisticated or unsophistication of a youthful damsel may be found
none	none	 in her manner o f receiving the attentions of a stranger in a station different from her own 
243-12956-0031	train-other-500	Young women themselves but rarely unsophisticated view with a certain pitying sort of curiosity unsophisticatedness in men And A young man s unsophisticatedeness it is a great delight to a woman to eradicate Yet
243-12956-0032	train-other-500	A girl regards with complex emotions the man who has blossomed under the genial warmth of her rays the flattery to own powers is counterbalanced by the evidence of lack of power in him A girl thinks she detects flippancy in seriousness
243-12956-0033	train-other-500	A woman thinks she detects seriousness in flippancy What would be conduct decidedly risque in a city miss is often innocent playfulness in a country maid
none	none	 Between the ages of sixteen and eighteen 
243-12956-0034	train-other-500	girls play with love as if it were a doll very soon after twenty they discover it is a dynamo
none	none	 This is why An early and clandestine engagement 
243-12956-0035	train-other-500	often works more havoc than happiness For Either one of the parties to the concealed compact receives or pays attention which perturb the other or a subsequent and acknowledged lover looks askance at the previous entanglement
243-12956-0036	train-other-500	Since even if A clandestine engagement as is usually the case is merely a flirtation with the emoluments
none	none	 which accompany a promise to marry those emoluments 
243-12956-0037	train-other-500	are not nice things for a subsequent and avowed lover whether masculine or feminine to think upon Lastly A laxity with regard to the claims of courtship is apt to breed a laxity with regard to the claims of wedlock In short
243-12956-0038	train-other-500	Flirtations like clandestine engagements are an affront to love
none	none	 Accordingly To the engagement ring 
243-12956-0039	train-other-500	should be as attached as much importance as to the wedding ring Indeed
none	none	 A difficult and a delicate path it is that a girl has to tread through life 
243-12956-0040	train-other-500	and often enough a dangerous Yet with extraordinary deftness she treads it She must win her a mate
none	none	 yet has to pretend that the mate wins her 
243-12956-0041	train-other-500	She makes believe to be captured
none	none	 yet has herself to be intent on the chase 
243-12956-0042	train-other-500	To be wooed and wedded is the law of her being yet not for one moment dares she to exhibit too great an alacrity to obey that law for she knows instinctively that an easy victory prognosticates a fickle victor
243-12956-0043	train-other-500	Is she abundantly endowed with the very attributes that make for wife and mother hood a strong and swaying passion and an affection unbounded she must hold them in leash with exemplary patience for alas
243-12956-0044	train-other-500	Are they given the rein for a single passing moment instead of being accounted unto her for righteousness they work her ruin She must win her one man and she must win him for life but she cannot pick or choose for she must wait to be asked
243-12956-0045	train-other-500	If she make test of many admirers she is described as a flirt if conscientious and demure she await her fate a desirable fate is by no means assured In truth it seems that too often a girl must dissemble
243-12956-0046	train-other-500	hateful as dissemblance in men T is a hard road indeed that a girl has to travel To win her a fellow farer for life she must go out of her way to accommodate so many travelers and this one is lured by this and that one by that
243-12956-0047	train-other-500	and another by something unnoticed by the throng But an she dissembles one iota too much her fellow farers look askance and he who eventually joins her for good upbraids her for that by which she won
none	none	 Dissemblance is indeed at once the boon and the bane of a girl without it she thinks to be overlooked 
243-12956-0048	train-other-500	often enough a preposterous assumption with it she is looked upon too much And always Always a girl has to pretend that never did she descend to dissemblance
none	none	 Which nevertheless is sometimes absolutely true for Just now and then there happens that miracle of miracles where their flames up in the man and their flames up in the maid in both at once unaided and unlooked for that divine and supra mundane spark which smolders lambent in every youthful breast when maid and man take mutual fire at touch of hands and look of eyes fire lit at that vestal altar which knows no source and burns for aye II On Men Duskolon esti to thremma anthropus Plato For man the over grown boy life has commonly two and only two sides work and play Happy he who has for a helpmate one who possesses the faculty of increasing a zeal for the first and of adding a zest to the second Wherein O woman thou mayest happily find the two fold secret of thy life work For Man is a greedy animal he wants all or nothing And fortunately for him Women tacitly extol man s greed they will not be shared any more than they will share There is something canine in the masculine nature like a dog over a bone it snarls at the very approach of a rival It is curious but it is true that proud man becomes prouder and more curious still at the same time humbler when weak woman gives him something a look a smile a locket her hair a kiss herself The greater a man s faith in himself the greater his mistress hers in him And perhaps the greater his mistress her faith in a man the greater his in himself For A woman s faith in a man works wonders A man to whom a woman cannot look up she cannot love Yet It is marvelous how a woman contrives to find something to look up to in a man Many men forget the artistic tendency of the feminine temperament a tendency which shows itself in many ways their love of pretty things of pretty ways and of pretty words From which three alone we may deduce the rule that When with the woman he admires and whose admiration he seeks a man cannot be too careful of his dress his speech and his manners A believer in Woman is a believer in Good And vice versa and mutatis mutandis Man s standard of value of a woman is usually determined by the scale of his own emotions That is to say The pedestal upon which a man places a woman a man always puts a woman upon a pedestal is a pedestal erected solely by the effect upon himself of her charms A man may boast himself invincible by men never by woman The lady killer is always an object of attraction to ladies even to those whom he makes no attempt to slay It may perhaps be a thing as unreasonable as certainly it is indisputable that however much wild oats a man may himself sow he invariably entertains a very peculiar objection to any woman near or dear to him entering upon this particular branch of agriculture He is a fool who does not bear himself before his lady love as a prince among men Some men are so gallant that they will never be outdone by the woman who encourages them But it often leads to strange embarrassments and entanglements Few things terrify a man more than the knowledge of a woman s ability to make her emotions when if ever he arrives at it That is a very silly man who thing she can play one woman off against another For In matters of emotional finesse the masculine instance is nowhere it is blinded befogged befooled at every turn Heaven help the man who is dragged into a quarrel between two wrathful ladies Three things there be nay four which man can never be sure how a greatsoever his acumen his astuteness or his zeal a woman a race horse a patent and the money market They defy both faith and fate they should be the recreations not the resources of life and he is a fool who stakes more than a portion of his substance on any one of them What a paltry thing after all is man man uncomplemented by woman Left to himself he stagnates linked with a woman he rises or sinks A gentle touch stimulates him a confiding heart makes of him a new creature Under the rays of feminine sympathy he expands who else would remain inert Fame may allure him friends encourage him fortune cause him a momentary smile but only woman makes him and fame friends fortune all are naught if there be not at his side a sharer of his weal A man will strive for fortune strip himself for friends scour the earth for fame but were there no woman in the world to be won not one of these things would he do III On Women Ehret die Fanen Schiller From woman who e re she be there seems to emanate a potency ineffable to man impalpable invisible divine It lies not in beauty or grace not even in manner or mein and it requires neither wiles nor artifice It is not the growth of long and intimate acquaintance for often it acts spontaneously and at once and neither the woman who possesses it nor the man who succumbs to it can give it a name For to say that it consists in the effluence or influence of personality or temperament of affinity or passion of sympathy or charm is to say nothing save that we know not what it is All unknown to herself it wraps its owner round with airs the which to breathe uplifts the spirit and yet may be perturbs the heart of man Even its effects are recondite and obscure It allures but how it allures now man shall tell It impels but to what does not appear It rouses all manner of hopes stirs sleeping ambition and desires and aspirations unappeasable but for what purport or to what end none stays to inquire It incites sometimes it enthralls It innervates it exhaults Under its spell reason is flung to the winds and matters of great mundane moment are trivial and of no account for it bewilders the wit and snatches the judgment of sane and rational men It is most powerful in youth it is most powerful upon youth yet some retain it till far on in years and no age but feels its sway a veiled and mysterious force sometimes daemonical often divine at once the delight and the despair of man After all The man who declares he understands women declares his folly For If woman were not such a mystery she would not be such an attraction For again What is known is ignored But woman need have no cause for apprehension Besides Men may be classified women never This is why Generalizing in the case of women is useless since Woman is a species of which every woman is a variety And every man must make up his mind to this that Every woman is a study in herself However If women were comprehensible to men men and women would be friends not lovers But the race is safe The simple fact is that Womanliness is the supreme attraction in however fair or however frail a personality it is embodied And The sacred function of all womanhood is to kindle in man the divine spark by means thirty of the mystic flame that burns ever in the vestal breast Every true woman s orbit is determined by two forces Love and Duty Which is another way of saying that Women like the lark are true to the kindred points of heaven and home But It is only when the two foci are coincident and identical that her orbit becomes the perfect circle and her home becomes her heaven A woman s heart is an unfathomable ocean nothing ever filled it no one ever plumbed it At the surface are glancing waves or flying spume or it may be raging billows beneath are silent depths invisible to man A thousand streams flow into it in vain Towards varying coast lines it bears itself variously here placid and content there dashing furious But none ever stamped his marked upon its brim and always it remains the refluent reluctant sea Of it man knows only the waves that break or ripple at his feet It betrays no thirty one secrets it asks not to be understood Storm and calm but stir or still its surface and what things it hides forever engulfed no one may learn Subtle yet mighty an eternal and entrancing mystery to man A man s heart is the enclosing shore measurable impressionable definite and overt thinking to house that sea shaping it over looking it and staying and governing its tides Yet changed by it crumbling before it yielding to it at once its guardian and its slave Yet perhaps The placidest of seas is that which is wholly land locked Women apparently were made for men men for themselves Certainly Men seem to carry out this design of Nature that they should be ministered to by women A woman asks a woman questions in order to discover something She asks a man questions in order to discover the man he last thing that a woman will risk is her personal appearance Which is saying a good deal for A woman will risk an interview at an unseasonable hour but not in an unseasonable frock Never never take a woman au pied de la letter Women s rights are to be loved Women s duties are to love There is always something sovereign and monarchial about a woman like a queen s her wishes are her commands And In matrimony woman s sovereignty is not abdicated By no means it is only transformed from an absolute into a constitutional monarch she acts then by and with the advice of her First Lord This is the ideal State Woman s true function as a citizen in this world is to spur men on to high and noble action And this quite unconsciously she does Woman s true function as a woman in the world is to evoke man s most fervid emotions and at the same time to keep them at their highest level And this she also does perhaps not quite so unconsciously They err who call women illogical Feminine logic is inexorable But it proceeds per saltum It is man who has laboriously to reason step by step The most wayward woman craves control To let a woman have her own way is interpreted by her as indifference And The surest way to fail to please a woman is to let her do what she pleases Woman is born to acting as the sparks fly upward And What a woman really is nobody knows least of all herself To see a woman as she really is one must see her with her babe For It is curious but it is true that not even before the passionate and accepted lover to whom she has utterly devoted herself can a woman bare her heart as can she to her babe Perhaps we may go so far as to say that Motherhood always partially eclipses wife hood When the child comes the man stands aside For It is not within the capability of man to evoke or to develop the totality of woman There are feminine potentialities he is powerless to awake There is a portion of womanliness always hidden from him To her babe alone she opens the innermost recesses of her soul For him she wears no masks affect no accent plays no part Even her features take on a different and unique expression before the offspring of her womb Never is she more womanly never so strong never so quite never so self contained never so completely herself and never so beautify when bending over her helpless infant son And naturally for say what one will Motherhood is the goal of womanhood And Howsoever she comes by it a woman s burthen is always to her That Holy Thing So No one knows what a woman is like till she is a mother In other words Motherhood reveals womanhood And be it remembered There be childless women both spinsters and wives who could mother mankind in their bosoms Such women wield great influence For Many a mere man there is has owed his all to a motherly woman Nor speech not restore nor expression of feature nor all combined will ever reveal the real feelings of a woman To unbosom herself is impossible to woman Do not expect it for Definite and accurate utterance is not given to woman The chief business of woman is first to get married second to get others married It is difficult to say which have played the greater havoc among men the women with too much conscience or the woman with none When a woman repulses beware When a woman beckons be warier Woman are always prepared for emergencies With woman tact and jealousy rarely go hand in hand tact and spite never The only instance in which a woman s tact is apt to be at fault is in detraction of a woman whom she regards as her rival The instance in which a woman s tact is seen as its best is in deploying the men who she knows are rivals for her hand And usually When a woman has more than one admirer she not only deploys them but tries to make them advance en echelon For Few things disconcert a woman more than a multiple and simultaneous attack delivered front a front But The way in which a woman will maneuver her attackers is marvelous They say a woman cannot argue Hear her explain an indiscretion An independent woman is a contradiction in terms For Woman s chief want is to feel that she is wanted Therefore it is that With women cruelty is more easily borne than coldness Indeed It is astonishing how much downright cruelty a woman will stand from the man she loves or has loved On the other hand Melancholy also attracts women Naturally Women are made to soothe to pity to comfort to delight Therefore it is that To see a strong man in a weak woman s arms is a sight which should arouse not our laughter but our one envy So it does one Common Gender Let not the simpleton think a woman will sympathize with his simplicity No woman is a simpleton What women admire is a subtle combination of forcefulness and gentleness If a woman has to choose between forcefulness and gentleness always she will sacrifice the latter And It is astonishing to what lengths forcefulness can go without endangering a woman s admiration If it sweeps her off her feet well In nothing does a woman so clearly exhibit the inherent femininity of her nature as in the delight with which at the bottom of her heart she recalls moments when she has been swept off her feet She may sigh over them but Generally a woman s sighs are by no means those of remorse A woman never brings pure reason to bear upon her actions she acts by sentiment forty and she judges her acts by sentiment This is why Even when a woman has deceived and betrayed she does not regard herself culpable Always she says to herself she was driven to it and therefore she is blameless Accordingly A penitent woman is rare Even when a man with his so called superior reason thinks he has proved her wrong at the bottom of her heart she knows herself right Many have been the discussions as to woman s most powerful weapon The simple fact is she is armed cap a pie two Indeed Every woman is a sort of feminine Proteus not only in the myriad shapes she assumes but also in her amenability to nothing but superior force Women form perhaps where men are concerned the single exception to the rule that in union there is strength One woman often enough is irrepressible two be the second her own mother break the charm an association of women is the feeblest of forces two Cf Cowper They are all women and they dart Like Porcupines from every part Anacreontics All women are rivals And this they never forget Consequently Mistrust a truce between hostile ladies Amongst women modesty is of infinitely more potent influence than is ability Yet To a woman s modesty ability is a wonderfully enhancing setting And Modesty is the most complex and the most varied of emotions Perhaps When modesty and frailty go hand in hand there is no more delectable combination known to men and Aphrodite has not the subtle charm of a Cynthia Perhaps this is why such A wondrous halo of romance hangs about the name of a Heloise of a Marguerite of a Marianna Alcoforado of a Concetta of Afragola of a Catalina of Robert le Diable s Helena of Isolde of Lucia of Bologna the enchantress of Ottaviano of Francesca of Guenevere of the sweet seventeen year old novice of Andouillets Margarita the fille who was rosy as the morn of the Beguine who nursed Captain Shandy of the fille de chamber who walked along the Quai de Conti with Yorick of Ameilia Viviani the inspirer of Shelly s most ecstatic lyric of Dryden s masque loving Lucretia For after all Is the star any the less starry to the rapt star gazer when he finds it to be a tremulous planet Cynthia may have blushed in heaven bit did the blush make her any less lovely to the Latmian Only in the clear and unclouded pool is the star undimmed embosomed They say a woman is capricious But the consistency of woman s capriciousness is only exceeded by the capriciousness of man s consistency Man calls woman capricious simply because he is too stupid to comprehend the laws by which she is swayed Woman does not call man capricious The inference is obvious To women the profoundest mysteries of the universe give place to two things a lover and a baby But perhaps these are the profoundest mysteries of the universe How many women there be who deeming themselves fitted to be the consorts of kings yet comport themselves dutifully as the wives of wastrels And indeed Given beauty cleverness and grace forty four there is no position to which a woman could not aspire for Being Woman she is ex officio Queen Speak to a woman disparagingly of her sex she is up in arms Speak to her disparagingly of a member of her sex well she will not be up in arms The reason for her bellicosity in the former case is the fact that A woman always interprets abstract disparagement of her sex personally And she is perfectly right It is not only the woman who cannot be accounted quite as stainless as the stars that sometimes trade on their charms When a strong souled woman wholly and unreservedly loves her love will go to lengths passing the comprehension of man For Women prefer an despot to a dependent It is marvelous to what a pitch of demureness features by nature that the most coquettish can be set A Man s features are often a clue to his character a woman s rarely So it comes about that The owner of a seraphic face is often owner of a temper satanic Nevertheless Often enough a spice of diablerie in a woman at once enhances all her charms It is indeed fortunate for the men that so many women are unaware of the power of their charms A woman would much rather you lied to her concerning herself than that you told her something unpleasant to hear Some women seem to be envious of some men s familiarity with immorality It is by woman that a woman will be first suspected and it is by a woman she will be last forgiven The last thing a woman will ask you for is your esteem And yet Cast a slur upon a woman s character and you are considered indiscreet Cast a slur upon a woman s personal appearance and you are considered culpable Fashion is a woman s sole law And The surest evidence of strong mindedness in woman is to fly in the fact of fashion Ridicule is woman s keenest weapon it is the poisoned arrow in her quiver Well is it for the men that she never or so rarely has recourse to it A woman is quick to discern the quality of the admiration bestowed upon her No one not even herself knows what a woman will do next Doubtless this is trite But it is true as trite Yet men rarely find it out till late in life and forget it as soon as found out A woman can say more in a sigh than a man can say in a sermon Nothing piques a woman so much as indifference to her favors Indifference to her undiscovered passion she quite otherwise regards The woman knows the male heart probably better than does it itself She knows above all things that to hold that heart she must never wholly satisfy it And many and multiform and marvelous are the ruses by which she accomplishes that end And yet Women there are who firmly believe that were they to try they could enthrall any man beyond possibility of extrication And forty eight so perhaps they could but the achievement would require as much unscrupulousness as it would seductiveness The seductive and unscrupulous woman is hatred of women Under the gaze of a group of men whom she knows that her brilliancy dazzles a woman like the snow clad hearth sparkles Under the gaze of a man by whom she knows she is passionately desired like the same earth under the lordly sun she melts All women think they can cozen men few women think they can cozen women The women who perturb men most are those who combine too effectively adorableness with desirableness As in nature so in humanity flight on the part of the lady is not always symbol of unwillingness of pursuit On the other hand Feminine audacity by no means betokens feminine immodesty Feminine obduracy is invincible by man Luckily it is rare Men call women variable did she not vary men would tire This women instinctively know Women rightly dislike and disgust variability in men For Women like best to be liked to lead gives them but paltry and temporary pleasure Though this they do not always instinctively know or if they do they conceal their knowledge And Variability is incompatible with leadership How delicately a loving woman reproves How defiantly an unloving How many lonely women married and unmarried the world contains only these lonely women know The feminine metier par excellence is to allure And The subtle and elaborate means by which women will devise to intensify the lure passes the comprehension o f men Yet In all ages to make herself attractive was as right and proper for the woman as to make himself feared was for the man Besides With women the art of attracting has long since become second nature Women are quick to recognize a rake For A rake always rouses curiosity never aversion A worsted woman always either silently or volubly calls down a curse upon her successful rival And t is a curse that too often fails Many women handicap other women and they handicap them in multifarious ways Probably the one most frequently used is lavishness of favors The woman who is lavish of favors is hated of her stricter sisters But before these what an air of bravado she wears As a rule women are far better readers of character than are men A woman will often startle a man by her penetrating insight into character And Many a man has been put on his guard by female institution The fragilest woman will be ill content with suppressed embraces And The ablest bodied woman loves being petted Even A prude is a shy coquette The man who judges of a woman by her letters is a fool Her gesture will contain more matter than her journal Besides The woman who could punctuate could reason The debut of a younger sister evokes mixed emotions The prayer uttered or unexpressed of many an undowered young woman is May a moneyed man fall in love with me And she is not always over careful to add And may I fall in love with that moneyed man If the New Woman three turns out to be a fitter companion for men than the old no man will complain of her novelty Yet Men regard the advent of the New Woman rather askance Why Because To judge from certain feminine utterances the New Woman seems more inclined to aim at rivalry than at companionship with man However there need be no fears as to the result since Such is the mysterious potency of womanhood that whether new or old woman will always lead man captive Besides As every new variety of fashion in dress seems becoming to women so it is probable every variety of fashion in manners will become them also But probably The phrase the New Woman is not unlike the phrase the New Chemistry the materials are the same what is new is the nomenclature three A phrase and not much more than a phrase much in vogue in Europe and America in the last two decades of the nineteenth century of the area known as Christian A woman s peccadilloes are generally worse than a man s At all events they are more reprobated Abashment intensifies a woman s love for him so making her abashed And There is a shame that is sweeter than joy As There is a fear more tremulous than delight For Mastery is a woman s standard of man And There is an element of the freest and frankest savagery in the most refined and spiritual of women How otherwise Can any one explain the extraordinary fable of Selene and Pan four And man But that man was ever a savage It may be added that The defenselessness of woman is a conventional fiction she can avert an attack by a look she can terminate a siege by a taunt four Though Browning tried See Dramatic Idyls Pan and Luna Solomon has objurgated the invincibly garrulous woman The invincibly taciturn woman is so rare as to have escaped objurgation Yet she too is a terror to men Every woman is suspicious and jealous of any woman that opens a man s eyes even though she knows that Never was there a woman who could and would deliberately wholly enlighten a man And yet marvelous and curious amongst things curious and marvelous will but a woman fling artifice to the winds and look and act and say as great Nature prompts wildly willfully wantonly that woman will captivate as no feminine wiles will ever captivate If the man were worth it many a woman would dispense with the marriage ceremony For Ah Love love love given love what else is needed Unfortunately Love can never be sure of itself much less of anything else Accordingly The marriage contract is a device on the part of the community to provide for the preservation of the home it makes the parties promise fidelity But Precious few are the men who are worth the risking Unfortunately More women succumb to strength of will than to strength of character Neither in general are women overcurious to enquire whether the strength of character Neither in general are women over curious to enquire whether the strength of the masculine will makes for good or for evil So long as the masculine will overmaster the feminine the feminine mind is satisfied Of course there are exceptions but as a rule Women whether young or old married or single strong minded or weak are never happier than when they can depend on a man Accordingly The lover or the husband who is weaker than and depends upon the woman will some day rue his weakness and dependence And yet To see a strong male at her feet that is exquisite to the woman So exquisite that It is with difficulty that a woman refrains from exhibiting a man s servitude to others On the other hand There is an element of intimidation in a resplendent woman And of this she is aware Hence perhaps her power A woman will attain her ends by adroit finesse where a man would blunder into open hostility And It is well that man should blind his eyes to feminine wiles since Always a woman kindly pretends oblivion of masculine blunders The woman whose tastes and refinements are above her station is in pitiable plight she is too fastidious to espouse the men who would marry her the men she would marry she rarely meets For The only thing that to love is insupportable is vulgarity Since Love romantic love the efflorescence and bloom of life is besmirched unless tenderly touched To generalize passes the wit of woman but in penetration she is preternatural What fascinates a woman is the man who unwittingly attracts her against her will But such a man rouses a combination of emotions comprehensible only by women A woman s answer to an insuperable argument is a look And a most cogent answer it is Indeed Speech is a woman s least effective weapon rarely if ever does she resort to it In the affairs of life as in the affairs of love where men be concerned it is upon her personality that she relies not upon her speech whether written or uttered Her personal appearance is to a woman what his personal honor is to a man it must be immaculate constant with the fashion of the hour and strictly in accordance with her or his status in society Accordingly Dress and demeanor these form the code of feminine ethics Even Deception on the part of a woman is merely diplomacy Women deceive only be cause man is too blind to see That is to say Since man in past ages has never allowed woman either freedom of action or frankness of speech it is not to be expected of her that she should be all at once an adept in their use To her credit be it said that Generally a woman deceives only n order to arouse or to retain the admiration of man For example Many a woman has surreptitiously made love to the man and few are the men who have detected it Why this woman fascinates all who come within the sphere of their influence and that women does not no earthly sage will ever know As well ask what makes one man a Napoleon another a poltroon So too It is impossible for a woman to say I will be loved as it is for a man to say I will be obeyed Perhaps Love and Power are divine miracles At the risk of treading on delicate ground ground off which I shall be hooted by the modern woman I venture to say that The idea that a woman is the property of the man of her choice rail as it as the woman may has not yet been ousted from the feminine mind and heart Indeed So firmly implanted in the feminine breast is the idea of the ownership of her by the man that it is to the man who assumes and exercises ownership that she clings This is why A woman easily changes her allegiance since Allegiance to a woman means loyalty to the man who assumes and exercises ownership over her Let a man who a fractional part of a second evince the shadow of a doubt of his proprietorship at once he undermines a woman s allegiance Consequently It is folly for men to express amazement at the ease with which a woman will transfer herself and her affections A woman will transfer herself bodily over and over again but only because the previous owner lightly esteemed or weakly maintained his ownership As a matter of fact In pristine days woman was naturally and necessarily the property the chattel of the man marriage was not then a matrimonial syndicate of two marriage meant that a woman sought a provider a supporter a defender the man a mate for his delight his comfort and his solace a keeper op is cave or hut a mother and nurse for his heirs And provision support and defense being in pristine days matters of strength prowess or cunning naturally and necessarily pristine man sixty five gained him and kept him a mate by strength prowess or cunning he regarded that mate as his by right of force not as a partner in a compact And The most complicated of modern communities has no whit altered the relationship of man to mate conceal though it may the origin and history of marriage Finally No woman at the bottom of her heart has any objection to being owned Indeed though no woman would say it a man may Every woman at the bottom of her heart delights to be owned and tacitly and secretly seeks the man who she thinks will glory in that ownership and keep his property safe not only from material harms but from temptations to changes of ownership In which last little fact lies a curious truth Women like to be defended against themselves In this little matter men and women differ That any other man should dare for one instant to covet or alienate five that most precious of his possessions his mate nothing rouses to a higher pitch man s unappeasable wrath than this Against the man so daring a woman s wrath is never roused rather she regards him as one having discernment and his daring is a commendable compliment to herself In fine and in short Allegiance to a man on the part of a woman means in her eyes loyalty to him who properly exercises the right of ownership In simple truth A woman gives herself to a man to the man who proves himself worthy the gift she is true And this is why women all women even the New ones love being petted and admired and made much of all their lives this but proves the possession of the gift to be appreciated Besides The male is the dominant animal not necessarily in his cave or his hut by no means but in the stress and struggle of life and women tacitly though never openly look up to and admire this dominance even when exercised over themselves since THIS in turn proves the masterfulness the worth of the man albeit sometimes they rebel against it if carried to far At least Unless a man continues to exhibit his appreciation of the gift by word as well as by deed the woman is apt to imagine that that appreciation is on the wane five How women must laugh in their sleeves at the fact that one man may sue another in a court of law for alienating his wife s affections IV On Love Amore che muove il sole e l altre stelle Dante The beginning middle and end of love is a sigh All things point to the infinite and love more than all things else Complex as is the character of love here are two things which love always does always it Refines the thoughts And heart enlarges Milton and Love dyes all things a cerulean hue What a pity it is not a fast color Love is the most antimonial of emotions it worships yet it will not stop at sacrilege it will build about its object a temple of adoration then desecrate the fane it will give all yet ruthlessly seize everything it delights in pleasing yet it sometimes wittingly wounds its ineffable tenderness often merges into an inclemency extraordinary symbol of universal duality it is at once demonical and angelic Nothing stands still in this world not even love it must grow or it withers And perhaps That is the strongest love which surmounts the greatest number of obstacles Love to some is an intoxicant to others an ailment To all it is a necessity As is one s character so is one s love And Perhaps the deepest love is the quietest Love is as implacable as it is un appeasable Nay more Love is merciless as merciless to its votary as to its victim For Love would slay rather than surrender would for swear rather than forgo Some loves like some fevers render the patient immune at all events to that particular kind of contagion Many lovers are vaccinated in early youth Only love can comprehend and reciprocate love This is why If of two sensitive human souls the one loves passionately and the other not at all the other is unwittingly blind and deaf to love s clamors and claims the one may ardently urge the other but passively yields Only the famished understand the pangs of the hungered Of a great and reciprocated love there is one and only one sign the expression of the eyes Who that has seen it was ever deceived by its counterfeit Did ever the same love light shine in the same eyes twice The light of love in the eyes may take on a thousand forms exultant jubilation a trustful happiness infinite appeasement or promises untold an adoration supreme or a complex oblation tenderness ineffable or heroic resolves implicit faith unquestioning confidence abounding pity unabashed desire He who shall count the stars of heaven shall enumerate the radiances of love There is no Art of Loving one though as Ovid says love must be guided by art two Yet If love did not come by chance it would never come at all one Ovid wrote not Art of Loving Ars Amandi he wrote on the Amatorial Art Ars Amatoria two Arte regendus amor Ars Amatoria I four To each of us himself is the centre of the visible universe But when love comes it alters this Ptolemaic theory Yet It is a significant fact that love which more than any other thing in this world is the great bringer together of hearts begins its mysterious work as a separator and puter at a distance For When love first dawns in the breast of youth it throws about its object a sacred aureole which awes at the same time that it inspires the faithful worshipper Can only two walk abreast in the path of love How many try to widen that strait and narrow way Love raises everything to a higher plane but nothing higher than the man or woman who is loved Is there anything about which love does not shed a halo Indeed Love is a sort of transfiguration And when on the mount we can very truly say It is good for us to be here If there is any sublunary thing equal in value to the true love of a faithful woman it has not yet entered into the heart of man to conceive True love makes all things loveable except perhaps the chaperon Was there ever man or woman yet who was not bettered by a true love True love is ever diffident and fearful of its own venturesomeness three But this not every woman understands Too often the Phantasm of love and not the Verity wins the day four Women who seek a real lover should beware the overbold one three Cf La volupte Nous rend hardis l amour nous rend timides Voltaire La Pucelle Chant vi four See Leopardi Storia del Genere Humano where the Verities of Truth and Love and Justice never leave the throne of Jove but their Phantasms are sent down amongst men To merge the THEE and the ME into one that is ever the attempt of love It is impossible Yet perhaps They are happiest who can longest disbelieve in the impossibility of this amatorial fusion for it may be that such Incredulity is favorable to romance Love is not exactly a sacrifice it is an exchange The lover indeed gives his heart he expects another in return Love is like life no apparatus can manufacture it kill it and nothing in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth will resuscitate it How many a forlorn human wight has tried to resuscitate love To such heights does love exalt the lover that he or she will live for days in the remembered delights of a look a word a gesture But One thing is impossible to love love cannot create love the intensest and most fervent love is powerless to evoke a scintillation of love Love may worship it may adore it may transfigure it may exalt the object of its devotion to the skies but it cannot cause that object to emit one ray of love in return Hate may be concealed love never The greater the imaginative altitude of love the lower the boiling point But Love cannot always be kept at high pressure The young think love is the winning post of life the old know it is a turn in the course Nevertheless it is a fateful turn In love the imagination plays a very large part And this may be variously interpreted Thus By man love is regarded as a sort of sacred religion by woman as her every day morality The former is the more exhilarating but the latter is more serviceable Indeed Love and religion are very near akin both inspire and both elevate And If faith hope and charity are the basis of religion there never was such as religion as love And Love is the only religion in which there have been no heretics Why Because woman are at once its object and its priesthood Love art and religion are but different phases of the same emotion awe reverence worship and sacrifice in the presence of the supreme ideal Love knows no creed Nay more Love acknowledges no deity but itself and accepts no sanctions but its own it is autonomous And yet And yet love sometimes feels constrained to offer a liturgical acquiescence to the rubric of Reason In short Between the prelatical domination of Reason and the recusant Protestantism of Love there has ever been strife Or in plain language There are two codes of ethics one that of the romantic heart the other that of the practical head Who shall assimilate them The heart in its profoundest depths feels that something is due to Reason and Reason in its highest flights feels that something is due to the heart Is there a divine duplicity in the human soul And yet after all All love seeks is love Yet love little knows that In seeking love love enters on an endless search Since Love is an endless effort to realize the Ideal For Love always beckons over insurmountable barriers to uninhabitable realms promises insupportable possibilities lures to an unimaginable goal Yet Love has a myriad counterfeits And Men and women interpret the word differently Even Different women interpret the word love differently Thus To one woman love is as the rising of the sun it shines but once in her whole life day it floods everything with its light it brightens the world it dazzles her To another woman love is as the rising of a star a fresh one may appear every hour of her life and nor she nor her world is one whit affected by its rays Indeed one would hardly err if he said that Many a woman really does not know whether she is in love or not She is sought that she perceives but which of her seekers is worthiest which most zealous which merely takes her fancy and which appeals to her heart on these matters she meditates long to the exasperation of course of the individual seeker Accordingly Men carried away by their own passionate impulse detest calculation of the part of women Since HE stakes his all on impulse in the matter of love says man why should woman stay to consider Foolish man he forgets that A woman always weighs a man s declaration of love and legitimately and naturally perhaps legitimately because naturally for once again What a woman stays to consider in the matter of love is not the potency of the impulse of the moment but the permanent efficacy of the emotion Therefore it is that Woman unwittingly obeys great Nature s laws Many imagine that love is a thing like a chemical element with a fixed symbol eighty four and a rigid atomic equivalent And so it may be but like the philosopher s stone hitherto it has defied detection in its elemental form The fact is probably that Love may be compared to a substance that is never found free and which not only combines in all sorts of relationships with all sorts of substances but also like many another chemical body takes on the most varied forms not only in these relationships but also under varying pressures and temperatures Or perhaps it would be better to say that Love may be compared to a musical note to the unthinking it is a simple sound to the more experienced it is know to consist of endless and complicated harmonical vibrations harmonizing with some and making discord with other notes by regular but unknown laws differing according to the timbre of the emitter reverberating under certain conditions lost to the ear in others and only responding to resonators vibrating synchronously with itself Lastly There is a whole gamut of love Changing that simile we may say that Love is not like the sun a unit and practically the same wherever seen it is like light all pervading universally diffused and reflected and refracted and absorbed in varying degrees and varying manners by various objects And Than a great and pure love can anyone point to anything on earth greater and more purifying The lesser luminary perturbs the tide of human passion the greater light draws it upward none the less veritably because in tinted formless vapor This is symbolical of love It is the nascent thing that evokes the keenest emotions the bud the babe dawn and the first beginnings of love So Love like sun light wears its most tender tints at dawn It still remains a mystery that out of a townful of folk two particular hearts should worry themselves into early graves because this one cannot get that other Yet It is almost enough to destroy one s faith in the uniqueness of love to see from how narrow a circle of acquaintances men and women choose their spouses Were Plato s two half souls separated by the diameter of the globe that were lamentable The man often argues that esteem will grow into passion The woman knows that the argument is utterly fallacious Yet Unless passion is guarded by esteem as the calyx ensheaths the corolla the former is prone to wither In youthful love as in the enfolded bud esteem and passion like calyx and corolla seem one and identical It is only the full blown flower that displays its constituent parts Would that love could remain ever in bud To some love comes like a flash to others as the burning of tinder In all when real love is kindled it devours all that is combustible But All love like all fire needs not only ventilation but replenishing Unless the primal spark is nourished it will not glow Stifle love and it dies down So Even the love of a married pair unless it retains something of the romance of courtship is apt to go out Love takes no though of surroundings an empty compartment is as good as a coppice Give it privacy it is satisfied In love we would much rather give than take Yet if the giving is one sided there is trouble And Love brooks no half measures Again Trust a woman to calculate the breaking strain of her lover s heart But she will never let him off with less than the maximum stress When love is dead it is perhaps best soonest buried In astronomy to determine the motions of three bodies mutually attractive is admittedly difficult It is easy compared with the same problem in love A man s work and a woman s love though to each the sum total of life are often things wholly and totally dissociated Man the egoist thinks that if the woman loves him by consequence she will love his work It may be but usually non sequitur for Few are the women who can understand a man s work For thousands of years man has worked in the hunting field in the market place in the camp for an equal length of time woman has worked by the cradle by the hearth Accordingly Man has two sides to his nature woman but one Man wears one aspect when facing the world he wears quite another aspect when facing women At their work men are rigid frigid austere sever peremptory tyrannical downright With women Humph Wherefore O strenuous and high aspiring man in thy work seek not from woman s love what woman s love cannot give but set thy face ninety as a flint Bethink thee of the fate of Anthony For Man s chief business in the world is Work Woman s chief business in the world is Love Man s love perhaps just because it is his play thing not his business is more finely tempered than is woman s and takes on a finer edge For this very reason it is the more easily turned and is the less useful It is the pocket knife not the lancet that is oftener called into requisition Also Man s love is usually a highly ephemeral affair With a man love is like hunger or thirst he makes a great fuss over it he forgets when it is appeased Yet When passion s trance is overpast it is fortunate if affection takes its place So too In love it is the man who protests and That man is fortunate who after marriage has not some dubious reflections as to whether he has protested over much For In love it is the man generally who makes a fool of himself Love like murder will out But Jill keeps her secret better than Jack For A woman generally controls love a man is controlled by it And Jill s very power of making believe to be fancy free exasperates Jack It is a purely feminine ruse to apply a test to love both her own and that of her lover to prove it true A man would as soon as think of applying a match to a powder magazine to prove it combustible Love in woman s eyes is the supreme and ultimate arbitrator If she is loved love in her eyes will condone anything anything For To prefer honor to love is a maxim to women unknown With them love IS honor And therefore the maxim is meaningless and needless It is a sort of legal or rather charitable fiction that women should surrender only to love In fact Do not even the lightest of Laises and Thaises make a show of being swayed by love And No woman by too much love was ever spoiled Man remember that The logic of the emotions differs from the logic of the intellect As to the senses Alack a day The senses never reason Love sometimes wrecks its barque upon the rocks to prove that they harbor no mirage Love sometimes forgets that it is possible to probe too far Love in pursuit of love sometimes vivisects as unconsciously as a science in pursuit of life Women detect the dawn of love while it is still midnight with a man That is to say A woman knows a man is in love with her long before he is aware of it himself Except perhaps in this once circumstance when she herself is in love with somebody else And this is a highly important circumstance Wholly to satisfy masculine infatuation is given to no woman And perhaps Wholly to satisfy feminine caprice is given to no man So sometimes The last refuge of an unrequited love is the belief that love will create love Nothing can be more futile than such a faith Yet Love without hope has its mitigations but How alleviate the pain of a love that mistook a simulated love for a true one A simulated love is a contradiction in terms Either one loves or one does not that is the conclusion of the whole matter Love would rather suffer than forget Love would give the world to be able to exculpate a languid lover A passionate love is perhaps always poignant Love disdains pity A wounded love carries a scar to the grave In love when honor is lost loss of shame soon follows Then indeed the downward patch becomes precipitous To some love never comes to some it comes too often but the same love never recurs as never a bud opens twice happy he or she is who gains bud blossom and fruit Since The sweetest love is that wherein the odorous flower of passion ripens into the nourishing fruitage of affection But Love requires careful nature And The more exotic the love the more difficult its culture True An orchid may life on air Yes but how torrid and vaporous an air Your sturdy mistletoe thrives on the humble apple a Cattleya requires a Columbian forest Youth wonders at the amatory successes of middle age Youth knows not that In matters amatory age is no handicap A girl in her teens will make love to a gentleman of forty and vice versa In fact The indiscreet impetuosity of youth succumbs before the astuteness of age The bachelor and the spinster both sometimes wonder that the benedick and the bride are still their rivals for they know not that In the amatorial art matrimony is no handicap In short There is no barrier at which love will balk Nay more Love will forgive anything Did love demand it love though it might blush would not blench And Often love itself stands amazed at its own divine audacity Indeed Love loves to immolate itself for love Knowing that To love nothing is common or unclean for Love like charity thinketh no evil But remember that It is only the Uranian Aphrodite five that dares essay a divine audacity Nevertheless Love is the most vulnerable of the emotions and A love doubtful of itself would be cautiously accepted it is not a fact that To try to feel one s own pulse is to make the heart beat irregularly So To try to see in a mirror the love light in one s own eyes is to be dim it So too If passion is not linked with affection woe worth the day when the troth was plighted But given passion linked with affection ah Nothing nothing is criminal to love for love knows not conscience Or rather Love upsets all conventional conditions For Love creates a world of its own a world populated by two and these make their own laws or make none So A woman will imbrue her hands with blood and a man will fling honor to the winds and yet the twain regard each other as impeccant and impeccable Till Pippa passes then Love always awakes to the fact that not even a community of two can live without law and that Though human laws may be outraged those divine may not And assuredly The ideal love is the divine love And in ideal love Strange strange but true in a great and ardent love when at last that is offered which was long sought there supervenes upon the lovers a great tenderness which hesitates to make their own that for which they yearned Almost it were as if A psychic monitor warned the conqueror to be clement and the captive to be kind This Tenderness is the worship of the soul by the soul And Of all tests of love tenderness is the truest But indeed indeed In love there are heights above heights depths beneath depths who shall scale them who shall plumb five See Plato Symposium one hundred eighty et seq V On Lovers Si vis amari ama Seneca Lovers think the world was made for them And so perhaps it was To each other lovers are the most interesting personages alive but onlookers regard them partly with amusement partly with pity partly with compassion in the etymological sense of that word The first wonder of every accepted lover is that he should be the accepted lover of such a woman What the woman thinks what the woman thinks probably not even she herself knows Probably each woman thinks her own thoughts To doubt whether one is in love is to prove oneself out of it To impress upon the lover the still existing necessity of refining gold or painting the lily is out of the question Yet every woman attempts it If there is one proverb more distasteful than another to a hot headed lover it is that half a loaf is better than no bread Children dogs and old people are difficult to deceive Lovers who have to use circumspection should remember this A doubting lover should mark how and for whom his woman dresses To die for a woman would perhaps to a young and ardent lover not be difficult to wage incessant warfare with the world for her that perhaps is not so easy But it is the better test of love and perhaps also the better preserver and replenisher of love For Little as people seem to be aware of it love requires constant replenishing no flame can burn without a feeding oil no pool overflow with out a purling brook Yet The first ecstasies of love often blind both lover and lass to the care necessary for the nurture of love Indeed To many treat love as if it were a passing whim whereas in sober reality it is or should be a lasting emotion Love with woman is like the tides And Few women know the high water mark of their love they are always harboring the belief that it may rise still higher and often they await that rise It is but the reflection of himself in his mistress that many a foolish lover loves That aged spinster is a rare one who does not regret she did not accept one of her lovers But That younger spinster is not to be envied who has to make choice of several Youth glories in the multiplicity of its lovers age sometimes wishes it had had but one The unloved think lad the one thing needful The beloved know that an ocean of love could be swallowed up and the parched soul cry out athirst It is not well either to confide or confess too much A very small rock will wreck a very big ship and a very small slip will spoil a very long life The pain which lovers cause each other through fickleness languidness jealousy and the thousand natural shocks that love is heir to is not altogether pain though at the moment it may seem the most poignant anguish the human soul could suffer One proof of this lies in the fact that There are few who would choose to have missed love s pangs altogether Perhaps the pleasure intermixed with love s pangs arises from the thought that the other is the cause of our suffering For In all love it is the sacrifice of oneself for the other that brings keenest joy And yet There is an element of self love in the very extremest of love Since Love after all is a debtor and creditor affair Who ever loved with no hope of return It is when one of the parties declares him or her self insolvent that the account is closed with many tears and sighs on the part of the chief creditor At all events The intenser the love the more flawless does its object appear For The surest test of the sincerity of love is that it thinketh no evil The surest test of a waning love is that it begins not to content itself when it sees its object suffer The surest test of a dead love is that it forgets how to be jealous The falling out of lovers true is a renewing may be of love one Still it is not to be recommended In fact it might be said that Every falling out of lovers true is a nail in love s coffin Yet A blessing it is that in love we remember the sweet rather than the bitter For Love was ever bitter sweet two one Amanitum irae amoris integratis est Terrence Andria III twenty three two But I supposed innumerable people have said this before No matter The heart of a lover is like that bottom of a well all the beauties of the starry heavens are revealed in it but when it sheds the light of its countenance upon it all else is obliterated Was any lover ever loved enough Or Did any ever hear of a tired lover Nevertheless often Drink to me only with thine eyes says the youthful lover but when the seance is over he goes out and orders beef steak and bottled beer What it really craves the lover s heart is impotent to express Yet it is ever attempting A lover is full of wishes as an egg is full of meat But What it really wishes no lover seems able to say As a matter of fact The endless task which the lover is ever attempting is a search for a formula for the summation of an infinite series of which love is the variable Few lovers seem to understand this To kindle aspiration in her lover a woman herself need not be aspiring For Whatever the talents of a man they are stimulated by contact with woman Since An elevating influence seems to radiate from women we have but to come into the light of their countenances for our own faces to shine as the sun Indeed Physicists may talk as they like but lovers know a more subtle and a more potent force than any yet revealed to them It has not yet been named but for the present it might be called psychicity three three doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes speaks of celebricity See Over the Tea Cup If you wish to ascertain the relationship of a youthful pair watch their eyes For Simulation is difficult to the eye When the idol into which a woman has converted her lover is dethroned she still worships her remembrance of her god and puts together and treasures the broken pieces When the idol into which has converted his loved one is dethroned he generally changes his creed A circumpsecting lover is a woman s abhorrence as a calculating mistress is a man s Let a lover but put himself into the hands of his mistress and he is safe Since The man she really loves a woman will shield through thick and thin through right and wrong For Concerning a man the only question a woman asks is not Is he right or wrong but Is he mine or another s We men therefore Leave a woman to get her lover out of a scrape It is to be feared that the men and women who love but once and forever are not usually to be found outside of romances With women love is a river ever flowing from the brook in girlhood four to the estuary of womanhood Like a river too Woman s love is fed by all the streams it meets On the other hand With man love is a geyser four Standing with reluctant feet Where the brook and river meet Longfellow Maidenhood The languishing lover has gone out of date he has been replaced by the diverting one And the change is significant of much The early nineteenth century maid pretended to ignorance the early twentieth century maid to omniscience The early nineteenth century suitor protested but The early twentieth century suitor has to contest In the one case The woman tacitly acknowledges an inequality In the other case The man has to openly to recognize his equal Nevertheless The fundamental relationship between the sexes do not materially vary from century to century much as conventional manners and customs may For after all Always what a man seeks in a woman is love And In all love there is something perfectly and Paradisiacally pristine Would the most emancipated woman have love otherwise At all events Perhaps the most womanly position a woman can occupy is with her head on her lover s heart At this the strong minded may scoff They may The obsession of the male heart by one woman ousts from it all other women Thus The accepted young man regards all women but the one as he would regard fashion plates To the young woman men continue to be men That is to say A man dives headlong into love A woman paddles into it And the woman s hesitation at the brink of the stream exasperates the spluttering man In short A man s heart is captured wholly and at a stroke A woman s heart surrenders itself piecemeal Whereas with a man a trivial passion is usually an affair more of the senses or of the imagination than of the heart with a woman every passions is an affair of the heart A man when first he is in love is absorbed in the contemplation of the object of his love A woman is similarly situated is capable of making comparisons It gives to woman s curiosity a curious pleasure to compare the methods of men s proposals In love a woman is generally cool enough to calculate pros and cons a man in similar plight is incapable of anything but folly It is a feminine motto that a woman needs to be taught how to love Perhaps she does but most men will think one private tutor ought to suffice and that tutor ought to be he At all events The last schoolmaster would be apt to regard with somewhat mixed feelings the tuition of previous crammers Why go to the trouble of explaining away a first love if the second is no whit its inferior Unless it be to overcome What a second love chiefly deplores is that it was not he or she who first taught his or her loved one to love Is it not true also that It is the first love that amazes that beautifies that consecrates An illicit love beautifies and consecrates nothing A Maud leaves the daisies rosy not so Faustine Many a woman has given her heart to one lover and herself to another The first is always won the second is sometimes extorted Yet It is wonderful how a woman will contrive to make all her lovers believe they are winners It often gives a lady a pleasure to give her lover a pang Not many but have tasted the bitterness of the conflict between the desire of the flesh and the resentment of the spirit Explain these terms who may To attempt by erring to cure an erring lover is to administer not an antidote but an adjuvant It works poison in the blood When and if in a tortuous love a man arrives at a Don t give a damn stage he is not to be classed with the animals known as docile And as to a woman but polite language has its limits Many a man has be exasperated not only by the audacity of his rival but by the equanimity with which his lady love views that audacity He forgets that as a rule Feminine complaisance varies directly as masculine audacity And yet often enough as a simple matter of fact one hundred eighteen Masculine diffidence is vastly more potent than masculine audacity And further Rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident man since Rarely need the complaisance that audacity evokes perturb the diffident man since The true woman may give her fingertips to the gallant she gives herself to the worshiper The pity o it is that The worshiper cannot away with the complaisance that permits a woman to give even her finger tips to the gallant And Few are the women who have plumbed the silent and sensitive depths of the diffidence of her devotee The worst of it is The devotee essays two things he would apotheosize the object of his adoration and place her as a constellation among the stars yet he would have her at the same time terrestrial and tangible When the woman shows herself terrestrial and tangible to others than he the faith of the devotee is shaken In fine Every lover attempts that impossible task the realization of the heavenly ideal Perhaps It is in aphelion that the corona appears most splendid Were perihelion to result is coalescence perhaps the photosphere would be proved composed of terrestrial vapors And if it did as no doubt it would would it be at all bedimmed For to the devout astrologer Nothing nothing will ever destroy beauty and therefore wonder So Bodily beauty where Love is priestess is a daedal spur to the loftiest worship The lover is ever worshipful And Where is worship nothing can be profane So In love there is nor taint nor stain Therefore Make O youthful lover the best and most of youth and love never will either recur VI On Making Love Mille modi Veneris Ovid There are as many ways of making love as there are of making soup And probably There are as many kinds of love as there are of flavors And Palates both sentimental and physical evidently differ widely And yet If you would know the secret of success with women it is said in a word Ardor And Would ye O women know in a word the secret of success with men It lies in Responsiveness In matters amatory or rather pre amatory feminine tactics are infallible and consummate Let no man think to cope with feminine strategy A rake has more chance than a ninny Which doubtless has been said before In love as in all things indecision spells ruination For There is a curious antagonism between the sexes They are in a manner foes not friends The successful wooer is the captor the raptor the bride is the capture the rapture one And Even she who is minded to be caught will not spare her huntsman the ardor of the chase and lightly esteems him who imagines she is to be lightly won In the chess like game of love making no woman plays for check mate the game interests her too much to bring it to a finish What pleases her most is stale mate where though the King cannot be captured the captress can maneuver without end A man imagines he wins by strenuous assault The woman knows the victory was due to surrender one Etymologically as well as metaphorically and veritably Wouldst thou ask ought of a woman Question her eyes they are vastly more voluble than her tongue Indeed There is no question too subtle too delicate too recondite or too rash for human eyes to ask or answer And He who has not learned the language of the eyes has yet to learn the alphabet of love Besides Love speaks two languages one with the lips the other with the eyes There is really a third but this is Pentecostal At all events Lovers always talk in a cryptic tongue There is but one universal language the ocular not Volapuk nor Esperanto is as intelligible or as efficacious as this No woman can be coerced into love though she may be coerced into marriage And Man the clumsy wielder of one blunt weapon often enough stands agape at his own powerlessness before the invulnerable woman of his desire Indeed The battle between the coquettish maid and determined man is like the battle between the Retiarius and the Mirmillio The coquetry ensnares the man as with a net against which his sword is useless A woman s emotions are as practical as a man s reason A man s emotions are never practical This is why In the emotional matter of love men and women so often lash And perhaps It is a beneficial thing for the race that a woman s emotions are practical For If neither the man nor the woman curbed the mettlesome Pegasus Emotion methinks the colts and fillies would want for hay and oats It is a moot question which is the more fatally fascinating the uniformed nurse or the weeded widow But Who has yet discovered the secret springs of fascination For example How is it that certain eyes and lips will enthrall while others leave us cold and inert Does the potency lie in the eyes and the lips or is there some inscrutable and psychic power At all events who will explain how it is that A man will sometimes forsake the most beautiful of wives and a woman will forsake the kindest of husbands to follow recklessly one who admits no comparison with the one forsaken All we can say is that The potency of personality exceeds the potency of beauty For Powerful as is physical charm it counts not for all in the matter of love Yet what it may be that does count and how and why it does count no man living shall say For Is even love aware of all its seeks And Is it given to any to grant all that love beseeches And yet Were all love sought bestowed what sequel Perhaps t were well to leave love but semi satisfied At bottom the real question is this What will win and keep me another heart But How to win and keep another heart that is a thing has to be found out for oneself if it be discoverable And always by the experimental method Since In matters amatory there is no a priori reasoning possible All we know is that There is nothing more potent than passion And The chasm which seems to innocence to yawn between virtue and frailty is leapt by that Pegasus Passion at a bound but he blinds his rider in the feat In spite of the poesy of love deeds are more potent than words though perhaps it is well to pave the way for the one by the other In spite too of the piety of love love laughs at promises that is the promises that affect it There is one miracle that women can always perform and always it astonishes the man it is this to change from the recipient into the appellant That is to say When woman usually regarded as the receiver becomes the giver or rather the demander man s wonderment surpasses words And let it be remembered that There is no re crossing this Rubicon Mistrust a prolonged and obdurate resistance Either you are out classed or you are out experienced And besides Surrender after prolonged resistance rarely is brought about by emotion A woman never really quite detests daring This is why Much is a forgiving a daring man So too Much is forgiven a pretty woman by the men If the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water the beginning of love is as when one kindleth a fire The eye tells more than the tongue And If the eye and the tongue contradict each other believe the eye There is an indifference that attracts and there is an indifference that repels He is a sagacious man and she is a sagacious woman who will differentiate them The question resolves itself into that which so often puzzles the angler how much line to let out About one thing there need be no hesitation When your fish is within reach be quick with the landing net or even with the gaff In the matter of wooing soon enough does the young girl learn to prefer the mature manners of the man of the world to the gaucheries of inexperienced youth As to the man How curious the things that appeal to this lord of creation Man a half averted face a laughing gesture a merry eye an all but imperceptible tone of the voice the scarce felt touch of a reluctant hand a semi tender phrase an unexpected glance the momentary pressure of petulant lips a blanched cheek a look prolonged one fractional part of a second beyond its wont an infinitesimal drooping of the eyelid a speaking silence a half caught sigh these will entrap the male brute where green widths that were never dried will not hold him But By what men are won most women seem thoroughly to comprehend By what women are won few men know Perhaps No woman knows by what she herself is won One thing there is at all events to which woman will always succumb tenderness But remember Dames that Tenderness is extremely difficult of simulation Or rather Tenderness is so delicate and deep seated a feeling that few care to attempt its simulation A woman who gives herself too freely is apt to regret the giving In time too she discovers that as a matter of fact No woman can give her real self twice one or other gift will prove to be a loan And It is always and only the first recipient that causes a woman s heart to flutter and often it flutters long one hundred forty four A second gift is generally a mortgage if it is not a sale A mortgage is difficult to bind For There is a statute of limitations in love as there is in law Nor is the former to be set aside by bond That pair is in a parlous state when either party discovers that the title was not properly searched Since Everybody expects a fee simple though few deserve it God wot Perhaps the most durable conquest is the incomplete one Which sounds illogical But it is well to remember that Repletion seems to cause in the man temporary indifference while Repletion causes in the woman enduring content And in this we can detect a significant distinction between the sexes namely the fact that A single goal satisfies most women No single goal ever yet satisfied the restless spirit of man What gives keenest joy is the evocation of latent passion For Each takes pleasure in believing that he or she alone can evoke this passion Accordingly The premature confession of passion and the confession of premature passion both rankle in the breast and probably in the breast of both penitent and confessor What intensity of feeling a woman can throw into the enunciation of a Christian name There is perhaps no better clue to possession that this For probably Not until a man s Christian mane is ecstatically uttered is a woman wholly his Men and women content with the different weapons This is why Men are rarely intrepid in the presence of women but women rarely stand in awe of men Nothing differentiates the sexes more than this but the psychological reason is difficult to discover Perhaps The making of love is a sort of duel the conditions of which are that the man shall doff all his armor and the woman may don all hers Indeed The battle of love making would be an unequal combat even were both contestants fully panoplied for A woman s derision will pierce any mail In fact No armor is impervious to woman s shafts be they those of laughter or be they those of love So The veriest roue is vulnerable to the veriest maid But For each man she meets a woman carries in her quiver but one shaft If that misses its aim she is powerless it is like a dart without a thong when thrown the man can close But Always it devolves upon the man to take the initiative But again Always the man must pretend that he takes no initiative But again Always the woman must pretend that she gives no opportunity The game of love is not only one of chance but one of skill What irks man is that a woman pretends that she must be circumvented by wiles But Man was ever a clumsy wooer Nevertheless It is only the man who thinks he is too venturesome Since The iciest woman sometimes thaws And The austerer a woman the sweeter her surrender And again A woman is never sweeter than in surrender Accordingly De l audace et encore de l audace et toujours de l audace two should be the motto of every wooer Since Audacity if beloved of women but it must be an audacity born of Sincerity and educated b y Discretion At all events Beware timidity it is fatal two Danton With women nothing is more conquering than conquest nothing so irresistible as resistance On the other hand Resistance on the part of the woman is an effort put forth for the purpose of defeating its own object A man prizes only what he has fought for No one knows this better than a woman This is why A woman s capitulation she always makes to appear as a capture And Where there are no defense works a woman will erect them Foolish that man who does not storm entrenchments For Resistance on the part of a woman is a wall which a man is expected to leap His agility is the measure of her approbation Arouse a woman s interest and you arouse much But Having failed disappear Yet It takes very many futile attempts to make a failure At the same time Importunity is an inferior weapon A conditional surrender is no surrender But A woman s surrender is in reality a desertion a going over to the enemy Thenceforward she is an ally Indeed A woman s capitulation is her conquest Let no amount of simulated austerity deter you The marble Galatea came to life at the prayer of a man The number of modes in which a woman can say Yes has not up to the present be accurately enumerated but perhaps the one most frequently in use is the negative imperative And Many are the men who have puzzled long and painfully over the motives of a woman s No Yet in nine cases out of ten a woman says No merely because she feels herself on the brink of saying Yes In other words It is often mistrust of herself that leads many a woman to refuse it will the lips the consent that is fluttering at her heart Perhaps that is why With woman Yea and Nay are meaningless and interchangeable terms Ware a show of excessive feeling It is proof either that it is shallow and evanescent or that it is put on At all events Excessive feeling is rarely taken seriously Now Seriousness adds a spice to gallantry But like spice a little is ample Many men think it is the woman who has to be persuaded It is not the woman it is her scruples Besides Nemo repente turpissimus vel turpissima Yet By thirty scruples are either dormant or dominant Both of the callow youth of fifteen and the man of the world of forty five swear by the woman of thirty It may seem a paradox but it is a truism that in matters of love it is the weaker and the defenseless sex that takes the initiative In other words The woman makes the opportunity which the man takes And An opportunity missed is an opportunity lost And The woman is implacable to the man who sees the opportunity and takes it not Since With woman indifference is worse than insult Wherefore Never never disappoint a woman Spontaneous admiration is the sincerest flattery Those who know this affect spontaneity But it requires much art to conceal this art You will oftener err upon the side of ultra delicacy in a compliment that upon the side of bare facedness Do not imagine that excessive admiration can give offence But remember that The eye can netter express admiration than can the tongue The publicity with which a woman will receive admiration from a male admirer one hundred forty four often is sufficient to astonish that admirer But Often enough it is the admiration not the admirer that a woman covets Indeed Many a woman is in love with love three but not her lover But this no lover can be got to comprehend To flatter by deprecating a rival is a complement of extremely doubtful efficacy three I seem to remember that somebody before has said something like this before A woman does not admire too clement a conqueror She admits the right to ovation and to him who waives it she lightly regards Seek no stepping stones unless you mean to cross He who gathers stepping stones and refrains from crossing is contempted of women Indeed Every advance of which advantage is not taken is in reality a retreat And remember too that though Sought interviews are sweet those unsought are sweeter And Probably no son of Adam and for the matter of that probably no daughter of Eve ever quite looks back with remorse upon a semi innocent escapade Yet The man who thinks he can at any time extract himself from any feminine entanglement that he may choose to have raveled is a simpleton The way of man with a maid may have been too wonderful for Agur now a days the way of a man with a married woman would puzzle a wiser than he What is the attitude to be maintained towards the too complaisant spouse of an honorable friend That is a problem will puzzle weak men without end Of that fatal and fateful dilemma when a wife or a husband falls victim to the wiles of another there are for the delinquent two and only two horns and it is a moot question upon which it is preferable to be impaled Flight either from the victor or the victrix Yet To some it is no anomaly to pray God s blessing upon a liaison But these folk are to be pitied for A clandestine love always works havoc havoc to all three four four Cf Platus Malus clandestinus est amor damnum saint merum Will men and women never learn what trouble they lay up in store for themselves by breaking their plighted troths VII On Beauty La beaute pour moi c est la divinite visible c est le bonheur palpable c est le ciel descendu sur terre Theophile Gautier Beauty they say is but skin deep That is quite deep enough to enslave mankind As a matter of fact it is much deeper for to say nothing of health and good spirits Beneath true beauty lies an admirable or a loveable character And yet or perhaps and therefore If by some mischance beauty should arouse our resentment with what different eyes we regard it The feeling for beauty is probably more highly developed in man than in woman N B Perhaps this is the source of the beauty of women Nevertheless It is a question that perhaps will never be settled how much value should be placed upon mere beauty For Man soon tires of mere beauty In fact man the inconstant creature soon tires of mere anything Beauty should never be analyzed At sight of graceful neck who speaks of musculus sterno cleido mastoideus at touch of moist red lips who thinks upon the corpuscles of Paccini More women are wooed for their complexions than for their characters Could women only know it nothing can add to their charms how provokingly delightful is the uniformed demureness of an hospital nurse beside the elaborate bedizenments of a woman of fashion The most beautiful thing known among men is a good woman And this is not an anomaly She who captures a man by a single charm be it even beauty holds him by a weak chain Think not it was merely beauty that made Helen or Cleopatra historic Beauty is much and grace is much but there is a charm more subtle and potent than these Beauty without modesty is a rose without perfume the petals may delight but they lack an ineffable savor Like a flower too Though the tangible petals are numbered and comptable the subtle perfume eludes the sense and is inexhaustible For Modesty is the exhalation of the soul at once it enhances as it refines the potency of beauty Nay more The sacrosanct aureole of modesty beautifies all it surrounds though it diviner haze imperfection there is none So Given a redolent balm and the lowliest herb becomes treasured and precious And Each human soul has its own individual essence What folly were the violet to envy the rose Since Beauty is much and grace is much and mien and demeanor and wit but a prepotent and psychic essence there is transcending the power of these And As the suave and subtle essence is not distinct from but springs from the tangible and numerable petals so the spirit perceives that its fleshy vesture is not a thing apart to be donned or doffed at will to b e contemned or left out of regards but indeed at integral and inseparable portion of itself for In the very woof and warp of flesh sprit is immanent and enmeshed Indeed though in a mystic sense Vesture and wearer are mutually one And yet Love ever essays the task of seeking out the psychic wearer beneath the corporeal vesture often with plaintive strife When seeker and sought make a mutual search the starkest strife is condoned But alack The mystic unity of the human soul is never wholly divulged not even to love not even to love VIII On Courtship Un amant fait la court ou s attache son coeur Moliere A woman really in love and sure of her lover delights in toying with a sort of coquetry of love as if it pleased her to try to win over again that the winning of which gave so exquisite a pleasure And perhaps The coquetry of love is the surest test of an unquestionable love For When possession can afford to play at pursuit this but proves possession complete Sometimes An assumed love will resort to the pretty tricks of a real one in order to assure its object or to re assure itself Surrender after a protracted siege has its advantages At all events both M and N can look back to more demi semi happy incidents when the courtship has been long Happy that couple can laugh over the incidents of courtship afterwards T is a portent of impending ill if they cannot Half heartedness in courtship is not only suicidal it is murderous On the other hand remember that In courtship there are various and varying stages But there is always the home gallop Remember too that What is suitable at one stage of courtship is ruinous at another And It is only the old whip who knows when to push the pace In courtship to force the running is hazardous Though we win the victory loses its sweets And In courtship men too often ride on the snaffle in matrimony too often on the curb Courtship asks for cash payment Matrimony has often to allow unlimited credit Insolvency is not unknown In courtship all auxiliaries but the rival No one will impede a lover save another lover In the presence of a woman man is by nature a diffident animal The women who recognize this are often the most successful Indeed Many are the refined and gentle women who in after life regret that they did not more openly cope with their less delicately minded sisters Nevertheless Nothing is more astonishing than a woman s tact in encouraging a man In courtship modulated and musical tones count for much Who with harsh speech would assail a lady s ear No woman thinks she can be wooed too often And Few women can forgo an opportunity to fascinate In courtship the woman is the whole world to the man in matrimony the man is the whole world to the woman In courtship the slightest suspicion of condescension is fatal For True love is a greater leveler than anarchy In courtship the wooer to the wooed is in Juliet s phrase the god of her idolatry in matrimony he is lucky if he is the idol of her deity It is a question which is the sweeter a spontaneous courtship or one that has sprung from friendship In a spontaneous courtship there is all the charm of novelty In a courtship that has grown out of affection there is all the trustfulness of friendship But Friendship and courtship are two totally distinct things In courtship men and women meet on the flowery thorny common of love In friendship men and women invite each other over to their respective plots So A friend will show a friend all over his domain A lover can but point out to the lover the flowers and thorns which grow in the soil to which they are both strangers one hundred sixty two It is an open question whether in matters pre matrimonial the mode of the French is not preferable to that of the Anglo Saxon whether that is Prudence and prevision are not more certain harbingers of matrimonial happiness of matrimonial happiness than are impulse and passion The French couple when wedded are virtually strangers the Anglo Saxon have already together enacted some scenes of the matrimonial drama Yet it is an open question also whether A more durable domestic affection is not built up from the pristine foundation of total ignorance than from that of a partial acquaintanceship The American Elizabeth Patterson before she became Madame Jerome Bonaparte could write I love Jerome Bonaparte and I prefer to be his wife were it only for a day to the happiest union The continentalized Madame Jerome Bonaparte twenty six years after she had ceased to be Miss Elizabeth Patterson could write Do we not know how easily men and women free themselves from the fetters of love and that only the stupid remain caught in these pretended bonds one After all Little do any couple know of each other before marriage Besides Does not a delightful romance envelope the nuptials of strangers At all events even if precaution is a foe to impulse few will be found to deny that Strangeness is by no means inimical to passion Perhaps then Fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts can form a better judgment as to the suitability and adaptability to each other of two young ardent and headstrong boys and girls can these themselves since Fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts know full well that impulse and passion often prove materials too friable for the many storied fabric of marriage At all events The French mode of contracting a marriage precludes the possibility of perilous and precocious affairs of the heart Perhaps The mistake that ardent and headstrong boys and girls make is in thinking that impulse and passion are the keys of Paradise Their Elders know that impulse and passion are sometimes the keys of Purgatory Prudence and prevision are not keys to any supernal or infernal existence they are merely guide books to a terrestrial journey At all events it is significant that which might be added as a lemma Widows rarely choose unwisely one Quoted by C de Varigny in the Revue des Deux Mondes of January the fifteenth eighteen ninety three Over that much bethought of much surmised about thing a proposal of marriage every young woman weaves a pre conceived halo of romance but In nineteen cases out of twenty a proposal is either unexpected or disappointing that is Many a girl has almost held her breath with anxiety as she saw the great question coming then almost cried with vexation at the way it came For often Either the wrong man proposes or the right man proposes stupidly The woman looks for ideal surroundings a dramatic situation and impassioned and poetic utterance usually The man seizes a commonplace opportunity and stutters Probably The ideal proposal occurs only in novels And yet and yet Perhaps after all the real proposal is more complimentary to woman than is the ideal at least perhaps The aberration and obfuscation of the man is proof once i of her potency and ii of his sincerity Did man keep his head would woman be quite so sure of his heart Yet it may be that in these matter woman is liable to err since Rarely if ever does a woman s heart run away with her head When it does Ah the momentary bliss of an unreasoning emotion Yet Woman does right to keep her head for Almost every woman s happiness depends upon what she does with her heart unless indeed she elects to go through life homeless childless and unenspoused for Though it is the wife that makes the home it is the man who must provide for it And since Man by nature is probably nomadic and polygamic not his to debate whether to give rein to emotion Woman by nature is in far different case For the sake of her child woman must bind the nomad to herself Accordingly It is woman who is the true agglutinator and civilizer of society Therefore it comes about that To order wisely her emotions is the inherited instinct of woman Wherefore Woman is the conserver of the nation and this in more senses than one IX On Men and Women Dio fa gli uomini e e s appaino Salviati There are two elements of character which a man should possess develop and maintain unstained if he would find favor in feminine eyes the first is bravery the second indomitableness of resolution So likewise There are two elements of character which a woman should possess develop and maintain unstained if she would find favor in masculine eyes the first is sympathy the second sweetness of temper A curious and latent hostility divides the sexes It seems as they could not approach each other without alarums and excursions Always the presence of the one rouses anxiety in the breast of the other they stand to arms they resort to tactics they maneuver And Men and women approach each other vizored and in armor But it is often only to conceal the craven heart that beats beneath the brazen cuirass Men judge of women not so much by their intrinsic worth as by the impression women make upon them And women know this since All women are alive to the fact that the impressing one of men is the important function of life Accordingly Great stress is and is naturally laid by women upon dress and the subtleties of the toilette For In matters of the heart man is led by the heart and not by the head two And why not Since It is generally a sweet heart not a hard head that a man wants In short Men are oftener vanquished by a look than by logic by a gracious smile than by good sense by manner and even by dress than by mental development or depth This is to say A man judges a woman by her appearance A woman judges a woman by her motives And A woman judges of a woman s motives by what she knows of her own So it comes about that To a man a woman s heart is something mysterious But Women who know their own hearts have little difficulty in reading others one It is perhaps highly unfortunate that to this word is attached a two fold signification two Though as mister Grant Allen has endeavored to show this is a scientific a method as any No units of measurement yet devised are adequate for the computation of the power wielded by a beautiful woman That is a significant fact and probably could we fathom all the profundities and unravel all the entanglements of the relations between the sexes as deep and as intricate as significant that no woman thinks a man can pay her a higher compliment than to wish to make her his own For though Woman thinks man her ultimate aim and desire Nature knows that man is but the stepping stone to the child In the end woman agrees with Nature We may go farther and say Women are nearer the eternal laws than are men Men govern themselves by the laws they themselves make Women are lawless Laws are for the temporal the fleeting for a given individual in a given society for a particular race in a particular clime Such laws are obeyed by women only under compulsion They more far seeing than men instinctively peer far beyond the ephemeral rules manufactured by men into the realm of laws eternal and immutable these she obeys implicitly unquestioningly much to man s amazement and it may be his mortification for he sees that she is freer than he This is why For the man she truly loves a woman will sacrifice everything everything The same generous sentiment cannot by any means be attributed to man Both the wise man and the wise woman but here I am reminded of the recipe for hare soup Between the sexes there is in reality but one link the link amatory And So long as Nature maintains two sexes so long will men and women hug yet chafe under that slender but invisible bond Not even Cupid and Psyche avoided a misunderstanding in spite of the devotion of the other And If men and women differ in matters amatory it is because men and women have trodden different evolutionary paths The man given up to the chase for pelts or pelf and careful of his status in the tribe thinks only of himself and the present The woman her sole care the nurture of her offspring thinks only of her progeny and the future But since The family is the unit of the state therefore The state makes laws not for love but for the family Happy that family the parents of which are bound by cosmic not by municipal affection Nevertheless Say what one will Love scoffs at laws howsoever marriage and divorce may be regulated by parliamentary statute Man as a member of a political community may make marriage laws to suit that community laws to suit that community laws de vinculo matrimonii and laws de mensa et thoro decrees nisi prius and decrees absolute but Law can no more bind the affections than it can bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades And yet at bottom Beneath all municipal and parochial regulations a great and cosmic law does govern the relations of the sexes and The lightest whim of the lightest lady has a definite perhaps a cosmic fount and origin A man can never know too much Perhaps a woman can And It is a question how far a man admires a woman who knows too much For If there is nothing a man can teach a woman not even of the ways of love the man is apt to be chagrined Besides Too much knowledge is inimical to romance War is a man s true trade love woman s There is no stronger argument against the equality of the sexes than a woman s hand It was made to toil No to place in her lover s In truth Is there anything more fragile in nature than a woman s hand But put it in her lover s and what a force it has Anomaly of anomalies with women fragility delicacy dependence beauty grace it is by these weak weapons that she wins So We watch a demure damsel of some sixteen sunny summers much as we watch a delicate dynamo of some thousand kilowatts Both seem so calm so quiescent Yet both we know can generate such startling energy can bring about such marvelous results Many women forget that things which men have no objection to their female friends doing they often have a very particular objection to their mothers sisters and wives doing So too they often forget that It is not the girl he flatters compliments and is conspicuously attentive to that the man always marries Perhaps this goes to show that There is a deeper and more serious current in the flow of male emotions which much as light and fitful breezes may stir the surface is moved only by and mingles only with a similar and confluent stream For It is not man s highest instincts that are stimulated by the more superficial of feminine blandishments though no doubt many a man there is has been made permanently captive by their lure The truth is that Man is a many sided creature he will reflect many different rays but it is only under the ray that pierces the surface and irradiates the interior that he truly glows Woman does not lean upon man because she is inferior but rather because she is his supporter just as The buttress leans upon the building but the building would fall without the buttress That is Woman s dependence upon man is his chief source of strength Those who cannot understand this may be left to their ignorance It is not all women who comprehend the exaltation of mind into which some men are thrown by their presence Indeed Men put a higher value upon a woman s complaisance than she does herself To a women feminine concession appear trivial Is it any wonder then that Woman calls man s jealousy unreasonable In reality The affianced man thinks he has gotten him an angel from heaven It is not within the bounds of mortal male comprehension that such an angel should sully her wings Women know their sex Which if it is a truism is a truism that men often forget And Few things permit a man to see so far into the subtleties and intricacies of feminine hearts as a squabble between two of them over himself A man in defeat generally turns to woman A woman in defeat is either scornful silent or both A man in depression falls back upon his only weapon brute force A woman in like circumstances does the same But her weapon is personal charm In matters amatory and maternal a woman will risk more than will a man In fact In matters amatory and maternal woman is the truly combative animal Many are the members of the one sex that are entrapped by the wiles of the other but it often happens that the entrapper afterwards rues the capture as much as or even more than the entrapped So it often happens that Girls who are deliberately seeking husbands think love may be won by artifice Not until well on in years do Women know that by men love and artifice are considered mortal foes To win him a wife by artifice would be to a man a thing impossible and abhorrent yet To win her a husband by artifice is to a woman a thing quite natural But When if ever the man discovers that he was won by artifice there are apt to be several bad quarters of an hour For when all is said and done The man free and easy thoughtless and untrammeled knowing he may pick and choose never chooses till till there comes the woman he thinks he wants Then he says point blank he wants her Should it ever be revealed to him that his Want was the result of her Artifice a very different complexion is put upon that Want On the other hand The woman deprived of the power of choice trammeled by convention bound to wait till asked for quite naturally resorts to artifice And yet curiously enough and a thing incomprehensible by man A man whom a woman has won by sheer artifice she can love to the end of her life But after all What a refuge to man is work or play Alas Women has no refuge So Men cannot suffer long women do A man flies to work or sport or to the gaming table or to drink A woman He who can tell what a woman does in the sorrow of the soul will tell us much Some women in sorrow of soul eat out their hearts in silence other women in sorrow of soul will tell us much Some women in sorrow of soul eat out their hearts in silence other women in sorrow of soul eat out the hearts of others not in silence But Take a taciturn woman seriously For always A taciturn woman has suffered much A taciturn woman is a lonely one And probably It is only women who really know loneliness Give a man a full meal and an outlet for his energy he is fairly contented for A man always has friends or a club women rarely have either The most superb of physical charms are powerless unless fired by imagination as the most destructive of explosives is harmless without a cap or a detonator But Given a detonator and the coarsest powder can work tremendous havoc What precisely will bring a particular man to her feet that is par excellence the feminine problem and many and various are the experiments by which she tries to resolve it And Few are the men who learn that were won by experiment For Man succumbs to his emotions He cannot comprehend how it is that Into feminine emotion calculation often enters As there are two classes of warriors so there are two classes of women There is the warrior who conquers the world from sheer love of conquest an Alexander a Genghis Khan an Attila a Napoleon and there is the warrior who captures a kingdom for the sake of possession such is your Norman William So there is the woman whom no conquest contents Aholibah Cleopatra Mesalina Faustine and there is the woman who is happy with a husband and home Deborah Vlmnia Calpurnia mother of Gracchi One thing from men women cannot abide and this is a hostile and REASONABLE attitude And naturally since It is only man s reason that is hostile to women And When a man clothes himself with reason as with a garment woman slinks away And quite naturally Reason and emotion are mortal foes and It is on the field of emotion that the battle of love must be fought For In the battle of love the woman chooses and entrenches her position the man has to act on the offensive But Only emotion can cope with emotion reason but beats the air Wherefore A wise man will neither oppose nor appeal to a woman through reason Who can penetrate to the motives of a woman s coaxings Yet Foolish is the man who questions the motives of a woman s coaxings Yet Not to be sure of a woman s coaxings not upon this side Phlegethon is there a more poignant position In loving one woman a man believes in all women And Not till a woman is loved are her finger tips objects of devoutest worship On the other hand It cannot be said that in loving one man a woman believes in all men Which little distinction is proof perhaps that Love blinds the eyes of men but opens the eyes of women In other words Passion obfuscates man s prevision it does not obfuscate a woman s Man gives the rein to passion or ere he knows whither it leads A woman gives the rein to passion only after she has found out whither it leads But when the goal is known perhaps Women are more implacable votaries of the Implacable Goddess than are men That is the say A woman keeps her head till she can give her heart then she gives it utterly A man perhaps because he has no heart soon enough loses his head So Before the gift a woman s qualms exasperate the man After the gift the man s indifference exasperates the woman It is folly to think that love and friendship exhaust the varieties of human relationships The relationships between earthly souls are as complex and multiform as those between heavenly bodies In one thing does friendship excel love it is always reciprocal one friend presupposes another Not so a lover Friendship is largely a masculine sentiment except among schoolgirls The friendship that exists between a man and a woman should be called by another name It cannot be wholly Platonic three it need not be wholly Dantesque Yet women generally strive to make it the one and men often try to make it the other And yet again How many women there be would if they could transmute love into friendship That is to say Women regard a man s friendship as a delicate flattery to themselves yet they instinctively know though they try hard to forget that a man s friendship for a woman is extremely likely to transcend the bounds of friendship If only friendship would keep within bounds How many women deceive themselves into thinking that were devoutly to be wished Yet probably as a matter of fact The very woman who avers she regrets that your friendship is not mere Platonic would resent the Platonism did it exist Possibly not every woman will understand this Assuredly no woman will admit it And yet It is impossible to conjecture in what an exchange of confidences may terminate it may be a kiss or it may be a quarrel But Confidences are evoked rather by friendship than by love A woman will tell a man friend what she will not tell a lover Few lovers will understand this fewer still will believe it Yet it is true and the explication of its truth would be long and complex This much may be said Love idealizes friendship does not At the same time Love probes the innermost recesses of the womanly nature and until the woman is wholly won The woman resents the inspection of love She knows that To stimulate love the woman must conceal not reveal To stimulate love the woman must conceal not reveal Furthermore Never was there a man who could be at once friend and lover Which is only one more proof that Never will the sexes understand each other three I use the word in its purely conventional sense The male was ever the more susceptible sex And for this reason Next to sympathy flattery is perhaps woman s most effective weapon And No masculine shield there is which woman s flattery will not pierce For Man man alert in the hunt keen in business circumspect with his fellows terrible in war man is pristine and simple in matters emotional and an easy prey to emotional wiles In the long journey of evolution from Amoeba to Man The masculine sex has developed muscle and mind The feminine sex developed and perfected the emotions Accordingly Man s emotions are the primitive weapons of a savage Woman s emotions are arms of precision Yet Sometimes woman deplores the unequal contest perhaps deplores her too easy victory Since In domestic life the weapons are laid aside the pair are then presumably unarmed and defenseless For though A mat has to be won by weapons Marriage should be a treaty of peace thenceforth the combatants are allies Many a man when ensnared has been amazed at the size of the meshes Only a woman knows by what open methods floundering men are captured He who by reasoning thinks to find out woman must either be a philosopher or a fool probably both Less of a philosopher and more of a fool is he who thinks to extract from woman her reasons for her actions The woman who can give reasons for an action is yet to be born The reason is plain Women act upon intuition not upon reason And He who could make a logical sorites out of feminine intuitions could make a philosophical system out of nautical almanacs And yet probably Could we only determine her orbit a woman s intuitions are as exact as the paths of the planets Unfortunately Such are the perturbations to which a woman s orbit is exposed that no masculine astronomy can construct its ephemeris Alack How many anxious star gazers are there among men The orbit of the ordinary male man it is not as difficult for a woman to compute inasmuch as The ordinary male man revolves unusually about two foci his Appetites and his Ambitions Which is the major and which the minor However You may trust women to know when he is in peri and when in aphelion Many a spouse has no difficulty in explaining away to her lord actions about the character of which even his initiate friends have no shadow of doubt For A woman s perception is preternatural But no it is natural enough since From the days of the first woman to the days of the New one love its wiles and its whims has been the serious business of woman Women know much better than men that stolen bread is sweetest In consequence Men steal almost everything they get from women At least they think they do Which is the same thing If the sexes were to change places more marriage licenses would be taken out Frailty says man thy name is woman and then he takes advantage of it At arm s length it is difficult to offer a helping hand Yet it is hazardous to reduce that distance Neglect is the unpardonable sin in a woman s eyes Woe to the man who is guilty of it If a woman possessed only a man s tact what fallings out there would be Man s summum bonum is to combine a comfortable home with congenial club Woman s summum bonum is the almost equally incompatible combination of a well regulated family and the height of fashionable gaiety Man s infinum malum is domestic distraction Woman s infinum malum is social exile Between man and man to lay another under pecuniary obligation is to jeopardize friendship Between man and woman a like cause brings about an opposite result The man with something of the feminine about him often knows better than his more masculine rivals how to work upon feminine susceptibilities Most women know how much to leave to a man s imagination But then man has not much imagination Besides Man s imagination is always highly complimentary to woman Affinity covereth a multitude of sins To attract sometimes requires temporary repulsion But Some women miscalculate their satellite s orbit With the result that either it rushes on to certain destruction or it passes beyond the limits of gravitation The woman who to one man is no more than the sub stratum of frock and bonnet is to another man the centre of gravity of the created cosmos When she is such centre to more than one man her horoscope is difficult to cast When one heart lays siege to another both sides throw up entrenchments and this even when both belligerents are ready to negotiate for surrender But Never never show that you expect capitulation And Flank movements are not to be recommended In conversation the last thing a woman expects from a man is information unless it be information concerning himself In fact Talk is a mere subterfuge It is what is left unsaid that tells Nevertheless When once the troth has been plighted both M and N try to utter what has been left unsaid But always with indifferent success Alack and well a day Can Love ever say what it feels It is difficult to say to which sex it is a greater compliment that widows always prove such successful fascinators Either they still have a penchant for mankind despite their intimate acquaintance with him in which case the men may congratulate themselves or else they have so completely found men out that they find no difficulty in entrapping them in which case it is the women s turn to applaud When our feelings are unwittingly hurt by a beautiful woman the pain is largely tempered by a subtle pleasure which proceeds from a feeling that inasmuch as we have been undeservedly pained we merit her sympathy perhaps even her affection Women seek not so much man s esteem as his admiration In fact Women would rather attract than inspire Indeed by him who dared it might be added that Women would rather be kissed than be sonnetted which is mighty lucky for the majority of men The most interesting man or woman is well perhaps the one most interested in us The least interesting man or woman is well perhaps the one most interested in him or her self Never fear but that one woman will urge your suit with another unless of course that other is a rival for Match making is one of the most fascinating of feminine avocations When a woman allows it to be understood that she considers herself irresistible to the other sex she draws upon herself the odium of her own By the other sex however such a woman is very differently regarded Indeed Men regard the avowed coquette not at all with malice but with a very opposite feeling of which perhaps amusement admiration and a certain amicable defiance are the chief ingredients It is only mountains that are volcanic or are snow capped the plains know nothing of extremes of frigidity or fire To the woman whom he has ceased to love the man is sometimes unconsciously cruel Towards the man whom she has ceased to love the woman commonly acts a part For a woman to humiliate one man in the presence of another is an offence which neither of the men is likely to forget Nor will the one man have a less unpleasant recollection of it than the other It is curious to listen to the explanations by one woman of the reasons of the attractiveness of another woman Very apt is she to say that the other woman is too free and easy too liberal of her favors too expansive of her sympathy too exhibitive of her charms Ahem Women know women And Women know that women know men And Women know that men do not know women Ahem Men in this respect are somewhat different A man usually regards not ungenerously the qualities of his successful rival a woman never The former will candidly admit the possession of a more potent charm the latter will trace it to the crudest of causes In a word The unsuccessful man blames not his rival nor the women he loses but himself The unsuccessful woman blames never herself but either the outrageous meretriciousness of her rival or the blindness of the man she loses From which it may once more be deduced that The unsuccessful woman blames never herself but either the outrageous meretricousness of her rival or the blindness of the man she loses From which it may once more be deduced that Men are won by more primitive means than are women And alas for men alas also for many women The majority of men are so blind so abominably blind that they cannot distinguish the women who are really in love with them from the women who pretend to be in love with them but are not For because So completely do women know men that it is easy for any woman to delude any man This is one of the reasons why Every woman is the rival of every other woman This woman will be herself her own true simple and virtuous self will resort to no subterfuge adopt no meretricious methods scorn to rely upon tactics or strategy be ever reserved reluctant shy yet fail This other woman will openly and blatantly overtly and unconcernedly assail the masculine heart with word and look and gesture and win Ach the purblindess of the masculine heart how it exasperates even the woman That man has sunk low who cannot recognize and respect the remnant of sex even in a degraded woman Woman can persuade themselves and men far more easily than can a man of the propriety of their actions Man is powerless before an injured woman He has no more dangerous foe than this It is the man who seeks excuses The woman braves it out Coquetry is Love s lady s maid She is accessory and ancillary to Love she bedizens Love she tricks her out in gay apparel When Love s lord and master enters my lady s maid is dismissed It might be as well sometimes to recall her And Nudity ousts coquetry Chastity is a word with as many shades of meaning as there are peoples perhaps as there are individuals upon the face of this habitable world Women think chastity is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced by men They mistake T is a virtue primarily insisted upon and enforced by women For When that divine unique thing Love comes to a woman if she be not chaste it is she who deplores the fact The man may easily enough be deceived her own heart a woman can never deceive Besides With what righteous indignation women themselves visit unchastity Between the sexes resentment is the worst of defensive weapons in the hands of a man it is like a cow hide shield opposed to Mauser bullets in the hands of a woman like a parasol on a cloudy day Since Woman penetrates resentment by ridicule man treats it with dull indifference And A snub from a woman is never forgotten And for two reasons because a The lord of creation hates to be floored by the jiu jitsu of feminine raillery and because b The last thing a man expects from a ministering angel is mundane mockery Besides Deliberate derision murders not only affection but admiration A blush needs no apologies Why Because Always a blush is spontaneous uncontrollable and If there is any one thing a man likes to see it is a spontaneous an uncontrollable action in woman When the man has declared himself hers and hers alone has given proof of the truth of such declaration has bound the woman to himself by terms dictated by herself then but not till then the woman acts spontaneously and without control then she blushes But Seek not impulsive masculine lover to explore too many of the mysteries of this thy feminine helpmeet Perchance she feels herself so much above thee that she blushes to give the herself Perchance she regards thee so much a symbol of the god like that she blushes for because she is not more worthy But far more probably she blushes for because she betrays to thee a mortal a divine and cosmic secret For There is a divine and cosmic secret hidden beneath every blush Ah man man peccant impulsive passionate man little knowest thou of the divine and cosmic secret that underlies Love To thee O man it may be t is a momentary flash that irradiates the world and reveals for a moment a sky above that world To thee O woman t is the reverberating thunder that echoing rolls for ever after unceasing in thy ears Is this why Between a man and a woman a single look will sometimes change the complexion of an intimacy of a life time And Not until that look comes not until eyes look into eyes with a penetration supernatural is acquaintanceship metamorphosed into love It is a favorite fiction amongst women that a rejected suitor either will not marry or marries the first girl he meets Because To marry another woman after having offered inalienable and unalterable fidelity to one would otherwise be a blow to amour propere And yet strangely enough or perhaps not so strangely This is a fiction but rarely maintained with regard to her own cardiac transportations And for this reason Woman is and knows herself to be a multiple personality Man a tyro in emotions is cast in a simpler mould So A woman may donate herself piecemeal or over and over again yet deem herself perfectly loyal And perhaps naturally and legitimately for That man who will comprehend and appreciate all the intricacies of feminine emotion but there is no such being existent Indeed even Self revelation is a task no daughter of Eve has achieved To sum up between men and women The consummation of love is a bodily oblation the outcome of spiritual obsession Must I explain this No I shall not Suffice it to say that The Heavenly Aphrodite is true friend to the Earthly four So Nothing offends love since love finds in all that savors of the mortal only a symbol and epitome of the supernatural And There is in Love a cosmic force and secret incomprehensible incommunicable by man Is not after all Love the one supreme and significant fact of the cosmos indelible indecipherable efflorescing in Man emerging from the material idealizing the carnal pointing to an inscrutable a spiritual goal Can it be that If we could explain Love we should explain the cosmos What if we could explain why it is that no one single isolated portion of the cosmos can live alone and vaunt itself in itself sufficient five but must seek some other single and isolated portion of the cosmos in order that that very cosmos shall continue shall evolve shall go towards its goal Do we put our finger here upon some curious and recondite cosmic fact utterly transcending our mean comprehension four Cf Plato Symposium one hundred eighty et seq five S T Coleridge Lectures on Shakespeare X On Jealousy la jalousie monster odieux Moliere Ware jealousy as you would ware wire for it no psychiater has yet discovered a balm To make an experiment of jealousy is to make a very hazardous experiment indeed Jealousy is no proof of love for Often jealousy is but rancor under a sense of humiliation Indeed Jealousy is a sign of weakness The lover whose self confidence assures him of his pre eminence fears no rival Yet Male self confidence is peculiarly vulnerable where women be concerned since As no man knows what it is appeals to a woman he does not know on what to pride himself Even an Othello is jealous of even an Iago Yet It is only the spectators who see the folly of Othello Desdemonas usually are helpless as they are oblivious The illicitly favored lover is never jealous of the husband but of another illicitly favored lover how jealous he is But Jealousy like modesty and like virtue varies with every time and clime what is customary in Cairo would rouse consternation in Kent and what goes on in Vienna shocks New England So How the husband favored lover differs also with every time and clime here he is mulcted in damages there he is shot down in a third place he is tolerated How the woman thinks her husband should treat the illicitly favored lover that you shall never find out The edacity of jealousy is unappeasable A wronged lover in his pain looks for more pain to bear like a martyr in an ecstasy he cries out for further tortures In love one always sees higher unreachable heights in jealousy always deeper unreachable depths And There is no wound but leaves its cicatrix Mistrust an unexpected change of front So Does your erstwhile frowning lady smile cherchez l homme or la femme Since To arouse jealousy in another feminine breast is sometimes the motive of feminine complaisance Indeed Few women can forgo an opportunity of arousing jealousy whether in a feminine or in a masculine breast Bethink thee of this little fact O man when next thy lady comports herself thee wards ultra graciously To see the girl of thy heart even if so be she not thine nor not nearly thine comport herself with another as she does with thee ah that gives a twinge to the masculine heart Nay lesser things than this will perturb this irascible organ that the other should admire her charms that she should accept such admiration yet what cares she that these discomfort a man For A man s discomfiture is naught to a woman In sooth Take a woman to task for her conduct and with how soft an answer she will turn away your wrath how deftly make light of your rival s advances Man when he has won him a woman is in his great greed of possession infinitely chagrined that he was not master of her past as of her present and future This goes by the name of la jalousie retrospective Women never know quite how to regard a man s jealousy It flatters her yet it pains her She is the cause of it yet she would believe it causeless She deplores it yet she would not have it quite away It is proof of love yet it is fatal to love How to treat it puzzles her Implicit obedience to the man s wishes lowers her in her own eyes and consequently so she thinks in his Yet so rabid is the emotion she fears to provoke it too far It places her in a quandary She never knows what will evoke it she never knows what course it will run whether it will cement her lover s affections or whether it will dissipate them forever It is love s most dangerous foe and it is dangerous because it is insidious If there is any one thing that puts a woman s wits to the test it is a man s jealousy The sheerest and most insensate folly a man can commit towards a woman is to let her know that another woman is cognizant of her jealousy of her He may give the latter a very keen pleasure but he gives the former a very keen pang For The cause of jealousy a woman may condone the divulgence of her jealousy she will never forgive What irritates a jealous man is the actions that cause his jealousy What irritates a jealous woman is the person who is the cause of her jealousy In other words A jealous swain upbraids his mistress A jealous mistress objurgates her rival XI On Kisses and Kissing Sag mir wer einst das Kussen efrund Das war ein gluhend glucklicher Mund Er kusste und dachte Nichts daberi Heine Many are the varieties of kisses as many probably as the varieties of kisses as many probably as the variety of lips and of the owners thereof And A kiss may mean so very much or so very little Wherefore Look not upon the lips when they are red for although A kiss is a small thing so is a spark And always though A smile is an open window a kiss is an open door Strange strange that from the momentary contact of lip with lip an infinitesimal surface of epithelial tissue there an be called up from the deeps of the soul emotions strange as deep emotions vague and thrilling emotions to the which to give utterance those lips are themselves all powerless And When to the conjoined lips there is added the bliss of an up turned eye and embracing arms Ah well a day There are Edens for us still if only we will eat not of the forbidden fruit The value of a kiss is determined by the personage on whom it is bestowed not by the from whom it is besought which if it needs any explanation means this that It is the man who ardently desires the kiss that puts the value upon that kiss not the woman of whom it is desired Yet women know that As with commodities so with kissings the greater the rarity the greater the vale Osculatory transactions there be as lasting in their results as transient in their causes A cheek surreptitiously brushed in the dark is preferable to lips premittedly pressed by day What an extraordinary multiplicity of maneuvers a man will perform for Just one kiss But With the precise numerical equivalent of the expression Just one kiss algebra has not yet been found quite able to grapple It is believed however to belong to Permutations and Combinations There is a very decided but wholly indefinable line of demarcation between the kissed and the unkissed woman In other words The status quo ante exosculationem can never be re established hitherto the kisses may have been friends henceforward they may be they may be But Who shall say to what kissing may lead Besides Much more kissing than is supposed goes by purchase than by favor All which probably will be Greek to the uninitiated Nevertheless and at all times and in all places A kiss is like faith it is the evidence of things not seen the substance of things hoped for How appalling the immensity of the results due to the minutest of causes a burning city from a lighted match a life long tragedy from a stolen kiss In truth Fate is often another name for Folly A woman who is afraid of a kiss knows much Amongst other things perhaps that Kisses like misfortunes rarely come singly and bear many things in their train Despite the varieties of beards and mustachios never will you hear from your osculatrix the source of her knowledge of that variety If by any chance the divulgence leaks out how the girl beshrews the mischance For though the man may hold his peace she knows that she gives him to think It takes two to make a quarrel Yes and it takes two to make the reconciliating kiss XII On Engagements and on Being Engaged Chalepon to mae philaesai Chalepon de kai philaesai Anacreon Perhaps the pleasantest and most satisfactory period in a girl s life is the time of her first youthful engagement Never is a girl more jubilant never more buoyant never so charming so blithesome or so debonair as when she is the gazetted about to be bride of the man of her girlish choice For During her engagement a girl is owned and petted and Ownership and petting are dear to women whether young or old Ownership is proof at all events that she is of value to the man else the man would not sought to make her his and Petting is proof that the man properly appreciates the value Yet meanwhile anomalous as it may sound The engaged girl is still her own property and is practically free Besides What more delectable to a girl than to have captured and kept a real man This flatters her uplifts her makes of her a woman at once she holds her head higher she carries herself with an air she shows off her capture Besides also The engaged girl is looked up to by her compeers is congratulated y her elders Even if she keeps the engagement secret these compeers and congratulatresses do not sometimes alas To her detriment In addition to all this What delight so unique as the preparation of the trousseau two hundred thirty nine Trousseau T is a name of mystical import to man A woman s trousseau is symbol of two things and perhaps dimly indicative of a third i it proves what needs no proof that such is the unselfish nature of Love never can it give enough never enhance too much the gifts it gives Accordingly the bride goes to the man appareled and bedecked to the best of her ability ii It is a subtle tribute to the sensibility of man of the man in love who is stimulated and pleased by dainty it may be diaphanous raiment Lastly since even that supernal thing Love is not unconcerned with matters practical iii It bespeaks as prophetic suspicion of the little fact that perhaps it is well to go to her husband s home abundantly provided with dainty raiment inasmuch as the man not in love is not always so delicately sensible of their need A girl s first engagement is peculiarly sweet long does she remember long meditatively dwell upon its pettiest incidents For if any man dared give utterance to so outrageous an assumption The emoluments of a promise to marry are as sweet to the donatress as undoubtedly they are to the accepter And why not pray Nevertheless A certain practical sobriety supervenes upon subsequent affairs of the heart For The recurrence of love is apt to spoil its romance And yet and yet It is a question which woman after woman has put herself in vain whether t would have been wiser to have accepted and retained the romantic love of unthinking youth or to have waited for the more sober affection of the years of discretion Perhaps a girl hardly knows all that is meant by that thing called love or what is entailed upon her by that thing called an engagement She has played with love so much that when a real and serious love is offered her she still thinks it the toy that amused her But Soon enough does the man if he is earnest and a man never proposes unless he is in earnest enlighten the girl of his choice for To a man love never is a toy though mere lust may be Men never play with love as do girls they play with lust as they play with bats and balls and fire arms When men fall in love they fall in love with a vengeance and The seriousness with which the man falls in love startles the girl The man demands so much is so exacting so peremptory so unyielding so frightfully selfish so terribly jealous of the slightest look or smile or gesture bestowed upon any other than he that the girl well the girl probably begins to think either that the man is an unreasonable brute or that her girlish notions of love were somewhat astray Then one or two things happens either the man goes off in a huff or the girl mends her ways The recurrence of a love is a great shock to love Love thinks itself a think unique unalterable supreme a thing not made out of the flux and change of earthly affairs but heaven born and descended from the skies that it should go and come seems to destroy the fundamental conception of love The affianced man thinks he has won him the sweetest the most sacrosanct thing that ever trode God s earth outside of Eden a bundle of blisses a compact little mass of exquisite mysteries whose every tint and curve and motion are to him sources of wonderment and delight he is at once humbled and exalted he thanks high Heaven for the gift for that comport himself worthy of such gift for that this wondrous and mysterious little thing called a woman should of her own accord put herself in his arms to be by him and by him alone cherished and nurtured till death them do part this indeed gives the mail heart a very sobering a very ennobling thrill for beneath the heaving breast he so passionately loves behind the eyes into the depths of which he so passionately looks there stirs he knows that ineffable that indefinable thing a woman s heart and that TO HIM has been committed the keeping of that heart this rouses in him the manly virtues as no other thing rouses them Strong is the man who can live up to these emotions sage the woman who knows what she has aroused The philanderer or the flirt to whom love making and love taking have been a pasttime is appalled at the seriousness of love when real love is offered him or her For often enough The philanderer or the flirt thinks compliments and cajolery the food of love in time they discover that love is a veritable sarcophagus Many an accepted lover both masculine and feminine tries to make up for coldness of passion by warmness of affection a subterfuge of dubious efficacy For though Affection seeks affection passion is only appeased by passion Yet When one loves passionately and the other languidly accepts it is well perhaps for that other sometimes to be a little unfaithful to the truth one and to simulate an unfelt ardor But always this is of questionable value for Love abhors simulation of anything even of ardor one Tennyson Love and Duty If mutual confidence is not established at the moment of betrothal it will never afterwards be established And Woeful will be the plight of those between whom mutual confidence is not then established For Mutual confidence is the only atmosphere in which love can breathe An engaged man like a hungry man is an irascible man And How often a fiancee is sore put to it not only to satisfy him but to pacify him A woman will often blandly ask why the two rivals to her hand should not be friends Yet it is significant of much that she does her utmost to keep them apart Indeed In no instance are a woman s tact and finesse so exercised as in playing off one man against another And yet usually she delights in the task for Being made love to is to women what killing whether of men or of animals is to men In a word To be sought after is to woman what war or the chase is to man The woman a woman accepts a man then and there he becomes her lord and master And this she unconsciously knows nay expects If the man does not then and there exercise his lordship and show his mastery he will find it difficult to do it later on But of course No woman will ever be got to admit that her newly won man is her master Nevertheless it is counsel that every man should lay to heart for Unless a woman is dominated N E not dominated over she tries to get the upper hand And Only two instances there are in which the woman should retain the upper hand when the man is either a philosopher or a fool When a man is both and the combination is not uncommon she would be a fool if she did not retain the upper hand But Little does a woman esteem him to does not sway nay who does not sacrifice it may be her to his will Of that engaged pair who can confidingly speak the one t the other of the dawn of their mutual attraction little need be feared if they cannot very much may be feared For Love without confidence is as defunct as faith without works For If M cannot confide in N it probably means that K and L have or that O and P will So tremendous are the results of the gift of self that Nature herself seems to have ordained that the feminine sacrifice shall be utter and complete For A man s interests may be many and and behold a bold girl will appear and carry off the shy man Perhaps to the life long chagrin and sorrow of all three Often oh how often an awkward and sophisticated youth and a prim maid with down cast eyes will sit together waltz together and the one never get one inch the nearer to the other though soul and mind and body crave a closer union The youth would give the solid earth nay the solid earth would be naught to gain him the courage to clasp the maiden to his breast yet so intense his awe he would not strain a spider s web to risk the maid s good will The maid who shall say what passes in her mind That the youth should adventure she could wish yet his very hesitancy bespeaks his devotion true Were he to fall about her neck embrace her close and demand the kiss of love most like she would recoil aghast at first Yet if he desisted she would also recoil aghast What should he do poor awkward youth what she One thing onlookers will do smile and simper and smile again but in their inmost heart of hearts they will envy that awkward youth that simple maid For because in this the first symptoms of unsolicited and reciprocal love they will recognize something of the divine and mystical nature of Love itself of Love untrammeled by convention or law of Love itself in its purity its intensity its diffidence its terrifying yet restraining force Ah Love not in every conflict art thou victor crowned two two Eros anikate machan Sophocles Antigone seven hundred eighty one XIII On Marriage and Married Life ariston andri ktaema sympathaes gunae Hippothoon Marriage laws are framed not for or by the likes and dislikes of men and women but by the exigencies of social often of political economy Therefore Men and women s likes and dislikes are obliged to conform to the usages demanded by social and political economy so In Turkey women accept with a good grace the custom of a plurality of wives in Tibet men accept with good grace a plurality of husbands In the western world Humph Always will there be everywhere prevalent a latent hostility between the likes and dislikes of men and women on one hand and the laws enforced by a social and political community on the other This is why Always there will be those who will try to reform the marriage state some looking only to the likes and dislikes of men and women others only to the advantages which shall accrue to the State So Some there will be will always advocate a loosening of the marriage bond others who will seek to make it indissoluble Both should remember that The unit of the State is the family therefore the State makes laws not to suit the tastes or convenience of the husband and the wife but for the good and preservation of the family All of which surely is right and proper since It is the business of the State to make laws governing the welfare of the generations to come In fine The children they are the pivot about which all matrimonial controversies should turn Reformers of marriage laws should seek a preventative not a cure since It is doubtful whether the ills of matrimony are really curable for generally speaking Matrimonial incompatibility is a malignant not a benignant disease its prognosis is doubtful nor does it run a regular course Many are the women who soon after marriage silently turn over in their minds this little problem whether it were better to marry the man they loved but who did not love them or to marry the man who loved them but to whom they were indifferent And The man a woman ultimately marries will give her no clue to the solution And for the following reasons i He fond wight does not know that any such problem is agitating her little brain and ii She of course dare not divulge the factors of the problem In short Most marriages are brought about by the following simple yet fateful consideration The man marries the woman he wants the woman marries the man who wants her The two propositions though apparently identical often produce results very far from identical And yet Sometimes sometimes that glorious dream comes true in which a hale and heart whole youth implants the first pure passionate kiss upon the lips of a hale and heart whole girl Ah happy twain For them the sun shines the great earth spins and constellations shed their selectest influence T is a dream that all youth dreams T is a dream makes wakeful life worth living Ah the wild dream of youth The maenad dream The spring time dream Of the maid the dim dim dream of stalwart man offering a love supreme without alloy and taking forceful a love as flawless as supreme a steady breast on which to lean strong circling arms a face set firm against the world a face that softens only to her up turned eyes that seek the lover who is hers and hers alone a dream of music color and the swaying dance of rivals splendidly out shone of home and friends and trappings of raiment Retinue of ordered bliss and by and by in a still dimmer far off time a time un whispered to herself of baby fingers baby lips Of the youthful man a vivid dream involved unsteady shifting a dream of lust and love and smoke and flame and fame of cuirass and horse and saber of blood and battle of high place of many dominated by his look and gesture of mighty man and orders issued preemptory not to be gain said also of lithe arms a supple waist sweetly soft entwining limbs a gentle girlish woman all his own who never was another s and always will be his and an heir and household gods Ah the wild dream of youth Youths dream ye while ye may And you ye aged I charge ye do not wake them it is the dream makes wakeful life worth living And yet and yet Sometimes sometimes alack and fie for shame things come to such a pass between husband and wife that a modus viviendi has to be tacitly agreed upon In that case alas Too often between husband and wife it depends upon who is the better actor and liar to their shame be it said But before this happens much else must have happened For Here and there ahem we meet a woman who is like the moon she circles sedately round and dutifully faces the planet to which she is united but that planet does not know that she is irradiated and warmed by a far distant sun a sun which symbolizes ahem Duty or Necessity or Affection for her children or tell it not in Gath Affection for another And here and there ahem we meet a man who like the sun shines steadfastly enough upon his own earth but shines also all unbeknown to earth upon other earths and errant comets and small aerolites As it is usually physical or sentimental characteristics that bring a man and a woman into the field of mutual attraction so it is generally physical or sentimental characteristics that drag them apart Thus A clever wife will put up with a stupid husband and an intellectual man will get on admirably with a dull but domestic woman But If either party to the marriage contract disregards or is unable to appease the demands made upon him or her for sympathy or emotion there is likely to be trouble for Sentiment not intellect is the cementing material in marriage and If a man and wife cannot effuse a mutual sentiment gradually they will grow apart Indeed The demands of the emotions are at once more imperious and tyrannical and more fastidious and critical than are the demands of the mind Of all of which what is the moral This The married pair who would live in amity not to say in affection must so live as that each shall persuade the other is the sole personage under the roof of heaven that he or she desires Alas The unwritten motto of many a married couple is The Heart Knoweth its own Bitterness Marriage reveals the moods of a man What is an ideal marriage That perhaps in which the man is to the woman at once friend husband and lover But some people prefer these functions distinct That is a happy marriage in which a woman s husband is also her confidant And always Husband and wife should move like binary stars revolving about a common centre mutually attractive and unless closely viewed presenting a single impression Matrimony is sometimes a terrible iconoclast Whether it throws down the images of false or of true gods depends on the religion of the worshipper It would be difficult sometimes to determine whether constancy was an autogenous or enforced virtue Never play pranks with your wife your horse or your razor There is a thing which not gold nor favor nor even love can buy Its true name is secret but it is content to be called Sympathy Accordingly Let no man or woman think when he or she has won wife or husband all has been won that is necessary For If sympathy cannot be gained from one quarter it will probably be sought in another At the moment of the formation of a matrimonial syndicate of two each member of this as yet unincorporated joint stock company verily believes that each has put into the concern his whole real and personal property Yet it is to be feared that although The woman possibly invests her whole capital the man often no doubt unwittingly to himself retains not a few unmatured bonds and debentures That is to say Love it is to be feared is often enough a bargain in which the woman comes off second best For A woman gives herself man accepts the gift Rarely if ever does a man give himself He cannot His work his play his politics his friends his club these are matters to him highly important To a woman the only highly important things are her husband and her home A woman rules until she tries to rule which will be an enigma to many Out of a wife s obedience will grow her governance never out of her dominance Those who think this sheer nonsense are welcome to think so But it is worth thinking about A man ought to rule his wife Granted But he cannot do this unless he rules himself The Colonel of a Regiment cannot command if he himself breaks the King s or the State s Regulations And An uncontrolled wife deems her husband indifferent or weak The number of husbands who though they think they rule yet in reality are ruled would astonish not their wives but themselves It is customary to call the man the head of the household yet between man and wife it is a question after all whether it is not the stronger will and the cooler judgment that should and generally does guide the family independent of sex or custom As in the solar spectrum so in love beyond and intermingled with the visible rays of passion are numerous actinic but invisible rays of affection invisible to careless spectators but known and felt by the recipients These too must be introduced if the connubial domicile is to be warmed as well as illuminated The marriage tie loosens all other ties In fact Neither men or women are always aware of the absoluteness of the marriage tie thenceforward the woman belongs not to her own people hardly to herself As to the man well Often a wife will actually be jealous of the time and attention her husband spends on things and matters unconnected with her his work his play his politics his friends his club Many are there who still believe that the marriage service like a legal indenture irrevocably entails the whole estate of a human heart In sober truth There never was a married couple yet who had not to purchase their own happiness And The only charms that increase in value as time goes on are the charms of character beside these those of person and even those of mind are weak In short In marriage as in every human relationship it is character that avails and prevails naught else Chemists draw a distinction between a chemical and a mechanical mixture Moralists might discover the same in marriage To encircle monogamy with an ever increasing halo of romance that is a problem deserving of study Monogamy is one of the disharmonies of life it seems as I have said to be the decree of politics rather than of nature But surely polygamy or polyandry would be more disharmonious still Marriage renders no one immune That is to say Unless husband and wife both avoid infection both can catch amatory fevers The woman who has learned how to minister to a man s creature comforts has learned much And It has disconcerted many a young wife to discover how important a part of her education this is Since It is certainly sometimes hard to reconcile a suitor s poetic protestations with a spouse s prosaic requisitions In the game of life a man may venture many stakes a woman s fate is determined by a single throw of the dice Thus How often it happens that a young and inexperienced maid will look about her will weigh and consider will pick and choose and when she thinks she has found a man to her purpose will set her cap at him will attract him enslave him bring him to her feet make him propose accept him as husband give him all the sweets of engagement regard herself and proclaim herself his affianced bride all with most prudential it may be most praise worthy motives On a sudden the man discovers that this was no real attachment but a fictitious almost an enforced one that the methods so he thinks were artificial the results delusive What happens The man withdraws politely gallantly t was a mistake he is sorry they are unsuited he did not know his own mind he is sorry and so on and so forth They separate And in this concatenation of circumstances action for breach of promise is out of the question Besides often enough the girl through pride or through sheer chagrin at the indifference of the man pretends acquiescence What happens to the man Nothing If his senses were stirred he himself is heart whole He gave nothing he merely received He proposes again to somebody else is accepted marries happily rears a family What happens to the girl Everything The man gave her nothing she gave all her lips her looks the recesses of her heart the premonitions of the gift of her self for when she leant on him looked up to him clung to him felt his strong encircling arms was perturbed by his ardor she gave that which was not to give again Such woman is to be pitied For however much she may strive to make it appear that she gave nothing that she had all to give again not even her own soul will bear her witness and sooner or later a subsequent lover and such girl accepts the first lover that offers will find a void where he hoped to find an inexhaustible treasure For the woman cannot forever keep up a fictitious affection and languid looks and eyes that will not brighten and smiles which are so evidently forced bespeak her sympathies elsewhere But as Heine said this is an old story often repeated one Wherefore Let us pity women The dice they throw are their hearts and they have only one throw when they have thrown away their hearts Pity women Men have so many dice to throw income status title virility fortune fame good spirits good connections good looks an air a figure a soul stirring voice manners breeding force a good name a good bank account The pity o it is that The whole marriage question revolves about a single point The man wants him a woman a woman who shall be his and only his The woman wants her a head of a home And here again and once again we see the difference between the sexes The one thing that the man wants is a mate The one thing that a woman wants is a head and provider of a household The man s thoughts never go beyond the woman The woman s thoughts always and at once travel far beyond the man to the children the household the home This is great Nature s inexorable law But little knows the woman and less knows the man that the nubile girl is merely obeying great Nature s inexorable law What price woman pays for her high office for in this implicit unquestioning and unconscious obedience to Nature she performs perhaps her highest function On all accounts therefore let us Pity women They obey so faithfully great Nature s law and Nature so often plays them false so very false and so very often Besides The woman who gives her hand without her heart finds in time that she has made a sorry bargain a sorrier bargain perhaps that the woman who gives her heart with out her hand For Passionately as a man desires a woman the passionately desired woman will in time discover that unless she gives her heart with her hand her gift suffers depreciation And Unless a woman gives her heart how can she give her aid Surely Unless a man s armor is buckled on for the strife of life by feminine sympathy the fight is apt to be a sorry one at best since A woman s true business is to back her husband if SHE leaves him in the lurch there is little hope for him For of a truth The strongest man is handicapped in the struggle for existence unless he knows and feels that his wife is at his side not pushing him so much as leaning upon him one Ein Jungling leibt ein Madchen Die hat einen Andern erwahlt Der Andre leibt eine Andre Und hat sich mit Dieser vermahlt Das Madchen heirathet aus Arger Den ersten besten Mann Der ihr in den Weg gelaufen Der Jungling ist ubel dran Es ist alte Geschichte Doch bleibt sie immer neu Und wem sie just passieret Dem bricht das Herz entzwei Buch der Lieder thirty nine To simulate passion for an hour is possible to simulate a life long love that is hard For Love is a thing unique and unalterable in spite of its various alloys clip the coin and it will not pass current For Ideal matrimony is founded on a mono metallic basis no amount of silver will be accepted for gold And yet How often M loves and N accepts the love Poor M Also in the long run poor N That indeed is a happy marriage where M gives and wants just what N wants and gives where M and N just want each other For Give and take is the rule of a community of two as it is of a community of ten thousand The ideal and probably impossible industrial community is that in which demand and supply are in exact equipoise The same holds good in matrimony In wedlock a virtuous has probably less force than a vicious example That is to say A frivolous spouse is more apt to drag the couple down than is a serious spouse apt to lead the couple up And Many a mate there is both masculine and feminine feels like a pack mule treading a precipitous pass Of every Audrey her Touchstone should be able proudly to say A poor Thing Sir but mine own In other words The homely violet deserves as tender cherishing as the rare exotic What portion of himself or herself any one complicated physical and psychological human being really and truly conveys to another by means of the simple contract known as the plighted troth or that of a larger deed called the called the solemnization of matrimony is a riddle difficult of solution and as to how much one may claim on the strength of one or other of these indentures that is a more difficult problem still In no amatorial contract probably is it possible to include or to enumerate all the hereditaments messuages or appurtenances involved Certainly How great so ever the community of interest M and N remain for ever M and N Is there not always something in the eternal feminine which cannot quite coalesce with the ephemeral masculine Probably Trust your wife with your purse and seven times out of ten it will grow heavy Many a woman by man is accepted at her face value Many a man by woman is taken on trust It is difficult to tell whether More bad debts are contracted by giving credit than by taking at face value For The promissory note of marriage is undated and unendorsed But Children act as collateral security How often a girl even an affianced girl accustomed to a multiplicity of admirers forgets the man of her ultimate choice she must then and there set above all other claimants If the man the woman chooses for husband does not stand in her estimation absolutely first and all other claimants nowhere there is bound sooner or later to be trouble For No man will play second fiddle to any body or any thing and The realm amatory is a monarchial not a republican one In all realms there must be a ruler whether elected or hereditary Always a divided sway results in schism whether in the family or in the state And although Often enough the wife proves herself the more effective Sovereign the forms of monarchy must be conceded to the man even though the executive is left to the woman How often the only breast to which one can go on to rain out the heavy mist of tears is the one inhibited Two wills are not so easily blended into one as that the task may be left to Cupid Yet Unless Cupid has a hand in blending two wills it is bound to be a sorry business at best Always and in all wedlock there comes a time when will conflicts with will If both wills are inflexible one must break or both will fly apart But Love and tact will relieve many a strain Though sometimes one discovers that Human eyes have a certain store of tears It is not difficult to weep them all away However In the final rupture between man and wife it is the children that turn the scales But O ye young husbands and wives remember that Youth regards the whole world as its friend age finds itself desolate in the midst of friends Wherefore O youth cleave unto the wife of thy bosom since A loving wife is worth a multitude of friends Sweet are friends and fame is sweet but sweeter far a wifely heart whereon to lay a weary head But Each married pair must solve its own difficulties as best it can If any advice were worth the offering it would be this O ye Husbands and O ye Wives if not for your own sakes then for your children s lead a straight clean honorable life any other sort of life leads to despicability to dismalness to disaster Which only means after all that In the marriage relation as in every relation the social the industrial the commercial the political it is conduct it is character that counts nothing else Beauty Wealth Culture Grace Wit Intellect Sprightliness Vivacity Humor these are much but they are simply naught and less than naught when just this simple single yet insatiable thing called Man wants to live amicably affectionately martially with that simple single but incomprehensible thing called Woman Character Conduct rule the world the Matrimonial equally with the Municipal XIV On this Human Heart The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it Holy Writ It does not take much to make two hearts beat faster than one The heart can deceive itself when it cannot deceive another Which will be cold comfort to some lovers though it may console others To admit a sacred visitant into the inner recesses of the human heart those recesses must be neat indeed Remember too that you can Never expect an angel to act as a charwoman the sweeping must be done by the owner Lastly Unless each heart is permitted access to the other their union is fictitious perhaps perilous Explain these tropes who can No man can tell to whom a woman s heart belongs not even the man who calls the woman his And Let no man imagine that when he has won him a woman he has won him a woman s heart Since Sometimes a woman will give her heart to one man and her troth to another Besides Many a heart is hard to read especially if it is a palimpsest Indeed many are illegible to their owners Nevertheless That the woman should not know her own heart as so often happens terrifies the woman as much as it exasperates the man Yet That must be a curious love that causes the heart to hesitate And yet Many a man has debated for months whether to propose or not and sometimes a woman will accept on a Friday the man that she refused point blank of a Tuesday But perhaps Where the heart hesitates it is not so much a case of love as a case of convenience For An overwhelming love leaves the heart of either doubt or debate But alas The human heart seems to be an anatomical engine of such intricate and delicate mechanism that its workings are uncontrollable even by its owner Is a constant heart as hard a thing to manufacture in the world of life as is an immobile thing in the world of matter And matter so they say is immobile only at absolute zero when bereft of even molecular motion a thing impossible to produce and which to produce would require incalculable pressure and almost incalculable cold Is there no chemical formula for fixing the impression of the heart Who really held Burns his heart in thrall Nelly Fitzpatrick or Mary Campbell or Ellison Begbie or Margaret Chalmers or Charlotte Hamilton or Jenny Cruikshank or Anne Park or Jean Armour or missus Whelpdale or missus Agnes McLehose and who the heart of Goethe Gretchen or Kitty Shonkopf or Frederica Brion or Charlotte Buff or Lily Shonemann or the Countess Augusta or Charlotte van Stein or Bettina Brentano or Mariana von Willemer or his wife Christina Vulpius However whether it is a provision of Nature or whether it is due to the perversity of Man probably the feminine heart is far more constant than the masculine and perhaps any one of Goethe s or of Burns his inamoratas would have clung to him had he been faithful to her And yet Would you have had Shelley stick to Harriet Westbrooke and how shall one interpret his feelings for Amelia Viviani What would have happened if Keats had lived and married Fanny Brawne she who flirted with somebody else while he was sick and did not even know that he was a poet Yet she was an inspiration to Keats as Mary Godwin and Amelia Viviani were to Shelley one Ought Byron to have said No to Claire or Lady Caroline Lamb or the Countess Guiccioli or any one of the many maids and matrons that besieged his heart Could anything have kept Rosina Wheeler and Bulwer Lytton side by side Rosina Wheeler to whom before marriage Lytton could find write Oh my dear Rose Where shall I find words to express my love for you and to whom after marriage he wrote Madam The more I consider your conduct and your letter the more unwarrantable they appear God in heaven what a pitiful game it all is And alas as George Sand says All this you see is a game that we are playing but our heart and life are the stakes and that has an aspect which is not always pleasing two one See the Dedication of The Revolt of Islam and see the Epipsychidion two Letter to Alfred de Musset Many a man s heart has been treated as a football Yes but many a woman s heart has been treated as a shuttlecock Human beings there are both men and women out of whom at a mere touch virtue seems to go converse with them is stimulating contact enthralling And yet Powerful as physical or as mental attraction may be permanently to retain the attracted object requires a profounder force Perhaps though Beauty and grace and brilliancy may attract it is only something far more deep seated that retains In other words Charm of body and mind may appeal to body and mind only the heart appeals to the heart Those who know not this and they are Many permit the heart to leak through the senses with the result that when demands are made upon the heart that cistern is found to have run dry So To philanderers and to flirts when a great and true love comes they do not comprehend it and they cannot appreciate it Wherefore Would be lover keep thy heart intact until it be required of thee You need not imagine that because you have once been permitted to see some way down into a human heart that you will necessarily ever again be so permitted Hard words break no bones But they often break hearts Drink is too often the refuge of the masculine and a rich husband the refuge of the feminine broken heart Extreme youth thinks the world is a toyshop where anything may be had for the asking old age regards it as a museum where nothing may be touched No heart under repeated temperings can remain forever keen And As a little body sometimes has a very big pain so an aching heart wonders that it can bear so much And What takes place in the quiet deeps of a troubled heart who shall know The way to the heart is not through the head Between heart and heart there are many channels But three are in universal use the eyes the lips and the finger tips Now the greatest of these is the eyes The masculine heart will never wholly understand the feminine nor the feminine the masculine O the pity o it And yet after all The human heart is much more the same whether it beats under a cuirass or under a corset Between the masculine heart and the feminine perfect frankness is perhaps of questionable import But why It is difficult to say Perhaps because The aspirations and desires of the human heart are infinite and unappeasable To attempt to formulate them is to frustrate them For It is as impossible for any two human hearts as it is impossible for any two material things to occupy the same space Especially when we remember that Between the masculine heart and the feminine is a great gulf fixed Nay rather From youth to age each human heart seems unwittingly to build about itself a high and ever higher growing wall impenetrable indelapidable not to be scaled by the look or speech or gesture Never can heart coalesce with heart And yet The absolute and intimate coalescence of heart with heart is not this after all the consummation that every lover seeks To attempt that consummation by mere speech it is this that is of questionable import Since Between heart and heart speech is the paltriest of channels What a thin yet what an invisible and impenetrable film separates those two worlds the one that of the visible audible and tangible the world of chatter and laughter of convention often of make believe and the other the world of deep and voiceless emotions of the feelings which know not how to give themselves utterance of affections which crave so much and are so impotent to say or to seek what they crave It is like a layer of ice separating the hidden and soundless deeps from the aerial world of noise and motion What would not one heart give to break the icy crust and see and know what was really passing in another And how often we drown if we do break through The isolation of the individual human heart is complete It is the most pathetic past in the universe and it is that against which the individual human heart rebels most There must be some profound and cosmic problem underlying this fact which no philosophy and no religion can solve That it is pathetic seems to prove it temporary earthly a matter of time and space but when will the individual human heart coalesce with the Heart of the Universe which perhaps is the goal of all Life For It may be that these little terrestrial human individuals which we call men and women are after all only tiny and temporary centers of conscious activity in an ocean of infinite consciousness as atoms are but tiny and temporary centers of energy in an ocean of infinite ether Could we see the sum total of Supreme and Infinite Consciousness at a glance perhaps individual men and women would dissolve into a mighty unity could see and comprehend the whole of the luminiferous ether Well perhaps Love is the only known means by which the individual heart can make any expansion whatsoever beyond its own bounds Yet alas Nothing seems to break down the barriers of sense The human heart beats its ineffectual wings in vain against the walls of its fleshly tabernacle Will nothing unite the Boy and the Girl Will nothing bring the Man and the Woman really together Yet the Boy thinks that were the Girl wholly his he and she would be happy and the Man thinks that were the Woman and he to share every thought and every emotion he and she would want naught else Is the amalgamation impossible Is the coalescence of thought and feeling outside the bounds of human possibility What then impels mankind to crave it to attempt it to sacrifice so much for it There is a cosmic puzzle here with which nor philosophy nor psychology nor religion has yet attempted to grapple After all pitiful as it may be lamentable as it may be it is true and it must be said that this human heart of ours goes through life hungry very hungry and unappeased For what it hungers what it has missed whereto it looks for sustenance it itself does not know Thus This feminine heart sighs without ceasing for because that other masculine heart upon which it staked all its all and an all that meant so much proved callous and indifferent That masculine heart ceases not to curse itself for resorting to such hasty and violent methods by which to obtain for itself an ephemeral and passing pleasure This feminine heart eats out its life with remorse for because it gave itself so unthinkingly when asked though of a survey it thought that asking was a thing prompted by impulses as noble as they seemed divine and That masculine heart when the tidal wave of heated passion has subsided wonders how it was led captive by lures so deceptive and untried M regrets and regrets in vain that he did not await a purer and more permanent passion and N chews for a life time the cud of persistent remorse for an hour s poignant pleasure Ach this human heart knows nothing of itself nor anything of its fellow beating hearts If it follows its bent it is cracked if it holds itself in leash it aches If it calls reason to aid its soaring hopes are dashed its romance spoiled and it itself reduced to the level of a machine that calculates If it acts on impulse and meeting a heart that beats so it thinks in unison unites itself with it often enough that other soon palpitates to a different rhythm or itself cannot keep time and all things go awry Poor aching beating human heart It cannot reason it cannot count the cost To it seems that impulse divine and mighty impulse is the sole law of the earth in time it learns that impulse the mightiest the divinest though it may be law in heaven is sometimes a veritable nemesis on earth it gives freely gladly without compunction it finds the gift rewarded by consequences too pitiful for tears Alas this human heart Can no one advise it Is there no advice will help it Must it always go wrong and always suffer Well If one loves one dare not reason if one reasons it is difficult to love There seems to be something cosmic something transcending the bounds of the visible and tangible universe in the desires and cravings of this same human heart this little human heart beating blindly beneath a waistcoat or a blouse Its owner is little bigger than a beetle or an ant and the habitat of that owner is a speck in space a pygmy in comparison with Sirius or Arcturus and invisible from the ultra telescopic confines of vision What it makes the desires and cravings of this human heart more important more importunate to its owner than the measuring of the vastest space Why is it that the longings the hopes the disappointments the desperate aspirations and the passionate loves of little human hearts should cause to their possessors such prepotent commotions such poignant qualms Rigel and Betelgeuse and Algol rush through space and about them probably circle numerous planets inhabited by countless and curious beings each and all perhaps possessing hearts as perturbable as our own And yet if our own little earthly Jack cannot get our own little earthly Jill what cares Jack what happens to Vega or Capella or to the great nebula in Orion Jack wants Jill and that want is to Jack the only thing in the sidereal heavens that matters The curious and perhaps semi comical but wholly pathetic thing about the whole matter is this that though undoubtedly our little planet is part of and has a place in this great sidereal universe and consequently all our Jacks and Jills are related to all the Jacks and Jills everywhere else yet each little human heart behaves as it were the only heart in the sum total of created things if it enjoys it calls upon all that is to congratulate it if it suffers it cries aloud to high heaven to avenge its wrongs it comports itself as if it and it alone were the only sensitive things in existence That is curious That it wrongs may have been wrought by itself that is fate may have been determined in the reign of Chaos and Old Night or ere even cosmic nebulae were born it does not dream if Jill is indifferent or Jack morose either is enough to cause Jack or Jill to curse God and die Is there some archetypal and arcanal secret in this the extreme the supernal egoism of the human heart Of all of which what is the moral Humph Frankly I do not know what is the moral Only this I see that each little heart creates its own little universe the bee s the that of its hive and the fields man s that of his earth and the stars What may be above or beyond the stars man no more knows than the bee knows what is beyond the fields The heart be it man s or a bee s is the centre of its self made sphere Some day perhaps man s sphere will extend as far beyond the stars as today it extends beyond the fields Then who knows perhaps unlimited senses and an uncircumcised intellect may find themselves commensurate with this high aspiring heart and an emancipated and ecstatic Jack unite with a congenial Jill That there is a Universe is apparent that it is one and complete we suppose that there are in it Jacks and Jills is indubitable that these Jacks and Jills crave mutual support sympathy love friendship wifehood sistership companionship brotherhood is also indubitable If therefore the whole scheme of the Universe is not a farce what does this craving of Love for Lover mean And yet It is quite impossible to conceive of a Universe of Love in which all the claims of Heart and Soul and Senses shall be eternally and infinitely satisfied Nevertheless on this little earth perhaps Ill betides the heart that leans overmuch on another For alas Not even the entire immolation of one heart for another will satisfy that other Indeed indeed In this life would one seek comfort and solace one must seek it in one s own self or in one s God For Only one of two things can comfort To put the world under one s feet or to keep a God over one s head only He who is captain of his soul or he who commits his soul to God can rise above fate There is a vacuum in every human heart And the human heart abhors it as much as nature What will fill this cardiac void no mortal to this moment has found out Art cries Beauty and tries to depict it Philosophy cries Truth and strives to define it Religion cries Good and does its best to embody it and numberless lesser voices in the wilderness cry Power or Gold or Work which is a narcotic or Excitement which is an intoxicant and a many toned changeful siren with sweetly saddening music cries Love And one pursues a phantom and another clasps a shadow and a third cloaks his eyes with a transparent veil or steeps his senses in floods that will not drown No what the human heart wants it does not know And what is more Pathetic problem amongst problems pathetic often it puzzles this human heart to distinguish between the things which it is right and proper to seek wherewith to fill that void and the things which are wrong and improper Furthermore How apt is the heart to seek in the illegitimate for the satisfaction which the legitimate fails to give Problems ancient as Eden What does it want this human heart what does it so earnestly desire so strenuously seek All about it and about are beauty friendship mirth and gladness the sea and the earth and the sky color and music and song and to each if he wills it wife or husband and children and home Wanting is what Ah One lesson this human heart has to learn so easy to put into words so difficult to carry out by deed is this To get the human heart must give The heart eats out itself causes its own emptiness creates its own void The selfish and egoistical life breeds always the vapid and vacuous heart Would you appease your own hunger Feed the hungry hearts around you Do you crave fullness of joy Give joy to the joyless Would you fill your own cavity satisfy your craving attain your desire find what you seek Give give give The more the better for The greater the donation the greater the repletion Nature gives gives lavishly wantonly unquestioningly Every atom of soil every drop of sap goes to produce flowers and fruit and seed root and branch and leaf are but carefully constructed means by which to transmute sunshine and soil and flower and fruit and seed No tree lives for itself Shall then this human heart live for itself gather and store up for its own delectation for its own good There is no such thing as one s own good Goodness is mutual is communal is only guided by giving and receiving Wherefore O frail weak human heart seek thou out carefully constructed
