none	none	THE STRANGER 
3083_7943_000010_000000	train-clean-360	It was corn planting time when the stranger followed the Old Trail into the Mutton Hollow neighborhood 
3083_7943_000011_000000	train-clean-360	All day a fine rain had fallen steadily and the mists hung heavy over the valley 
3083_7943_000011_000001	train-clean-360	The lower hills were wrapped as in a winding sheet dank and cold 
3083_7943_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The trees were dripping with moisture 
3083_7943_000011_000003	train-clean-360	The stranger looked tired and wet 
none	none	By his dress the man was from the world beyond the ridges and his carefully tailored clothing looked strangely out of place in the mountain wilderness 
3083_7943_000012_000001	train-clean-360	His form stooped a little in the shoulders perhaps with weariness but he carried himself with the unconscious air of one long used to a position of conspicuous power and influence and while his well kept hair and beard were strongly touched with white the brown clear lighted eyes that looked from under their shaggy brows told of an intellect unclouded by the shadows of many years 
3083_7943_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It was a face marked deeply by pride pride of birth of intellect of culture the face of a scholar and poet but it was more it was the countenance of one fairly staggering under a burden of disappointment and grief 
3083_7943_000013_000000	train-clean-360	As the stranger walked he looked searchingly into the mists on every hand and paused frequently as if questioning the proper course 
none	none	Suddenly he stepped quickly forward His ear had caught the sharp ring of a horse s shoe on a flint rock somewhere in the mists on the mountain side above It was Jed Holland coming down the trail with a week s supply of corn meal in a sack across his horse s back 
3083_7943_000014_000000	train-clean-360	As the figure of the traveler emerged from the mists the native checked his horse to greet the newcomer with the customary salutation of the backwoods Howdy 
3083_7943_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The man returned Jed s greeting cordially and resting his satchel on a rock beside the narrow path added I am very glad to meet you 
3083_7943_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I fear that I am lost 
3083_7943_000016_000000	train-clean-360	The voice was marvelously pure deep and musical and like the brown eyes betrayed the real strength of the man denied by his gray hair and bent form 
none	none	The tones were as different from the high keyed slurring speech of the backwoods as the gentleman himself was unlike any man Jed had ever met 
3083_7943_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The boy looked at the speaker in wide eyed wonder he had a queer feeling that he was in the presence of a superior being 
none	none	Throwing one thin leg over the old mare s neck and waving a long arm up the hill and to the left Jed drawled That thar s Dewey Bal down yonder s Mutton Holler Then turning a little to the right and pointing into the mist with the other hand he continued Compton Ridge is over thar Whar was you tryin to git to Mister
3083_7943_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Where am I trying to get to As the man repeated Jed s question he drew his hand wearily across his brow I I it doesn t much matter boy 
none	none	I suppose I must find some place where I can stay to night 
3083_7943_000018_000002	train-clean-360	Do you live near here 
none	none	Nope Jed answered Hit s a right smart piece to whar I live This here s grindin day an I ve been t mill over on Fall Creek the Matthews mill hit is 
3083_7943_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Hit ll be plumb dark gin I git home 
none	none	I lowed you was a stranger in these parts soon s I ketched sight of you

3083_7943_000019_000003	train-clean-360	What might YER name be Mister 
3083_7943_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The other looking back over the way he had come seemed not to hear Jed s question and the native continued Mine s Holland Pap an Mam they come from Tennessee 
none	none	Pap he s down in th back now an ain t right peart but he ll be round in a little I reckon Preachin Bill he lows hit s good fer a feller t be down in th back onct in a while says if hit warn t fer that we d git to standin so durned proud an straight we d go plumb over backwards A bitter smile crossed the face of the older man He evidently applied the native s philosophy in a way unguessed by Jed
3083_7943_000021_000002	train-clean-360	 Very true very true indeed he mused 
none	none	Then he turned to Jed and asked Is there a house near here
3083_7943_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Jim Lane lives up the trail bout half a quarter 
3083_7943_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Ever hear tell o Jim 
none	none	No I have never been in these mountains before I lowed maybe you d heard tell o Jim or Sammy There s them that lows Jim knows a heap more bout old man Dewey s cave than he lets on his place bein so nigh Reckon you know bout Colonel Dewey him th Bal up thar s named fer Maybe you come t look fer the big mine they say s in th cave

3083_7943_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 No said the other I am not looking for mines of lead or zinc there is greater wealth in these hills and forests young man 
none	none	Law you don t say Jim Wilson allus lowed thar must be gold in these here mountains cause they re so dad burned rough 
3083_7943_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Lemme hep you Mister 
none	none	I d like mighty well t git some clothes like them I do not speak of gold my boy the stranger answered kindly But I must not keep you longer or darkness will overtake us Do you think this mister Lane would entertain me Jed pushed a hand up under his tattered old hat and scratched awhile before he answered Don t know bout th entertainin Mister but most anybody would take you in He turned and looked thoughtfully up the trail I don t guess Jim s to home though cause I see d Sammy a fixin t go over t th Matthews s when I come past 
3083_7943_000028_000002	train-clean-360	You know the Matthews s I reckon 
none	none	There was a hint of impatience now in the deep voice No I told you that I had never been in these mountains before 
3083_7943_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Will mister Matthews keep me do you think 
none	none	Jed who was still looking up the trail suddenly leaned forward and pointing into the timber to the left of the path said in an exciting whisper Look at that Mister yonder thar by that big rock The stranger looking thought he saw a form weird and ghost like in the mist flitting from tree to tree but even as he looked it vanished among the hundreds of fantastic shapes in the gray forest
3083_7943_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 What is it he asked 
3083_7943_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The native shook his head 
3083_7943_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Durned if I know Mister 
none	none	You can t tell There s mighty strange things stirrin on this here mountain an in the Holler down yonder Say Mister did you ever see a hant The gentleman did not understand
3083_7943_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 A hant a ghost some calls em explained Jed 
none	none	Bud Wilson he sure seed old Matt s 
3083_7943_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The other interrupted 
none	none	Really young man I must go It is already late and you know I have yet to find a place to stay for the night Law that s alright Mister replied Jed Ain t no call t worry Stay anywhere Whar do you live when you re to home 
3083_7943_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Again Jed s question was ignored 
3083_7943_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 You think then that mister Matthews will keep me 
none	none	Law yes 
3083_7943_000038_000001	train-clean-360	They ll take anybody in 
3083_7943_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I know they re to home cause they was a fixin t leave the mill when I left bout an hour ago Was the river up much when you come acrost As the native spoke he was still peering uneasily into the woods 
3083_7943_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I did not cross the river 
3083_7943_000039_000001	train-clean-360	How far is it to this Matthews place and how do I go 
3083_7943_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Jest foller this Old Trail 
none	none	Hit ll take you right thar Good road all th way
3083_7943_000040_000003	train-clean-360	 Bout three mile I d say 
none	none	Did you come from Springfield or saint Louis maybe The man lifted his satchel from the rock as he answered No I do not live in either Springfield or saint Louis 
3083_7943_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Thank you very much for your assistance 
3083_7943_000041_000002	train-clean-360	I will go on now for I must hurry or night will overtake me and I shall not be able to find the path 
none	none	Oh hit s a heap lighter when you git up on th hill bove th fog said Jed lowering his leg from the horse s neck and settling the meal sack preparatory to moving But I d a heap rather hit was you than me a goin up on Dewey t night He was still looking up the trail
3083_7943_000042_000002	train-clean-360	 Reckon you must be from Kansas City or Chicago 
3083_7943_000042_000003	train-clean-360	I heard tell they re mighty big towns 
3083_7943_000043_000000	train-clean-360	The stranger s only answer was a curt Good by as his form vanished in the mist 
none	none	Jed turned and dug his heels vigorously in the old mare s flanks as he ejaculated softly Well I ll be dod durned 
3083_7943_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Must be from New York sure 
3083_7943_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Slowly the old man toiled up the mountain up from the mists of the lower ground to the ridge above and as he climbed unseen by him a shadowy form flitted from tree to tree in the dim dripping forest 
3083_7943_000046_000000	train-clean-360	As the stranger came in sight of the Lane cabin a young woman on a brown pony rode out of the gate and up the trail before him and when the man reached the open ground on the mountain above and rounded the shoulder of the hill he saw the pony far ahead loping easily along the little path 
3083_7943_000046_000001	train-clean-360	A moment he watched and horse and rider passed from sight 
3083_7943_000047_000000	train-clean-360	The clouds were drifting far away 
none	none	The western sky was clear with the sun still above the hills 
3083_7943_000047_000002	train-clean-360	In an old tree that leaned far out over the valley a crow shook the wet from his plumage and dried himself in the warm light while far below the mists rolled and on the surface of that gray sea the traveler saw a company of buzzards wheeling and circling above some dead thing hidden in its depth 
none	none	Wearily the man followed the Old Trail toward the Matthews place and always as he went in the edge of the gloomy forest flitted that shadowy form 
3083_7944_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER II 
none	none	SAMMY LANE Preachin Bill says Hit s a plumb shame there ain t more men in th world built like old man Matthews and that thar boy o his n Men like them ought t be as common as th other kind an would be too if folks cared half as much bout breeding folks as they do bout raising hogs an horses 
3083_7944_000004_000000	train-clean-360	mister Matthews was a giant 
3083_7944_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Fully six feet four inches in height with big bones broad shoulders and mighty muscles 
none	none	At log rollings and chopping bees in the field or at the mill or in any of the games in which the backwoodsman tries his strength no one had ever successfully contested his place as the strongest man in the hills 
3083_7944_000004_000003	train-clean-360	And still throughout the country side the old folks tell with pride tales of the marvelous feats of strength performed in the days when Old Matt was young 
3083_7944_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Of the son Young Matt the people called him it is enough to say that he seemed made of the same metal and cast in the same mold as the father a mighty frame softened yet by young manhood s grace a powerful neck and well poised head with wavy red brown hair and blue eyes that had in them the calm of summer skies or the glint of battle steel 
3083_7944_000005_000001	train-clean-360	It was a countenance fearless and frank but gentle and kind and the eyes were honest eyes 
3083_7944_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Anyone meeting the pair as they walked with the long swinging stride of the mountaineer up the steep mill road that gray afternoon would have turned for a second look such men are seldom seen 
3083_7944_000007_000000	train-clean-360	When they reached the big log house that looks down upon the Hollow the boy went at once with his axe to the woodpile while the older man busied himself with the milking and other chores about the barn 
3083_7944_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Young Matt had not been chopping long when he heard coming up the hill the sound of a horse s feet on the Old Trail 
3083_7944_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The horse stopped at the house and a voice that stirred the blood in the young man s veins called Howdy Aunt Mollie 
3083_7944_000009_000000	train-clean-360	missus Matthews appeared in the doorway by her frank countenance and kindly look anyone would have known her at a glance as the boy s mother 
none	none	Land sakes if it ain t Sammy Lane 
3083_7944_000009_000002	train-clean-360	How are you honey 
none	none	I am alright answered the voice I ve come over t stop with you to night Dad s away again Mandy Ford staid with me last night but she had to go home this evenin The big fellow at the woodpile drove his axe deeper into the log
3083_7944_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 It s about time you was a comin over replied the woman in the doorway I was a tellin the menfolks this mornin that you hadn t been nigh the whole blessed week 
3083_7944_000011_000001	train-clean-360	mister Matthews lowed maybe you was sick 
3083_7944_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The other returned with a gay laugh I was never sick a minute in my life that anybody ever heard tell 
3083_7944_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I m powerful hungry though You d better put in another pan of corn bread She turned her pony s head toward the barn 
3083_7944_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Seems like you are always hungry laughed the older woman in return 
none	none	Well just go on out to the barn and the men will take your horse then come right in and I ll mighty soon have something to fill you up 
3083_7944_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Operations at the woodpile suddenly ceased and Young Matt was first at the barn yard gate 
none	none	Miss Sammy Lane was one of those rare young women whose appearance is not to be described One can of course put it down that she was tall beautifully tall with the trimness of a young pine deep bosomed with limbs full rounded fairly tingling with the life and strength of perfect womanhood and it may be said that her face was a face to go with one through the years and to live still in one s dreams when the sap of life is gone and withered and old one sits shaking before the fire a generous loving mouth red lipped full arched with the corners tucked in and perfect teeth between a womanly chin and nose with character enough to save them from being pretty hair dark showing a touch of gold with umber in the shadows a brow full broad set over brown eyes that had never been taught to hide behind their fringed veils but looked always square out at you with a healthy look of good comradeship a gleam of mirth or a sudden wide questioning gaze that revealed depth of soul within 
3083_7944_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But what is the use 
3083_7944_000016_000001	train-clean-360	When all this is written those who knew Sammy will say Tis but a poor picture for she is something more than all this Uncle Ike the postmaster at the Forks did it much better when he said to Preachin Bill the night of the Doin s at the Cove School Ba thundas 
none	none	That gal o Jim Lane s jest plumb fills th whole house WHAT An when she comes a ridin up t th office on that brown pony o hern I ll be dad burned if she don t pretty nigh fill th whole out doors ba thundas 
3083_7944_000016_000005	train-clean-360	What And the little shrivelled up old hillsman who keeps the ferry removed his cob pipe long enough to reply with all the emphasis possible to his squeaky voice She sure do Ike She sure do 
none	none	I ve often thought hit didn t look jest fair fer God lmighty t make sech a woman thout ary man t match her Makes me feel plumb shamed o myself t stand round in th same county with her Hit sure do Ike Greeting the girl the young man opened the gate for her to pass
3083_7944_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I ve been a lookin for you over said Sammy a teasing light in her eyes 
3083_7944_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Didn t you know that Mandy was stoppin with me 
none	none	She s been a dyin to see you I m mighty sorry he replied fastening the gate and coming to the pony s side
3083_7944_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Why didn t you tell me before 
3083_7944_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I reckon she ll get over it alright though he added with a smile as he raised his arms to assist the girl to dismount 
3083_7944_000020_000000	train-clean-360	The teasing light vanished as the young woman placed her hands on the powerful shoulders of the giant and as she felt the play of the swelling muscles that swung her to the ground so easily her face flushed with admiration 
none	none	For the fraction of a minute she stood facing him her hands still on his arms her lips parted as if to speak then she turned quickly away and without a word walked toward the house while the boy pretending to busy himself with the pony s bridle watched her as she went 
3083_7944_000021_000000	train-clean-360	When the girl was gone the big fellow led the horse away to the stable where he crossed his arms upon the saddle and hid his face from the light 
3083_7944_000021_000001	train-clean-360	mister Matthews coming quietly to the door a few minutes later saw the boy standing there and the rugged face of the big mountaineer softened at the sight 
3083_7944_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Quietly he withdrew to the other side of the barn to return later when the saddle and bridle had been removed and the young man stood stroking the pony as the little horse munched his generous feed of corn 
3083_7944_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The elder man laid his hand on the broad shoulder of the lad so like him and looked full into the clear eyes 
3083_7944_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 Is it alright son he asked gruffly and the boy answered as he returned his father s look It s alright Dad 
3083_7944_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Then let s go to the house Mother called supper some time ago 
3083_7944_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Just as the little company were seating themselves at the table the dog in the yard barked loudly 
3083_7944_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Young Matt went to the door The stranger whom Jed had met on the Old Trail stood at the gate 
3083_7944_000025_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER III 
3083_7944_000026_000000	train-clean-360	THE VOICE FROM OUT THE MISTS 
3083_7944_000027_000000	train-clean-360	While Young Matt was gone to the corral in the valley to see that the sheep were safely folded for the night and the two women were busy in the house with their after supper work mister Matthews and his guest sat on the front porch 
3083_7944_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 My name is Howitt Daniel Howitt the man said in answer to the host s question 
3083_7944_000028_000001	train-clean-360	But as he spoke there was in his manner a touch of embarrassment and he continued quickly as if to prevent further question You have two remarkable children sir that boy is the finest specimen of manhood I have ever seen and the girl is remarkable remarkable sir 
none	none	You will pardon me I am sure but I am an enthusiastic lover of my kind and I certainly have never seen such a pair 
3083_7944_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The grim face of the elder Matthews showed both pleasure and amusement 
none	none	You re mistaken Mister the boy s mine alright an he s all that you say an more I reckon 
3083_7944_000029_000002	train-clean-360	I doubt if there s a man in the hills can match him to day not excepting Wash Gibbs an he s a mighty good boy too 
3083_7944_000029_000003	train-clean-360	But the girl is a daughter of a neighbor and no kin at all 
none	none	Indeed exclaimed the other you have only one child then 
3083_7944_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The amused smile left the face of the old mountaineer as he answered slowly There was six boys sir this one Grant is the youngest 
3083_7944_000031_000001	train-clean-360	The others lie over there He pointed with his pipe to where a clump of pines not far from the house showed dark and tall against the last red glow in the sky 
3083_7944_000032_000000	train-clean-360	The stranger glanced at the big man s face in quick sympathy 
none	none	I had only two a boy and a girl he said softly The girl and her mother have been gone these twenty years 
3083_7944_000032_000003	train-clean-360	The boy grew to be a man and now he has left me The deep voice faltered 
none	none	Pardon me sir for speaking of this but my lad was so like your boy there He was all I had and now now I am very lonely sir 
3083_7944_000033_000000	train-clean-360	There is a bond of fellowship in sorrow that knows no conventionalities 
3083_7944_000033_000001	train-clean-360	As the two men sat in the hush of the coming night their faces turned toward the somber group of trees they felt strongly drawn to one another 
3083_7944_000034_000000	train-clean-360	The mountaineer s companion spoke again half to himself I wish that my dear ones had a resting place like that 
none	none	In the crowded city cemetery the ground is always shaken by the tramping of funeral professions He buried his face in his hands 
3083_7944_000035_000000	train-clean-360	For some time the stranger sat thus while his host spoke no word Then lifting his head the man looked away over the ridges just touched with the lingering light and the valley below wrapped in the shadowy mists 
none	none	I came away from it all because they said I must and because I was hungry for this He waved his hand toward the glowing sky and the forest clad hills
3083_7944_000035_000002	train-clean-360	 This is good for me it somehow seems to help me know how big God is 
none	none	One could find peace here surely sir one could find it here peace and strength 
3083_7944_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The mountaineer puffed hard at his pipe for a while then said gruffly Seems that way Mister to them that don t know 
none	none	But many s the time I ve wished to God I d never seen these here Ozarks 
3083_7944_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I used to feel like you do but I can t no more 
3083_7944_000036_000003	train-clean-360	They mind me now of him that blackened my life he used to take on powerful about the beauty of the country and all the time he was a turnin it into a hell for them that had to stay here after he was gone 
3083_7944_000037_000000	train-clean-360	As he spoke anger and hatred grew dark in the giant s face and the stranger saw the big hands clench and the huge frame grow tense with passion 
none	none	Then as if striving to be not ungracious the woodsman said in a somewhat softer tone You can t see much of it this evening though count of the mists 
3083_7944_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It ll fair up by morning I reckon 
3083_7944_000037_000003	train-clean-360	You can see a long way from here of a clear day Mister 
3083_7944_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes indeed replied mister Howitt in an odd tone 
none	none	One could see far from here I am sure We who live in the cities see but a little farther than across the street We spend our days looking at the work of our own and our neighbors hands Small wonder our lives have so little of God in them when we come in touch with so little that God has made
3083_7944_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 You live in the city then when you are at home asked mister Matthews looking curiously at his guest 
none	none	I did when I had a home I cannot say that I live anywhere now 
3083_7944_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Old Matt leaned forward in his chair as if to speak again then paused someone was coming up the hill and soon they distinguished the stalwart form of the son 
3083_7944_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Sammy coming from the house with an empty bucket met the young man at the gate and the two went toward the spring together 
none	none	In silence the men on the porch watched the moon as she slowly pushed her way up through the leafy screen on the mountain wall Higher and higher she climbed until her rays fell into the valley below and the drifting mists from ridge to ridge became a sea of ghostly light 
3083_7944_000042_000001	train-clean-360	It was a weird scene almost supernatural in its beauty 
none	none	Then from down at the spring a young girl s laugh rose clearly and the big mountaineer said in a low tone mister 
3083_7944_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Howitt you ve got education it s easy to see that I ve always wanted to ask somebody like you do you believe in hants 
3083_7944_000043_000002	train-clean-360	Do you reckon folks ever come back once they re dead and gone 
3083_7944_000044_000000	train-clean-360	The man from the city saw that his big host was terribly in earnest and answered quietly No I do not believe in such things mister Matthews but if it should be true I do not see why we should fear the dead 
3083_7944_000045_000000	train-clean-360	The other shook his head I don t know I don t know sir I always said I didn t believe but some things is mighty queer He seemed to be shaping his thought for further speech when again the girl s laugh rang clear along the mountain side 
3083_7944_000045_000001	train-clean-360	The young people were returning from the spring 
3083_7944_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The mountaineer relighted his pipe while Young Matt and Sammy seated themselves on the step and missus Matthews coming from the house joined the group 
3083_7944_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve just naturally got to find somebody to stay with them sheep Dad said the son there ain t nobody there to night and as near as I can make out there s three ewes and their lambs missing 
3083_7944_000047_000001	train-clean-360	There ain t a bit of use in us trying to depend on Pete 
3083_7944_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll ride over on Bear Creek to morrow and see if I can get that fellow Buck told us about returned the father 
3083_7944_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 You find it hard to get help on the ranch inquired the stranger 
3083_7944_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes sir we do answered Old Matt 
none	none	We had a good nough man till about a month ago since then we ve been gettin along the best we could 
3083_7944_000050_000002	train-clean-360	But with some a stayin out on the range an not comin in an the wolves a gettin into the corral at night we ll lose mighty nigh all the profits this year 
3083_7944_000050_000003	train-clean-360	The worst of it is there ain t much show to get a man unless that one over on Bear Creek will come 
3083_7944_000050_000004	train-clean-360	I reckon though he ll be like the rest He sat staring gloomily into the night 
3083_7944_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Is the work so difficult mister Howitt asked 
3083_7944_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Difficult no there ain t nothing to do but tendin to the sheep 
3083_7944_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The man has to stay at the ranch of nights though 
3083_7944_000053_000000	train-clean-360	mister Howitt was wondering what staying at the ranch nights could have to do with the difficulty when up from the valley below from out the darkness and the mists came a strange sound a sound as if someone were singing a song without words 
3083_7944_000053_000001	train-clean-360	So wild and weird was the melody so passionately sweet the voice it seemed impossible that the music should come from human lips 
3083_7944_000053_000002	train-clean-360	It was more as though some genie of the forest clad hills wandered through the mists singing as he went with the joy of his possessions 
none	none	missus Matthews came close to her husband s side and placed her hand upon his shoulder as he half rose from his chair his pipe fallen to the floor 
3083_7944_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Young Matt rose to his feet and moved closer to the girl who was also standing 
none	none	The stranger alone kept his seat and he noted the agitation of the others in wonder For some moments the sound continued now soft and low with the sweet sadness of the wind in the pines then clear and ringing it echoed and reechoed along the mountain now pleadings as though a soul in darkness prayed a gleam of light again rising swelling exultingly as in glad triumph only to die away once more to that moaning wail seeming at last to lose itself in the mists Slowly Old Matt sank back into his seat and the stranger heard him mutter Poor boy poor boy Aunt Mollie was weeping Suddenly Sammy sprang from the steps and running down the walk to the gate sent a clear piercing call over the valley O h h Pete The group on the porch listened intently Again the girl called and yet again O h h Pete But there was no answer It s no use honey said missus Matthews breaking the silence it just ain t no use and the young girl came slowly back to the porch CHAPTER IV A CHAT WITH AUNT MOLLIE When the stranger looked from his window the next morning the valley was still wrapped in its gray blanket But when he and his host came from the house after breakfast the sun had climbed well above the ridge and save a long loosely twisted rope of fog that hung above the distant river the mists were gone The city man exclaimed with delight at the beauty of the scene As they stood watching the sheep white specks in the distance climbing out of the valley where the long shadows still lay to the higher sunlit pastures mister Matthews said We ve all been a talkin about you this mornin mister Howitt and we d like mighty well to have you stop with us for a spell If I understood right you re just out for your health anyway and you ll go a long ways sir before you find a healthier place than this right here We ain t got much such as you re used to I know but what we have is yourn and we d be proud to have you make yourself to home for as long as you d like to stay You see it s been a good while since we met up with anybody like you and we count it a real favor to have you mister Howitt accepted the invitation with evident pleasure and soon after the mountaineer rode away to Bear Creek on his quest for a man to herd sheep Young Matt had already gone with his team to the field on the hillside west of the house and the brown pony stood at the gate ready for Sammy Lane to return to her home on Dewey Bald I d like the best in the world to stay Aunt Mollie she said in answer to missus Matthews protest but you know there is no one to feed the stock and besides Mandy Ford will be back sometime to day The older woman s arm was around the girl as they went down the walk You must come over real often now honey you know it won t be long til you ll be a leavin us for good How do you reckon you ll like bein a fine lady and livin in the city with them big folks The girl s face flushed and her eyes had that wide questioning look as she answered slowly I don t know Aunt Mollie I ain t never seen a sure nough fine lady I reckon them city folks are a heap different from us but I reckon they re just as human It would be nice to have lots of money and pretties but somehow I feel like there s a heap more than that to think about Any how she added brightly I ain t goin for quite a spell yet and you know Preachin Bill says There ain t no use to worry bout the choppin til the dogs has treed the coon I ll sure come over every day missus Matthews kissed the girl and then standing at the gate watched until pony and rider had disappeared in the forest Later Aunt Mollie with a woman s fondness for a quiet chat brought the potatoes she was preparing for dinner to sit with mister Howitt on the porch I declare I don t know what we ll do without Sammy she said I just can t bear to think of her goin away The guest feeling that some sort of a reply was expected asked Is the family moving from the neighborhood No sir there ain t no family to move Just Sammy and her Pa and Jim Lane won t never leave this country again You see Ollie Stewart s uncle his father s brother it is ain t got no children of his own and he wrote for Ollie to come and live with him in the city He s to go to school and learn the business foundry and machine shops or something like that it is and if the boy does what s right he s to get it all some day Ollie and Sammy has been promised ever since the talk first began about his goin but they ll wait now until he gets through his schoolin It ll be mighty nice for Sammy marryin Ollie but we ll miss her awful the whole country will miss her too She s just the life of the neighborhood and everybody lows there never was another girl like her Poor child she ain t had no mother since she was a little trick and she has always come to me for everything like us bein such close neighbors and all But law sir I ain t a blamin her a mite for goin with her Daddy a runnin with that ornery Wash Gibbs the way he does Again the man felt called upon to express his interest Is mister Lane in business with this man Gibbs Law no that is don t nobody know about any business I reckon it s all on account of those old Bald Knobbers they used to hold their meetin s on top of Dewey yonder and folks do say a man was burned there once because he told some of their secrets Well Jim and Wash s daddy and Wash all belonged though Wash himself wasn t much more than a boy then and when the government broke up the gang old man Gibbs was killed and Jim went to Texas It was there that Sammy s Ma died When Jim come back it wasn t long before he was mighty thick again with Wash and his crowd down on the river and he s been that way ever since There s them that says it s the same old gang what s left of them and some thinks too that Jim and Wash knows about the old Dewey mine mister Howitt remembering his conversation with Jed Holland asked encouragingly Is this mine a very rich one Don t nobody rightly know about that sir answered Aunt Mollie This is how it was away back when the Injuns was makin trouble cause the government was movin them west to the territory this old man Dewey lived up there somewhere on that mountain He was a mighty queer old fellow didn t mix up with the settlers at all except Uncle Josh Hensley s boy who wasn t right smart and didn t nobody know where he come from nor nothing but all the same twas him that warned the settlers of the trouble and helped them all through it scoutin and such And one time when they was about out of bullets and didn t have nothin to make more out of Colonel Dewey took a couple of men and some mules up on that mountain yonder in the night and when they got back they was just loaded down with lead but he wouldn t tell nobody where he got it and as long as he was with them the men didn t dare tell Well sir them two men was killed soon after by the Injuns and when the trouble was finally over old Dewey disappeared and ain t never been heard tell of since They say the mine is somewhere s in a big cave but nobody ain t never found it though there s them that says the Bald Knobbers used the cave to hide their stuff in and that s how Jim Lane and Wash Gibbs knows where it is it s all mighty queer You can see for yourself that Lost Creek down yonder just sinks clean out of sight all at once there must be a big hole in there somewhere Aunt Mollie pointed with her knife to the little stream that winds like a thread of light down into the Hollow I tell you sir these hills is pretty to look at but there ain t much here for a girl like Sammy and I don t blame her a mite for wantin to leave It s a mighty hard place to live mister Howitt and dangerous too sometimes The city has its hardships and its dangers too missus Matthews life there demands almost too much at times I often wonder if it is worth the struggle I guess that s so replied Aunt Mollie but it don t seem like it could be so hard as it is here I tell mister Matthews we ve clean forgot the ways of civilized folks altogether though I suppose we ve done as well as most and we hadn t ought to complain The old scholar looked at the sturdy figure in its plain calico dress at the worn hands busy with their homely task and the patient kindly face across which time had ploughed many a furrow in which to plant the seeds of character and worth He thought of other women who had sat with him on hotel verandas at fashionable watering places women gowned in silks and laces women whose soft hands knew no heavier task than the filmy fancy work they toyed with and whose greatest care seemingly was that time should leave upon their faces no record of the passing years And this is the stuff said he to himself that makes possible the civilization that produces them Aloud he said Do you ever talk of going back to your old home No sir not now she rested her wet hands idly on the edge of the pan of potatoes and turned her face toward the clump of pines We used to think we d go back sometime seemed like at first I couldn t stand it then the children come and every time we laid one of them over there I thought less about leavin until now we never talk about it no more Then there was our girl too mister Howitt No sir we won t never leave these hills now Oh you had a daughter too I understood from mister Matthews that your children were all boys Aunt Mollie worked a few moments longer in silence then arose and turned toward the house Yes sir there was a girl she s buried under that biggest pine you see off there a little to one side We we don t never talk about her mister Matthews can t stand it Seems like he ain t never been the same since since it happened Tain t natural for him to be so rough and short he s just as good and kind inside as any man ever was or could be He s real taken with you mister Howitt and I m mighty glad you re goin to stop a spell for it will do him good If it hadn t been for Sammy Lane runnin in every day or two I don t guess he could have stood it at all I sure don t know what we ll do now that she s goin away Then there s there s that at the ranch in Mutton Hollow but I guess I d better not try to tell you about that I wish mister Matthews would though maybe he will You know so much more than us I know most you could help us or tell us about things CHAPTER V JEST NOBODY After the midday meal while walking about the place mister Howitt found a well worn path it led him to the group of pines not far from the house where five rough head stones marked the five mounds placed side by side A little apart from these was another mound alone Beneath the pines the needles made a carpet firm and smooth figured by the wild woodbine that clambered over the graves moss had gathered on the head stones and the wind in the dark branches above moaned ceaselessly About the little plot of ground a rustic fence of poles was built and the path led to a stile by which one might enter the enclosure The stranger seated himself upon the rude steps Below and far away he saw the low hills rolling ridge on ridge like the waves of a great sea until in the blue distance they were so lost in the sky that he could not say which was mountain and which was cloud His poet heart was stirred at sight of the vast reaches of the forest all shifting light and shadows the cool depths of the near by woods with the sunlight filtering through the leafy arches in streaks and patches of gold on green and the wide wide sky with fleets of cloud ships sailing to unseen ports below the hills The man sat very still and as he looked the worn face changed once as if at some pleasing memory he smiled A gray squirrel with bright eyes full of curious regard peeped over the limb of an oak a red bird hopping from bush to bush whistled to his mate and a bob white s quick call came from a nearby thicket The dreamer was aroused at last by the musical tinkle of a bell He turned his face toward the sound but could see nothing The bell was coming nearer it came nearer still Then he saw here and there through the trees small moving patches of white an old ewe followed by two lambs came from behind a clump of bushes and the moving patches of white shaped themselves into other sheep feeding in the timber mister Howitt sat quite still and while the old ewe paused to look at him the lambs took advantage of the opportunity until their mother was satisfied with her inspection and by moving on upset them Soon the whole flock surrounded him and after the first lingering look of inquiry paid no heed to his presence Then from somewhere among the trees came the quick low bark of a dog The man looked carefully in every direction he could see nothing but the sheep yet he felt himself observed Again came the short bark and this time a voice a girl s voice mister Howitt thought said It s alright Brave go on brother And from behind a big rock not far away a shepherd dog appeared followed by a youth of some fifteen years He was a lightly built boy a bit tall for his age perhaps but perfectly erect and his every movement was one of indescribable grace while he managed somehow to wear his rough backwoods garments with an air of distinction as remarkable as it was charming The face was finely molded almost girlish with the large gray eyes and its frame of yellow golden hair It was a sad face when in repose yet wonderfully responsive to every passing thought and mood But the eyes with their strange expression and shifting light proclaimed the lad s mental condition As the boy came forward in a shy hesitating way an expression of amazement and wonder crept into the stranger s face he left his seat and started forward Howard he said Howard That ain t his name Mister his name s Pete returned the youth in low soft tones In the voice and manner of the lad no less than in his face and eyes mister Howitt read his story Unconsciously he echoed the words of mister Matthews Poor Pete The dog lifted his head and looked into the man s face while his tail wagged a joyful greeting and as the man stooped to pat the animal and speak a few kind words a beautiful smile broke over the delicate features of the youth Throwing himself upon the ground he cried Come here Brave and taking the dog s face between his hands said in confidential tones ignoring mister Howitt s presence He s a good man ain t he brother The dog answered with wagging tail We sure like him don t we The dog gave a low bark Listen Brave listen He lifted his face to the tree tops then turned his ear to the ground while the dog too seemed to hearken Again that strange smile illuminated his face Yes yes Brave we sure like him And the tree things like him too brother and the flowers the little flower things that know everything they re all a singin to Pete cause he s come Did you see the flower things in his eyes and hear the tree things a talkin in his voice Brave And see brother the sheep like him too Pointing toward the stranger he laughed aloud The old ewe had come quite close to the man and one of the lambs was nibbling at his trousers leg mister Howitt seated himself on the stile again and the dog released by the youth came to lie down at his feet while the boy seemed to forget his companions and appeared to be listening to voices unheard by them now and then nodding his head and moving his lips in answer The old man looked long and thoughtfully at the youth his own face revealing a troubled mind This then was Pete Poor Pete Howard whispered the man the perfect image then again he said half aloud Howard The boy turned his face and smiled That ain t his name Mister his name s Pete Pete seen you yesterday over on Dewey and Pete he heard the big hills and the woods a singin when you talked But Jed he didn t hear Jed he don t hear nothin but himself he can t But Pete he heard and all Pete s people too And the gray mist things come out and danced along the mountain cause they was so glad you come And Pete went with you along the Old Trail Course though you didn t know Do you like Pete s people Mister He waved his hands to include the forest the mountains and the sky and there was a note of anxiety in the sweet voice as he asked again Do you like Pete s friends Yes indeed I like your friends replied mister Howitt heartily and I would like to be your friend too if you will let me What is your other name The boy shook his head Not me not me he said do you like Pete The man was puzzled Are you not Pete he asked The delicate face grew sad No no no he said in a low moaning tone I m not Pete Pete he lives in here he touched himself on the breast I am I am A look of hopeless bewilderment crept into his eyes I don t know who I am I m jest nobody Nobody can t have no name can he He stood with downcast head then suddenly he raised his face and the shadows lifted as he said But Pete he knows Mister ask Pete A sudden thought came to mister Howitt Who is your father my boy Instantly the brightness vanished again the words were a puzzled moan I ain t got no father Mister I ain t me nobody can t have no father can he The other spoke quickly But Pete had a father who was Pete s father Instantly the gloom was gone and the face was bright again Sure Mister Pete s got a father don t you know Everybody knows that Look He pointed upward to a break in the trees to a large cumulus cloud that had assumed a fantastic shape He lives in them white hills up there See him Mister Sometimes he takes Pete with him up through the sky and course I go along We sail and sail and sail with the big bird things up there while the sky things sing and sometimes we play with the cloud things all day in them white hills Pete says he ll take me away up there where the star things live some day and we won t never come back again and I won t be nobody no more and Aunt Mollie says she reckons Pete knows Course I d hate mighty much to go away from Uncle Matt and Aunt Mollie and Matt and Sammy cause they re mighty good to me but I jest got to go where Pete goes you see cause I ain t nobody and nobody can t be nothin can he The stranger was fascinated by the wonderful charm of the boy s manner and words As the lad s sensitive face glowed or was clouded by each wayward thought and the music of his sweet voice rose and fell mister Howitt told himself that one might easily fancy the child some wandering spirit of the woods and hills Aloud he asked Has Pete a mother too The youth nodded toward the big pine that grew to one side of the group and lowering his voice replied That s Pete s mother mister Howitt pointed to the grave You mean she sleeps there No no not there there He pointed up to the big tree itself She never sleeps don t you hear her He paused The wind moaned through the branches of the pine Drawing closer to the stranger s side the boy whispered She always talks that a way always and it makes Pete feel bad She wants somebody Hear her callin callin callin He ll sure come some day Mister he sure will Say do you know where he is The stranger startled drew back No no my boy certainly not what do you mean who are you Like the moaning of the pines came the reply Nothin Mister nobody can t mean nothin can they I m jest nobody But Pete lives in here ask Pete Is Pete watching the sheep asked mister Howitt anxious to divert the boy s mind to other channels Yes we re a tendin em now but they can t trust us you know when they call Pete he just goes and course I ve got to go long Who is it calls Pete Why they don t you know I lowed you knowed about things They called Pete last night The moonlight things was out and all the shadow things didn t you see them Mister The moonlight things the wind the stars the shadow things and all the rest played with Pete in the shiny mists and course I was along Didn t you hear singin Pete he always sings that a way when the moonlight things is out Seems like he just can t help it But what becomes of the sheep when Pete goes away The boy shook his head sadly Sometimes they get so lost that Young Matt can t never find em sometimes wolves get em it s too bad Mister it sure is Then laughing aloud he clapped his hands There was a feller at the ranch to keep em but he didn t stay Ho Ho he didn t stay you bet he didn t Pete didn t like him Brave didn t like him nothing didn t like him the trees wouldn t talk when he was around the flowers died when he looked at em and the birds all stopped singin and went away over the mountains He didn t stay though Again he laughed You bet he didn t stay Pete knows Why did the man go asked mister Howitt thinking to solve a part of the mystery at least But the only answer he could draw from the boy was Pete knows Pete knows Later when the stranger returned to the house Pete went with him at the big gate they met mister Matthews returning unsuccessful from his trip Hello boy said the big man How s Pete to day The lad went with glad face to the giant mountaineer It was clear that the two were the warmest friends Pete s mighty glad to day cause he s come He pointed to mister Howitt Does Pete like him The boy nodded All Pete s people like him Ask him to keep the sheep Uncle Matt He won t be scared at the shadow things in the night mister Matthews smiled as he turned to his guest Pete never makes a mistake in his judgment of men mister Howitt He s different from us ordinary folks as you can see but in some things he knows a heap more I m mighty glad he s took up with you sir All day I ve been thinking I d tell you about some things I don t like to talk about I feel after last night like you d understand maybe and might help me you having education But still I ve been a little afraid us being such strangers I know I m right now cause Pete says so If you weren t the kind of a man I think you are he d never took to you like he has That night the mountaineer told the stranger from the city the story that I have put down in the next chapter CHAPTER VI THE STORY Slowly the big mountaineer filled his cob pipe with strong home grown tobacco watching his guest keenly the while from under heavy brows Behind the dark pines the sky was blood red and below Mutton Hollow was fast being lost in the gathering gloom When his pipe was lighted Old Matt said Well sir I reckon you think some things you seen and heard since you come last night are mighty queer I ain t sayin neither but what you got reasons for thinkin so mister Howitt made no reply And after puffing a few moments in silence the other continued If it weren t for what you said last night makin me feel like I wanted to talk to you and Pete a takin up with you the way he has I wouldn t be a tellin you what I am goin to now There s some trails mister Howitt that ain t pleasant to go back over I didn t low to ever go over this one again Did you and Pete talk much this afternoon In a few words mister Howitt told of his meeting with the strange boy and their conversation When he had finished the big man smoked in silence It was as if he found it hard to begin From a tree on the mountain side below a screech owl sent up his long quavering call a bat darted past in the dusk and away over on Compton Ridge a hound bayed The mountaineer spoke That s Sam Wilson s dog Ranger must a started a fox The sound died away in the distance Old Matt began his story Our folks all live back in Illinois And if I do say so they are as good stock as you ll find anywhere But there was a lot of us and I always had a notion to settle in a new country where there was more room like and land wasn t so dear so when wife and I was married we come out here I recollect we camped at the spring below Jim Lane s cabin on yon side of Old Dewey there That was before Jim was married and a wild young buck he was too as ever you see The next day wife and I rode along the Old Trail til we struck this gap and here we ve been ever since We ve had our ups and downs like most folks sir and sometimes it looked like they was mostly downs but we got along and last fall I bought in the ranch down there in the Hollow The boy was just eighteen and we thought then that he d be makin his home there some day I don t know how that ll be now but there was another reason too why we wanted the place as you ll see when I get to it There was five other boys as I told you last night The oldest two would have been men now The girl his voice broke the girl she come third she was twenty when we buried her over there That was fifteen year ago come the middle of next month Everybody lowed she was a mighty pretty baby and bein the only girl I reckon we made more of her than we did of the boys She growed up into a mighty fine young woman too strong and full of fire and go like Sammy Lane Seems to wife and me when Sammy s round that it s our own girl come back and we ve always hoped that she and Grant would take the ranch down yonder but I reckon that s all over now that Ollie Stewart has come into such a fine thing in the city Anyway it ain t got nothing to do with this that I m a tellin you She didn t seem to care nothin at all for none of the neighbor boys like most girls do she d go with them and have a good time alright but that was all Peared like she d rather be with her brothers or her mother or me Well one day when we was out on the range a ridin for stock she d often go with me that way we met a stranger over there at the deer lick in the big low gap coming along the Old Trail He was as fine a lookin man as you ever see sir big and grand like with lightish hair kind of wavy and a big mustache like his hair and fine white teeth showing when he smiled He was sure good lookin damn him and with his fine store clothes and a smooth easy way of talkin and actin he had tain t no wonder she took up with him We all did I used to think God never made a finer body for a man I know now that Hell don t hold a meaner heart than the one in that same fine body And that s somethin that bothers me a heap mister Howitt As I say our girl was built like Sammy Lane and so far as looks go she was his dead match I used to wonder when I d look at them together if there ever was such another fine lookin pair I ain t a goin to tell you his name there ain t no call to as I can see There might be some decent man named the same But he was one of these here artist fellows and had come into the hills to paint he said A smothered exclamation burst from the listener mister Matthews not noticing continued He sure did make a lot of pictures and they seemed mighty nice to us though of course we didn t know nothin about such things There was one big one he made of Maggie that was as natural as life He was always drawin of her in one way or another and had a lot of little pictures that didn t amount to much and that he didn t never finish But this big one he worked at off and on all summer It was sure fine with her a standin by the ranch spring holdin out a cup of water and smilin like she was offerin you a drink It was well that the night had fallen At Old Matt s words the stranger shrank back in his chair his hand raised as if to ward off a deadly blow He made a sound in his throat as if he would cry out but could not from horror or fear But the darkness hid his face and the mountaineer with mind intent upon his story did not heed He took an old cabin at the foot of the hill near where the sheep corral is now and fixed it up to work in The shack had been built first by old man Dewey him that the mountain s named after It was down there he painted the big picture of her a standin by the big spring We never thought nothin about her bein with him so much Country folks is that way mister Howitt though we ought to knowed better we sure ought to knowed better The old giant paused and for some time sat with his head bowed his forgotten pipe on the floor Well he began again he stopped with us all that summer and then one day he went out as usual and didn t come back We hunted the hills out for signs thinkin maybe he met up with some trouble He d sent all his pictures away the week before Jim Lane haulin them to the settlement for him The girl was nigh about wild and rode with me all durin the hunt and once when we saw some buzzards circlin she gave a little cry and turned so white that I suspicioned maybe she got to thinkin more of him than we knew Then one afternoon when we were down yonder in the Hollow she says all of a sudden like Daddy it ain t no use a ridin no more He ain t met up with no trouble He s left all the trouble with us She looked so piqued and her eyes were so big and starin that it come over me in a flash what she meant She saw in a minute that I sensed it and just hung her head and we come home She just kept a gettin worse and worse mister Howitt peared to fade away like like I watched them big glade lilies do when the hot weather comes About the only time she would show any life at all was when someone would go for the mail when she d always be at the gate a waitin for us Then one day a letter come I brung it myself She give a little cry when I handed it to her and run into the house most like her old self I went on out to the barn to put up my horse thinkin maybe it was goin to be alright after all but pretty soon I heard a scream and then a laugh Fore God sir that laugh s a ringin in my ears yet She was ravin mad when I got to her a laughin and a screechin and tryin to hurt herself all the while callin for him to come I read the letter afterwards It told over and over how he loved her and how no woman could ever be to him what she was said they was made for each other and all that and then it went on to say how he couldn t never see her again and told about what a grand old family his was and how his father was so proud and expected such great things from him that he didn t dare tell them bein the last of this here old family and her bein a backwoods girl without any schoolin or nothin My God O my God faltered the stranger s voice in the darkness Old Matt talked on in a hard easy tone Course it was all wrote out nice and smooth like he talked but that s the sense of it He finished it by sayin that he would be on his way to the old country when the letter reached her and that it wouldn t be no use to try to find him The girl quieted down after a spell but her mind never come back She wasn t just to say plumb crazy but she seemed kind o dazed and lost like and wouldn t take no notice of nobody Acted all the time like she was expectin him to come And she d stand out there by the gate for hours at a time watchin the Old Trail and talkin low to herself Pete is her boy mister Howitt and as you ve seen he ain t just right Seems like he was marked some way in his mind like you ve seen other folks marked in their bodies We ve done our best by the boy sir but I don t guess he ll ever be any better Once for a spell we tried keepin him to home but he got right sick and would o died sure if we hadn t let him go it was pitiful to see him Everybody lows there won t nothin in the woods hurt him nohow so we let him come and go as he likes and he just stops with the neighbors wherever he happens in Folks are all as good to him as they can be cause everybody knows how it is You see sir people here don t think nothin of a wood s colt nohow but we was raised different As wife says we ve most forgot civilized ways but I guess there s some things a man that s been raised right can t never forget She died when Pete was born and the last thing she said was He ll come Daddy he ll sure come Pete says the wind singin in that big pine over her grave is her a callin for him yet It s mighty queer how the boy got that notion but you see that s the way it is with him And that ain t all sir The big man moved his chair nearer the other and lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper Folks say she s come back There s them that swears they ve seen her round the old cabin where they used to meet when he painted her picture the big one you know Just before I bought the ranch it was first and that s why we can t get no one to stay with the sheep I don t know mister Howitt I don t know I ve thought a heap about it I ain t never seen it myself and it pears to me that if she COULD come back at all she d sure come to her old Daddy Then again I figure it that bein took the way she was part of her dead so to speak from the time she got that letter and her mind so set on his comin back that maybe somehow you see that maybe she is sort a waitin for him there Many s the time I have prayed all night that God would let me meet him again just once or that proud father of his n just once sir I d glad go to Hell if I could only meet them first If she is waitin for him down there he ll come he ll sure come Hell couldn t hold him against such as that and when he comes Unconsciously as he spoke the last sentences the giant s voice took a tone of terrible meaning and he slowly rose from his seat When he uttered the last word he was standing erect his muscles tense his powerful frame shaken with passion There was an inarticulate cry of horror as the mountaineer s guest started to his feet A moment he stood then sank back into his chair a cowering shivering heap Long into the night the stranger walked the floor of his little room under the roof his face drawn and white whispering half aloud things that would have startled his unsuspecting host MY boy MY boy MINE To do such a thing as that Howard Howard O Christ that I should live to be glad that you are dead And that picture His masterpiece the picture that made his fame the picture he would never part with and that we could never find I see it all now Just God what a thing to carry on one s soul Once he paused to stand at the window looking down upon the valley The moon had climbed high above the mountain but beneath the flood of silver light the shadows lay dark and deep in Mutton Hollow Then as he stood there from out the shadowy gloom came the wild weird song they had heard the evening before The man at the window groaned The song sank to a low moaning wail and he seemed to hear again the wind in the pine above the grave of the murdered girl She was calling calling would he come back Back from the grave could he come The words of the giant mountaineer seemed burned into the father s brain Hell couldn t hold him against such as that Then the man with the proud face the face of a scholar and poet drew back from the window shaking with a fear he could not control He crept into a corner and crouched upon the floor With wide eyes he stared into the dark He prayed And this is how it came about that the stranger who followed the Old Trail along the higher sunlit ground followed also the other trail down into the valley where the gloomy shadows are there to live at the ranch near the haunted cabin the shepherd of Mutton Hollow CHAPTER VII WHAT IS LOVE Sammy Lane rode very slowly on her way home from the Matthews place that morning after the stranger had arrived She started out at her usual reckless gait but that was because she knew that Young Matt was watching her Once in the timber the brown pony was pulled to a walk and by the time they came out into the open again the little horse unrebuked by his mistress was snatching mouthfuls of grass as he strolled along the trail Sammy was thinking thinking very seriously Aunt Mollie s parting question had stirred the girl deeply Sammy had seen few people who did not belong to the backwoods The strangers she had met were hunters or cattlemen and these had all been in dress and manner not unlike the natives themselves This man who had come so unexpectedly out of the mists the night before was unlike anyone the young woman had ever known Like Jed Holland she felt somehow as if he were a superior being The Matthews family were different in many ways from those born and raised in the hills And Sammy s father too was different But this stranger it was quite as though he belonged to another world Coming to the big low gap the girl looked far away to the blue line of hills miles and miles away The stranger had come from over these she thought and then she fell to wondering what that world beyond the farthest cloud like ridge was like Of all the people Sammy had ever known young Stewart was the only one who had seen even the edge of that world to tell her about it Her father and her friends the Matthews s never talked of the old days She had known Ollie from a child With Young Matt they had gone to and from the log school house along the same road Once before mister Stewart s death the boy had gone with his father for a day s visit to the city and ever after had been a hero to his backwoods schoolmates It was this distinction really that first won Sammy s admiration and made them sweethearts before the girl s skirts had touched the tops of her shoes Before the woman in her was fairly awake she had promised to be his wife and they were going away now to live in that enchanted land Spying an extra choice bunch of grass a few steps to one side of the path Brownie turned suddenly toward the valley and the girl s eyes left the distant ridge for the little cabin and the sheep corral in Mutton Hollow Sammy always spoke of that cabin as Young Matt s house And all unbidden now the thought came who would live with the big fellow down there in the valley when she had gone far away to make her home with Ollie and his people in the city An impatient tug at the reins informed Brownie that his mistress was aware of his existence and for a time the pony was obliged to pass many a luscious bunch of grass But soon the reins fell slack again The little horse moved slowly and still more slowly until by the relaxed figure of his rider he knew it was safe to again browse on the grass along the path So wondering dreaming Sammy Lane rode down the trail that morning the trail that is nobody knows how old And on the hill back of the Matthews house a team was standing idle in the middle of the field At the big rock on the mountain side where the trail seems to pause a moment before starting down to the valley the girl slipped from her saddle and leaving Brownie to wander at will climbed to her favorite seat Half reclining in the warm sunshine she watched the sheep feeding near and laughed aloud as she saw the lambs with wagging tails greedily suckling at their mother s sides near by in a black haw bush a mother bird sat on her nest a gray mare with a week old colt following on unsteady legs came over the ridge and not far away a mother sow with ten squealing pigs came out of the timber Keeping very still the young woman watched until they disappeared around the mountain Then lifting her arms above her head she stretched her lithe form out upon the warm rocky couch with the freedom and grace of a wild thing of the woods Sammy Lane knew nothing of the laws and customs of the so called best society Her splendid young womanhood was not the product of those social traditions and rules that kill the instinct of her kind before it is fairly born She was as free and as physically perfect as any of the free creatures that lived in the hills And keenly alive to the life that throbbed and surged about her her woman s heart and soul responded to the spirit of the season The droning of the bees in the blossoms that grew in a cranny of the rock the tinkle tinkle of the sheep bells as the flock moved slowly in their feeding and the soft breathing of Mother Earth was in her ears while the gentle breeze that stirred her hair came heavy with the smell of growing things Lying so she looked far up into the blue sky where a buzzard floated on lazy wings If she were up there she perhaps could see that world beyond the hills Then suddenly a voice came to her Aunt Mollie s voice How do you reckon you ll like bein a fine lady Sammy and a livin in the city with the big folks The girl turned on her side and rising on one elbow looked again at Mutton Hollow with its little cabin half hidden in the timber And as she looked slowly her rich red life colored cheek and neck and brow With a gesture of impatience Sammy turned away to her own home on the southern slope of the mountain just in time to see a young woman ride into the clearing and dismount before the cabin door It was her friend Mandy Ford The girl on the rock whistled to her pony and mounting made her way down the hill All that day the strange guest at the Matthews place was the one topic of conversation between the two girls Shucks said Mandy when Sammy had finished a very minute description of mister Howitt he s jest some revenue like s not Sammy tossed her head Revenue you ought to see him Revenues don t come in no such clothes as them and they don t talk like him neither Can t tell bout revenues retorted the other Don t you mind how that n fooled everybody over on th bend last year He was jest as common as common and folks all lowed he was just one of em But this one ain t like anybody that we ever met up with and that s jest it returned Sammy Mandy shook her head You say he ain t huntin he sure ain t buyin cattle this time o year and he ain t a wantin t locate a comin in on foot what else can he be but a revenue To which Sammy replied with an unanswerable argument Look a here Mandy Ford you jest tell me would a low down revenue ask a blessin like Parson Bigelow does At this Mandy gave up the case saying in despair Well what is he a doin here then Tain t likely he s done come into th woods fer nothin He told Old Matt that he was sick and tired of it all answered the other Did he look like he was ailin Sammy replied slowly I don t reckon it s that kind of sickness he meant and when you look right close into his eyes he does pear kind o used up like In connection with this discussion it was easy to speak of Miss Lane s fairy prospects for was not the stranger from the city and was not Sammy going to live in that land of wonders The two girls were preparing for the night when Sammy who was seated on the edge of the bed paused with one shoe off to ask thoughtfully Mandy what is love anyhow Mandy looked surprised I reckon you ought to know she said with a laugh Ollie s been a hangin round you ever since I can remember Sammy was struggling with a knot in the other shoe lace Yes she admitted slowly I reckon I had ought to know but what do you say it is Mandy Why hit s hit s jest a caring fer somebody more n fer ary one else in th whole world Is that all The knot was still stubborn No hit ain t all Hit s a goin t live with somebody an a lettin him take care o you stead o your folks Sammy was still struggling with the knot An hit s a cookin an a scrubbin an a mendin fer him an an sometimes hit s a splittin wood an a doin chores too an I reckon that s all Just here the knot came undone and the shoe dropped to the floor with a thud Sammy sat upright No it ain t Mandy it s a heap more n that it s a nursin babies and a takin care of em till they re growed up and then when they re big enough to take care o themselves and you re old and in the way like Grandma Bowles it s a lookin back over it all and bein glad you done married the man you did It s a heap more n livin with a man Mandy it s a doin all that without ever once wishin he was somebody else This was too much for Mandy she blushed and giggled then remarked as she gazed admiringly at her friend You ll look mighty fine Sammy when you get fixed up with all them pretties you ll have when you an Ollie git married I wish my hair was bright an shiny like yourn How do you reckon you ll like bein a fine lady anyhow Here it was again Sammy turned upon her helpless friend with How do I know if I would like it or not What is bein a fine lady anyhow Why bein a fine lady is is livin in a big house with carpets on th floor an lookin glasses an not havin no work t do an wearin pretty clothes with lots of rings an things an an she paused then finished in triumph an a ridin in a carriage That wide questioning look was in Sammy s eyes as she returned It s a heap more n that Mandy I don t jest sense what it is but I know tain t all them things that makes a sure nough lady Tain t the clothes he wears that makes mister Howitt different from the folks we know He don t wear no rings and he walks He s jest different cause he s different and would be no matter what he had on or where he was This too was beyond Mandy Sammy continued as she finished her preparations for retiring This here house is plenty big enough for me least wise it would be if it had one more room like the cabin in Mutton Hollow carpets would be mighty dirty and unhandy to clean when the men folks come trampin in with their muddy boots I wouldn t want to wear no dresses so fine I couldn t knock round in the brush with them and it would be awful to have nothin to do as for a carriage I wouldn t swap Brownie for a whole city full of carriages She slipped into bed and stretched out luxuriously Do you reckon I could be a fine lady and be as I am now a livin here in the hills The next day Mandy went back to her home on Jake Creek And in the evening Sammy s father with Wash Gibbs returned both men and horses showing the effects of a long hard ride CHAPTER VIII WHY AIN T WE GOT NO FOLKS Preachin Bill says There s a heap o difference in most men but Jim Lane now he s more different than ary man you ever seed Ain t no better neighbor n Jim anywhere Ride out o his way any time t do you a favor But you bet there ain t ary man lives can ask Jim any fool questions while Jim s a lookin at him Tried it onct myself Jim was a waitin at th ferry fer Wash Gibbs an we was a talkin long right peart bout crops an th weather an such when I says says I like a dumb ol fool How d you like it down in Texas Jim when you was there that time I gonies His jaw shet with a click like he d cocked a pistol an that look o hisn like he was a seein plumb through you come int his eyes an he says says he quiet like D you reckon that rain over on James yesterday raised th river much An fore I knowed it I was a tellin him how that ol red bull o mine treed th Perkins boys when they was a possum huntin Many stories of the Bald Knobber days when the law of the land was the law of rifle and rope were drifting about the country side and always when these tales were recited the name of Jim Lane was whispered while the bolder ones wondered beneath their breath where Jim went so much with that Wash Gibbs whose daddy was killed by the Government mister Lane was a tall man well set up with something in his face and bearing that told of good breeding southern blood one would say by the dark skin and the eyes hair and drooping mustache of black His companion Wash Gibbs was a gigantic man taller and heavier even than the elder Matthews but more loosely put together than Old Matt with coarse heavy features and as Grandma Bowles said the look of a sheep killin dog Grandma being very near her journey s end could tell the truth even about Wash Gibbs but others spoke of the giant only in whispers save when they spoke in admiration of his physical powers As the two men swung stiffly from their saddles Sammy came running to greet her father with a kiss of welcome this little exhibition of affection between parent and child was one of the many things that marked the Lanes as different from the natives of that region Your true backwoodsman carefully hides every sign of his love for either family or friends Wash Gibbs stood looking on with an expression upon his brutal face that had very little of the human in it Releasing his daughter mister Lane said Got anything to eat honey We re powerful hungry Wash lowed we d better tie up at the river but I knew you d be watching for me The horses are plumb beat And Gibbs broke in with a coarse laugh I wouldn t mind killin a hoss neither if I was t git what you do at th end o th ride To this Jim made no reply but began loosening the saddle girths while Sammy only said as she turned toward the house I ll have supper ready for you directly Daddy While the host was busy caring for his tired horse the big man who did not remove the saddle from his mount followed the girl into the cabin Can t you even tell a feller Howdy he exclaimed as he entered the kitchen I did tell you Howdy replied the girl sharply stirring up the fire Pears like you might o been a grain warmer about hit growled the other seating himself where he could watch her If I d been Young Matt er that skinny Ollie Stewart you d a been keen enough Sammy turned and faced him with angry eyes Look a here Wash Gibbs I done tol you last Thursday when you come for Daddy that you d better let me alone I don t like you and I don t aim to ever have anything to do with you You done fixed yourself with me that time at the Cove picnic I ll tell Daddy about that if you don t mind I don t want to make no trouble but you just got to quit pestering me The big fellow sneered I lowed you might change your mind bout that some day Jim ain t goin t say nothin t me an if he did words don t break no bones I m a heap th best man in this neck o th woods an your Paw knows hit You know it too Under his look the blood rushed to the girl s face in a burning blush In spite of her anger she dropped her eyes and without attempting a reply turned to her work A moment later mister Lane entered the room a single glance at his daughter s face a quick look at Wash Gibbs as the bully sat following with wolfish eyes every movement of the girl and Jim stepped quietly in front of his guest At the same moment Sammy left the house for a bucket of water and Wash turned toward his host with a start to find the dark faced man gazing at him with a look that few men could face with composure Without a word Jim s right hand crept stealthily inside his hickory shirt where a button was missing For a moment Gibbs tried to return the look He failed Something he read in the dark face before him some meaning light in those black eyes made him tremble and he felt rather than saw Jim s hand resting quietly now inside the hickory shirt near his left arm pit The big man s face went white beneath the tan his eyes wavered and shifted he hung his head and shuffled his feet uneasily like an overgrown school boy brought sharply to task by the master Then Jim his hand still inside his shirt drawled softly but with a queer metallic ring in his voice Do you reckon it s a goin t storm again At the commonplace question the bully drew a long breath and looked around We might have a spell o weather he muttered but I don t guess it ll be t night Then Sammy returned and they had supper Next to his daughter Jim Lane loved his violin and with good reason for the instrument had once belonged to his great grandfather who tradition says was a musician of no mean ability Preachin Bill lowed there was a heap o difference between a playin a violin an jest fiddlin You wouldn t know some fellers was a makin music if you didn t see em a pattin their foot but hit ain t that a way with Jim Lane He sure do make music real music As no one ever questioned Bill s judgment it is safe to conclude that mister Lane inherited something of his great grandfather s ability along with his treasured instrument When supper was over and Wash Gibbs had gone on his way Jim took the violin from its peg above the fireplace and tucking it lovingly under his chin gave himself up to his favorite pastime while Sammy moved busily about the cabin putting things right for the night When her evening tasks were finished the girl came and stood before her father At once the music ceased and the violin was laid carefully aside Sammy seated herself on her father s knee Law child but you re sure growin up said Jim with a mock groan at her weight Yes Daddy I reckon I m about growed I ll be nineteen come Christmas O shucks ejaculated the man It wasn t more n last week that you was washin doll clothes down by the spring The young woman laughed I didn t wash no doll clothes last week she said Then her voice changed and that wide questioning look the look that made one think so of her father came into her eyes There s something I want to ask you Daddy Jim You you know Ollie s goin away an an an I was thinkin about it all day yesterday an Daddy why ain t we got no folks mister Lane stirred uneasily Sammy continued There s the Matthews s they ve got kin back in Illinois Mandy Ford s got uncles and aunts over on Lang Creek Jed Holland s got a grandad and mam and even Preachin Bill talks about a pack o kin folks over in Arkansaw Why ain t we got no folks Daddy The man gazed long and thoughtfully at the fresh young face of his child and the black eyes looked into the brown eyes keenly as he answered her question with another question Do you reckon you love him right smart honey Are you sure dead sure you ain t thinkin of what he s got stead of what he is I know it ll be mighty nice for you to be one of the fine folks and they re big reasons why you ought but it s goin to take a mighty good man to match you a mighty good man And it s the man you ve got to live with not his money Ollie s good Daddy she returned in a low voice her eyes fixed upon the floor I know I know replied Jim He wouldn t do nobody no harm he s good enough that way and I ain t a faultin him But you ought to have a MAN a sure enough good man But tell me Daddy why ain t we got no folks The faintest glimmer of a smile came into the dark face You re sure growed up girl you re sure growed up girl you sure are An I reckon you might as well know Then he told her CHAPTER IX SAMMY LANE S FOLKS It began on a big southern plantation where there were several brothers and sisters with a gentleman father of no little pride and a lady mother of equal pride and great beauty With much care for detail Jim drew a picture of the big mansion with its wide lawns flower gardens and tree bordered walks with its wealth of culture its servants and distinguished guests for said he When you get to be a fine lady you ought to know that you got as good blood as the best of the thorough breds And Sammy interrupting his speech with a kiss bade him go on with his story Then he told how the one black sheep of that proud southern flock had been cast forth from the beautiful home while still hardly grown and how with his horse gun and violin the wanderer had come into the heart of the Ozark wilderness when the print of moccasin feet was still warm on the Old Trail Jim sketched broadly here and for some reason did not fully explain the cause of his banishment neither did he comment in any way upon its justice or injustice Time passed and a strong clear eyed clean limbed deep bosomed mountain lass with all the mastering passion of her kind mated the free half wild young hunter and they settled in the cabin by the spring on the southern slope of Dewey Then the little one came and in her veins there was mingled the blue blood of the proud southerners and the warm red life of her wilderness mother Again Jim s story grew rich in detail Holding his daughter at arm s length and looking at her through half closed eyes he said You re like her honey you re mighty like her same eyes same hair same mouth same build same way of movin strong but smooth and free like She could run clean to the top of Dewey or sit a horse all day Do you ever get tired girl Sammy laughed and shook her head I ve run from here to the signal tree lots of times Daddy You re like the old folks too mused Jim like them in what you think and say Tell me more said the girl Seems like I remember bein in a big wagon and there was a woman there too was she my mother Jim nodded and unconsciously lowered his voice as he said It was in the old Bald Knobber time Things happened in them days honey Many s the night I ve seen the top of old Dewey yonder black with men It was when things was broke up that that your mother and me thought we could do better in Texas so we went Jim was again sketching broadly Your mother left us there girl Seemed like she couldn t stand it bein away from the hills or somethin and she just give up I never did rightly know how it was We buried her out there way out on the big plains I remember her a little whispered Sammy Jim continued Then after a time you and me come back to the old place Your mother named you Samantha girl but bein as there wasn t no boy I always called you Sammy It seems right enough that way now for you ve sure been more n a son to me since we ve been alone and that s one reason why I learned you to ride and shoot with the best of them There s them that says I ain t done right by you bringing you up without ary woman about the place and I don t know as I have but somehow I couldn t never think of no woman as I ought after living with your mother And then there was Aunt Mollie to learn you how to cook and do things about the house I counted a good bit too on the old stock and it sure showed up right You re like the old folks girl in the way you think but you re like your mother in the way you look Sammy s arms went around her father s neck You re a good man Daddy Jim the best Daddy a girl ever had and if I ain t all bad it s on account of you There was a queer look on the man s dark face He had sketched some parts of his tale with a broad hand indeed The girl raised her head again But Daddy I wish you d do something for me I I don t like Wash Gibbs to be a comin here I wish you d quit ridin with him Daddy I m I m afeared of him he looks at me so He s a sure bad one I know he is Daddy Jim laughed and again there was that odd metallic note in his voice I ve knowed him a long time honey Me and his daddy was was together when he died and you used to sit on Wash s knee when you was a little tad Not that he s so mighty much older than you but he was a man s size at fifteen You don t understand girl but I ve got to go with him sometimes But don t you fret Wash Gibbs ain t goin to hurt me and he won t come here more n I can help either Then he changed the subject abruptly Tell me what you ve been doin while I was away Sammy told of her visit to their friends at the Matthews place and of the stranger who had come into the neighborhood As the girl talked her father questioned her carefully and several times the metallic note crept into his soft drawling speech while into his eyes came that peculiar searching look as if he would draw from his daughter even more than she knew of the incident Once he rose and going to the door stood looking out into the night Sammy finished with her answer to Mandy Ford s opinion of the stranger You don t reckon a revenue would ask a blessin do you Daddy Seems like he just naturally wouldn t dast God would make the victuals stick in his throat and choke him sure Jim laughed as he replied I don t know girl I never heard of a revenue s doin such But a feller can t tell When Sammy left him to retire for the night her father picked up the violin again and placed it beneath his chin as if to play but he did not touch the strings and soon hung the instrument in its place above the mantel Then going to the doorway he lighted his pipe and for a full hour sat looking up the Old Trail toward the Matthews place his right hand thrust into the bosom of his hickory shirt where the button was missing CHAPTER X A FEAT OF STRENGTH AND A CHALLENGE What the club is to the city man and the general store or postoffice to the citizens of the country village the mill is to the native of the backwoods Made to saw the little rough lumber he needs in his primitive building or to grind his corn into the rough meal that is his staff of life the mill does more for the settler than this it brings together the scattered population it is the news center the heart of the social life and the hub of the industrial wheel On grinding day the Ozark mountaineer goes to mill on horse back his grist in a sack behind the saddle or indeed taking place of the saddle itself The rule is first come first served So while waiting his turn or waiting for a neighbor who will ride in the same direction the woodsman has time to contribute his share to the gossip of the country side or to take part in the discussions that are of more or less vital interest When the talk runs slow there are games pitching horse shoes borrowed from the blacksmith shop there is always a blacksmith shop near by running or jumping contests or wrestling or shooting matches Fall Creek Mill owned and operated by mister Matthews and his son was located on Fall Creek in a deep narrow valley about a mile from their home A little old threshing engine one of the very first to take the place of the horse power and itself in turn already pushed to the wall by improved competitors rolled the saw or the burr This engine which had been rescued by mister Matthews from the scrap pile of a Springfield machine shop was accepted as evidence beyond question of the superior intelligence and genius of the Matthews family In fact Fall Creek Mill gave the whole Mutton Hollow neighborhood such a tone of up to date enterprise that folks from the Bend or the mouth of the James looked upon the Mutton Hollow people with no little envy and awe not to say even jealousy The settlers came to the Matthews mill from far up the creek crossing and recrossing the little stream from Iron Spring and from Gardner beyond Sand Ridge following faint twisting bridle paths through the forest from the other side of Dewey Bald along the Old Trail from the Cove and from the Postoffice at the Forks down the wagon road through the pinery and from Wolf Ridge and the head of Indian Creek beyond climbing the rough mountains Even from the river bottoms they came yellow and shaking with ague to swap tobacco and yarns and to watch with never failing interest the crazy old engine as Young Matt patted and coaxed and flattered her into doing his will They began coming early that grinding day two weeks after mister Howitt had been installed at the ranch But the young engineer was ready with a good head of steam in the old patched boiler and the smoke was rising from the rusty stack in a long twisting line above the motionless tree tops It was a great day for Young Matt great because he knew that Sammy Lane would be coming to mill he would see her and talk with her perhaps if he were quick enough he might even lift her from the brown pony It was a great day too because Ollie Stewart would be saying good by and before to morrow would be on his way out of the hills Not that it mattered whether Ollie went or not It was settled that Sammy was going to marry young Stewart that was what mattered And Young Matt had given her up And as he had told his father in the barn that day it was alright But still still it was a great day because Ollie would be saying good by It was a great day in Young Matt s life too because on that day he would issue his challenge to the acknowledged champion of the country side Wash Gibbs But Young Matt did not know this until afterwards for it all came about in a very unexpected way The company had been discussing the new arrival in the neighborhood and speculating as to the probable length of mister Howitt s stay at the ranch and while Young Matt was in the burr house with his father they had gone over yet again the familiar incidents of the ghost story how Budd Wilson seen her as close as from here t th shop yonder How Joe Gardner s mule had gone plumb hog wild when he tried to ride past the ol ruins near th ranch And how Lem Wheeler while out hunting that roan steer o hisn had heard a moanin an a wailin under the bluff Upon Young Matthews returning to his engine the conversation had been skilfully changed to Ollie Stewart and his remarkable good fortune From Ollie and his golden prospects it was an easy way to Sammy Lane and her coming marriage Buck Thompson was just concluding a glowing tribute to the girl s beauty of face and form when Young Matt reached for an axe lying near the speaker Said Buck Preachin Bill lowed t other day hit didn t make no difference how much money th ol man left Ollie he d be a poor sort of a man anyhow an that there s a heap better men than him right here in th hills that Sammy could a had fer th askin How bout that Matt called a young fellow from the river The big man s face flushed at the general laugh which followed and he answered hotly as he swung his axe You d better ask Wash Gibbs I hear he says he s the best man in these woods I reckin as how Wash can back his jedgment there said Joe Wash is a sure good man remarked Buck but there s another not so mighty far away that ll pretty nigh hold him level He looked significantly to where Young Matt was making the big chips fly Huh grunted Joe I tell you gentlemen that there man Gibbs is powerful yes sir he sure is Tell you what I seed him do Joe pulled a twist of tobacco from his hip pocket and settled down upon his heels his back against a post Wash an me was a goin to th settlement last fall an jest this side th camp house on Wilderness Road we struck a threshin crew stuck in th mud with their engine Had a break down o some kind Somethin th matter with th hind wheel And jest as Wash an me drove up th boss of th outfit was a tellin em t cut a big pole for a pry t lift th hind ex so s they could block it up an fix th wheel Wash he looked at em a minute an then says says he Hold on boys you don t need ary pole What do you know bout an engine you darned hill billy says th old man kind o short Don t know nothin bout an engine you prairie hopper says Wash but I know you don t need no pole t lift that thing How d you lift it then says t other Why I d jest catch holt an lift says Wash The gang like t bust themselves laughin Why you blame fool says the boas do you know what that engine ll weigh Don t care a cuss WHAT she ll weigh says Wash She ain t PLANTED there is she An with that he climbs down from th wagon an dad burn me if he didn t take holt o that hind ex an lift one whole side o that there engine clean off th ground Them fellers jest stood round an looked at him t beat th stir Well says Wash still a keepin his holt slide a block under her an I ll mosey along That boss didn t say a word till he d got a bottle from a box on th wagon an handed hit t Wash then he says kind o scared like Where in hell are you from Mister Oh I m jest a kid from over on Roark says Wash handin th bottle t me You ought t see some o th MEN in my neighborhood Then we went on When the speaker had finished there was quiet for a little then the young man from the river drawled How much did you say that there engine d weigh Joe There was a general laugh at this which the admirer of Gibbs took good naturedly Don t know what she d weigh but she was bout the size o that one there he answered With one accord everyone turned to inspect the mill engine Pretty good lift Joe Let s you an me take a pull at her Budd remarked Lem Wheeler The two men lifted and strained at the wheel Then another joined them and amid the laughter and good natured raillery of the crowd the three tried in vain to lift one of the wheels while mister Matthews seeing some unusual movement came into the shed and stood with his son an amused witness of their efforts Sure this engine ain t bigger n t other Joe asked one of the group Don t believe she weighs a pound more replied the mountaineer with conviction I tell you gentlemen that man Gibbs is a wonder he sure is Old Matt and his son glanced quickly at each other and the boy shook his head with a smile This little by play was lost on the men who were interested in the efforts of different ones in groups of three to move the wheel When they had at last given it up the young man from the river drawled You re right sure hit weren t after th boas give you that bottle that Wash lifted her are you Joe Or wasn t hit on th way home from th settlement When the laugh at this insinuation had died out Buck said thoughtfully Tell you what boys I d like t see Young Matt try that lift mister Matthews who was just starting back to the burr house paused in the doorway All eyes were fixed upon his son Try her Matt Show us what you can do called the men in chorus But the young man shook his head and found something that needed his immediate attention All that morning at intervals the mountaineers urged the big fellow to attempt the feat but he always put them off with some evasive reply or was too busy to gratify them But after dinner while the men were pitching horse shoes in front of the blacksmith shop Buck Thompson approached the young engineer alone Look a here Matt he said why don t you try that lift Durned me if I don t believe you d fetch her The young giant looked around I know I can Buck I lifted her yesterday while Dad fixed the blockin I always do it that way Buck looked at him in amazement Well why in thunder don t you show th boys then he burst forth at last Cause if I do Wash Gibbs ll hear of it sure and I ll have to fight him to settle which is th best man Good Lord ejaculated Buck with a groan If you re afraid o Wash Gibbs it s th first thing I ever knowed you t be scared o Young Matt looked his friend steadily in the eyes as he replied I ain t afraid of Wash Gibbs I m afraid of myself mister Howitt says No man needn t be afraid of nobody but himself I ve been a thinkin lately Buck an I see some things that I never see before I figure it that if I fight Wash Gibbs or anybody else just to see which is th best man I ain t no better n he is I reckon I ll have to whip him some day alright an I ain t a carin much how soon it comes but I ain t a goin to hurt nobody for nothin just because I can Buck made no reply to this Such sentiment was a little too much for his primitive notions He went back to the men by the blacksmith shop It was not long however until the players left their game to gather once more about the engine Lem Wheeler approached Young Matt with a serious air Look a here he said we all want t see you try that lift I ain t got no time for foolin replied the young man Dad s just pushin to get done before dark Shucks retorted the other Hit won t take a minute t try Jest catch hold an show us what you can do What are you all so keen about my liftin for anyhow demanded the big fellow suspiciously I ain t never set up as the strong man of this country Well you see it s this way Buck done bet me his mule colt agin mine that you could lift her an we want you to settle th bet exclaimed Lem Young Matthews shot a glance at the mountaineer who grinned joyously Yep said Buck that s how it is I m a backin you Don t want you t hurt yourself for me but I sure do need that colt o Lem s hit s a dead match for mine The giant looked at his friend a moment in silence then burst into a laugh of appreciation at Buck s hint Seein as how you re backin me Buck I ll have t get you that mule if I can He shut off steam and as the engine came to a stop stooped and with apparent ease lifted the rear wheel a full four inches from the ground Loud exclamations of admiration came from the little group of men in the shed Lem turned with a long face Them colts ll make a fine team Buck he said You bet come over an hep me break em replied Buck with another grin of delight Wait till Wash Gibbs hears bout this an he ll sure be for breakin Young Matt put in another Better get your fightin clothes on Matt Wash ll never rest easy until you ve done showed him These and similar remarks revealed the general view of the situation While the men were discussing the matter a thin high pitched voice from the edge of the crowd broke in That there s a good lift alright but hit ain t nothin t what I seed when I was t th circus in th city Young Matt who had started the engine again turned quickly Ollie Stewart was sitting on a horse near by and at his side on the brown pony was Miss Sammy Lane They had evidently ridden up just in time to witness the exhibition of the giant s strength CHAPTER XI OLLIE STEWART S GOOD BY Beside the splendidly developed young woman Ollie Stewart appeared but a weakling His shoulders were too narrow and he stooped his limbs were thin his hair black and straight and his eyes dull As Young Matt stepped forward Ollie dismounted quickly but the big fellow was first at the brown pony s side Sammy s eyes shone with admiration and as the strong man felt their light he was not at all sorry that he had won the mule colt for Buck No she said declining his offered assistance she did not wish to get down they were going to the postoffice and would call for the meal on their way home Young Matt lifted the sack of corn from Brownie s back and carried it into the shed When he returned to the group Ollie was saying in his thin voice In th circus I seen in the city there was a feller that lifted a man big as Jed here clean above his head with one hand Buck turned to his big friend His look was met by a grim smile that just touched the corners of the lad s mouth and there was a gleam in the blue eyes that betrayed the spirit within The lean mountaineer again turned to the company while the boy glanced at Sammy The girl was watching him and had caught the silent exchange between the two friends Shucks said Buck Matt could do that easy Try it Matt Try Jed here Try hit once called the chorus This time the big fellow needed no urging With Sammy looking on he could not resist the opportunity which Ollie himself had presented Without a word but with a quick tightening of the lips he stepped forward and caught Jed by the belt with his right hand and then before anyone could guess his purpose he reached out with his other hand and grasped Ollie himself in the same manner There was a short step forward a quick upward swing and the giant held a man in each hand at full arm s length above his head Amid the shouts of the crowd still holding the men he walked deliberately to the blacksmith shop and back then lowering them easily to their feet turned to his engine Ollie and Sammy rode away together up the green arched road and the little company in the mill shed stood watching them As the finely formed young woman and her inferior escort passed from sight a tall mountaineer from the other side of Compton Ridge remarked I done heard Preachin Bill say t other day that mighty nigh all this here gee hawin balkin and kickin mongst th married folks comes cause th teams ain t matched up right Bill he lowed God lmighty d fixed hit somehow so th birds an varmints don t make no mistake but left hit plumb easy for men an women t make durned fools o theirselves Everybody grinned in appreciation and another spoke up According t that I ll bet four bits if them two yonder ever do get into double harness there ll be pieces o th outfit strung from th parson s clean t th buryin ground When the laughter had subsided Buck turned to see Young Matt standing just outside the shed ostensibly doing something with the belt that led to the burr but in reality looking up the creek Law ejaculated Buck under his breath what a team THEY D make Who said Lem who was standing near by Them mule colts returned Buck with a grin They sure will Buck There ain t two better in the country they re a dead match I ll come over an hep you break em when they re big nough And then he wondered why Buck swore with such evident delight One by one the natives received their meal and singly or in groups of two or three were swallowed up by the great forest Already the little valley was in the shadow of the mountain though the sun still shone brightly on the tree tops higher up when Ollie and Sammy returned from the Forks mister Matthews had climbed the hill when the last grist was ground leaving his son to cool down the engine and put things right about the mill Come on Matt said Ollie as the big fellow brought out the meal It s time you was a goin home The young giant hung back saying You folks better go on ahead I ll get home alright Didn t think nothin would get you laughed Ollie Come on you might as well go long with us The other muttered something about being in the way and started back into the shed Hurry up called Sammy we re waitin After this there was nothing else for the young man to do but join them And the three were soon making their way up the steep mountain road together For a time they talked of commonplace things then Young Matt opened the subject that was on all their hearts I reckon Ollie this is the last time that you ll ever be a climbin this old road As he spoke he was really thinking of the time to come when Sammy would climb the road for the last time Yes returned Stewart I go to morrow fore sun up The other continued It ll sure be fine for you to live in the city and get your schoolin and all that Us folks here in the woods don t know nothin We ain t got no chance to learn You ll be forgettin us all mighty quick I reckon once you get to livin with your rich kin Deed I won t returned Ollie warmly Sammy an me was a talkin bout that this evenin We aim t always come back t Mutton Holler onct a year an be just like other folks don t we Sammy The brown pony stepping on a loose stone stumbled toward the man walking by his side And the big fellow put out his hand quickly to the little horse s neck For an instant the girl s hand rested on the giant s shoulder and her face was close to his Then Brownie recovered his footing and Young Matt drew farther away Ollie continued We aim t have you come t th city after a while I m goin t get Uncle Dan t give you a job in th shops an you can get out o these hills an be somebody like we uns The tone was unmistakably patronizing The big mountaineer lifted his head proudly and turned toward the speaker but before he could reply Sammy broke in eagerly Law but that would sure be fine wouldn t it Matt I d know you d do somethin big if you only had the chance I just know you would You re so so kind o big every way she laughed It s a plumb shame for you to be buried alive in these hills There was nothing said after this until coming to the top of the ridge they stopped From here Ollie and Sammy would take the Old Trail to the girl s home Then with his eyes on the vast sweep of forest clad hills and valleys over which the blue haze was fast changing to purple in the level rays of the sun Young Matt spoke I don t guess you d better figure on that Some folks are made to live in the city and some ain t I reckon I was built to live in these hills I don t somehow feel like I could get along without them and besides I d always be knockin against somethin there He laughed grimly and stretched out his huge arms I ve got to have room Then there s the folks yonder He turned his face toward the log house just showing through the trees You know how it is me bein the only one left and Dad gettin old No I don t guess you need to count on me bein more than I am Then suddenly he wheeled about and looked from one face to the other and there was a faint hint of defiance in his voice as he finished I got an idea too that the backwoods needs men same as the cities I don t see how there ever could BE a city even if it wasn t for the men what cleared the brush Somebody s got to lick Wash Gibbs some day or there just naturally won t be no decent livin in the neighborhood ever He held up his big hand to the man on the horse Good by and good luck to you Ollie The horses turned down the Old Trail and with their riders passed from sight That night Sammy Lane said farewell to her lover and with many promises for the future Ollie rode away to his cabin home to leave the next morning for that world that lies so far so far away from the world of Young Matt and his friends the world that is so easy to get into after all and so impossible to get out of ever CHAPTER XII THE SHEPHERD AND HIS FLOCK All that spring and summer things went smoothly in the Mutton Hollow neighborhood The corn was ready to gather and nothing had happened at the ranch since mister Howitt took charge while the man who had appeared so strangely in their midst had made a large place for himself in the hearts of the simple mountaineers At first they were disposed to regard him with some distrust as one apart he was so unlike themselves But when he had changed his dress for the rough garb of the hillsman and meeting them kindly upon their own ground had entered so readily into their life the people by common consent dropped the distinguishing title Mister for the more familiar one of the backwoods Dad Not that they lacked in respect or courtesy it was only their way And the quiet shepherd accepted the title with a pleased smile seeming to find in the change an honor to be received not lightly But while showing such interest in all that made up their world the man never opened the door for anyone to enter his past They knew no more of his history than the hints he had given mister Matthews the night he came out of the mists At the occasional religious meetings in the school house at the Forks mister Howitt was always present an attentive listener to the sermons of the backwoods preacher And then seeing his interest they asked him to talk to them one day when Parson Bigelow failed to make his appointment He don t holler so much as a regular parson said Uncle Josh Hensley but he sure talks so we uns can understand From that time they always called upon him at their public gatherings So the scholar from the world beyond the ridges slipped quietly into the life of the mountain folk and took firm root in their affections And in his face so Preachin Bill said was the look of one who had done fought his fight to a finish an war too dead beat t even be glad it war all over Between the giant mister Matthews and his shepherd the friendship begun that night grew always stronger In spite of the difference in education and training they found much in common Some bond of fellowship unknown to the mountaineer at least drew them close and the two men spent many evenings upon the front porch of the log house in quiet talk while the shadows crept over the valley below and the light went from the sky back of the clump of pines From the first Young Matt was strongly drawn to the stranger who was to have such influence over his life and Pete Pete said that God lived with Dad Howitt in Mutton Hollow Pete somehow knew a great deal about God these days A strange comradeship had come to be between the thoughtful gentleman who cared for the sheep and the ignorant sorely afflicted and nameless backwoods boy The two were always together out on the hillside and in the little glens and valleys during the day with the sheep or at the ranch in the Hollow when the flock was safely folded and the night slipped quietly over the timbered ridges mister Howitt had fixed a bunk in his cabin for the boy so that he could come and go at will Often the shepherd awoke in the morning to find that some time during the night his strange friend had come in from his roving Again after seeing the boy soundly sleeping the shepherd would arise in the morning to find the bunk empty Sammy Lane too had fallen under the charm of the man with the white hair and poet s face Sammy was not so often at the Matthews place after Ollie had gone to the city The girl could not have told why She had a vague feeling that it was better to stay away But this feeling did not prevent her climbing the Old Trail to the Lookout on the shoulder of Dewey and she spent hours at the big rock looking over the valley to where the smoke from Aunt Mollie s kitchen curled above the trees And sometimes against the sky she could see a man and a team moving slowly to and fro in the field back of the house When this happened Sammy always turned quickly away to where the far off line of hills lay like a long low cloud against the sky Every week the girl rode her brown pony to the Postoffice at the Forks and when she had a letter things were different She always stopped then at the Matthews home One day when this happened Dad and Pete were on the ridge above the Old Trail just where the north slope of Dewey shades into the rim of the Hollow The elder man was seated on the ground in the shade of an oak with his back against the trunk of the tree while the boy lay full length on the soft grass looking up into the green depths of foliage where a tiny brown bird flitted from bough to bough In his quaint way Pete was carrying on a conversation with his little friend in the tree top translating freely the while for his less gifted but deeply interested companion on the ground below when Brave the shepherd dog lying near interrupted the talk by a short bark Looking up they saw Young Matt riding along the summit of the ridge The young man paused when he heard the dog and caught sight of the two under the tree then he came to them and seated himself on the grass at Pete s side He spoke no word of greeting and the look on his face was not good to see Pete s eyes went wide with fear at the manner of his big friend and he drew back as if to run but when Young Matt throwing himself over on the grass had hidden his face a half sad half knowing look came into the lad s delicate features reaching forth a hand as slim as a girl s he stroked the shaggy red brown head as he murmured softly Poor Matt Poor Matt Does it hurt Is Matt hurt It ll be better by and by The great form on the grass stirred impatiently The shepherd spoke no word Pete continued stroking the big head and talking in low soothing tones as one would hush a child Pete don t know what s a hurtin Young Matt but it ll be alright some day It ll sure grow over after awhile Ain t nothing won t grow over after awhile cause God he says so Still the older man was silent Then the giant burst forth in curses and the shepherd spoke Don t do that Grant It s not like you lad You cannot help your trouble that way Young Matt turned over to face his friend I know it Dad he growled defiantly but I just got to say somethin I ain t meanin no disrespect to God lmighty and I reckon He ought to know it but he broke forth again Pete drew back in alarm Look your trouble in the face lad said the shepherd don t let it get you down like this Look it in the face roared the other Good God that s just it ain t I a lookin it in the face every day You don t know about it Dad If you did you you d cuss too He started in again I know more than you think Grant said the other when the big fellow had stopped swearing to get his breath While he spoke the shepherd was looking away along the Old Trail There comes your trouble now he added pointing to a girl on a brown pony coming slowly out of the timber near the deer lick The young man made no reply Pete at sight of the girl started to his feet but the big fellow pulled him down again and made the boy understand that he must not betray their position When Sammy reached the sheep she checked her pony and searched the hillside with her eyes while her clear call went over the mountain Oh h h Dad Young Matt shook his head savagely at his companion and even Brave was held silent by a low Be still from his master Again Sammy looked carefully on every side but lying on the higher ground and partly hidden by the trees the little group could not be seen When there was no answer to her second call the girl drew a letter from her pocket and permitting the pony to roam at will proceeded to read The big man looking on cursed again beneath his breath It s from Ollie he whispered to his companions She stopped at the house He says his uncle will give me a job in the shops and that it ll be fine for me cause Ollie will be my boss himself He my boss Why dad burn his sneakin little soul I could crunch him with one hand I d see him in hell before I d take orders from him I told her so too he finished savagely And what did she say asked the shepherd quietly his eyes on the girl below Just said kind o short like that she reckoned I could Then I come away The girl finished her letter and after another long call for Dad moved on over the shoulder of the mountain Pete who had withdrawn a little way from his companions was busily talking in his strange manner to his unseen friends Then Young Matt opened his heart to the shepherd and told him all It was the old old story and as mister Howitt listened dreams that he had thought dead with the death of his only son stirred again in his heart and his deep voice was vibrant with emotion as he sought to comfort the lad who had come to him While they talked the sun dropped until its lower edge touched the top of the tallest pine on Wolf Ridge and the long shadows lay over the valley below I m mighty sorry I let go and cuss Dad finished the boy But I keep a holdin in and a holdin in til I m plumb wild then something happens like that letter and I go out on the range and bust I ve often wished you knowed Seems like your just knowin about it will help me to hold on I get scared at myself sometimes Dad I do honest I m glad too that you have told me Grant It means more to me than you can guess I I had a boy once you know He was like you He would have come to me this way if he had lived The sheep had begun working toward the lower ground The shepherd rose to his feet Take them home Brave Come on boys you must eat with me at the ranch to night Then the three friends the giant mountaineer the strangely afflicted youth and the old scholar went down the mountain side together As they disappeared in the timber on the lower level the bushes near which they had been sitting parted silently and a man s head and shoulders appeared from behind a big rock The man watched the strange companions out of sight Then the bushes swayed together and the mountain seemed to have swallowed him up The three friends had just finished their supper when Pete saw Sammy entering the ranch clearing Young Matt caught up his hat At the rear door he paused I ve got to go now Dad he said awkwardly I can t see her any more to day But if you ll let me I ll come again when things get too hot The shepherd held out his hand I understand Come always my boy The big fellow with Pete skipped away into the timber at the rear of the cabin a moment before Sammy appeared at the open door in front CHAPTER XIII SAMMY LANE S AMBITION Law sakes cried Sammy looking at the table You don t use all them dishes do you Dad You sure must eat a lot Oh I eat enough laughed mister Howitt but it happens that I had company this evening Young Matt and Pete were here for supper He brought two chairs outside the cabin Shucks exclaimed Sammy as she seated herself and removed her sunbonnet they must ve eat and run Wish d I d got here sooner Young Matt run away from me this afternoon And I wanted to see him bout Mandy Ford s party next week I done promised Mandy that I d bring him I reckon he d go with me if I asked him There is not the least doubt about that observed the man I m sure anyone would be glad for such charming company The girl looked up suspiciously Are you a jokin she said Indeed I am not I am very much in earnest Then taking a cob pipe from his pocket he added politely May I smoke Heh O law yes What you ask me for She watched him curiously as he filled and lighted the pipe I reckon that s because you was raised in the city he added slowly is that the way folks do there Folks smoke here sometimes do they not he returned between puffs I don t mean that Course they smoke and chew too And the women dip snuff some of em Aunt Mollie Matthews don t though and I ain t never goin to cause she don t But nobody don t ask nobody else if they can They just go ahead That ain t the only way you re different from us though she continued looking at mister Howitt with that wide questioning gaze You re different in a heap o ways Tain t that you wear different clothes for you don t no more Nor taint that you act like you were any better n us I don t know what it is but it s somethin Take your stayin here in Mutton Hollow now honest Dad ain t you afear d to stay here all alone at nights Afraid afraid of what he looked at her curiously Hants said the girl lowering her voice down there She pointed toward the old ruined cabin under the bluff SHE S sure been seen there What if HE was to come too Don t you believe in hants The shepherd s face was troubled as he answered I don t know Sammy I scarcely know what I believe Some marvelous experiences are related by apparently reliable authorities but I have always said that I could not accept the belief I I am not so sure now After all the unseen world is not so very far away Strange forces of which we know nothing are about us everywhere I dare not say that I do not believe But you ain t scared Why should I fear Sammy shook her head Ain t nother man or woman in the whole country would dast spend the night here Dad except Pete of course Not even Young Matt nor my Daddy would do it and I don t guess they re afraid of anything anything that s alive I mean You re sure different Dad plumb different I reckon it must be the city that does it And that s what I ve come to see you about this evenin You see Ollie s been a tellin me a lot about folks and things way over there She waived her hand toward the ridges that shut in the Hollow And Ollie he s changed a heap himself since he went there to live I got a letter to day and when I went home I hunted up the first one he wrote and I can tell there s a right smart difference already You know all about Ollie and me goin to get married I reckon mister Howitt admitted that he had heard something of that nature and Sammy nodded I lowed you d know But you don t know how mighty proud and particular Ollie always is I figure that bein in the city with all them one folks ain t goin to make him any less that way than he was And if he stays there and keeps on a changin and I stay here and don t change none why it might be that I I She faltered and came to a dead stop twisting her bonnet strings nervously in her confusion Ollie he ain t like Young Matt nohow she said again Such as that wouldn t make no difference with him But Ollie well you see There was a twinkle now in the shepherd s eye as he answered Yes I see I am quite sure that I see The girl continued You know all about these things Dad And there ain t nobody else here that does Will you learn me to be a sure nough lady so as Ollie won t so he won t Again she paused in confusion It was evident from the look on mister Howitt s face that whatever he saw it was not this I feel somehow like I could do it if I had a chance she murmured There was no answer After a time Sammy stole a look at her quiet companion What could the man in the chair be thinking about His pipe was neglected his gray head bowed Course said the young woman with just a little lifting of her chin Course if I couldn t never learn there ain t no use to try The old scholar raised his head and looked long at the girl Her splendid form glowing with the rich life and strength of the wilderness showed in every line the proud old southern blood Could she learn to be a fine lady mister Howitt thought of the women of the cities pale sickly colorless hot house posies beside this mountain flower What would this beautiful creature be had she their training What would she gain What might she not lose Aloud he said My dear child do you know what it is that you ask Sammy hung her head abashed at his serious tone I lowed it would be right smart trouble for you she said But I could let you have Brownie in pay he ain t only five year old and is as sound as a button He s all I ve got mister Howitt But I d be mighty proud to swap him to you My girl my girl said the shepherd you misunderstand me I did not mean that It would be a pleasure to teach you I was thinking how little you realized what the real life of the city is like and how much you have that the fine ladies as you call them would give fortunes for and how little they have after all that could add one ray of brightness to your life Sammy laughed aloud as she cried Me got anything that anybody would want Why Dad I ain t got nothin but Brownie and my saddle and and that s all I sure ain t got nothing to lose The man smiled in sympathy Then slowly a purpose formed in his mind And if you should lose you will never blame me he said at last Never never she promised eagerly Alright it is a bargain I will help you The girl sprang to her feet I knew you would I knew you would I was plumb sure you would she cried fairly quivering with life and excitement It s got to be a sure nough lady Dad I want to be a really truly fine lady like them Ollie tells about in his letters you know Yes Sammy I understand a sure enough lady and we will do it I am sure But it will take a great deal of hard work on your part though I reckon it will she returned soberly coming back to her seat Then drawing her chair a little closer she leaned toward her teacher Begin now she commanded Tell me what I must do first mister Howitt carefully searched his pockets for a match and lighted his pipe again before he said First you must know what a sure enough lady is You see Sammy there are several kinds of women who call themselves ladies but are not real ladies after all and they all look very much like the sure enough kind that is they look like them to most people Sammy nodded Just like them Thompsons down by Flat Rock They re all mighty proud cause they come from Illinois the same as the Matthews s You d think to hear em that Old Matt couldn t near run the ranch without em and some folks strangers like might believe it But we all know they ain t nothing but just low down trash all the time and no better than some of them folks over on the Bend The shepherd smiled Something like that I see you understand Now a real lady Sammy is a lady in three ways First in her heart I mean just to herself in the things that no one but she could ever know A sure enough lady does not PRETEND to be she IS Again the girl broke in eagerly That s just like Aunt Mollie ain t it Couldn t no one ever have a finer lady heart than her Indeed you are right agreed the teacher heartily And that is the thing that lies at the bottom of it all Sammy The lady heart comes first I won t never forget that she returned I couldn t forget Aunt Mollie nohow Tell me more Dad Next the sure enough lady must have a lady mind She must know how to think and talk about the things that really matter All the fine dresses and jewels in the world can t make a real lady if she does not think or if she thinks only of things that are of no value Do you see Again the girl nodded and with a knowing smile answered quickly I know a man like that And I see now that that is what makes him so different from other folks It s the things he thinks about all to himself that does it But I ve got a heap to learn I sure have I could read alright if I had something to read and I reckon I could learn to talk like you if I tried hard enough What else is there Then continued the shepherd A lady will keep her body as strong and as beautiful as she can for this is one way that she expresses her heart and mind Do you see what I mean Sammy answered slowly I reckon I do You mean I mustn t get stooped over and thin chested and go slouching around like so many of the girls and women around here do and I mustn t let my clothes go without buttons cause I am in a hurry and I must always comb my hair and keep my hands as white as I can Is that it That s the idea said the shepherd Sammy gazed ruefully at a large rent in her skirt and at a shoe half laced Then she put up a hand to her tumbled hair I I didn t think it made any difference when only home folks was around she said That s just it my child said the old man gently I think a sure enough lady would look after these things whether there was anyone to see her or not just for herself you know And this is where you can begin I will send for some books right away and when they come we will begin to train your mind But the heart how ll I get a lady heart Dad How does the violet get its perfume Sammy Where does the rose get its color How does the bird learn to sing its song For a moment she was puzzled Then her face lighted I see she exclaimed I m just to catch it from folks like Aunt Mollie and and someone else I know I m just to BE not to make believe or let on like I was but to BE a real lady inside And then I m to learn how to talk and look like I know myself to be She drew a long breath as she rose to go It ll be mighty hard Dad in some ways but it ll sure be worth it all when I get out mong the folks I m mighty thankful to you I sure am And I hope you won t never be sorry you promised to help me As the girl walked swiftly away through the thickening dusk of the evening the shepherd watched her out of sight then turned toward the corral for a last look at the sheep to see that all was right for the night Brave old fellow he said to the dog who trotted by his side are we going to make another mistake do you think We have made so many so many you know Brave looked up into the master s face and answered with his low bark as though to declare his confidence Well well old dog I hope you are right The child has a quick mind and a good heart and if I am not mistaken good blood We shall see We shall see Suddenly the dog whirled about the hair on his back bristling as he gave a threatening growl A man on a dun colored mule was coming up the road CHAPTER XIV THE COMMON YELLER KIND mister Howitt stood quietly by the corral gate when the horseman rode up It was Wash Gibbs on his way home from an all day visit with friends on the river When the big mountaineer took the short cut through Mutton Hollow he thought to get well past the ranch before the light failed No matter how well fortified with the courage distilled by his friend Jennings the big man would never have taken the trail by the old ruined cabin alone after dark He had evidently been riding at a good pace for his mule s neck and flanks were wet with sweat Gibbs himself seemed greatly excited and one hand rested on the pistol at his hip as he pulled up in front of the shepherd Without returning mister Howitt s greeting he pointed toward the two empty chairs in front of the house demanding roughly Who was that with you before you heard me comin Sammy Lane was here a few minutes ago replied the shepherd Gibbs uttered an oath She was was she Well who was th man There was no man returned the other Young Matt and Pete were here for supper but they went as soon as the meal was finished before Sammy came Don t you try to lie to me exclaimed the big man with another burst of language and a threatening movement with the hand that rested on the pistol mister Howitt was startled Never in his life before had such words been addressed to him He managed to reply with quiet dignity I have no reason for deceiving you or anyone else mister Gibbs There has been no man here but myself since Matt and Pete left after supper The shepherd s manner carried conviction and Gibbs hesitated evidently greatly perplexed During the pause Brave growled again and faced toward the cliff below the corral his hair bristling What s th matter with that dog said Gibbs turning uneasily in his saddle to face in the direction the animal was looking What is it Brave said mister Howitt The only answer was an uneasy whine followed by another growl all of which said plainly in dog talk I don t know what it is but there is something over there on that cliff that I don t like It must be some animal said the shepherd Ain t no animal that makes a dog act like that Did any body pass while you was a sittin there jest before I come in sight Not a soul answered the other Did you meet someone down the road The big man looked at the shepherd hard before he answered in a half frightened half bullying tone I seed something in th road yonder an hit disappeared right by th old shack under th bluffs He twisted around in his saddle again facing the cliff with its dense shadows and dim twilight forms as he muttered If I was only right sure I Then swinging back he leaned toward the man on the ground Look a here Mister There s them that lows there s things in this here Holler t be afeared of an I reckon hit s so There s sure been hell t pay at that there cabin down yonder I ain t a sayin what hit was I seed but if hit war anywhere else I d a said hit was a man but if hit was a man I don t know why you didn t see him when he come past er else you re a lyin I jest want t tell you you re right smart of a stranger in these here parts even if you have been a workin fer Ol Matt all summer You re too blame careful bout talkin bout yourself or tellin whar you come from t suit some folks Some strangers are alright an again some ain t But we don t aim t have nobody in this here neighborhood what jumps into th brush when they see an honest man a comin As he finished speaking Gibbs straightened himself in the saddle and before mister Howitt could reply the dun mule at a touch of the spur had dashed away up the road in the direction taken by Sammy Lane It was quite dark in the heavy timber of the Hollow by the time Sammy had reached the edge of the open ground on the hill side but once on the higher level clear of the trees the strong glow of the western sky still lighted the way From here it was not far to the girl s home and as she climbed a spur of Dewey Sammy saw the cabin and heard distinctly the sweet strain s of her father s violin On top of the rise the young woman paused a moment to enjoy the beauties of the evening which seemed to come to her with a new meaning that night As she stood there her strong young figure was clearly outlined against the sky to the man who was riding swiftly along the road over which she had just passed Sammy turned when she heard the quick beating of the mule s feet then recognizing the huge form of the horseman as he came out of the woods into the light she started quickly away towards her home but the mule and its rider were soon beside her Howdy Sammy Gibbs leaped from the saddle and with the bridle rein over his arm came close to the girl Fine evening for a walk Howdy returned the young woman coolly quickening her pace You needn t t be in such a powerful hurry growled Wash If you ve got time t talk t that old cuss at th ranch you sure got time t talk t me Sammy turned angrily You d better get back on your mule and go about your business Wash Gibbs When I want you to walk with me I ll let you know That s alright honey exclaimed the other insolently I m a goin your way just th same an we ll mosey long t gether I was a goin home but I ve got business with your paw now Worse thing for Daddy too flashed the girl I wish you d stay away from him Wash laughed Your daddy couldn t keep house thout me nohow Who was that feller talkin with you an th old man down yonder There wasn t nobody talkin to us replied Sammy shortly That s what he said too growled Gibbs but I sure seed somebody a sneakin into th brush when I rode up I thought when I was down there hit might o been a hant but I know hit was a man now There s somethin mighty funny a goin on around here since that feller come int th neighborhood an he ll sure find somethin in Mutton Holler more alive than Ol Matt s gal if he ain t careful The girl caught her breath quickly She knew the big ruffian s methods and with good reason feared for her old friend should he even unconsciously incur the giant s displeasure As they drew near the house Wash continued Young Matt he was there too Let me tell you I ain t forgot bout his big show at th mill last spring he ll have t do a heap better n he done then when I get round t him Sammy laughed scornfully Pears like you ain t been in no hurry t try it on I ain t heard tell of Young Matt s leaving th country yet You d better stay away from Jennings still though when you do try it Then while the man was tying his mule to the fence she ran into the cabin to greet her father with a hysterical sob that greatly astonished Jim Before explanations could be made a step was heard approaching the door and Sammy had just time to say Wash Gibbs in answer to her father s inquiring look when the big man entered mister Lane arose to hang his violin on its peg Don t stop fer me Jim said the newcomer Jest let her go Me an Sammy s been havin a nice little walk an some right peart music would sound mighty fine Gibbs was angered beyond reason at Sammy s last words or he would have exercised greater care Sammy s father made no reply until the girl had left the room but whatever it was that his keen eye read in his daughter s face it made him turn to his guest with anything but a cordial manner and there was that in his voice that should have warned the other So you and Sammy went for a walk did you She was comin home from th sheep ranch an I caught up with her explained Gibbs I lowed as how she needed company so I come long I seemed t be bout as welcome as usual he added with an ugly grin Meanin that my girl don t want your company and told you so asked the other softly Wash answered with a scowl Sammy s gettin too dad burned good fer me since Ollie s uncle took him in An now this here old man from nowhere has come it s worse than ever She ll put a rope round our necks th first thing you know Jim s right hand slipped quietly inside his hickory shirt where the button was missing as he drawled My girl always was too good for some folks And it s about time you was a findin it out She can t help it She was born that way She s got mighty good blood in her veins that girl has and I don t aim to ever let it be mixed up with none of the low down common yeller kind The deliberate purpose of the speaker was too evident to be mistaken The other man s hand flew to his hip almost before mister Lane had finished his sentence But Wash was not quick enough Like a flash Jim s hand was withdrawn from inside the hickory shirt and the giant looked squarely into the muzzle of Jim Lane s ever ready murderous weapon In the same even voice without the slightest allusion to the unfinished movement of the other mister Lane continued I done told you before that my girl would pick her own company and I ain t never feared for a minute that she d take up with such as you Ollie Stewart ain t so mighty much of a man maybe but he s clean he is and the stock s pretty good Now you can just listen to me or you can mosey out of that door and the next time we meet we will settle it for good without any further arrangement As Sammy s father talked the big figure of his visitor relaxed and when Jim had finished his slow speech Wash was leaning forward with his elbows on his knees his hands clasped in front We ain t got no call t fight now Jim he said in a tone of respect We got something else t think about an that s what I come here fer t night I didn t aim t til I seed what I did at th ranch down yonder I tell you hit s time we was a doin somethin At this mister Lane s face and manner changed quickly He put up his weapon and the two men drew their chairs close together as though Death had not a moment before stretched forth his hand to them For an hour they sat talking in low tones Sammy in the next room had heard the conversation up to this point but now only an occasional word reached her ears Gibbs seemed to be urging some action and her father was as vigorously protesting I tell you Jim hit s th only safe way You didn t use t be so squeamish Several times the old shepherd was mentioned and also the stranger whom Wash had seen that evening And once the trembling girl heard Young Matt s name At length the guest rose to go and mister Lane walked with him to the gate Even after the big man was mounted the conversation still continued Wash still urging and Jim still protesting When his visitor was gone mister Lane came slowly back to the house Extinguishing the light he seated himself in the open doorway and filled his pipe Sammy caught the odor of tobacco and a moment later Jim heard a light quick step on the floor behind him Then two arms went around his neck What is it Daddy What is it Why don t you drive that man away Did you hear us talkin asked the man an anxious note in his voice I heard you talkin to him about pesterin me but after that you didn t talk so loud What is the matter Daddy that he could stay and be so thick with you after the things you said I was sure he d make you kill him Jim laughed softly You re just like your mother girl Just like her with the old blood a backin you up Then he asked a number of questions about mister Howitt and her visit to the ranch that evening As Sammy told him of her ambition to fit herself for the place that would be hers when she married and repeating the things that mister Howitt had told her explained how the shepherd had promised to help Jim expressed his satisfaction and delight I knowed you was a studyin about something girl he said but I didn t say nothin cause I lowed you d tell me when you got ready I didn t want to say nothing til I was sure you see replied the daughter I aimed to tell you as soon as I got home to night but Wash Gibbs didn t give me no chance The man held her close Dad Howitt sure puts the thing just right Sammy It ll be old times come back when you re a lady in your own house with all your fine friends around and you ll do it girl you sure will Don t never be afraid to bank on the old blood It ll see you through Then his voice broke You won t never be learned away from your old Daddy will you honey Will you always stand by Daddy like you do now Will you let me and Young Matt slip round once in a while just to look at you all so fine Daddy Jim if you don t hush I ll I ll she hid her face on his shoulder There there honey I was only funnin You ll always be my Sammy the only boy I ever had You just naturally couldn t be nothin else Long after his daughter had gone to her room and to her bed the mountaineer sat in the doorway looking into the dark He heard the short bark of a fox in the brush back of the stable and the wild cry of a catamount from a cliff farther down the mountain was answered by another from the timber below the spring He saw the great hills heaving their dark forms into the sky and in his soul he felt the spirit of the wilderness and the mystery of the hour At last he went into the house to close and bar the door Away down in Mutton Hollow a dog barked and high up on Old Dewey near Sammy s Lookout a spot of light showed for a moment then vanished CHAPTER XV THE PARTY AT FORD S Young Matt would have found some excuse for staying at home the night of the party at Ford s but the shepherd said he must go The boy felt that the long evening with Sammy would only hurt He reasoned with himself that it would be better for him to see as little as possible of the girl who was to marry Ollie Stewart Nevertheless he was singing as he saddled the big white faced sorrel to ride once more over the trail that is nobody knows how old mister Lane was leading the brown pony from the stable as Young Matt rode up to the gate and from the doorway of the cabin Sammy called to say that she would be ready in a minute Ain t seen you for a coon s age boy said Jim while they were waiting for the girl Why don t you never come down the Old Trail no more The big fellow s face reddened as he answered I ain t been nowhere Jim Pears like I just can t get away from the place no more we re that busy Sammy s father looked his young neighbor squarely in the eye with that peculiar searching gaze Look a here Grant I ve knowed you ever since you was born and you ought to know me a little Tain t your way to dodge and tain t mine I reckon you know you re welcome same as always don t you Young Matt returned the other s look fairly I ain t never doubted it Jim But things is a heap different now since it s all done and settled with Ollie gone The two understood each other perfectly Said Jim drawing a long breath Well I wish you d come over just the same anyway It can t do nobody no harm as I can see It wouldn t do me no good replied the young man Maybe not assented Jim But I d like mighty well to have you come just the same Then he drew closer to his young friend I ve been aimin to ride over and see you Matt but Sammy said you was a comin this evenin and I lowed this would be soon enough I reckon you know what Wash Gibbs is tellin he aims to do first chance he gets The giant drew himself up with a grim smile I ve heard a good bit Jim But you don t need to mind about me I know I ain t quite growed but I am a growin The older man surveyed the great form of the other with a critical eye as he returned Durned if I don t believe you d push him mighty close if he d only play fair But but I lowed you ought to know it was a comin I have knowed it for a long time said the other cheerfully but I heard Preachin Bill say once that if a feller don t fuss about what he knows for sure the things he don t know ain t apt to bother him none It s this here guessin that sure gets a man down Preachin Bill hits it every pop don t he exclaimed Jim admiringly But there s somethin else you ought to know too Matt Wash has done made his threats agin the old man down there You mean Dad Howitt said Young Matt sharply What s Wash got agin Dad Jim mister Lane shifted uneasily Some fool notion of hisn You mind old man Lewis I reckon The big man s muscles tightened Dad told us about his stoppin at the ranch the other night Wash Gibbs better keep his hands off mister Howitt I ain t told nobody about this Grant and you can do as you like about tellin your father and the old man But if anything happens get word to me quick Before more could be said Sammy appeared in the doorway and soon the two young people were riding on their way Long after they had passed from sight in the depth of the forest the dark mountaineer stood at the big gate looking in the direction they had gone Young Matt was like a captive tugging at his bonds mister Lane s words had stirred the fire and the girl s presence by his side added fuel to the flame He could not speak He dared not even look at her but rode with his eyes fixed upon the ground where the sunlight fell in long bars of gold Sammy too was silent She felt something that was strangely like fear when she found herself alone with her big neighbor Now and then she glanced timidly up at him and tried to find some word with which to break the silence She half wished that she had not come So they rode together through the lights and shadows down into the valley the only creatures in all the free life of the forest who were not free At last the girl spoke It s mighty good of you to take me over to Mandy s to night There ain t no one else I could o gone with There was no reply and Sammy seeming not to notice continued talking in a matter of fact tone that soon for such is the way of a woman won him from his mood and the two chatted away like the good comrades they had always been Just after they had crossed Fall Creek at Slick Rock Ford some two miles below the mill Young Matt leaned from his saddle and for a little way studied the ground carefully When he sat erect again he remarked with the air of one who had reached a conclusion Wouldn t wonder but there ll be doin s at Ford s to night sure enough There s sure to be returned the girl everybody ll be there Mandy s folks from over on Long Creek are comin and some from the mouth of the James Mandy wanted Daddy to play for em but he says he can t play for parties no more and they got that old fiddlin Jake from the Flag neighborhood I guess There ll be somethin a heap more excitin than fiddlin and dancin accordin to my guess returned Young Matt What do you mean asked Sammy Her escort pointed to the print of a mule s shoe in the soft soil of the low bottom land That there s Wash Gibbs s dun mule and he s headed down the creek for Jennings s still Wash ll meet a lot of his gang from over on the river and like s not they ll go from there to the party I wish your dad was goin to do the playin to night It was full dark before they reached the Ford clearing The faint far away sound of a violin seeming strange and out of place in the gloomy solitude of the great woods first told them that other guests had already arrived Then as they drew nearer and the tones of the instrument grew louder they could hear the rhythmic swing and beat of heavily shod feet upon the rough board floors with the shrill cries of the caller and the half savage half pathetic sing song of the backwoods dancers singing Missouri Gal Reaching the edge of the clearing they involuntarily checked their horses stopping just within the shadow of the timber Here the sound of the squeaking fiddle the shouting caller the stamping feet and the swinging dancers came with full force and through the open door and windows of the log house they could see the wheeling swaying figures of coatless men and calico gowned women while the light streaming out opened long lanes in the dusk About them in the forest s edge standing in groups under the trees were the shadowy forms of saddle horses and mules tied by their bridle reins to the lower branches and nearer to the cabin two or three teams tied to the rail fence stood hitched to big wagons in which were splint bottom chairs for extra seats During the evening the men tried in their rough good natured way to joke Young Matt about taking advantage of Ollie Stewart s absence but they very soon learned that while the big fellow was ready to enter heartily into all the fun of the occasion he would not receive as a jest any allusion to his relation to the girl whom he had escorted to the party Sammy too when her big companion was not near suffered from the crude wit of her friends Ollie Stewart don t own me yet she declared with a toss of the head when someone threatened to write her absent lover No replied one of her tormentors but you ain t aimin to miss your chance o goin t th city t live with them big bugs In the laugh that followed Sammy was claimed by a tall woodsman for the next dance and escaped to take her place on the floor Well Ollie ll sure make a good man for her remarked another joker if he don t walk th chalk she can take him cross her knee an wallop him She ll surely marry him alright said the first cause he s got th money but she s goin t have a heap o fun makin Young Matt play th fool before she leaves th woods He ain t took his eyes off her t night Everybody s laughin at him I notice they take mighty good care t laugh behind his back flashed little black eyed Annie Brooke from the Cove neighborhood Young Matt who had been dancing with Mandy Ford came up behind the group just in time to hear their remarks Two or three who saw him within hearing tried to warn the speakers but while everybody around them saw the situation the two men caught the frantic signals of their friends too late The music suddenly stopped The dancers were still By instinct every eye in the room was fixed upon the little group as the jokers turned to face the object of their jests The big mountaineer took one long step toward the two who had spoken his brow dark with rage his huge fists clenched But even as his powerful muscles contracted for the expected blow the giant came to a dead stop Slowly his arm relaxed His hand dropped to his side Then turning deliberately he walked to the door the silent crowd parting to give him way As the big man stepped from the room a gasp of astonishment escaped from the company and the two jokers with frightened faces broke into a shrill nervous laughter Then a buzz of talk went round the fiddlers struck up again the callers shouted the dancers stamped and bowed and swung their partners as they sang And out in the night under the trees at the edge of the gloomy forest the strongest man in the hills was saying over and over to the big white faced sorrel I don t dare do it I don t dare Dad Howitt wouldn t He sure wouldn t Very soon two figures left the house and hurried toward a bunch of saddle horses near by They had untied their animals and were about to mount when suddenly a huge form stepped from the shadows to their horses heads Put up your guns boys said Young Matt calmly I reckon you know that if I d wanted trouble it would o been all over before this The weapons were not drawn and the big man continued Dad Howitt says a feller always whips himself every time he fights when there ain t no no principle evolved I don t guess Dad would see ary principle in this cause there might be some truth in what you boys said I reckon I am somethin at playin a fool but it would o been a heap safer for you to let folks find it out for themselves We all were jest a foolin Matt muttered one That s alright returned the big fellow But you d better tie up again and go back into the house and dance a while longer Folks might think you was scared if you was to leave so soon CHAPTER XVI ON THE WAY HOME Not until the party was breaking up and he saw Sammy in the doorway did Young Matt go back to the house When they had ridden again out of the circle of light and the laughter and shouting of the guests was no longer heard Sammy tried in vain to arouse her silent escort chatting gaily about the pleasures of the evening But all the young man s reserve had returned When she did force him to speak his responses were so short and cold that at last the girl too was silent Then man like he wished she would continue talking By the time they reached Compton Ridge the moon was well up For the last two miles Sammy had been watching the wavering shafts of light that slipped through tremulous leaves and swaying branches As they rode a thousand fantastic shapes appeared and vanished along the way and now and then as the sound of their horses feet echoed through the silent forest some wild thing in the underbrush leaped away into the gloomy depth Coming out on top of the narrow ridge the brown pony crowded closer to the big white faced sorrel and the girl stirred by the weird loveliness of the scene broke the silence with an exclamation O Matt Ain t it fine Look there She pointed to the view ahead Makes me feel like I could keep on a goin and goin and never stop The man too felt the witchery of the night The horses were crowding more closely together now and leaning forward the girl looked up into his face What s the matter Matt Why don t you talk to me You know it ain t true what them folks said back there The sorrel was jerked farther away It s true enough so far as it touches me returned the man shortly When are you goin to the city I don t know she replied Let s don t talk about that to night I don t want even to think about it not to night You you don t believe what they was a sayin Matt you know you don t You mustn t ever believe such as that I I never could get along without you and Aunt Mollie and Uncle Matt nohow The brown pony was again crowding closer to his mate The girl laid a hand on her companion s arm Say you don t blame me for what they said Matt You know I wouldn t do no such a thing even if I could There mustn t anything ever come between you and me never never I I want us always to be like we are now You ve been so good to me ever since I was a little trick and you whipped big Lem Wheeler for teasin me I I don t guess I could get along without knowin you was around somewhere She finished with a half sob It was almost too much The man swung around in his saddle and the horses apparently of their own accord stopped Without a word the big fellow stretched forth his arms and the girl as if swept by a force beyond her control felt herself swaying toward him The spell was broken by the trampling of horses and the sound of loud voices For a moment they held their places motionless as if rudely awakened from a dream The sound was coming nearer Then Young Matt spoke It s Wash Gibbs and his crowd from the still Ride into the brush quick There was no time for flight In the bright moonlight they would have been easily recognized and a wild chase would have followed Leaving the road they forced their horses into a thick clump of bushes where they dismounted to hold the animals by their heads Scarcely had they gained this position when the first of the crowd reached the spot where they had been a moment before Wash Gibbs was easily distinguished by his gigantic form and with him were ten others riding two and two several of whom were known to Young Matt as the most lawless characters in the country All were fired by drink and were laughing and talking with now and then a burst of song or a vulgar jest I say Wash called one What ll you do if Young Matt s there The unseen listeners could not hear the leader s reply but those about the speaker laughed and shouted with great glee Then the two in the bushes distinctly heard the last man in the line ask his companion Do you reckon he ll put up a fight and as they passed from sight the other answered Wash don t aim t give him no show When the sounds had died away Young Matt turned to the girl Come on we ve got to keep em in sight But Sammy held back Oh Matt don t go yet We must not Didn t you hear what that man said It s you they re after Let s wait here until they re clean gone No tain t they ain t a wantin me the big fellow replied And before the young woman could protest further he lifted her to the saddle as easily as if she were a child Then springing to the back of his own horse he led the way at a pace that would keep them within hearing of the company of men Who is it Matt Who is it if it ain t you asked the girl Don t know for sure yet but I ll tell you pretty soon They had not gone far when Young Matt stopped the horse to listen intently and soon by the sound he could tell that the party ahead had turned off the ridge road and were following the trail that leads down the eastern side of the mountain A moment longer the mountaineer listened as if to make sure then he spoke Them devils are goin to the ranch after Dad Howitt Sammy you ve got to ride hard to night They won t hear you now and they re getting farther off every minute There ain t no other way and I know you ll do it for the old man Get home as quick as you can and tell Jim what s up Tell him I ll hold em until he gets there Even as he spoke he sprang from his horse and began loosening the saddle girths But Matt protested the girl how can you You can t get by them How re you goin to get there in time Down the mountain short cut he answered as he jerked the heavy saddle from his horse and threw it under some nearby bushes But they ll kill you You can t never face that whole crowd alone I can do it better n Dad and him not a lookin for them Slipping the bridle from the sorrel he turned the animal loose and removing his coat and hat laid them with the saddle Then to the girl on the pony he said sharply Go on Sammy Why don t you go on Don t you see how you re losin time Them devils will do for Dad Howitt like they done for old man Lewis Your father s the only man can stop em now Ride hard girl and tell Jim to hurry And and good by Sammy As he finished he spoke to her horse and struck him such a blow that the animal sprang away For a moment Sammy attempted to pull up her startled pony Then Young Matt saw her lean forward in the saddle and urge the little horse to even greater speed As they disappeared down the road the giant turned and ran crashing through the brush down the steep side of the mountain There was no path to follow And with deep ravines to cross rocky bluffs to descend or scale and in places wild tangles of vines and brush and fallen trees the trip before him would have been a hard one even in the full light of day At night it was almost impossible and he must go like a buck with the dogs in full cry When Sammy came in sight of her home she began calling to her father and as the almost exhausted horse dashed up to the big gate the door of the cabin opened and Jim came running out Lifting his daughter from the trembling pony he helped her into the house where she sobbed out her message At the first word Wash Gibbs Jim reached for a cartridge belt and by the time Sammy had finished he had taken his Winchester from its brackets over the fireplace Slipping a bridle on his horse that was feeding in the yard he sprang upon the animal s back without waiting for a saddle Stay in the cabin girl put out the light and don t open the door until I come he said and he was gone As Sammy turned back into the house from away down in Mutton Hollow on the night wind came the sound of guns CHAPTER XVII WHAT HAPPENED AT THE RANCH It was after midnight when mister Howitt was rudely awakened The bright moon shining through the windows lit up the interior of the cabin and he easily recognized Young Matt standing by the bed with Pete who was sleeping at the ranch that night near by Why Matt what is the matter exclaimed the shepherd sitting up He could not see that the big fellow s clothing was torn that his hat was gone and that he was dripping with perspiration but he could hear his labored breathing Strong as he was the young giant was nearly exhausted by the strain of his race over the mountains Get up quick Dad I ll tell you while you re puttin on your clothes the woodsman answered and while the shepherd dressed he told him in a few words finishing with Call Brave inside and get your gun with all the shells you can find Don t show a light for a minute They ll be here any time now and it ll be a good bit yet before Sammy can get home He began fastening the front door The peaceful minded scholar could not grasp the meaning of the message it was to him an impossible thought You must be mistaken Grant he said Surely you are excited and unduly alarmed Wash Gibbs has no reason to attack me Young Matt replied gruffly I ain t makin no mistake in the woods Dad You ain t in the city now and there ain t no one can hear you holler Don t think I am scared neither if that s what you mean But there s ten of them in that bunch and they re bad ones You d better call Brave sir He ll be some help when it comes to the rush But the other persisted You must be mistaken lad Why should any one wish to harm me Those men are only out fox hunting or something like that If they should be coming here it is all a mistake I can easily explain Explain hell ejaculated the mountaineer I ask your pardon Dad but you don t know not being raised in these woods like me Old man Lewis hadn t done nothing neither and he explained too only he never got through explainin They ain t got no reason They re drunk You ve never seen Wash Gibbs drunk and to night he s got his whole gang with him I don t know why he s comin after you but from what you told me bout his stoppin here that evenin and what I ve heard lately I can guess I know what he ll do when he gets here if we don t stop him It ll be all the same to you whether he s right or wrong Brave came trotting into the cabin through the rear door and lay down in his corner by the fireplace That s mighty funny said Young Matt Then as he glanced quickly around Where s Pete The boy had slipped away while the two men were talking Stepping outside they called several times but save the Wh w h o w h o o o of an owl in a big tree near the corral there was no answer The boy s alright anyway said the young man nothin in the woods ever hurts Pete He s safer there than he would be here and I m glad he s gone The shepherd did not reply He seemed not to hear but stood as though fascinated by the scene He still could not grasp the truth of the situation but the beauty of the hour moved him deeply What a marvelous what a wonderful sight he said at last in a low tone I do not wonder the boy loves to roam the hills a night like this Look Grant See how soft the moonlight falls on that patch of grass this side of the old tree yonder and how black the shadow is under that bush like the mouth of a cave a witch s cave I am sure there are ghosts and goblins in there with fairies and gnomes and perhaps a dragon or two And see lad how the great hills rise into the sky How grand how beautiful the world is It is good to live Matt though life be sometimes hard still still it is good to live At the old scholar s words and manner the mountaineer too forgot for a moment the thing that had brought him there and a look of awe and wonder came over his rugged features as the shepherd with his face turned upward and his deep voice full of emotion repeated The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork Day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night showeth knowledge The owl left his place in the old tree and flew across the moonlit clearing into the deeper gloom of the woods Inside the cabin the dog barked and through the still night from down the valley where the ranch trail crosses the creek came the rattle of horses feet on the rocky floor of the little stream and the faint sound of voices Young Matt started and again the man of the wilderness was master of the situation They re comin Dad We ain t got no time to lose Re entering the cabin mister Howitt quieted the dog while his companion fastened the rear door and in the silence while they waited a cricket under the corner of the house sang his plaintive song The sound of voices grew louder as the horses drew nearer Brave growled and would have barked again but was quieted by the shepherd who crouched at his side with one hand on the dog s neck The older man smiled to himself It all seemed to him so like a child s game He had watched the mountaineer s preparation with amused interest and had followed the young woodsman s directions even to the loaded shotgun in his hand as one would humor a boy in his play The scholar s mind trained to consider the problems of civilization and to recognize the dangers of the city refused to entertain seriously the thought that there in the peaceful woods in the dead of night a company of ruffians was seeking to do him harm The voices had ceased and the listeners heard only the sound of the horses feet as the party passed the ruined cabin under the bluff A moment or two later the riders stopped in front of the ranch house Brave growled again but was silenced by the hand on his neck Young Matt was at the window I see them he whispered They re gettin off their horses and tyin them to the corral fence The smile on the shepherd s face vanished and he experienced a queer sensation it was as though something gripped his heart The other continued his whispered report They re bunchin up now under the old tree talkin things over Don t know what to make of the dog not bein around I reckon Now they re takin a drink It takes a lot of whiskey to help ten men jump onto one old man and him a stranger in the Woods Now Wash is sendin two of them around to the back so you can t slip out into the brush Sh h h here comes a couple more to try the front door He slipped quietly across the room to the shepherd s side The visitors came softly up to the front door and tried it gently A moment later the rear door was tried in the same way Let Brave speak to them whispered Young Matt and the dog feeling the restraining hand removed barked fiercely mister Howitt following his companion s whispered instructions spoke aloud What s the matter Brave A bold knock at the front door caused the dog to redouble his efforts until his master commanded him to be still Who is there called the shepherd Young Matt s took powerful bad answered a voice an they want you t come up t th house an doctor him A drunken laugh came from the old tree followed by a smothered oath The giant at mister Howitt s side growled under his breath Oh I m sick am I There s them that ll be a heap sicker before mornin Keep on a talkin Dad We ve got to make all the time we can so s Jim can get here The shepherd called again I do not recognize your voice You must tell me who you are Outside there was a short consultation followed by a still louder knock Open up Why don t you open up an see who we are while from under the tree came a call Quit your foolin an bring him out o there you fellers This command was followed by a still more vigorous hammering at the door and the threats Open up ol man Open up or we ll sure bust her in mister Howitt whispered to his companion Let me open the door and talk to them Grant Surely they will listen to reason But the woodsman returned Talk to a nest of rattlers Jim Lane s the only man that can talk to them now We ve got to stand them off as long as we can As he spoke he raised his revolver and was about to fire a shot through the door when a slight noise at one side of the room attracted his attention He turned just in time to catch a glimpse of a face as it was withdrawn from one of the little windows The noise at the door ceased suddenly and they heard the two men running to join the group under the tree They ve found you ain t alone whispered the big fellow springing to the window again And as a wild drunken yell came from the visitors he added Seems like they re some excited about it too They re holdin a regular pow wow What do you reckon they re thinkin Hope they ll keep it up till Jim Sh h h Here comes another It s that ornery Jim Bowles from the mouth of Indian Creek The man approached the cabin but stopped some distance away and called Hello ol man Well what do you want answered mister Howitt Who s that there feller you got with you A friend Yes We all lowed hit war a friend an we all want t see him powerful bad Can t he come out an play with us Mister Another laugh came from the group under the tree Young Matt whispered Keep him a talkin Dad and mister Howitt called He doesn t feel like playing to night Come back to morrow At this the spokesman dropped his bantering tone Look a here ol man We uns ain t got no time t be a foolin here We know who that feller is an we re a goin t have him He s been a sneakin round this here neighborhood long enough As fer you Mister we low your health ll be some better back where you come from an we aim t hep you leave this neck o th woods right sudden Open up now an turn that there feller over t us an we ll let you off easy like If you don t we ll bust in th door an make you both dance t th same tune There won t be ary thing under you t dance on nuther The old shepherd was replying kindly when his speech was interrupted by a pistol shot and a command from the leader at which the entire gang charged toward the cabin firing as they came and making the little valley hideous with their drunken oaths and yells From his window Young Matt coolly emptied his revolver but even as the crowd faltered there came from their leader another volley of oaths Go on go on yelled Wash Their guns are empty now Fetch em out fore they can load again With an answering yell the others responded Carrying a small log they made for the cabin at full speed One crashing blow the door flew from its hinges and the opening was filled with the drunken sweating swearing crew The same instant Young Matt dropped his useless revolver and springing forward met them on the threshold The old shepherd who had not fired a shot could scarcely believe his eyes as he saw the giant catch the nearest man by the shoulder and waist and lifting him high above his head fling him with terrific force full into the faces of his bewildered companions Those who were not knocked down by the strange weapon scattered in every direction crouching low For a moment the big fellow was master of the situation and standing alone in the doorway in the full light of the moon was easily recognized Hell boys Hit s Young Matt hisself yelled the one who had raised a laugh by saying that Young Matt was sick and the shepherd was wanted to doctor Yes It s me Bill Simpson I m sure ailin to night I need somebody to go for a doctor powerful bad returned the young giant We never knowed it war you whined the other carefully lengthening the distance between the big man on the doorstep and himself No I reckon not You all played to find an old man alone and do for him like you ve done for others A fine lot you are ten to one and him not knowin the woods While he was speaking the men slowly retreated to gather about their big leader under the tree two of them being assisted by their companions and one other limping painfully Young Matt raised his voice I know you Wash Gibbs and I know this here is your dirty work You ve been a braggin what you d do when you met up with me I m here now Why don t you come up like a man Come out here into the light and let s you and me settle this thing right now You all CRACK A jet of flame leaped out of the shadow and the speaker dropped like a log With a cry the shepherd ran to the side of his friend but in a moment the crowd had again reached the cabin and the old man was dragged from his fallen companion With all his strength mister Howitt struggled with his captors begging them to let him go to the boy But his hands were bound tightly behind his back and when he still plead with those who held him Wash Gibbs struck him full in the mouth a blow that brought the blood They were leading the stunned and helpless old man away when someone who was bending over Young Matt exclaimed You missed him Wash Jest raked him He ll be up in a minute An hell ll be to pay in th wilderness if he ain t tied Better fix him quick The big fellow already showed signs of returning consciousness and by the time they had tied his arms he was able to struggle to his feet For a moment he looked dizzily around his eyes turning from one evil triumphant face to another until they rested upon the bleeding countenance of his old friend The shepherd s eyes smiled back a message of cheer and the kind old man tried to speak when Wash Gibbs made another threatening motion with his clenched fist At this a cry like the roar of a mad bull came from the young giant In his rage he seemed suddenly endowed with almost superhuman strength Before a man of the startled company could do more than gasp with astonishment he had shaken himself free from those who held him and breaking the rope with which he was bound as though it were twine had leaped to the shepherd s side But it was useless For a moment no one moved Then a crashing blow from the butt of a rifle in the hands of a man in the rear of the two prisoners sent Young Matt once more to the ground When he again regained consciousness he was so securely bound that even with his great strength he was helpless Leading their captives to the old tree the men withdrew for a short consultation and to refresh themselves with another drink When they had finished Gibbs addressed the two friends We uns didn t aim to hurt you Young Matt but seein how you re so thick with this here feller an pear to know so much bout him I reckon we can t hep ourselves nohow He turned to the shepherd There s been too dad burned much funny work at this ranch since you come Mister an we uns low we ll just give warnin that we don t want no more strangers snoopin round this neighborhood an we don t aim t have em neither We uns low we can take care o ourselves without ary hep from th dad burned government The shepherd tried to speak but Gibbs with an oath roared Shut up I tell you Shut up I ve been a watchin an I know what I know Fix that there rope boys an we ll get through an mosey long out o here Ain t no use to palaver nohow A rope was thrown over a limb above their heads and a man approached the shepherd with the noose Young Matt struggled desperately With an evil grin Gibbs said Don t you worry sonny you re a goin too And at his signal another rope was fixed and the noose placed over the young man s head The men took their places awaiting the word from their leader The shepherd spoke softly to his companion Thank you my boy The giant began another desperate struggle Wash Gibbs raising his hand opened his lips to give the signal But no word came The brutal jaw dropped The ruffian s eyes fairly started from his head while the men who held the ropes stood as if turned to stone as a long wailing cry came from the dark shadows under the bluff There was a moment of death like silence Then another awful sobbing groan rising into a blood curdling scream came from down the road and from the direction of the ruined cabin advanced a ghostly figure Through the deep shadows and the misty light it seemed to float toward them moaning and sobbing as it came A shuddering gasp of horror burst from the frightened crew under the tree Then at a louder wail from the approaching apparition they broke and ran Like wild men they leaped for their horses and flinging themselves into their saddles fled in every direction Young Matt and the shepherd sank upon the ground in helpless amazement As the outlaws fled the spectre paused Then it started onward toward the two men Again it hesitated For a moment it remained motionless then turned and vanished just as Jim Lane came flying out of the timber into the bright light of the little clearing CHAPTER XVIII LEARNING TO BE A LADY The books sent for by mister Howitt came a few days after the adventure at the ranch and Sammy with all the intensity of her nature plunged at once into the work mapped out for her by the shepherd All through the long summer and autumn the girl spent hours with her teacher out on the hillside Seated on some rocky bench or reclining on the grassy slope she would recite the lessons he gave her or listen to him as he read aloud from character forming books pausing now and then to slip in some comment to make the teaching clear or to answer her eager questions At other times while they followed the sheep leisurely from one feeding ground to another he provoked her to talk of the things they were reading and while he thus led her to think he as carefully guarded her speech and language At first they took the old familiar path of early intellectual training but little by little he taught her to find the way for herself Always as she advanced he encouraged her to look for the life that is more than meat and always while they read and talked together there was opened before them the great book wherein God has written in the language of mountain and tree and sky and flower and brook the things that make truly wise those who pause to read From her mother and from her own free life in the hills Sammy had a body beautiful with the grace and strength of perfect physical womanhood With this she had inherited from many generations of gentle folk a mind and spirit susceptible of the highest culture Unspoiled by the hot house forcing process that so often leaves the intellectual powers jaded and weak before they have fully developed and free from the atmosphere of falsehood and surface culture in which so many souls struggle for their very existence the girl took what her teacher had to offer and made it her own With a mental appetite uninjured by tit bits and dainties she digested the strong food and asked eagerly for more Her progress was marvelous and the old scholar often had cause to wonder at the quickness with which his pupil s clear mind grasped the truths he showed her Often before he could finish speaking a bright nod or word showed that she had caught the purpose of his speech while that wide eager look and the question that followed revealed her readiness to go on It was as though many of the things he sought to teach her slept already in her brain and needed only a touch to arouse them to vigorous life In time the girl s very clothing and even her manner of dressing her hair came to reveal the development and transformation of her inner self not that she dressed more expensively she could not do that but in the selection of materials and in the many subtle touches that give distinction even to the plainest apparel she showed her awakening To help her in this there was Aunt Mollie and a good ladies magazine which came to her regularly through the kindness of her teacher Sammy s father too came unconsciously under the shepherd s influence As his daughter grew the man responded to the change in her as he always responded to her every thought and mood He talked often now of the old home in the south land and sometimes fell into the speech of other days dropping for a moment the rougher expressions of his associates But all this was to Sammy alone To the world there was no change in Jim and he still went on his long rides with Wash Gibbs By fall the place was fixed up a bit the fence was rebuilt the yard trimmed and another room added to the cabin So the days slipped away over the wood fringed ridges The soft green of tree and of bush and grassy slope changed to brilliant gold and crimson and russet brown while the gray blue haze that hangs always over the hollows took on a purple tone Then in turn this purple changed to a deeper colder blue when the leaves had fallen and the trees showed naked against the winter sky With the cold weather the lessons were continued in the Lane cabin on the southern slope of Dewey All day while the shepherd was busy at the ranch Sammy pored over her books and every evening the old scholar climbed the hill to direct the work of his pupil with long Jim sitting silent and grim by the fireside listening to the talk and seeing who knows what visions of the long ago in the dancing flame And so the winter passed and the spring came again came with its soft beauty of tender green its wealth of blossoms and sweet fragrance of growing things Then came the summer that terrible summer when all the promises of spring were broken when no rain fell for weary months and the settlers in the total failure of their crops faced certain ruin CHAPTER XIX THE DROUGHT It began to be serious by the time corn was waist high When the growing grain lost its rich color and the long blades rustled dryly in the hot air the settlers looked anxiously for signs of coming rain The one topic of conversation at the mill was the condition of the crops The stories were all of past drought or tales of hardship and want The moon changed and still the same hot dry sky with only now and then a shred of cloud floating lazily across the blue The grass in the glades grew parched and harsh the trees rattled their shriveled leaves creek beds lay glaring white and dusty in the sun and all the wild things in the woods sought the distant river bottom In the Mutton Hollow neighborhood only the spring below the Matthews place held water and all day the stock on the range crowding around the little pool tramped out the narrow fringe of green grass about its edge and churned its bright life into mud in their struggle Fall came and there was no relief Crops were a total failure Many people were without means to buy food for themselves and their stock for the coming winter and the months until another crop could be grown and harvested Family after family loaded their few household goods into the big covered wagons and deserting their homes set out to seek relief in more fortunate or more wealthy portions of the country The day came at last when Sammy found the shepherd in the little grove near the deer lick and told him that she and her father were going to move Father says there is nothing else to do Even if we could squeeze through the winter we couldn t hold out until he could make another crop Throwing herself on the ground she picked a big yellow daisy from a cluster that finding a little moisture oozing from a dirt filled crevice of the rock had managed to live and began pulling it to pieces In silence the old man watched her He had not before realized how much the companionship of this girl was to him To the refined and cultivated scholar whose lot had been cast so strangely with the rude people of the mountain wilderness the companionship of such a spirit and mind was a necessity Unconsciously Sammy had supplied the one thing lacking and by her demands upon his thought had kept the shepherd from mental stagnation and morbid brooding Day after day she had grown into his life his intellectual and spiritual child and though she had dropped the rude speech of the native she persisted still in calling him by his backwoods title Dad But the little word had come to hold a new meaning for them both He saw now all at once what he would lose when she went away One by one the petals from the big daisy fell from the girl s hand dull splashes of gold against her dress and on the grass Where will you go he asked at last Sammy shook her head without looking up Don t know anywhere that Daddy can earn a livin I mean living for us And when do you start Pretty soon now there ain t nothin there is nothing to stay for now Father told me when he went away day before yesterday that we would go as soon as he returned He promised to be home sometime this evening I I couldn t tell you before Dad but I guess you knew The shepherd did know For weeks they had both avoided the subject Sammy continued I I ve just been over to the Matthews place Uncle Matt has been gone three days now I guess you know about that too Aunt Mollie told me all about it Oh I wish I wish I could help them She reached for another daisy and two big tears rolled from under the long lashes to fall with the golden petals We ll come back in the spring when it s time to plant again but what if you re not here Her teacher could not answer for a time then he said in an odd hesitating way Have you heard from Ollie lately The girl raised her head her quick rare instinct divining his unspoken thought and something she saw in her old friend s face brought just a hint of a smile to her own tearful eyes She knew him so well You don t mean that Dad she said We just couldn t do that I had a letter from him yesterday offering us money but you know we could not accept it from him And there the subject was dropped They spent the afternoon together and in the evening at Sammy s Lookout on the shoulder of Dewey she bade him good night and left him alone with his flocks in the soft twilight That same evening mister Matthews returned from his trip to the settlement CHAPTER XX THE SHEPHERD WRITES A LETTER To purchase the sheep and the ranch in the Hollow mister Matthews placed a heavy mortgage not only upon the ranch land but upon the homestead as well In the loss of his stock the woodsman would lose all he had won in years of toil from the mountain wilderness When the total failure of the crops became a certainty and it was clear that the country could not produce enough feed to carry his flock through the winter until the spring grass mister Matthews went to the settlement hoping to get help from the bank there where he was known He found the little town in confusion and the doors of the bank closed The night before a band of men had entered the building and forcing the safe had escaped to the mountains with their booty Old Matt s interview with the bank official was brief It is simply impossible mister Matthews said the man as it is we shall do well to keep our own heads above water Then the mountaineer had come the long way home As he rode slowly up the last hill the giant form stooped with a weariness unusual and the rugged face looked so worn and hopelessly sad that Aunt Mollie who was waiting at the gate did not need words to tell her of his failure The old man got stiffly down from his horse and when he had removed saddle and bridle and had turned the animal into the lot the two walked toward the house But they did not enter the building Without a word they turned aside from the steps and followed the little path to the graves in the rude enclosure beneath the pines where the sunshine fell only in patches here and there That night after supper mister Matthews went down into the Hollow to see the shepherd It s goin to be mighty hard on Mollie and me a leavin the old place up yonder said the big man when he had told of his unsuccessful trip It won t matter so much to the boy cause he s young yet but we ve worked hard mister Howitt for that home Mollie and me has She s up there now a sittin on the porch and a livin it all over again like she does when there ain t no one around with her face turned toward them pines west of the house It s mighty nigh a breakin her heart just to think of leavin but she ll hide it all from me when I go up there thinkin not to worry me as if I didn t know An it s goin to be mighty hard to part with you too mister Howitt I don t reckon you ll ever know sir how much you done for us for me most of all The shepherd made as if to interrupt but the big man continued Don t you suppose we can see sir how you ve made over the whole neighborhood There ain t a family for ten miles that don t come to you when they re in trouble An there s Sammy Lane a readin an talkin just about the same as you do yourself fit to hold up her end with anybody what s got education and Jim himself s changed something wonderful Same old Jim in lots of ways but something more somehow though I can t tell it Then there s my boy Grant I know right well what he d been if it wasn t for you to show him what the best kind of a man s like He d a sure never knowed it from me I don t mean as he d a ever been a bad man like Wash Gibbs or a no account triflin one like them Thompsons but he couldn t never a been what he is now through and through if he hadn t a known you There s a heap more too all over the country that you ve talked to a Sunday when the parson wasn t here As for me you you sure been a God s blessin to me and Mollie mister Howitt Again the shepherd moved uneasily as if to protest but his big friend made a gesture of silence Let me say it while I got a chance Dad And the other bowed his head while Old Matt continued I can t tell how it is an I don t reckon you d understand any way but stayin as you have after our talk that first night you come an livin down here on this spot alone after what you know it s it s just like I was a little kid an you was a standin big and strong like between me an a great blackness that was somethin awful I reckon it looks foolish me a talkin this way Maybe it s because I m gettin old but anyhow I wanted you to know The shepherd raised his head and his face was aglow with a glad triumphant light while his deep voice was full of meaning as he said gently It has been more to me too than you think mister Matthews I ought to tell you I I will tell you he checked himself and added some day Then he changed the topic quickly Are you sure there is no one who can help you over this hard time Is there NO way The mountaineer shook his head I ve gone over it all again an again Williams at the bank is the only man I know who had the money an he s done for now by this robbery You see I can t go to strangers Dad I ain t got nothin left for security But could you not sell the sheep for enough to save the homestead Who could buy or who would buy if they could in this country without a bit of feed And then look at em they re so poor an weak now they couldn t stand the drivin to the shippin place They d die all along the road They re just skin an bones Dad ain t no butcher would pay freight on em even mister Howitt sat with knitted brow staring into the shadows Then he said slowly There is that old mine If this man Dewey were only here do you suppose Again the mountaineer shook his head Colonel Dewey would be a mighty old man now Dad even if he were livin Tain t likely he ll ever come back nor tain t likely the mine will ever be found without him I studied all that out on the way home As he finished speaking he rose to go and the dog springing up dashed out of the cabin and across the clearing toward the bluff by the corral barking furiously The two men looked at each other A rabbit said mister Howitt But they both knew that the well trained shepherd dog never tracked a rabbit and Old Matt s face was white when he mounted to ride away up the trail Long the shepherd stood in the doorway looking out into the night listening to the voices of the wilderness In his life in the hills he had found a little brightness while in the old mountaineer s words that evening he had glimpsed a future happiness of which he had scarcely dared to dream With the single exception of that one wild night his life had been an unbroken calm Now he was to leave it all And for what He seemed to hear the rush and roar of the world beyond the ridges as one in a quiet harbor hears outside the thunder of the stormy sea He shuddered The gloom and mystery of it all crept into his heart He was so alone But it was not the wilderness that made him shudder It was the thought of the great mad cruel world that raged beyond the hills that and something else The dog growled again and faced threateningly toward the cliff What is it Brave The only answer was an uneasy whine as the animal crouched close to the man s feet The shepherd peered into the darkness in the direction of the ruined cabin God he whispered how can I leave this place He turned back into the house closed and barred the door With the manner of one making a resolution after a hard struggle he took writing material from the top shelf of the cupboard and seating himself at the table began to write The hours slipped by and page after page closely written came from the shepherd s pen while as he wrote the man s face grew worn and haggard It was as though he lifted again the burden he had learned to lay aside At last it was finished Placing the sheets in an envelope he wrote the address with trembling hand While mister Howitt was writing his letter at the ranch and Old Matt was tossing sleeplessly on his bed in the big log house a horseman rode slowly down from the Compton Ridge road Stopping at the creek to water he pushed on up the mountain toward the Lane cabin The horse walked with low hung head and lagging feet the man slouched half asleep in the saddle It was Jim Lane CHAPTER XXI GOD S GOLD The troubled night passed The shepherd arose to see the sky above the eastern rim of the Hollow glowing with the first soft light of a new day Away over Compton Ridge one last pale star hung caught in the upper branches of a dead pine Not a leaf of the forest stirred In awe the man watched the miracle of the morning as the glowing colors touched cloud after cloud until the whole sky was aflame and the star was gone Again he seemed to hear faint and far away the roar and surge of the troubled sea With face uplifted he cried aloud O God my Father I ask thee not for the things that men deem great I covet not wealth nor honor nor ease only peace only that I may live free from those who do not understand only that I may in some measure make atonement that I may win pardon Oh drive me not from this haven into the world again AGAIN AGAIN came back from the cliff on the other side of the clearing and as the echo died away in the silent woods a bush on top of the bluff stirred in the breathless air stirred and was still again Somewhere up on Dewey a crow croaked hoarsely to his mate a cow on the range bawled loudly and the sheep in the corral chorused in answer Re entering the cabin the old man quickly built a fire then taking the bucket went to the spring for water He must prepare his breakfast Coming back with the brimming pail he placed it on the bench and was turning to the cupboard when he noticed on the table a small oblong package mister Matthews must have left it last night he thought Strange that I did not see it before Picking up the package he found that it was quite heavy and to his amazement saw that it was addressed to himself in a strange cramped printing such letters as a child would make He ripped open the covering and read in the same crude writing This stuff is for you to give to the Matthews s and Jim Lane but don t tell anyone where you got it And don t try to find out where it come from either or you ll wish you hadn t You needn t be afraid It s good money alright The package contained gold pieces of various denominations With a low exclamation the shepherd let the parcel slip and the money fell in a shining heap on the floor He stood as in a dream looking from the gold to the letter in his hand Then going to the door he gazed long and searchingly in every direction Nothing unusual met his eye Turning back into the cabin again he caught up the letter he had written and stepped to the fireplace an expression of relief upon his face But with his hand outstretched toward the flames he paused the letter still in his grasp while the expression of relief gave way to a look of fear The bank he muttered the robbery The shining pieces on the floor seemed to glisten mockingly No no no said the man Better the other way and yet He read the letter again It s good money alright you needn t be afraid In his quandary he heard a step without and looking up saw Pete in the open door The boy s sensitive face was aglow as he said Pete s glad this morning Pete saw the sky Did Dad see the sky mister Howitt nodded then moved by a sudden impulse pointed to the money and said Does Pete see this It s gold all gold The boy drew near with curious eyes Dad doesn t know where it came from continued the shepherd Does Pete know The youth gave a low laugh of delight Course Pete knows Pete went up on Dewey this morning way up to the old signal tree and course he took me with him The sky was all soft and silvery an the clouds was full plumb full of gold like that there He pointed to the yellow coins on the floor Didn t Dad see Some of it must o spilled out Ah yes that was God s gold said the older man softly The lad touched his friend on the arm and with the other hand again pointed to the glittering heap on the floor Pete says that there s God s gold too and Pete he knows The man started and looked at the boy in wonder But why why should it come to me at such a time as this he muttered Cause you re the Shepherd of Mutton Hollow Pete says Don t be scared Dad Pete knows It s sure God s gold The shepherd turned to the fireplace and dropped the letter he had written upon the leaping flames CHAPTER XXII A LETTER FROM OLLIE STEWART The Postoffice at the Forks occupied a commanding position in the northeast corner of Uncle Ike s cabin covering an area not less than four feet square The fittings were in excellent taste and the equipment fully adequate to the needs of the service an old table on legs somewhat rickety upon the table a rude box set on end and divided roughly into eight pigeon holes duly numbered in the table a drawer filled a little with stamps and stationery filled mostly with scraps of leaf tobacco and an odd company of veteran cob pipes now on the retired list or home on furlough before the table a little old chair wrought in some fearful and wonderful fashion from hickory sticks from which the bark had not been removed With every change of the weather this chair through some unknown but powerful influence changed its shape thus becoming in its own way a sort of government weather bureau And if in all this land of the free and home of the brave there be a single throne it must be this same curiously changeable chair In spite of or perhaps because of its strange powers that weird piece of furniture managed to make itself so felt that it was religiously avoided by every native who called at the Forks Not the wildest Hill Billy of them all dared to occupy for a moment this seat of Uncle Sam s representative Here Uncle Ike reigned supreme over his four feet square of government property And you may be very sure that the mighty mysterious thing known as the gov ment lost none of its might and nothing of its mystery at the hands of its worthy official Uncle Ike left the group in front of the cabin and hurriedly entering the office seated himself upon his throne A tall thin slow moving mule brought to before a certain tree with the grace and dignity of an ocean liner coming into her slip Zeke Wheeler dismounted and with the saddle mail pouch over his arm stalked solemnly across the yard and into the house his spurs clinking on the gravel and rattling over the floor Following the mail carrier the group of mountaineers entered and with Uncle Ike s entire family took their places at a respectful distance from the holy place of mystery and might in the north east corner of the room The postmaster with a key attached by a small chain to one corner of the table unlocked the flat pouch and drew forth the contents five papers three letters and one postal card The empty pouch was kicked contemptuously beneath the table The papers were tossed to one side All eyes were fixed on the little bundle of first class matter In a breathless silence the official cut the string The silence was broken Ba thundas Mary Liz Jolly ll sure be glad t git that there letter Her man s been gone nigh onto three months now an ain t wrote but once That was when he was in Mayville I see he s down in th nation now at Auburn sendin Mary Liz some money I reckon Ba thundas it s bout time What James Creelman E S Q Wal dad burn ME Jim done wrote t that there house in

buyin four dollar watches Must er sold that gray mule o hisn hit d fetch bout that much I reckon Much you know bout it Buck Boswell Let me tell you Jim he works he does He s the workingest man in this

one o them new fangled women in th city where he s gone to an not come back here for one o our girls I don t believe Sammy d care much nohow ba thundas What The official tossed the letter into a pigeon hole beside its neglected mate with a gesture that fully expressed the opinion of the entire community regarding mister Stewart and his intentions toward Miss Lane Sammy got the letters the next day and read them over and over as she rode slowly through the sweet smelling woods The last one told her that Ollie was coming home on a visit Thursday that s the day after to morrow she said aloud Then she read the letter again It was a very different letter from those Ollie had written when first he left the woods Most of all it was different in that indefinable something by which a man reveals his place in life in the letters he writes no less than in the words he speaks or the clothing he wears As Sammy rode slowly through the pinery and down the narrow Fall Creek valley she was thinking of these things thinking of these things seriously The girl had been in a way conscious of the gradual change in Ollie s life as it had been revealed in his letters but she had failed to connect the change with her lover The world into which young Stewart had gone and by which he was being formed was so foreign to the only world known to Sammy that while she realized in a dim way that he was undergoing a transformation she still saw him in her mind as the backwoods boy With the announcement of his return and the thought that she would soon meet him face to face it burst upon her suddenly that her lover was a stranger The man who wrote this letter was not the man whom she had promised to marry Who was he Passing the mill and the blacksmith shop the brown pony with his absorbed rider began to climb the steep road to the Matthews place Half way up the hill the little horse stepping on a loose stone stumbled catching himself quickly As a flash of lightning on a black night reveals well known landmarks and familiar objects this incident brought back to Sammy the evening when with Ollie and Young Matt she had climbed the same way when her horse had stumbled and her face had come close to the face of the big fellow whose hand was on the pony s neck The whole scene came before her with a vividness that was startling every word every look every gesture of the two young men her own thoughts and words the objects along the road the very motion of her horse she seemed to be actually living again those moments of the past But more than this she seemed not only to live again the incidents of that evening but in some strange way to possess the faculty of analyzing and passing judgment upon her own thoughts and words Great changes had come to Sammy too since that night when her lover had said good by And now in her deeper life the young woman felt a curious sense of shame as she saw how trivial were the things that had influenced her to become Ollie s promised wife She blushed as she recalled the motives that had sent her to the shepherd with the request that he teach her to be a fine lady Coming out on top of the ridge Brownie stopped of his own accord and the girl saw again the figure of a young giant standing in the level rays of the setting sun with his great arms outstretched saying I reckon I was built to live in these hills I don t guess you d better count on me ever bein more n I am Sammy realized suddenly that the question was no longer whether Ollie would be ashamed of her It was quite a different question indeed CHAPTER XXIII OLLIE COMES HOME The day that Ollie was expected at the cabin on Dewey Bald mister Lane was busy in the field I don t reckon you ll need me at th house nohow he said with a queer laugh as he rose from the dinner table and Sammy blushing told him to go on to his work or Young Matt would get his planting done first Jim went out to get his horse from the stable but before he left he returned once more to the house What is it Daddy Forget something asked Sammy as her father stood in the doorway Not exactly drawled Jim I ain t got a very good forgetter Wish I had It s somethin I can t forget Wish I could In a moment the girl s arms were about his neck You dear foolish old Daddy Jim I have a bad forgetter too You thought when I began studying with Dad Howitt that my books would make me forget you Well have they A tightening of the long arm about her waist was the only answer And now you are making yourself miserable trying to think that Ollie Stewart and his friends will make me forget you just as if all the folks in the world could ever be to me what you are you and Dad and Uncle Matt and Aunt Mollie and Young Matt Daddy I am ashamed of you Honest I am Do you think a real genuine lady could ever forget the father who had been so good to her Daddy I am insulted You must apologize immediately She pretended to draw away but the long arm held her fast while the mountaineer said in a voice that had in it pride and pain with a world of love I know I know girl But you ll be a livin in the city when you and Ollie are married and these old hills will be mighty lonesome with you gone You see I couldn t never leave the old place Tain t much I know so far as money value goes But there s some things worth a heap more than their money value I reckon If you was only goin t live where I could ride over once or twice a week to see you it would be different Yes Daddy but maybe I won t go after all I m not married yet you know Something in her voice or manner caused Jim to hold his daughter at arm s length and look full into the brown eyes What do you mean girl Sammy laughed in an uneasy and embarrassed way She was not sure that she knew herself all that lay beneath the simple words She tried to explain Why I mean that that Ollie and I have both grown up since we promised and he has been living away out in the big world and going to school besides He must have seen many girls since he left me He is sure to be changed greatly and and maybe he won t want a backwoods wife The man growled something beneath his breath and the girl placed a hand over his lips You mustn t say swear words Daddy Jim Indeed you must not Not in the presence of ladies anyway You re changed a heap in some ways too said Jim Yes I suppose I am but my changes are mostly on the inside like and perhaps he won t see them Would you care so mighty much Sammy whispered the father That s just it Daddy How can I tell We must both begin all over again don t you see Then she sent him away to his work Sammy had finished washing the dinner dishes and was putting things in order about the house when she stopped suddenly before the little shelf that held her books Then with a smile she carried them every one into her own room placing them carefully where they could not be seen from the open door Going next to the mirror she deliberately took down her hair and arranged it in the old careless way that Ollie had always known You re just the same backwoods girl Sammy Lane so far as outside things go she said to the face in the glass but you are not quite the same all the way through We ll see if he She was interrupted by the loud barking of the dog outside and her heart beat more quickly as a voice cried Hello hello I say call off your dog Sammy hurried to the door A strange gentleman stood at the gate The strangest gentleman that Sammy had ever seen Surely this could not be Ollie Stewart this slender pale faced man with faultless linen well gloved hands and shining patent leathers The girl drew back in embarrassment But there was no hesitation on the part of the young man Before she could recover from her astonishment he caught her in his arms and kissed her again and again until she struggled from his embrace You you must not she gasped Why not he demanded laughingly Has anyone a better right I have waited a long while for this and I mean to make up now for lost time He took a step toward her again but Sammy held him off at arm s length as she repeated No no you must not not now Young Stewart was helpless And the discovery that she was stronger than this man brought to the girl a strange feeling as of shame How strong you are he said petulantly ceasing his efforts Then carefully surveying the splendidly proportioned and developed young woman he added And how beautiful Under his look Sammy s face flushed painfully even to her neck and brow and the man seeing her confusion laughed again Then seating himself in the only rocking chair in the room the young gentleman leisurely removed his gloves looking around the while with an amused expression on his face while the girl stood watching him At last he said impatiently Sit down sit down Sammy You look at me as if I were a ghost Unconsciously she slipped into the speech of the old days You sure don t look much like you used to I never see nobody wear such clothes as them Not even Dad Howitt when he first come Do you wear em every day Ollie frowned You re just like all the rest Sammy Why don t you talk as you write You ve improved a lot in your letters If you talk like that in the city people will know in a minute that you are from the country At this Sammy rallied her scattered wits and the wide questioning look was in her eyes as she replied quietly Thank you I ll try to remember But tell me please what harm could it do if people did know I came from the country It was Ollie s turn to be amazed Why you can talk he said Where did you learn And the girl answered simply that she had picked it up from the old shepherd This little incident put Sammy more at ease and she skilfully led her companion to speak of the city and his life there Of his studies the young fellow had little to say and to her secret delight the girl found that she had actually made greater progress with her books than had her lover with all his supposed advantages But of other things of the gaiety and excitement of the great city of his new home the wealth of his uncle and his own bright prospects Ollie spoke freely never dreaming the girl had already seen the life he painted in such glowing colors through the eyes of one who had been careful to point out the froth and foam of it all Neither did the young man discover in the quiet questions she asked that Sammy was seeking to know what in all this new world he had found that he could make his own as the thing most worth while The backwoods girl had never seen that type of man to whom the life of the city only is life Ollie was peculiarly fitted by nature to absorb quickly those things of the world into which he had gone that were most different from the world he had left and there remained scarcely a trace of his earlier wilderness training But there is that in life that lies too deep for any mere change of environment to touch Sammy remembered a lesson the shepherd had given her gentle spirit may express itself in the rude words of illiteracy it is not therefore rude Ruffianism may speak the language of learning or religion it is ruffianism still Strength may wear the garb of weakness and still be strong and a weakling may carry the weapons of strength but fight with a faint heart So beneath all the changes that had come to her backwoods lover Sammy felt that Ollie himself was unchanged It was as though he had learned a new language but still said the same things Sammy too had entered a new world Step by step as the young man had advanced in his schooling and dropping the habits and customs of the backwoods had conformed in his outward life to his new environment the girl had advanced in her education under the careful hand of the old shepherd Ignorant still of the false standards and the petty ambitions that are so large a part of the complex world into which he had gone she had been introduced to a world where the life itself is the only thing worth while She had seen nothing of the glittering tinsel of that cheap culture that is death to all true refinement But in the daily companionship of her gentle teacher she had lived in touch with true aristocracy the aristocracy of heart and spirit Young Matt and Jim had thought that in Sammy s education the bond between the girl and her lover would be strengthened They had thought to see her growing farther and farther from the life of the hills the life to which they felt that they must always belong But that was because Young Matt and Jim did not know the kind of education the girl was getting So Ollie had come back to his old home to measure things by his new standard and he had come back too to be measured according to the old old standard If the man s eyes were dimmed by the flash and sparkle that play upon the surface of life the woman s vision was strong and clear to look into the still depths Later in the day as they walked together up the Old Trail to Sammy s Lookout the girl tried to show him some of the things that had been revealed to her in the past months But the young fellow could not follow where she led and answered her always with some flippant remark or with the superficial philosophy of his kind When he tried to turn the talk to their future she skillfully defeated his purpose or was silent and when he would claim a lover s privileges she held him off Upon his demanding a reason for her coldness she answered Don t you see that everything is different now We must learn to know each other over again But you are my promised wife I promised to be the wife of a backwoodsman she answered I cannot keep that promise for that man is dead You are a man of the city and I am scarcely acquainted with you Young Stewart found himself not a little puzzled by the situation He had come home expecting to meet a girl beautiful in face and form but with the mind of a child to wonder at the things he would tell her He had found instead a thoughtful young woman trained to look for and recognize truth and beauty Sammy was always his physical superior She was now his intellectual superior as well The change that had come to her was not a change by environment of the things that lay upon the surface but it was a change in the deeper things of life in the purpose and understanding of life itself Like many of his kind Ollie could not distinguish between these things CHAPTER XXIV WHAT MAKES A MAN mister Matthews and his son finished their planting early in the afternoon and the boy set out to find old Kate and the mule colt Those rovers had not appeared at the home place for nearly two weeks and some one must bring them in before they forgot their home completely Don t mind if I ain t back for supper Mother said Young Matt I may eat at the ranch with Dad I ain t been down there for quite a spell now an I d kind o like to know if that panther we ve been a hearin is givin Dad any trouble Dad told me yesterday that he thought he heard old Kate s bell over on yon side of Cox s Bald said mister Matthews I believe if I was you I d take across Cox s along the far side of th ridge around Dewey an down into the Hollow that way Joe Gardner was over north yesterday an he said he didn t see no signs on that range I reckon you ll find em on Dewey somewheres about Jim Lane s maybe You d better saddle a horse No I ll take it a foot I can ride old Kate in if I find them replied the big fellow and with his rifle in the hollow of his arm he struck out over the hills All along the eastern slope of the ridge that forms one side of Mutton Hollow he searched for the missing stock but not a sound of the bell could he hear not a trace of the vagabonds could he find And that was because old Kate and the little colt were standing quietly in the shade in a little glen below Sand Ridge not a quarter of a mile from the barn The afternoon was well on when Young Matt gave up the search and shaped his course for the sheep ranch He was on the farther side of Dewey and the sun told him that there was just time enough to reach the cabin before supper Pushing straight up the side of the mountain he found the narrow bench that runs like a great cornice two thirds of the way around the Bald Knob The mountaineer knew that at that level on the side opposite from where he stood was Sammy s Lookout and from there it was an easy road down to the sheep ranch in the valley Also he knew that from that rocky shelf all along the southern side of the mountain he would look down upon Sammy s home and who could tell he might even catch a glimpse of Sammy herself Very soon he rounded the turn of the hill and saw far below the Lane homestead the cabin and the barn in the little clearing looking like tiny doll houses Young Matt walked slowly now The supper was forgotten Coming to the clump of cedars just above the Old Trail where it turns the shoulder of the hill from the west he stopped for a last look Beyond this point he would turn his back upon the scene that interested him so deeply The young man could not remember when he had not loved Sammy Lane She seemed to have been always a part of his life It was the season of the year when all the wild things of the forest choose their mates and as the big fellow stood there looking down upon the home of the girl he loved all the splendid passion of his manhood called for her It seemed to him that the whole world was slipping away to leave him alone in a measureless universe He almost cried aloud It is the same instinct that prompts the panther to send his mating call ringing over the hills and through the forest and leads the moose to issue his loud challenge At last Young Matt turned to go when he heard the sound of voices Someone was coming along the Old Trail that lay in full view on the mountain side not two hundred yards away Instinctively the woodsman drew back into the thick foliage of the cedars The voices grew louder A moment more and Sammy with Ollie Stewart appeared from around the turn of the hill They were walking side by side and talking earnestly The young woman had just denied the claims of her former lover and was explaining the change in her attitude toward him but the big fellow on the ledge above could not know that He could not hear what they were saying He only saw his mate and the man who had come to take her from him Half crouching on the rocky shelf in the dark shadow of the cedar the giant seemed a wild thing ready for his spring ready and eager yet held in check by something more powerful still than his passion Slowly the two following the Old Trail passed from sight and Young Matt stood erect He was trembling like a frightened child A moment longer he waited then turned and fairly ran from the place Leaving the ledge at the Lookout he rushed down the mountain and through the woods as if mad to burst in upon the shepherd with words that were half a cry half a groan He s come Dad he s come I ve just seen him with her mister Howitt sprang up with a startled exclamation His face went white He grasped the table for support He tried to speak but words would not come He could only stare with frightened eyes as though Young Matt himself were some fearful apparition The big fellow threw himself into a chair and presently the shepherd managed to say in a hoarse whisper Tell me about it Grant if you can I seen them up on Dewey just now goin down the Old Trail from Sammy s Lookout to her home I was huntin stock The old scholar leaned toward his friend as he almost shouted Saw them going to Sammy s home Saw whom lad Whom did you see Why why Sammy Lane and that that Ollie Stewart of course I tell you he s come back Come to take her away The reaction was almost as bad as the shock mister Howitt gasped as he dropped back into his seat He felt a hysterical impulse to laugh to cry out Young Matt continued He s come home Dad with all his fine clothes and city airs and now she ll go away with him and we won t never see her again As he began to put his thoughts into words the giant got upon his feet and walked the floor like one insane He shan t have her he cried clenching his great fists he shan t have her If he was a man I could stand it Dad But look at him Look at him will you The little white faced washed out runt what is he He ain t no man Dad He ain t even as much of a man as he was And Sammy is God What a woman she is You ve been a tellin me that I could be a gentleman even if I always lived in the backwoods But you re wrong Dad plumb wrong I ain t no gentleman I can t never be one I m just a man I m a a savage a damned beast and I m glad of it He threw back his shaggy head and his white teeth gleamed through his parted lips as he spoke in tones of mad defiance Dad you say there s some things bigger n learnin and such and I reckon this here s one of them I don t care if that little whelp goes to all the schools there is and gets to be a president or a king I don t care if he s got all the money there is between here and hell put him out here in the woods face to face with life where them things don t count and what is he What is he Dad He s nothin plumb nothin The old shepherd waited quietly for the storm to pass The big fellow would come to himself after a time until then words were useless At last Young Matt spoke in calmer tones I run away Dad I had to I was afraid I d hurt him Something inside o me just fought to get at him and I couldn t a held out much longer I don t want to hurt nobody Dad I reckon it was a seein em together that did it It s a God s blessin I come away when I did it sure is He dropped wearily into his chair again Then the teacher spoke It is always a God s blessing lad when a man masters the worst of himself You are a strong man my boy You hardly know your strength But you need always to remember that the stronger the man the easier it is for him to become a beast Your manhood depends upon this and upon nothing else that you conquer and control the animal side of yourself It will be a sad moment for you and for all of us who love you if you ever forget Don t you see lad it is this victory only that gives you the right to think of yourself as a man Mind I say to think of yourself as a man It doesn t much matter what others think of you It is what one can honestly think of one s self that matters So they spent the evening together and the big mountaineer learned to see still more deeply into the things that had come to the older man in his years of study and painful experience When at last Young Matt arose to say good night the shepherd tried to persuade him to sleep at the ranch But he said no the folks at home would be looking for him and he must go I m mighty glad I come Dad he added I don t know what I d do if it wasn t for you go plumb hog wild and make a fool of myself I reckon I don t know what a lot of us would do either Seems like you re a sort of shepherd to the whole neighborhood I reckon though I m bout the worst in the flock he finished with a grim smile mister Howitt took his hat from the nail If you must go I will walk a little way with you I love to be out such nights as this I often wish Pete would take me with him He s out somewhere to night sure replied the other as they started We heard him a singin last night Then he stopped and asked Where s your gun Dad There s a panther somewhere on this range I know returned the shepherd I heard it scream last night and I meant to go up to the house to day for a gun I broke the hammer of mine yesterday That s bad said Young Matt But come on I ll leave mine with you until to morrow That fellow would sure make things lively if he should come to see you and catch you without a shootin iron Together the two walked through the timber until they came to where the trail that leads to the Matthews place begins to climb the low spur of the hill back of the house Here mister Howitt stopped to say good night adding as the young man gave him the rifle I don t like to take this Grant What if you should meet that panther between here and home Shucks returned the other you re the one that ll need it You ve got to take care of them sheep I ll get home alright Don t forget the other beast lad Remember what it is that makes the man CHAPTER XXV YOUNG MATT REMEMBERS After parting with his friend Young Matt continued on his way until he reached the open ground below the point where the path from the ranch joins the Old Trail Then he stopped and looked around Before him was the belt of timber and beyond the dark mass of the mountain ridge with the low gap where his home nestled among the trees He could see the light from the cabin window shining like a star Behind him lay the darker forest of the Hollow and beyond like a great sentinel was the round treeless form of Dewey Bald From where he stood he could even see clearly against the sky the profile of the mountain s shoulder and the ledge at Sammy s Lookout Another moment and the young man had left the path that led to his home and was making straight for the distant hill He would climb to that spot where he had stood in the afternoon and would look down once more upon the little cabin on the mountain side Then he would go home along the ridge Three quarters of an hour later he pushed up out of a ravine that he followed to its head below the Old Trail near the place where with Pete and the shepherd he had watched Sammy reading her letter He was climbing to the Lookout for it was the easiest way to the ledge and as his eye came on a level with the bench along which the path runs he saw clearly on the big rock above the figure of a man Instantly Young Matt stopped The moon shone full upon the spot and he easily recognized the figure It was Ollie Stewart Young Stewart had been greatly puzzled by Sammy s attitude It was so unexpected and to his mind so unreasonable He loved the girl as much as it was possible for one of his weak nature to love and he had felt sure of his place in her affections But the door that had once yielded so readily to his touch he had found fast shut He was on the outside and he seemed somehow to have lost the key In this mood on his way home he had reached the spot that was so closely associated with the girl and pausing to rest after the sharp climb had fallen to brooding over his disappointment So intent was he upon his gloomy thoughts that he had not heard Young Matt approaching and was wholly unconscious of that big fellow s presence in the vicinity For a time the face at the edge of the path regarded the figure on the rock intently then it dropped from sight Young Matt slipped quietly down into the ravine and a few moments later climbed again to the Old Trail at a point hidden from the Lookout Here he stepped quickly across the narrow open space and into the bushes on the slope of the mountain above Then with the skill of one born and reared in the woods the mountaineer made his way toward the man on the shoulder of the hill What purpose lay under his strange movement Young Matt did not know But certainly it was not in his mind to harm Ollie He was acting upon the impulse of the moment an impulse to get nearer and to study unobserved the person of his rival So he stalked him with all the instinct of a creature of the woods Not a twig snapped not a leaf rustled as from bush to fallen log from tree trunk to rock he crept always in the black shadows or behind some object But there were still other eyes on Old Dewey that night and sharp ears heard the big woodsman climbing out of the ravine if Ollie did not When the young man in the clear light of the moon crossed the Old Trail a figure near the clump of trees where he had sat with his two friends that day dropped quietly behind a big rock half hidden in the bushes As the giant crept toward the Lookout this figure followed showing but little less skill than the mountaineer himself Once a loose stone rattled slightly and the big fellow turned his head but the figure was lying behind a log that the other had just left When Young Matt finally reached the position as close to Ollie as he could go without certain discovery the figure also came to a rest not far away The moments passed very slowly now to the man crouching in the shadows Ollie looked at his watch It was early yet to one accustomed to late hours in the city Young Matt heard distinctly the snap of the case as the watch was closed and returned to its owner s pocket Then Stewart lighted a cigar and flipped the burned out match almost into his unseen companion s face It seemed to Young Matt that he had been there for hours Years ago he left his home yonder on the ridge to look for stray stock They must have forgotten him long before this The quiet cabin in the Hollow and his friend the shepherd too were far away In all that lonely mountain there was no one no one but that man on the rock there that man and himself How bright the moon was Suddenly another form appeared upon the scene It came creeping around the hill from beyond the Lookout It was a long low lithe bodied form that moved with the easy gliding movements of a big cat Noiselessly the soft padded feet fell upon the hard rock and loose gravel of the old pathway the pathway along which so many things had gone for their kill or had gone to be killed Young Matt saw it the moment it appeared He started in his place He recognized it instantly as the most feared of all the wild things in the mountain wilderness a panther He saw it sniff the footprints on the trail Ollie s footprints He saw it pause and crouch as it caught sight of the man on the rock Instantly wild and unwelcome thoughts burned within the strong man s brain The woodsman knew why that thing had come Against such a foe the unconscious weakling on the rock there calmly puffing his cigar would have no chance whatever He would not even know of its presence until it had made its spring and its fangs were in his neck The man of the wilderness knew just how it would be done It would be over in a minute The giant clenched his teeth Why had he not gone on to his home after leaving the shepherd Why had he followed that impulse to stand again where he had stood that afternoon Above all what had possessed him what had led him to creep to his present position He shot a quick glance around How bright how bright the moon was The panther turned aside from the trail and with silent grace leaped to the ledge gaining a position on a level with Ollie still unconscious of its presence A cold sweat broke out on the big man s forehead The great hands worked His breath came in quick gasps It could not be laid to his door He had only to withdraw to stop his ears and run as he had fled that afternoon God How slowly that thing crept forward crouching low upon its belly its tail twitching from side to side nearer nearer Young Matt felt smothered He loosened the collar of his shirt The moon the moon was so bright He could even see the muscles in the beast s heavy neck and shoulders working under the sleek skin Suddenly the words of the shepherd came to him as though shouted in his ears Remember the other beast lad Don t you see it is this victory only that gives you the right to think of yourself as a man Ollie was almost brushed from his place as the big mountaineer sprang from the shadow while the panther startled by the appearance of another man upon the rock paused An exclamation of fright burst from young Stewart as he took in the situation And the giant by his side reached forth a hand to push him back as he growled Shut up and get out of the way This here s my fight At the movement the wild beast seemed to understand that the newcomer was there to rob him of his prey With a snarl it crouched low again gathering its muscles for the spring The giant waited Suddenly the sharp crack of a rifle rang out on the still night echoing and echoing along the mountain The panther leaped but fell short The startled men on the rock saw it threshing the ground in its death struggle That was a lucky shot for you said Ollie Lucky for me repeated Young Matt slowly eyeing his well dressed companion Well yes I reckon it was Who fired it The big fellow shook his head in a puzzled way Stewart looked surprised Wasn t it someone hunting with you With me Huntin Not to night muttered the other still searching the hill side Well I d like to know what you were doing here alone then said Ollie suspiciously At his tone Young Matt turned upon him savagely Tain t none of your business what I was a doin here that I can see I reckon these hills are free yet But it s mighty lucky for us both that someone was round whoever he is Maybe you ain t thankful that that critter ain t fastened on your neck But I am An I m goin to find out who fired that shot if I can He started forward but Ollie called imperiously Hold on there a minute I want to say something to you first The other paused and young Stewart continued I don t know what you mean by prowling around this time of night But it looks as though you were watching me I warn you fairly don t try it again I know how you feel toward Miss Lane and I know how you have been with her while I was away I tell you it s got to stop She is to be my wife and I shall protect her You may just as well He got no further The big man sprang forward to face him with a look that made the dandy shrink with fear Protect Sammy Lane from me Protect her you You know what I feel toward her You He fairly choked with his wild rage The frightened Ollie drew a weapon from his pocket but with a snarling laugh the big fellow reached out his great hand and the shining toy went whirling through the air Go home said the giant Damn you go home Don t you hear For God s sake get out o my sight fore I forget again Ollie went CHAPTER XXVI OLLIE S DILEMMA As Preachin Bill used to say Every hound has hits strong pints but some has more of em Young Stewart was not without graces pleasing to the girl whom he hoped to make his wife He seemed to know instinctively all those little attentions in which women so delight and he could talk too very entertainingly of the things he had seen To the simple girl of the backwoods he succeeded in making the life in the city appear very wonderful indeed Neither was Sammy insensible to the influence of his position and his prospective wealth with the advantages that these things offered Then with all this he loved her dearly and when if you please was ever a woman wholly unmoved by the knowledge that she held first place in a man s heart For two weeks they were together nearly every day sometimes spending the afternoon at the girl s home on the side of Dewey or roving over the nearby hills sometimes going for long rides through the great woods to pass the day with friends returning in the evening to find Jim smoking in the doorway of the darkened cabin When mister Lane at the end of the first week asked his daughter in his point blank fashion what she was going to do with young Stewart the girl answered He must have his chance Daddy He mast have a good fair chance I I don t know what it is but there is I I don t know Daddy I am sure I loved him when he want away that is I think I am sure And Jim looking into her eyes agreed heartily then he took down his violin to make joyful music far into the night Ollie did not see Young Matt after their meeting on the Lookout The big fellow too avoided the couple and Sammy for some reason carefully planned their rides so that they would not be likely to meet their neighbor an the ridge Once indeed they called at the Matthews place walking over in the evening but that was when Sammy knew that Young Matt was not at home Day after day as they talked together the girl tried honestly to enter into the life of the man she had promised to marry But always there was that feeling of something lacking Just what that something was or why she could not feel completely satisfied Sammy did not understand But the day was soon to come when she would know the real impulses of her heart Since that first afternoon Ollie had not tried to force his suit While in a hundred little ways he had not failed to make her feel his love he had never openly attempted the role of lover He was conscious that to put the girl constantly upon the defensive would be disastrous to his hopes and in this he was wise But the time had come when he must speak for it was the last day of his visit He felt that he could not go back to the city without a definite understanding Sammy too realized this but still she was not ready to give an answer to the question he would ask They had been to the Forks and were on their way home As they rode slowly under the trees the man pleaded his cause but the woman could only shake her head and answer quite truthfully Ollie I don t know But tell me Sammy is there any one in the way Again she shook her head I I think not You think not Don t you know The young man reined his horse closer to the brown pony Let me help you decide dear You are troubled because of the change you see in me and because the life that I have tried to tell you about is so strange so different from this You need not fear With me you will very soon be at home there as much at home as you are here Come dear let me answer for you The girl lifted her face to his Oh if you only could But even as she spoke there came to her the memory of that ride home from the party at Ford s when her pony had crowded close to the big white faced sorrel It was Brownie this time who was pulled sharply aside The almost involuntary act brought a quick flush to the young man s cheek and he promptly reined his own horse to the right thus placing the full width of the road between them So they went down the hill into the valley where Fall Creek tumbled and laughed on its rocky way A thread of blue smoke curling lazily up from the old stack and the sound of a hammer told them that some one was at the mill Sammy was caught by a sudden impulse Why that must be Young Matt she exclaimed Let us stop I do believe you haven t seen him since you came home I don t want to see him nor any one else now returned Ollie This is our last evening together Sammy and I want you all to myself Let us go up the old Roark trail around Cox s Bald and home through the big low gap He checked his horse as he spoke for they had already passed the point where the Roark trail leaves Fall Creek But the girl was determined to follow her impulse You can stop just a minute she urged You really ought to see Matt you know We can ride back this way if you like It s early yet But the man held his place and replied shortly I tell you I don t want to see anybody and I am very sure that Young Matt doesn t want to see me not with you anyway Sammy flushed at this and answered with some warmth There is no reason in the world why you should refuse to meet an old friend but you may do as you please of course Only I am going to the mill So saying she started down the valley and as there was really nothing else for him to do the man followed As they approached the mill Sammy called for Young Matt who immediately left his work and came to them The big fellow wore no coat and his great arms were bare while his old shirt patched and faded and patched again was soiled by engine grease and perspiration His trousers too held in place by suspenders repaired with belt lacing and fastened with a nail were covered with sawdust and dirt His hands and arms and even his face were treated liberally with the same mixture that stained his clothing and the shaggy red brown hair uncovered was sadly tumbled In his hand he held a wrench The morrow was grinding day and he had been making some repairs about the engine Altogether as the backwoodsman came forward he presented a marked contrast to the freshly clad well groomed gentleman from the city And to the woman the contrast was not without advantages to the man in the good clothes The thought flashed through her mind that the men who would work for Ollie in the shops would look like this It was the same old advantage the advantage that the captain has over the private the advantage of rank regardless of worth Sammy greeted Young Matt warmly I just told Ollie that it was too bad he had not seen you You were away the night we called at your house you know and he is going home to morrow The giant looked from one to the other Evidently Sammy had not heard of that meeting at the Lookout and Stewart s face grew red as he saw what was in the big fellow s mind I m mighty glad to see you again he said lamely I told Sammy that I had seen you but she has forgotten Oh no I haven t replied the girl You said that you saw him in the field as you passed the first day you came but that you were in such a hurry you didn t stop At this Ollie forced a loud laugh and remarked that he was in something of a hurry that day He hoped that in the girl s confusion the point might be overlooked But the mountaineer was not to be sidetracked so easily Ollie s poor attempt only showed more clearly that he had purposely refrained from telling Sammy of the might when Young Matt had interfered to save his life To the simple straight forward lad of the woods such a course revealed a spirit most contemptible Raising his soiled hands and looking straight at Ollie he said deliberately I m sorry seein as this is the first time we ve met that I can t shake hands with you This here s CLEAN dirt though Sammy was puzzled Ollie s objection to their calling at the mill his evident embarrassment at the meeting and something in Young Matt s voice that hinted at a double meaning in his simple words all told her that there was something beneath the surface which she did not understand After his one remark to her escort the woodsman turned to the girl and in spite of Sammy s persistent attempts to bring the now sullen Ollie into the conversation ignored the man completely When they had talked for a few moments Young Matt said I reckon you ll have to excuse me a minute Sammy I left the engine in such a hurry when you called that I ll have to look at it again It won t take more n a minute As he disappeared in the mill shed the young lady turned to her companion What s the matter with you two Have you met and quarreled since you came home Fate was being very unkind to Ollie He replied gruffly You ll have to ask your friend I told you how it would be The greasy hobo doesn t like to see me with you and hasn t manners enough even to hide his feelings Come let us go on A look that was really worth seeing came into the girl s fine eyes but she only said calmly Matt will be back in a minute All the more reason why we should go I should think you have had enough I am sure I have The young woman was determined now to know what lay at the bottom of all this She said quietly but with a great deal of decision You may go on home if you wish I am going to wait here until Young Matt comes back Ollie was angry now in good earnest He had not told Sammy of the incident at the Lookout because he felt that the story would bring the backwoodsman into a light altogether too favorable He thought to have the girl safely won before he left the hills then it would not matter That Young Matt would have really saved Ollie s life at the risk of his own there was no doubt And Stewart realized that his silence under such circumstances would look decidedly small and ungrateful to the girl To have the story told at this critical moment was altogether worse than if he had generously told of the incident at once He saw too that Sammy guessed at some thing beneath the surface and he felt uneasy in remaining until Young Matt came back to renew the conversation And yet he feared to leave At this stage of his dilemma he was relieved from his plight in a very unexpected manner CHAPTER XXVII THE CHAMPION A big wagon with two men on the seat appeared coming up the valley road It was Wash Gibbs and a crony from the river They had stopped at the distillery on their way and were just enough under the influence of drink to be funny and reckless When they caught sight of Ollie Stewart and Miss Lane Wash said something to his companion at which both laughed uproariously Upon reaching the couple the wagon came to a stop and after looking at Ollie for some moments with the silent gravity of an owl Gibbs turned to the young lady Howdy honey Where did you git that there Did your paw give hit to you fer a doll baby Young Stewart s face grew scarlet but he said nothing Can t hit talk continued Gibbs with mock interest Glancing at her frightened escort the girl replied You drive on Wash Gibbs You re in no condition to talk to anyone An ugly leer came over the brutal face of the giant Oh I ain t ain t I You think I m drunk But I ain t not so mighty much Jest enough t perten me up a pepper grain Then turning to his companion who was grinning in appreciation of the scene he continued Here Bill you hold th ribbens an watch me tend t that little job I told you I laid out t do first chance I got At this Ollie grew as pale as death Once he started as if to escape but he could not under Sammy s eyes As Wash was climbing down from the wagon he caught sight of Young Matt standing in the door of the mill shed Hello Matt he called cheerfully I ain t a lookin fer you t day tend t you some other time Got more important business jest now Young Matt made no reply nor did he move to interfere In the backwoods every man must fight his own battles so long as he fights with men When Stewart was in danger from the panther it was different This was man to man Sammy too reared in the mountains and knowing the code waited quietly to see what her lover would do Coming to Ollie s side Gibbs said Git down young feller an look at yer saddle You go on and let me alone Wash Gibbs I ve never hurt you Ollie s naturally high pitched voice was shrill with fear Wash paused looked back at his companion in the wagon then to Young Matt and then to the girl on the horse That s right he said shaking his head with ponderous gravity You all hear him He ain t never hurted me nary a bit Nary a bit ladies an gentlemen But good Lord look at him Hain t hit awful Suddenly he reached out one great arm and jerked the young man from his horse catching him with the other hand as he fell and setting him on his feet in the middle of the road Ollie was like a child in the grasp of his huge tormentor and in spite of her indignation a look of admiration flashed over Sammy s face at the exhibition of the bully s wonderful physical strength an admiration that only heightened the feeling of shame for her lover s weakness Gibbs addressed his victim Now dolly you an me s goin t play a little Come on let s see you dance The other struggled feebly a moment and attempted to draw a pistol whereupon Wash promptly captured the weapon remarking in a sad tone as he did so You hadn t ought t tote such a gun as that sonny hit might go off Hit s a right pretty little thing ain t hit he continued holding his victim with one hand and examining the pearl handled nickel plated weapon with great interest Hit sure is But say dolly if you was ever t shoot me with that there an I found hit out I d sure be powerful mad You hear me now an don t you pack that gun no more not in these mountains Hit ain t safe The fellow in the wagon roared with delight at these witticisms and looked from Young Matt to Sammy to see if they also appreciated the joke Got any more pretties asked Gibbs of his victim No Let s see Catching the young man by the waist he lifted him bodily and holding him head downward shook him roughly Again Sammy felt her blood tingle at the feat of strength Next holding Ollie with one huge hand at the back of his neck Wash said See that feller in th wagon there He s a mighty fine gentleman friend o mine Make a bow t him As he finished with his free hand he struck the young man a sharp blow in the stomach with the result that Stewart did make a bow very low but rather too suddenly to be graceful The fellow in the wagon jumped up and bowed again and again Howdy mister City Man howdy Mighty proud t meet up with you mighty proud you bet The giant whirled his captive toward the mill See that feller yonder I m goin t lick him some day Make a face at him Catching Ollie by the nose and chin he tried to force his bidding while the man in the wagon made the valley ring with his laughter Then Wash suddenly faced the helpless young man toward Sammy Now ladies and gentlemen he said in the tones of a showman addressing an audience this here pretty little feller from th city s goin t show us Hill Billies how t spark a gal The bully s friend applauded loudly roaring at the top of his voice Marry em Wash Marry em You can do hit as good as a parson You d make a good parson Let s see how d you go at hit The notion tickled the fancy of the giant for it offered a way to make Sammy share the humiliation more fully Git down an come here t yer honey he said to the girl Git down I say he repeated when the young woman made no motion to obey Indeed I will not replied Sammy shortly Her tone and manner angered Gibbs and dropping Ollie he started toward the girl to take her from the horse by force As he reached the pony s side Sammy raised her whip and with all her strength struck him full across the face The big ruffian drew back with a bellow of pain and anger Then he started toward her again I ll tame you you wild cat he yelled And Sammy raised her whip again But before Gibbs could touch the girl a powerful hand caught him by the shoulder I reckon you ve had fun enough Wash Gibbs remarked Young Matt in his slow way I ain t interfering between man and man but you d best keep your dirty hands off that lady The young woman s heart leaped at the sound of that deep calm voice that carried such a suggestion of power And she saw that the blue eyes under the tumbled red brown locks were shining now like points of polished steel The strong man s soul was rejoicing with the fierce joy of battle The big bully drew back a step and glared at the man who had come between him and his victim the man whom for every reason he hated Lifting his huge paws he said in a voice hoarse with deadly menace Dirty be they By hell I ll wash em An hit won t be water that ll clean em neither Don t you know that no man ever crosses my trail an lives The other returned easily Oh shucks Get into your wagon and drive on You ain t on Roark now You re on Fall Creek and over here you ain t no bigger n anybody else While Young Matt was speaking Gibbs backed slowly away and as the young man finished suddenly drew the pistol he had taken from Ollie With a quickness and lightness astonishing in one of his bulk and usually slow movements the mountaineer leaped upon his big enemy There was a short sharp struggle and Wash staggered backward leaving the shining weapon in Young Matt s hand It might go off you know said the young fellow quietly as he tossed the gun on the ground at Ollie s feet With a mad roar Gibbs recovered himself and rushed at his antagonist It was a terrific struggle not the skillful sparring of trained fighters but the rough and tumble battling of primitive giants It was the climax of long months of hatred the meeting of two who were by every instinct mortal enemies Ollie shrank back in terror but Sammy leaned forward in the saddle her beautiful figure tense her lips parted and her face flushed with excitement It was soon evident that the big champion of the hills had at last met his match As he realized this a look of devilish cunning crept into the animal face of Gibbs and he maneuvered carefully to bring his enemy s back toward the wagon Catching a look from his friend over Young Matt s shoulder the man in the wagon slipped quickly to the ground and Sammy saw with horror a naked knife in his hand She glanced toward Ollie appealingly but that gentleman was helpless The man with the knife began creeping cautiously toward the fighting men keeping always behind Young Matt The young woman felt as though an iron band held her fast She could not move She could not speak Then Gibbs went down and the girl s scream rang out Behind you Matt Look quick As he recovered his balance from the effort that had thrown Wash Young Matt heard her cry saw the girl s look of horror and her outstretched hand pointing Like a flash he whirled just as the knife was lifted high for the murderous blow It was over in an instant Sammy saw him catch the wrist of the uplifted arm heard a dull snap and a groan saw the knife fall from the helpless hand and then saw the man lifted bodily and thrown clear over the wagon to fall helpless on the rocky ground The woman gave a low cry Oh WHAT A MAN Wash Gibbs too opened his eyes just in time to witness the unheard of feat and to see the bare armed young giant who performed it turn again breathing heavily with his great exertion but still ready to meet his big antagonist The defeated bully rose from the ground The other stepped forward to meet him But without a word Gibbs climbed into the wagon and took up the reins Before they could move Young Matt had the mules by their heads You have forgotten something he said quietly pointing to the man on the ground who was still unconscious from his terrible fall That there s your property Take it along We ain t got no use for such as that on Fall Creek Sullenly Wash climbed down and lifted his companion into the wagon As Young Matt stood aside to let him go the bully said I ll see you agin fer this The strong man only answered I reckon you d better stay on Roark Wash Gibbs You got more room there CHAPTER XXVIII WHAT PETE TOLD SAMMY No word was spoken by either Sammy or her lover while their horses were climbing the mill road and both were glad when they reached the top of the ridge and turned into the narrow path where they would need to ride one before the other It was not easy to ride side by side when each was busy with thoughts not to be spoken At the gate Ollie dismounted to help the girl from her horse But before he could reach the pony s side Sammy sprang lightly to the ground unassisted Opening the big gate she turned Brownie loose in the yard while the man stood watching her a baffled look upon his face He had always done these little things for her To be refused at this time was not pleasant The feeling that he was on the outside grew stronger Turning to his own horse Ollie placed his foot in the stirrup to mount when Sammy spoke perhaps she felt that she had been a little unkind You were going to stay to supper she said Not to night he answered gaining his seat in the saddle and picking up the reins But you are going to leave in the morning are you not You you must not go like this He dropped the reins to the horse s neck again Look here Sammy do you blame me because I did not fight that big bully Sammy did not reply What could I do You know there is not another man in the mountains beside Young Matt who could have done it Surely you cannot blame me The young woman moved uneasily No certainly not I do not blame you in the least I but it was very fortunate that Young Matt was there wasn t it The last sentence slipped out before she knew Ollie retorted angrily It seems to be very fortunate for him He will be a greater hero than ever now I suppose If he is wise he will stay in the backwoods to be worshipped for he ll find that his size won t count for much in the world He s a great man here where he can fight like a beast but his style wouldn t go far where brains are of value It would be interesting to see him in town a man who never saw a railroad Sammy lifted her head quickly at this and fixed her eyes on the man s face with that wide questioning gaze that reminded one so of her father I never saw a railroad either not that I can remember though I suppose we must have crossed one or two on our way to Texas when I was a baby Is it the railroads then that makes one so so superior The man turned impatiently in the saddle You know what I mean Yes she answered slowly I think I do know what you mean Ollie lifted the reins again from his horse s neck and angered them nervously I d better go now there s no use talking about this to night I won t leave in the morning as I had planned I I can t go like this There was a little catch in his voice May I come again to morrow afternoon Sammy Yes you had better go now and come back to morrow And Sammy won t you try to think that I am not altogether worthless even if I am not big enough to fight Wash Gibbs You are sure that you do not blame me for what happened at the mill No she said of course not You could not help it Why should I blame anyone for that which he cannot help Then Ollie rode away and Sammy going to her pony stood petting the little horse while she watched her lover up the Old Trail and still there was that wide questioning look in her eyes As Ollie passed from sight around the hill above the girl slipped out of the gate and a few minutes later stood at the Lookout where she could watch her lover riding along the ridge She saw him pass from the open into the fringe of timber near the big gap and a few minutes later saw him reappear beyond the deer lick Still she watched as he moved along the rim of the Hollow looking in the distance like a toy man on a toy horse watched until he passed from sight into the timber again and was gone And all the time that questioning look was in her eyes Did she blame Ollie that he had played so poorly his part in the scene at the mill No she told herself over and over again as though repeating a lesson no Ollie was not to blame and yet She knew that he had spoken truly when he said that there were things that counted for more than brute strength But was there not something more than brute strength in the incident Was there not that which lay deeper something of which the brute strength after all was only an expression The girl stamped her foot impatiently as she exclaimed aloud Oh why did he not TRY to do something He should have forced Wash Gibbs to beat him into insensibility rather than to have submitted so tamely to being played with In the distance she saw the shepherd following his flock down the mountain and the old scholar who always watched the Lookout when in the vicinity for a glimpse of his pupil waved his hand in greeting as he moved slowly on after his charges It was growing late Her father too would be coming home for his supper But as she rose to go a step on the mountain side above caught her attention and looking up she saw Pete coming toward the big rock Sammy greeted the youth kindly I haven t seen Pete for days and days where has he been Pete s been everywhere an course I ve been with him replied the lad with his wide sweeping gesture Then throwing himself at full length at the girl s feet he said abruptly Pete was here that night and God he was here too Couldn t nobody else but God o done it The gun went bang and a lot more guns went bang bang all along the mountains And the moonlight things that was a dancin quit cause they was scared and that panther it just doubled up and died Matt and Ollie wasn t hurted nary a bit Pete says it was God done that He was sure in the hills that night Sammy was startled Matt and Ollie a panther What do you mean boy The troubled look shadowed the delicate face as the lad shook his head Don t mean nothin Sammy not me Nobody can t mean nothin can they But what does Pete mean Does Pete know about it Oh yes course Pete knows everything Don t Sammy know bout that night when God was in the hills He was eager now with eyes wide and face aglow No said Sammy I do not know Will Pete tell me all about it The strange youth seated himself on the rock facing the valley below saying in a low tone Ollie was a settin like this all still just a smokin and a watchin the moonlight things that was dancin over the tops of the trees down there Then leaping to his feet the boy ran a short way along the ledge to come stealing back crouching low as he whispered It come a creepin and a creepin towards Ollie and he never knowed nothin about it But Matt he knowed and God he knowed too Wonderingly the girl watched his movement Suddenly he sprang to the rock again and facing the imaginary beast cried in childish imitation of a man s deep voice Get out of the way This here s my fight Then in his own tones It was sure scared when Young Matt jumped on the rock Everything s scared of Matt when he talks like that It was mad too cause Matt he wouldn t let it get Ollie And it got ready to jump at Matt and Matt he got ready for a tussle and Ollie he got out of the way And all the moonlight things stopped dancin and the shadow things come out to see the fight He had lowered his voice again almost to a whisper Sammy was breathless Bang cried the lad clapping his hands and shouting the words Bang Bang God he fired and all the guns in the hills went off and that panther it just doubled up and died It would sure got Ollie though if Matt hadn t a jumped on the rock when he did But do you reckon it could o got Matt if God hadn t been here that night It was all too clearly portrayed to be mistaken Sammy needn t be afeared continued Pete seeing the look on the girl s face It can t come back no more It just naturally can t you know Sammy cause God he killed it plumb dead And Pete dragged it way over on yon side of the ridge and the buzzards got it CHAPTER XXIX JIM LANE MAKES A PROMISE Sammy went home to find her father getting supper Rushing into the cabin the girl gave him a hug that caused Jim to nearly drop the coffee pot You poor abused Daddy to come home from work all tired and find no supper no girl no nothing Sit right down there now and rest while I finish things Jim obeyed with a grin of appreciation I didn t fix no taters thought you wasn t comin Going to starve yourself were you just because I was gone replied the girl with a pan of potatoes in her hand I see right now that I will have to take care of you always always Daddy Jim The smile suddenly left the man s face Where s Ollie Stewart Didn t he come home with you Ollie s at home I suppose I have been up to the Lookout talking to Pete Ain t Ollie goin back to the city to morrow No not to morrow the next day He s coming over here to morrow afternoon Then he s going away Then before Jim could ask another question she held up the half of a ham Daddy Daddy How many times have I told you that you must not you must not slice the ham with your pocket knife Just look there What would Aunt Mollie say if she saw that so haggled and one sided All during the evening meal the girl kept up a ceaseless merry chatter changing the subject abruptly every time it approached the question that her father was most anxious to ask And the man delighted with her gay mood responded to it as he answered to all her moods until they were like two school children in their fun But when supper was over and the work done and Jim taking down his violin would have made music Sammy promptly relieved him of his instrument and seated herself on his knee Not to night Daddy I want to talk to night real serious She told him then of the encounter with Wash Gibbs and his friend at the mill together with the story that Pete had illustrated so vividly at the Lookout And so Daddy she finished I know now what I shall do He will come to morrow afternoon to say good by and then he will go away again back to the city and his fine friends for good And I ll stay and take care of my Daddy Jim It isn t that he is a bad man like Wash Gibbs He couldn t be a bad man like that he isn t big enough And that s just it He is too little body soul and spirit he is too little He will do well in the world perhaps he will even do big things But I heard dear old Preachin Bill say once that some fellers can do mighty big things in a durned little way So he is going back to the city and I am going to stay in the hills Jim took no pains to hide his delight I knowed it girl I knowed it Bank on the old blood every time There ain t a drop of yeller in it not a drop Sammy Ollie ain t to say bad but he ain t just our kind Lord But I d like to o seen Young Matt a givin it to Wash Gibbs He threw back his head and roared with delight Just wait till I see Wash I ll ask him if he thinks Young Matt would need a pry for to lift that mill engine with now Then all of a sudden the laugh died out and the man s dark face was serious as he said slowly The boy ll have to watch him though It ll sure be war from this on the worst kind of war Daddy what do you think Wash would have done to me if Young Matt had not been there That metallic ring was in Jim s voice now as he replied Wash Gibbs ought to knowed better than to done that But it was a blessin Young Matt was there wasn t it He d take care of you anywhere I wouldn t never be afraid for you with him The girl hid her face on her father s shoulder as she said Daddy will Wash Gibbs come here any more now It seems to me he wouldn t dare meet you after this Jim answered uneasily I don t know girl I reckon he ll be around again after a time There was a pause for a little while then Sammy with her arms still about his neck said Daddy I m going to stay in the hills with you now I am going to send Ollie away to morrow because as you say he isn t our kind Daddy Wash Gibbs is not our kind either is he You don t understand girl and I can t tell you now It all started way back when you was a little trick The young woman answered very gently Yes I know You have told me that often But Daddy what will what will our friends think if you keep on with Wash Gibbs now after what happened at the mill to day Young Matt fought Gibbs because he insulted me and was going to hurt me You say yourself that it will be war between them now Will you side with Wash And if you do won t it look like there was just a little tiny streak of yellow in us This side of the situation had not struck Jim at first He got up and walked the floor while the girl standing quietly by the fireplace watched him a proud fond light in her eyes Sammy did not know what the bond between her father and the big ruffian was but she knew that it was not a light one Now that the issue was fairly defined she felt confident that whatever the cost the break would be made But at this time it was well that she did not know how great the cost of breaking the bond between the two men would be Jim stopped before his daughter and placing a hand upon each shoulder said Tell me girl are you so powerful anxious to have me and Young Matt stay good friends like we ve always been I I am afraid I am Daddy And then a rare smile came into the dark face of Jim Lane He kissed the girl and said I ll do it honey I ain t afraid to now CHAPTER XXX SAMMY GRADUATES The next day when young Stewart came the books were all back on the shelf in the main room of the cabin and Sammy dressed in a fresh gown of simple goods and fashion with her hair arranged carefully as she had worn it the last two months before Ollie s coming sat at the window reading The man was surprised and a little embarrassed Why what have you been doing to yourself he exclaimed I have not been doing anything to myself I have only done some things to my clothes and hair returned the girl Then he saw the books Why where did these come from He crossed the room to examine the volumes Do you do you read all these The shepherd has been helping me she explained Oh yes I understood that you were studying with him He looked at her curiously as though they were meeting for the first time Then as she talked of her studies his embarrassment deepened for he found himself foundering hopelessly before this clear eyed clear brained backwoods girl Come said Sammy at last Let us go for a walk She led the way to her favorite spot high up on the shoulder of Dewey and there with Mutton Hollow at their feet and the big hills about them with the long blue ridges in the distance beyond which lay Ollie s world she told him what he feared to learn The man refused to believe that he heard aright You do not understand he protested and he tried to tell her of the place in life that would be hers as his wife In his shallowness he talked even of jewels and dresses and such things But can all this add one thing to life itself she asked Is not life really independent of all these things Do they not indeed cover up the real life and rob one of freedom It seems to me that it must be so He could only answer But you know nothing about it How can you You have never been out of these woods No she returned that is true I have never been out of these woods and you can never now get away from the world into which you have gone She pointed to the distant hills It is very very far over there to where you live I might indeed find many things in your world that would be delightful but I fear that I should lose the things that after all are to me the really big things I do not feel that the things that are greatest in your life could bring happiness without that which I find here And there is something here that can bring happiness without what you call the advantages of the world to which you belong What do you know of the world he said roughly Nothing she said But I know a little of life And I have learned some things that I fear you have not Beside I know now that I do not love you I have been slow to find the truth but I have found it And this is the one thing that matters that I found it in time Did you reach this conclusion at the mill yesterday he asked with a sneer No It came to me here on the rock last evening after you were gone I heard a strange story the story of a weak man a strong man and a God who was very kind Ollie saw that further persuasion was of no avail and as he left her she watched him out of sight for the last time along the trail that is nobody knows how old When he was gone in obedience to an impulse she did not try to understand she ran down the mountain to the cabin in the Hollow Young Matt s cabin And when the shepherd came in from the hills with his flock he found the house in such order as only a woman s hand can bring The table was set and his supper cooking on the stove Dad she asked Do you think I know enough now to live in the city The old man s heart sank It had come then Bravely he concealed his feelings as he assured her in the strongest terms that she knew enough and was good enough to live anywhere Then said Sammy I know enough even if I am not good enough to live in the hills The brown eyes deep under their shaggy brows were aglow with gladness and there was a note of triumph in the scholar s voice as he said Then you do not regret learning the things I have tried to teach you You are sure you have no sorrow for the things you are losing Regret Dad Regret The young woman drew herself up and lifted her arms Oh Dad I see it all now all that you have been trying in a thousand ways to teach me You have led me into a new world the real world the world that has always been and must always be and in that world man is king king because he is a man And the treasure of his kingdom is the wealth of his manhood And the woman Sammy the woman And they twain shall be one flesh Then the master knew that his teaching had not been in vain I can lead you no farther my child he said with a smile You have passed the final test She came close to him Then I want my diploma she said for he had told her about the schools Reverently the old scholar kissed her brow This is the only diploma I am authorized to give the love and homage of your teacher And my degree She waited with that wide questioning look in her eyes The most honorable in all the world a sure enough lady CHAPTER XXXI CASTLE BUILDING The corn was big enough to cultivate the first time and Young Matt with Old Kate was hard at work in the field west of the house It was nearly three weeks since the incident at the mill since which time the young fellow had not met Sammy Lane to talk with her He had seen her though at a distance nearly every day for the girl had taken up her studies again and spent most of her time out on the hills with the shepherd That day he saw her as she turned into the mill road at the lower corner of the field on her way to the Forks And he was still thinking of her three hours later as he sat on a stump in the shade of the forest s edge while his horse was resting Young Matt recalled the fight at the mill with a wild joy in his heart Under any circumstances it was no small thing to have defeated the champion strong man and terror of the hills It was a glorious thing to have done the deed for the girl he loved and under her eyes Sammy might give herself to Ollie now and go far away to the great world but she could never forget the man who had saved her from insult when her lover was far too weak to save even himself And Young Matt would stay in the hills alone but always he would have the knowledge and the triumph of this thing that he had done Yes it would be easier now but still still the days would be years when there was no longer each morning the hope that somewhere before the day was gone he would see her The sun fell hot and glaring on the hillside field and in the air was the smell of the freshly turned earth High up in the blue a hawk circled and circled again A puff of air came sighing through the forest touched lightly the green blades in the open slipped over the ridge and was lost in the sky beyond Old Kate with head down was dreaming of cool springs in shady dells and a little shiny brown lizard with a bright blue tail crept from under the bottom rail of the fence to see why the man was so still The man turned his head quickly the lizard dodged under the rail and old Kate awoke with a start Someone was coming along the road below Young Matt knew the step of that horse as well as he knew the sound of old Kate s bell or the neigh of his own sorrel The brown pony stopped at the lower corner of the field and a voice called You d better be at work I don t believe you have ploughed three rows since I passed The big fellow went eagerly down the hill to the fence I sure ought to o done better n that for it s been long enough since you went by I always notice though that it gets a heap farther to the other side of the field and back about this time o day What s new over to the Forks Sammy laughed Couldn t hear a thing but how the champion strong man was beaten at his own game Uncle Ike says Ba thundas You tell Young Matt that he d better come over A man what can ride Wash Gibbs a bug huntin is too blamed good a man t stay at home all th time We want him t tell us how he done it Ba thundas He ll be gittin a job with th gov ment next What The man crossed his arms on the top rail of the worm fence and laughed It was good to have Sammy deliver her message in just that way I reckon Uncle Ike thinks I ought to go dancin all over the hills now with a chip on my shoulder he said I don t think you ll do that she returned Dad Howitt wouldn t would he But I must hurry on now or Daddy s supper won t be ready when he comes in I stopped to give you these papers for your father She handed him the package And and I want to thank you Matt for what you did at the mill All my life you have been fighting for me and and I have never done anything for you I wish I could do something something that would show you how how I care Her voice faltered He was so big and strong and there was such a look of hopeless love and pain on his rugged face a face that was as frank and open as a child s Here was a man who had no need for the shallow cunning of little fox like men This one would go open and bold on his way and that which he could not take by his strength he would not have Had she not seen him in battle Had she not seen his eyes like polished steel points Deep down in her heart the woman felt a thrill of triumph that such a man should stand so before her She must go quickly Young Matt climbed slowly up the hill again to his seat on the stump Here he watched until across the Hollow he saw the pony and his rider come out of the timber and move swiftly along the ridge watched until they faded into a tiny spot rounded the mountain and disappeared from sight Then lifting his eyes he looked away beyond the long blue line that marked the distant horizon Some day he would watch Sammy ride away and she would go on and on and on beyond that blue line put of his life forever Ollie had gone over there to live and the shepherd had come from there What was that world like he wondered Between the young man of the mountains and that big world yonder there had always been a closely shut door He had seen the door open to Ollie and now Sammy stood on the threshold Would it ever open for him And if it did what Then came a thought that made his blood leap Might he not force it open The shepherd had told him of others who had done so Young Matt felt a strong man s contempt for the things Ollie had gotten out of the world but he stood in awe before mister Howitt He told himself now that he would look for and find the things yonder that made Dad the man he was He would carry to the task his splendid strength Nothing should stop him And Sammy when she understood that he was going away to be like the shepherd would wait awhile to give him his chance Surely she would wait when he told her that But how should he begin Looking up again his eye caught a slow shifting patch of white on the bench above Lost Creek where the little stream begins its underground course The faint bark of a dog came to him through the thin still air and the patch of white turned off into the trail that leads to the ranch Dad exclaimed the young man in triumph Dad should tell him how He had taught Sammy And so while the sunlight danced on the green field and old Kate slept in the lengthening shadows of the timber the lad gave himself to his dreams and built his castles as we all have builded His dreaming was interrupted as the supper bell rang and with the familiar sound a multitude of other thoughts came crowding in the father and mother they were growing old Would it do to leave them alone with the graves on the hill yonder and the mystery of the Hollow And there was the place to care for and the mill Who but Young Matt could get work from the old engine It was like the strong man that the fight did not last long Young Matt s fights never lasted very long By the time he had unhitched old Kate from the cultivator it was finished The lad went down the hill his bright castles in ruin even as we all have gone or must sometime go down the hill with our brightest castles in ruin CHAPTER XXXII PREPARATION That same night mister Lane told his daughter that he would leave home early the next morning to be gone two days Jim was cleaning his big forty five when he made the announcement Sammy paused with one hand on the cupboard door to ask With Wash Gibbs Daddy No I ain t goin with Wash but I ll likely meet up with him before I get back There was a hint of that metallic ring in the man s voice The girl placed her armful of dishes carefully on the cupboard shelf You re you re not going to forget your promise are you Daddy Jim The mountaineer was carefully dropping a bit of oil into the lock of his big revolver No girl I ain t forgettin nothin This here s the last ride I aim to take with Wash I m goin to see him to he paused and listened carefully to the click click click as he tested the action of his weapon to keep my promise Oh Daddy Daddy I m so glad I wanted this more than I ever wanted anything in all my life before You re such a good Daddy to me I never could bear to see you with that bad bad man She was behind his chair now and stooping laid her fresh young cheek against the swarthy furrowed face The man sat like a grim stone image his eyes fixed on the gun resting on his knees Not until she lifted her head to stand erect behind his chair with a hand on each shoulder did he find words Girl there s just one thing I ve got to know for sure before I go to morrow I reckon I m right but somehow a man can t never tell about a woman in such things Will you tell your Daddy Sammy Tell what Daddy Jim the girl asked her hands stealing up to caress her father s face What answer will you give to Young Matt when he asks you what Ollie did But why must you know that before you go to morrow Cause I want to be plumb sure I ain t makin no mistake in sidin with the boy in this here trouble You couldn t make a mistake in doing that Daddy no matter whether I no matter what but perhaps Matt will not ask me what Ollie did Just a ray of humor touched the dark face I ain t makin no mistake there I know what the man will do He laid the gun upon the table and reaching up caught the girl s hand But I want to know what you ll say when he asks you Tell me honey so I ll be plumb certain I m doin right Sammy lowered her head and whispered in his ear Are you sure this time girl dead sure Oh I m so sure that it seems as if I I couldn t wait for him to come to me I never felt this way before never The mountaineer drew his daughter into his arms and held her close as he said I ain t afraid to do it now girl The young woman was so occupied with her own thoughts and the emotions aroused by her father s question that she failed to note the ominous suggestion that lay under his words So she entered gaily into his plans for her during his two days absence Jim would leave early in the morning and Sammy was to stay with her friend Mandy Ford over on Jake Creek mister Lane had arranged with Jed Holland to do the milking so there would be no reason for the girl s return until the following evening and she must promise that she would not come home before that time Sammy promised laughingly He need not worry she and Mandy had not had a good visit alone for weeks When his daughter had said good night Jim extinguished the light and slipping the big gun inside his shirt went to sit outside the cabin door with his pipe An hour passed Sammy was fast asleep And still the man sat smoking A half hour more went by Suddenly the pipe was laid aside and Jim s hand crept inside his shirt to find the butt of the revolver His quick ear had caught the sound of a swiftly moving horse coming down the mountain The horse stopped at the gate and a low whistle came out of the darkness Leaving his seat Sammy s father crossed the yard and a moment later the horse with its rider was going on again down the trail toward the valley below and the distant river Jim waited at the gate until the sound of the horse s feet had died away in the night Then he returned to the cabin But even as he walked toward the house a dark figure arose from a clump of bushes within a few feet of the spot where Jim and the horseman had met The figure slipped noiselessly away into the forest The next morning Jim carefully groomed and saddled the brown pony for Sammy then leading his own horse ready for the road he came to the cabin door Going now Daddy said the girl coming for the good by kiss My girl my girl whispered the man as he took her in his arms Sammy was frightened at the sight of his face so strange and white Why Daddy Daddy Jim what is the matter Nothin girl nothin Only only you re so like your mother girl She she used to come just this way when I d be leavin You re sure like her and and I m glad I m glad you re like the old folks too Remember now stay at Mandy s until to morrow evenin Kiss me again honey Good by He mounted hurriedly and rode away at a brisk gallop Pulling up a moment at the edge of the timber he turned in the saddle to wave his hand to the girl in the cabin door CHAPTER XXXIII A RIDE IN THE NIGHT Sammy arrived at the Ford homestead in time for dinner and was joyfully received by her friend Mandy But early in the afternoon their pleasure was marred by a messenger from Long Creek on the other side of the river missus Ford s sister was very ill and missus Ford and Mandy must go at once But Sammy can t stay here alone protested the good woman Mandy you ll just have to stay Indeed she shall not declared their guest I can ride up Jake Creek to the Forks and stay all night at Uncle Ike s Brownie will make it easily in time for supper You just get your things on and start right away You d better hurry too put in mister Ford There s a storm comin fore long an we got t git across th river fore hit strikes I ll be here with th horses by the time you get your bonnets on He hurried away to the barn for his team while the women with Sammy s assistance made their simple preparation As mother Ford climbed into the big wagon she said to Sammy Hit s an awful lonely ol trip fer you child an you must start right away so s t be sure t get there fore hit gets plumb dark while mister Ford added as he started the team Your pony s ready saddled an if you ll hurry along you can jest bout make hit Don t get catched on Jakey in a big rain whatever you do Don t you worry about me returned the girl Brownie and I could find the way in the dark But when her friends were gone Sammy womanlike busied herself with setting the disordered house aright before she started on her journey Watching the clouds she told herself that there was plenty of time for her to reach the Postoffice before the storm It might not come that way at all in fact But the way up Jake Creek was wild and rough and along the faint trail that twisted and wound like a slim serpent through the lonely wilderness Brownie could make but slow time As they followed the little path the walls of the narrow valley grew steeper more rocky and barren and the road became more and more rough and difficult until at last the valley narrowed to a mere rocky gorge through which the creek ran tumbling and foaming on its way It was quite late when Sammy reached the point near the head of the stream where the trail leads out of the canon to the road on the ridge above It was still a good two miles to the Forks As she passed the spring a few big drops of rain came pattering down and looking up she saw swaying and tossing in the wind the trees that fringed the ledges above and she heard the roar of the oncoming storm A short way up the side of the mountain at the foot of a great overhanging cliff there is a narrow bench and less than a hundred feet from where the trail finds its way through a break in the rocky wall there is a deep cave like hollow Sammy knew the spot well It would afford excellent shelter Pushing Brownie up the steep path she had reached this bench when the rushing storm cloud shut out the last of the light and the hills shook with a deafening crash of thunder Instinctively the girl turned her pony s head from the trail and following the cliff reached the sheltered nook just as the storm burst in all its wild fury The rain came down in torrents the forest roared and against the black sky in an almost continuous glare of lightning the big trees tugged and strained in their wild wrestle with the wind while peal after peal of thunder rolling crashing reverberating through the hills added to the uproar It was over in a little while The wind passed the thunder rumbled and growled in the distance and the rain fell gently but the sky was still lighted by the red glare Though it was so dark that Sammy could see the trees and rocks only by the lightning s flash she was not frightened She knew that Brownie would find the way easily and as for the wetting she would soon be laughing at that with her friends at the Postoffice But as the girl was on the point of moving a voice said It s a mighty good thing for us this old ledge happened to be here ain t it It was a man s voice and another replied Right you are And it s a good thing too that this blow came early in the evening The speakers were between Sammy and the trail They had evidently sought shelter from the storm a few seconds after the girl had gained her position In the wild uproar she had not heard them and as they crouched under the cliff they were hidden by a projection of the rock though now and then when the lightning flashed she could see a part of one of the horses They might be neighbors and friends They might be strangers outlaws even The young woman was too wise to move until she was sure The first voice spoke again Jack got off in good time did he Got a good start replied the other He ought to be back with the posse by ten at the latest I told him we would meet them at nine where this trail comes into the big road And how far do you say it is to Jim Lane s place by the road and the Old Trail asked the first voice At the man s words a terrible fear gripped Sammy s heart POSSE that could mean only one thing officers of the law But her father s name and her home in an instant Jim s strange companionship with Wash Gibbs their long mysterious rides together her father s agitation that morning when he said good by with a thousand other things rushed through her mind What terrible thing was this that she had happened upon in the night What horrible trap had they set for her Daddy her Daddy Jim For trap it was It could be nothing else At any risk she must hear more She had already lost the other man s reply Calming herself the girl listened eagerly for the next word A match cracked The light flared out and a whiff of tobacco smoke came curling around the rock as one of the men said Are you sure there is no mistake about their meeting at Lane s to night Can t possibly be came the answer I was lying in the brush right by the gate when the messenger got there and I heard Jim give the order myself Take it all the way through unless we make a slip to night it will be one of the prettiest cases I ever saw Yes said the other but you mustn t forget that it all hinges on whether or not that bank watchman was right in thinking he recognized Wash Gibbs The man couldn t be mistaken there returned the other There is not another man in the country the size of Gibbs except the two Matthews s and of course they re out of the question Then look Jim Lane was ready to move out because of the drought when all at once after being away several days the very time of the robbery he changes his mind and stays with plenty of money to carry him through And now here we are to night with that same old Bald Knobber gang what s left of them called together in the same old way by Jim himself to meet in his cabin Take my word for it we ll bag the whole outfit with the rest of the swag before morning It s as sure as fate I m glad that girl is away from home though Sammy had heard enough As the full meaning of the officers words came to her she felt herself swaying dizzily in the saddle and clung blindly to the pony s mane for support Then something in her brain kept beating out the words Ride Ride Ride Never for an instant did Sammy doubt her father It was all some horrible mistake Her Daddy Jim would explain it all Of course he would if if she could only get home first But the men were between her and the path that led to the road Then all at once she remembered that Young Matt had told her how Sake Creek hollow headed in the pinery below the ridge along which they went from Fall Creek to the Forks It might be that this bench at the foot of the ledge would lead to a way out As quick as thought the girl slipped to the ground and taking Brownie by the head began feeling her way along the narrow shelf Dead leaves tangled grass and ferns all wet and sodden made a soft carpet so that the men behind the rock heard no sound Now and then the lightning revealed a glimpse of the way for a short distance but mostly she trusted blindly to her pony s instinct Several times she stumbled over jagged fragments of rock that had fallen from above cutting her hand and bruising her limbs cruelly Once she was saved from falling over the cliff by the little horse s refusal to move A moment she stood still in the darkness then the lightning showed a way past the dangerous point After a time that seemed hours she noticed that the ledge had become no higher than her head and that a little farther on the bench was lost in the general slope of the hill She had reached the head of the hollow A short climb up the side of the mountain and pushing through the wet bushes she found herself in the road She had saved about three miles It was still nearly five to her home An instant later the girl was in her saddle and the brown pony was running his best Sammy always looked back upon that ride in the darkness and indeed upon all that happened that night as to a dream of horror As she rode that other night came back to her the night she had ridden to save the shepherd and she lived over again that evening in the beautiful woods with Young Matt Oh if he were only with her now Unconsciously at times she called his name aloud again and again keeping time to the beat of her pony s feet At other times she urged Brownie on and the little horse feeling the spirit of his mistress answered with the best he had to give With eager outstretched head and wide nostrils he ran as though he understood the need How dark it was At every bound they seemed plunging into a black wall What if there should be a tree blown across the road At the thought she grew faint She saw herself lying senseless and her father carried away to prison Then rallying she held her seat carefully She must make it as easy as possible for Brownie dear little Brownie How she strained her eyes to see into the black night How she prayed God to keep the little horse Only once in a lifetime it seemed to her did the pony s iron shoe strike sparks of fire from the rocks or the lightning give her a quick glimpse of the road ahead They must go faster faster faster Those men should not they should not have her Daddy Jim not unless Brownie stumbled Where the road leaves the ridge for Fall Creek Valley Sammy never tightened the slack rein and the pony never shortened his stride by so much as an inch It was well that he was hill bred for none but a mountain horse could have kept his feet at such a terrific pace down the rocky slope Down the valley road past the mill and over the creek they flew then up the first rise of the ridge beyond The pony was breathing hard now and the girl encouraged him with loving words and endearing terms pleading with him to go on go on go on At last they reached the top of the ridge The way was easier now Here and there where the clouds were breaking the stars looked through but over the distant hills the lightning still played showing which way the storm had gone and against the sky now showing but dimly under ragged clouds and peeping stars now outlined clearly against the flashing light she saw the round treeless form of Old Dewey above her home CHAPTER XXXIV JIM LANE KEEPS HIS PROMISE Sammy on her tired pony approached the Lookout on the shoulder of Dewey As they drew near a figure rose quickly from its place on the rock and running swiftly along the ledge concealed itself in the clump of cedars above the trail on the southern side of the mountain A moment later the almost exhausted horse and his rider passed and the figure slipping from the ledge followed them unobserved down the mountain Nearing the house Sammy began to wonder what she should do next With all her heart the girl believed in her father s innocence She did not know why those men were at her home But she did know that the money that helped her father over the drought had come through the shepherd the Matthews family too had been helped the same way Surely Dad Howitt was incapable of any crime It was all some terrible mistake some trap from which her father must be saved But Sammy knew too that Wash Gibbs and his companions were bad men who might easily be guilty of the robbery To help them escape the officers was quite a different matter Leaving the trembling Brownie in a clump of bushes a little way from the clearing the girl went forward on foot and behind her still crept the figure that had followed from the Lookout Once the figure paused as if undecided which course to pursue Close by two saddle horses that had carried their riders on many a long ride were tied to a tree a few feet from the corner of the barn Sammy would have recognized these but in her excitement she had failed to notice them At first the girl saw no light Could it be that the officers were wrong that there was no one at the cabin after all Then a little penciled gleam set her heart throbbing wildly Blankets were fastened over the windows Sammy remembered that a few days before a bit of chinking had fallen from between the logs in the rear of the cabin She had spoken to her father about it but it was not likely that he had remembered to fix it Cautiously she passed around the house and creeping up to the building through the crevice between the logs gained a clear view of the interior Seated or lounging on chairs and on the floor about the room were eleven men one the man who had been with Wash Gibbs at the mill carried his arm in a sling The girl outside could hear distinctly every word that was spoken Wash himself was speaking Well boys we re all here Let s get through and get away Bring out the stuff Jim mister Lane went to one corner of the cabin and pulling up a loose board of the flooring drew out two heavy sacks As he placed the bags on the table the men all rose to their feet There it is just as you give it to me said Jim But before you go any farther men I ve got something to say The company stirred uneasily and all eyes turned from Jim to their big leader while Sammy noticed for the first time that the table had been moved from its usual place and that her father had taken such a position that the corner of the cabin was directly behind him with the table in front For her life the girl could not have moved Slowly Jim swept the group of scowling wondering faces on the other side of the table Then in his slow drawling speech he said Most of you here was in the old organization Tom and Ed and me knows how it started away back for we was in it at the beginnin Wash here was the last man to join fore we was busted and he was the youngest member too bein only a boy but big for his age You remember how he was taken in on account of his daddy s bein killed by the gov ment Didn t ary one of us fellers that started it ever think the Bald Knobber s would get to be what they did We began it as a kind of protection times bein wild then But first we knowed some was a usin the order to protect themselves in all kinds of devilment and things went on that way cause nobody didn t dare say anything for if they did they was tried as traitors and sentenced to the death I ain t a sayin boys that I was any better than lots of others for I reckon I done my share But when my girl s mother died away down there in Texas I promised her that I d be a good daddy to my little one and since then I done the best I know After things quieted down and I come back with my girl Wash here got the old crowd what was left of us together and wanted to reorganize again I told you then that I d go in with you and stand by the old oath so long as it was necessary to protect ourselves from them that might be tryin to get even for what had been done but that I wouldn t go no farther I don t mind tellin you now boys though I reckon you know it that I went in because I knowed what you d do for me if I didn t And I didn t dare risk leaving my girl all alone then I ve tended every meetin and done everything I agreed and there ain t a man here can say I ain t Some of the men nodded and That s so and You re right Jim came from two or three Jim went on You know that I voted against it and tried to stop you when you hung old man Lewis I thought then and I think yet that it was spite work and not protection and you know how I was against goin for the shepherd and you went when I didn t know it As for this here bank business I didn t even know of it till you give me this stuff here for me to keep for you I had to take it count of the oath It s got to be just like it was before We come together first to keep each other posted and save ourselves if there was any call to and little by little you ve been led into first one thing and then another till you re every bit and grain as bad as the old crowd was only there ain t so many of you and you ve kept me in it cause I didn t dare leave my girl Jim paused There was an ominous silence in the room With his eyes covering every scowling face in the company Jim spoke again But things has changed for me right smart since our last meetin when you give me this stuff to hold You boys all know how I ve kept Wash Gibbs away from my girl and there ain t one of you that don t know I m right knowin him as we do More n two weeks ago when I wasn t around he insulted her and would have done worse if Young Matt hadn t been there to take care of her I called you here to night because I knowed that after what happened at the mill Wash and Bill would be havin a meetin as soon as they could get around and votin you all to go against Young Matt and his people But I m goin to have my say first Wash Gibbs reached stealthily for his weapon but hesitated when he saw that the dark faced man noted his movement Jim continued in his drawling tones but his voice rang cold and clear I ain t never been mealy mouthed with no man and I m too old to begin now I know the law of the order and I reckon Gibbs there will try to have you keep it You boys have got to say whether you ll stand by him or me It looks like you was goin to go with him alright But whether you do or don t I don t aim to stay with nobody that stands by such as Wash Gibbs I m goin to side with decent folks who have stood by my girl and you can do your damnedest You take this stuff away from here And as for you Wash Gibbs if you ever set foot on my place again if you ever cross my path after to night I ll kill you like the measly yeller hound you are As he finished Jim stood with his back to the corner of the room his hand inside of the hickory shirt where the button was missing While her father was speaking Sammy forgot everything in the wild joy and pride of her heart He was her Daddy her Daddy Jim that man standing so calmly there before the wild company of men Whatever the past had been he had wiped it clean to night He belonged to her now all to her She looked toward Wash Gibbs Then she remembered the posse the officers of the law They could not know what she knew If her father was taken with the others and with the stolen gold he would be compelled to suffer with the rest Yet if she called out to save him she would save Wash Gibbs and his companions also and they would menace her father s life day and night The girl drew back from the window She must think What should she do Even as she hesitated a score of dark forms crept swiftly silently toward the cabin At the same moment a figure left the side of the house near the girl and crouching low ran to the two horses that were tied near the barn Sammy was so dazed that for a moment she did not grasp the meaning of those swiftly moving forms Then a figure riding one horse and leading another dashed away from the barn and across a corner of the clearing The silence was broken by a pistol shot in the cabin Like an echo came a shot from the yard and a voice rang out sharply HALT The figure reeled in the saddle as if to fall but recovered and disappeared in the timber The same instant there was a rush toward the house a loud call to surrender a woman s scream and then came to Sammy blessed kindly darkness CHAPTER XXXV I WILL LIFT UP MINE EYES UNTO THE HILLS When Sammy opened her eyes she was on the bed in her own room In the other room someone was moving about and the light from a lamp shone through the door At first the girl thought that she had awakened from a night s sleep and that it was her father whom she heard building the fire before calling her as his custom was But no he was not building the fire he was scrubbing the floor How strange She would call presently and ask what he meant by getting up before daylight and whether he thought to keep her from scolding him by trying to clean up what he had spilled before she should see it She had had a bad dream of some kind but she could not remember just what it was It was very strange that something seemed to keep her from calling to her father just then She would call presently She must remember first what that dream was She felt that she ought to get up and dress but she did not somehow wish to move She was strangely tired It was her dream she supposed Then she discovered that she was already fully dressed and that her clothing was wet muddy and torn And with this discovery every incident of the night came vividly before her She hid her face After awhile she tried to rise to her feet but fell back weak and dizzy Who was that in the other room Could it be her father Would he never finish scrubbing the floor in that corner When she could bear the suspense no longer she called in a voice that sounded weak and far away Daddy Oh Daddy Instantly the noise ceased a step crossed the room and the shepherd appeared in the doorway Placing the lamp on a little stand the old man drew a chair to the side of the bed and laid his hand upon her forehead smoothing back the tangled hair He spoke no word but in his touch there was a world of tenderness Sammy looked at him in wonder Where had he come from Why was he there at all And in her room She glanced uneasily about the apartment and then back to the kind face of her old teacher I don t think I understand Never mind now dear Don t try to understand just yet Aunt Mollie will be here in a few minutes Matt has gone for her When she comes and you are a little stronger we shall talk The girl caught his hand You you won t leave me Dad You won t leave me alone I m afraid Dad I never was before No no my child I shall not leave you But you must have something warm to drink I have been preparing it He stepped into the other room soon returning with a steaming cup When she had finished the strengthening draught Young Matt with his mother and father arrived While helping the girl into clean dry clothing Aunt Mollie spoke soothingly to her as one would reassure a frightened child But Sammy could hear only the three men moving about in the other room doing something and talking always in low tones She did not speak but in her brown eyes that never left the older woman s face was that wide questioning look When missus Matthews had done what she could for the comfort of the girl and the men had finished whatever they were doing in the other room Sammy said Aunt Mollie I want to know I must know Won t you tell Dad to come please Instinctively she had turned to her teacher When the shepherd came she met him with the old familiar demand Tell me everything Dad everything I want to be told all about it You will be brave and strong Sammy Instantly as ever her quick mind grasped the meaning that lay back of the words and her face grew deathly white Then she answered I will be brave and strong But first please open the window Dad He threw up the sash It was morning and the mists were over the valley but the mountain tops were bathed in light Sammy arose and walked steadily to a chair by the open window Looking out upon the beautiful scene her face caught the light that was on the higher ground and she said softly I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills That s our word now isn t it Dad I can share it with you now Then the shepherd told her Young Matt had been at the ranch with mister Howitt since early in the evening and was taking his leave for the night when they heard horses stopping at the corral and a voice calling Upon their answering the voice said There is trouble at Jim Lane s Take these horses and go quick And then as they had run from the house the messenger had retreated into the shadow of the bluff saying Never mind me If you love Sammy hurry At this they mounted and had ridden as fast as possible The old man did not tell the girl that he had found his saddle wet and slippery and that when he reached the light his hands were red They had found the officers ready to leave with their prisoners All but two of the men were captured with their booty Wash Gibbs alone escaping badly hurt they thought after killing one of the posse When they had asked for Sammy one of the officers told them that she was at Ford s over on Jake Creek but another declared that he had heard a woman scream as they were making the attack Young Matt had found her unconscious on the ground behind the cabin When the shepherd finished his brief account the girl said Tell me all Dad I want to know all Did did they take Daddy away The old man s eyes were dim as he answered gently No dear girl THEY did not take him away Then Sammy knew why Dad had scrubbed the cabin floor and what the three men who talked so low had been doing in the other room She made no outcry only a moan as she looked away across the silent hills and the valley where the mists were slowly lifting lifting slowly like the pale ghost of the starlight that was Oh Daddy Daddy Jim You SURE kept your promise You sure did I m glad glad they didn t get you Daddy They never WOULD have believed what I know never never But there were no tears and the shepherd seeing after a little touched her hand Everything is ready dear would you like to go now Not just yet Dad I must tell you first how I came to be at home and why I am glad oh so glad that I was here But call the others please I want them all to know When the three who with her teacher loved her best had come Sammy told her story repeating almost word for word what she had heard her father say to the men When she had finished she turned her face again to the open window The mists were gone The landscape lay bright in the sun But Sammy could not see It is much better so much better as it is my child said the old scholar You see dear they would have taken him away Nothing could have saved him It would have been a living death behind prison walls away from you Yes I know Dad I understand It is better as it is Now we will go to him please They led her into the other room The floor in the corner of the cabin where the shepherd had washed it was still damp Through it all Sammy kept her old friend constantly by her side It is easier Dad when you are near Nor would she leave the house until it was all over save to walk a little way with her teacher Young Matt and his father made the coffin of rough boards sawed at the mill and from the country round about the woods people came to the funeral or as they called it in their simple way the burying The grave was made in a little glen not far from the house When some of the neighbors would have brought a minister from the settlement Sammy said No Dad would say all that was necessary So the shepherd standing under the big trees talked a little in his simple kindly way and spoke the words Earth to earth dust to dust ashes to ashes As good declared some as any preacher on earth could o done hit though one or two held it warn t jest right to put a body in th ground thout a regular parson t preach th sermon When the last word was spoken and the neighbors had gone away over the mountains and through the woods to their homes Aunt Mollie with her motherly arm about the girl said Come honey you re our girl now As long as you stay in the hills you shall stay with us And Old Matt added You re the only daughter we ve got Sammy and we want you a heap worse than you know When Sammy told them that she was not going to the city to live they cried in answer Then you shall be our girl always and they took her home with them to the big log house on the ridge For a week after that night at the Lane cabin Pete was not seen When at last he did appear it was to the shepherd on the hill and his voice and manner alarmed Dad But the boy s only reply to mister Howitt s question was Pete knows Pete knows Then in his own way he told something that sent the shepherd to Young Matt and the two followed the lad to a spot where the buzzards were flying low through the trees By the shreds of clothing and the weapons lying near they knew that the horrid thing from which as they approached carrion birds flapped their wings in heavy flight was all that remained of the giant Wash Gibbs Many facts were brought out at the trial of the outlaws and it was made clear that Jim Lane had met his death at the hands of Wash Gibbs just at the beginning of the attack and that Gibbs himself had been wounded a moment later by one of the attacking posse Thus does justice live even in the hills CHAPTER XXXVI ANOTHER STRANGER mister Matthews and his son first heard of the stranger through Lou Gordon the mail carrier who stopped at the mill on his way to Flag with the week s mail The native rode close to the shed and waited until the saw had shrieked its way through the log of oak and the carriage had rattled back to first position Then with the dignity belonging to one of his station as a government officer he relieved his overcharged mouth of an astonishing quantity of tobacco and drawled Howdy men Howdy Lou returned Young Matt from the engine and Old Matt from the saw Reckon them boards is fer a floor in Joe Gardner s new cabin Yes returned Old Matt we ought to got em out last week but seems like we couldn t get at it with the buryin an all Pears like you all r gettin mighty proud in this neighborhood PUNCHEON floors USED t be good enough fer anybody t dance on Be a buildin board houses next I reckon mister Matthews laughed Bring your logs over to Fall Creek when you get ready to build Lou we ll sure do you right The representative of the government

t keep th dad burned gov ment straight Late that afternoon Lou s prophecy was fulfilled A wagon going down the Creek with a load of supplies for the distillery stopped at the mill shed and the stranger began climbing carefully down over the wheels Budd Wilson on his high seat winked and nodded at mister Matthews and his son as though it was the greatest joke of the season Hold those horses driver Hold them tight tight sir Got em Mister responded Budd promptly The mules stood with drooping heads and sleepy eyes the lines under their feet The gentleman was feeling carefully about the hub of the wheel with a foot that stretch as he might could not touch it by a good six inches That s right man right he puffed Hold them tight tight Start now break a leg sure sure Then what would Sarah and the girls do Oh blast it all where is that step Can t stay here all day Bring a ladder Bring a high chair a table a box a big box a heh heh Look out I say look out Blast it all what do you mean This last was called forth by Young Matt lifting the little man bodily to the ground as an ordinary man would lift a child To look up at the young giant the stranger tipped back his head until his shining silk hat was in danger of falling in the dirt Bless my soul what a specimen What a specimen Then with a twinkle in his eye Which one of the boys are you anyway At this the three mountaineers roared with laughter With his dumpy figure in the long coat and his round face under the tall hat the little man was irresistible He fairly shone with good humor his cheeks were polished like big red apples his white hair had the luster of silver his blue eyes twinkled his silk hat glistened his gold watch guard sparkled his patent leathers glistened and the cane with the big gold head gleamed in the sunlight That s him Doc called the driver That s the feller what wallered Wash Gibbs like I was a tellin ye Strongest man in the hills he is Dad burn me if I believe he knows how strong he is Doc Doc Dad burned Doc muttered the stranger What would Sarah and the girls say He waddled to the wagon and reached up one fat hand with a half dollar to Budd Here driver here Get cigars with that cigars mind you or candy I stay here Mind you don t get anything to drink nothing to drink I say Budd gathered up the reins and woke the sleepy mules with a vigorous jerk Nary a drink Doc nary a drink Thank you kindly all the same Got t mosey long t th still now ought t o been there hour ago f I can do anything fer you jest le me know I live over on Sow Coon Gap when I m t home Come over an visit with me Young Matt there ll guide you As he watched the wagon down the valley the stranger mused Doc Doc huh Quite sure that fellow will buy a drink quite sure When the wagon had disappeared he turned to mister Matthews and his son According to that fellow I am not far from a sheep ranch kept by a mister Howitt That s it mister Daniel Howitt fine looking man fine brown eyes great voice gentleman sir gentleman if he is keeping sheep in this wilderness Blast it all just like him just like him always keeping somebody s sheep born to be a shepherd born to be Know him At mention of mister Howitt s name Young Matt had looked at his father quickly When the stranger paused he answered Yes sir We know Dad Howitt Is he a friend of yourn Dad Dad Howitt Doc and Dad Well what would Sarah and the girls say Friend of mine Young man Daniel and David I am David Daniel and David lay on the same blanket when they were babies played in the same alley school together same classes colleged together next door neighbors Know him Blast it all where IS this sheep place Again the two woodsmen exchanged glances The elder Matthews spoke It ain t so far from here sir The ranch belongs to me and my son But mister Howitt will be out on the hills somewhere with the sheep now You d better go home with us and have supper and the boy will take you down this evenin Well now that s kind sir very kind indeed Man at the Postoffice is a savage sir blasted old incorrigible savage My name is Coughlan doctor David Coughlan of Chicago practicing physician for forty years don t do anything now not much that is Sarah and the girls won t let me Your name sir Grant Matthews My boy there has the same We re mighty glad to meet any friend of Dad s I can tell you He s sure been a God s blessin to this neighborhood Soon they started homeward Young Matt going ahead to do the chores and to tell his mother of their coming guest while mister Matthews followed more slowly with the doctor Shortening his stride to conform to the slow pace of the smaller man the mountaineer told his guest about the shepherd how he had come to them of his life and how he had won the hearts of the people When he told how mister Howitt had educated Sammy buying her books himself from his meager wages the doctor interrupted in his quick way Just like him just like him Always giving away everything he earned Made others give too Blast it all he s cost me thousands of dollars thousands of dollars treating patients of his that never paid a cent not a cent sir Proud though proud as Lucifer Fine old family finest in the country sir Right to be proud right to be Old Matt scowled as he returned coldly He sure don t seem that way to us Mister He s as common as an old shoe And then the mountaineer told how his son loved the shepherd and tried to explain what the old scholar s friendship had meant to them The stranger ejaculated Same old thing same old trick Did me that way does everybody that way Same old Daniel Proud though can t help it can t help it The big man answered with still more warmth You ought to hear how he talks to us folks when we have meetin s at the Cove school house He s as good as any preacher you ever heard except that he don t put on as much maybe Why sir when we buried Jim Lane week before last everybody lowed he done as well as a regular parson At this doctor Coughlan stopped short and leaned against a convenient tree for support looking up at his big host with merriment he could not hide Parson parson Daniel Howitt talk as good as a parson Blast it all Dan is one of the biggest D D s in the United States as good as a parson I should think so Why man he s my pastor my pastor Biggest church greatest crowds in the city Well what would Sarah and the girls say He stood there gasping and shaking with laughter until Old Matt finding the ridiculous side of the situation joined in with a guffaw that fairly drowned the sound of the little man s merriment When they finally moved on again the Doctor said And you never knew The papers were always full always His real name is Stop Old Matt spoke so suddenly and in such a tone that the other jumped in alarm I ain t a meanin no harm Doc but you oughtn t to tell his name and anyway I don t want to know Preacher or no preacher he s a man he is and that s what counts in this here country If Dad had wanted us to know about himself I reckon he d a told us and I don t want to hear it until he s ready The Doctor stopped short again Right sir right Daniel has his reasons of course I forgot That savage at the Postoffice tried to interrogate me tried to draw me I was close on guard you see Fellow in the wagon tried still on guard You caught me Blast it all I like you Fine specimen that boy of yours fine When they reached the top of the ridge the stranger looked over the hills with exclamations of delight Grand sir grand Wish Sarah and the girls could see Don t wonder Daniel staid That Hollow down there you say way down there Mutton Mutton Hollow Daniel lives there Blast it all come on man come on As they drew near the house Pete came slowly up the Old Trail and met them at the gate CHAPTER XXXVII OLD FRIENDS After supper Young Matt guided the stranger down the trail to the sheep ranch in Mutton Hollow When they reached the edge of the clearing the mountaineer stopped Yonder s the cabin sir an Dad is there as you can see by the smoke I don t reckon you ll need me any more now an I ll go back We ll be mighty glad to see you on the ridge any time sir Any friend of Dad s is mighty welcome in this neighborhood Thank you thank you very thoughtful very thoughtful indeed fine spirit fine I shall see you again when Daniel and I have had it out Blast it all what is he doing here Good night young man good night He started forward impetuously Matt turned back toward home The dog barked as doctor Coughlan approached the cabin and the shepherd came to the open door He had been washing the supper dishes His coat was off his shirt open at the throat and his sleeves rolled above his elbows Here Brave The deep voice rolled across the little clearing and the dog ran to stand by his master s side Then as mister Howitt took in the unmistakable figure of the little physician he put out a hand to steady himself Oh it s me Daniel it s me Caught you didn t I Blast it all might have known I would Bound to bound to Daniel been at it ever since I lost you Visiting in Kansas City last week with my old friends the Stewarts young fellow there Ollie put me right First part of your name description voice and all that knew it was you knew it Didn t tell them though blasted reporters go wild Didn t tell a soul not a soul Sarah and the girls think I am in Kansas City or Denver Didn t tell old man Matthews either came near though very near Blast it all what does it mean what does it all mean In his excitement the little man spoke rapidly as he hurried toward the shepherd When he reached the cabin the two friends so different yet so alike clasped hands As soon as the old scholar could speak he said David David To think that this is really you You of all men you whom I most needed Huh grunted the other Look like you never needed me less Look fit for anything anything ten years younger every bit of ten years Blast it all what have you done to yourself What have you done He looked curiously at the tanned face and rude dress of his friend Bless my soul what a change What a change Told Matthews you were an aristocrat He wouldn t believe it Don t wonder Doubt it myself now The other smiled at the Doctor s amazement I suppose I have changed some David The hills have done it Look at them He pointed to the encircling mountains See how calm and strong they are how they lift their heads above the gloom They are my friends and companions David And they have given me of their calmness and strength a little But come in come in you must be very tired How did you come The doctor followed him into the cabin Railroad hack wagon walked Postoffice last night Man there is a savage blasted incorrigible savage Mill this afternoon Home with your friends on the ridge Old man is a gentleman a gentleman sir if God ever made one His boy s like him The mother she s a real mother made to be a mother couldn t help it And that young woman with the boy s name bless my soul I never saw such a creature before Daniel never If I had I I Blast it all I wouldn t be bossed by Sarah and the girls I wouldn t See in that young man and woman what God meant men and women to be Told them they ought to marry that they owed it to the race You know my ideas Daniel Think they will The shepherd laughed a laugh that was good to hear What s the matter now Daniel What is the matter Have I said anything wrong again Blast it all you know how I always do the wrong thing Have I No indeed David you are exactly right returned mister Howitt But tell me did you see no one else at the house There is another member of the family The doctor nodded I saw him Pete you mean Looked him over mister Matthews asked me to Sad case very sad Hopeless absolutely hopeless Daniel Pete has not seemed as well as usual lately I fear so much night roaming is not good for the boy returned the other slowly But tell me how are Sarah and the girls Still looking after doctor Davie I suppose Just the same haven t changed a bit not a bit Jennie looks after my socks and handkerchiefs Mary looks after my shirts and linen Anna looks after my ties and shoes Sue looks after my hats and coats and Kate looks after the things I eat and Sarah Sarah looks after everything and everybody same as always Blast it all If they d give me a show I d be as good as ever good as ever Daniel What can a man do what can a man do with an only sister and her five old maid daughters looking after him from morning until night from morning until night Daniel Tell them I am a full grown man don t do no good no good at all Blast it all poor old things just got to mother something got to Daniel While he was speaking his eyes were dancing from one object to another in the shepherd s rude dwelling turning for frequent quick glances to Dad himself You live here you You ought not Daniel you ought not What would Sarah and the girls say Blast it all what do you mean by it I ordered you away on a vacation You disappear Think you dead row in the papers mystery I hate mystery Blast it all what does it mean what does it all mean Not fair to me Daniel not fair By this time the little man had worked himself up to an astonishing pitch of excitement his eyes snapped his words came like pistol shots his ejaculations were genuine explosions He tapped with his feet rapped with his cane shook his finger and fidgeted in his chair We want you back Daniel I want you Church will want you when they know looking for a preacher right now I come after you Daniel Blast it all I ll tell Sarah and the girls and they ll come after you too Chicago will go wild when they know that Daniel Howitt Cha Stop The doctor bounced out of his chair The shepherd was trembling and his voice shook with emotion Forgive me David But that name must never be spoken again never My son is dead and that name died with him It must be forgotten The physician noted his friend s agitation in amazement There there Daniel I didn t mean to Thought it didn t matter when we were alone I I Blast it all Tell me Daniel what do you mean by this strange business this very strange business A look of mingled affection regret and pain came into the shepherd s face as he replied Let me tell you the story David and you will understand When he had finished mister Howitt asked gently Have I not done right David The boy is gone It was hard going as he did But I am glad now for Old Matt would have killed him as he would kill me yet if he knew Thank God we have not also made the father a murderer Did I not say rightly that the old name died with Howard Have I not done well to stay on this spot and to give my life to this people Quite right Daniel quite right You always are It s me that goes wrong blundering bumping smashing into things Blast it all I I don t know what to say B B Blast it all The hour was late when the two men finally retired for the night Long after his heavy regular breathing announced that the doctor was sleeping soundly the shepherd lay wide awake keenly sensitive to every sound that stirred in the forest Once he arose from his bed and stepping softly left the cabin to stand under the stars his face lifted to the dark summit of Old Dewey and the hills that rimmed the Hollow And once when the first light of day came over the ridges he went to the bunk where his friend lay to look thoughtfully down upon the sleeping man Breakfast was nearly ready when doctor Coughlan awoke The physician saw at once by the worn and haggard look on his friend s face that his had been a sleepless night It was as though all the pain and trouble of the old days had returned The little doctor muttered angrily to himself while the shepherd was gone to the spring for water Blast it all I m a fool a meddlesome old fool Ought to have let well enough alone No need to drag him back into it all again no need Do no good no good at all When the morning meal was finished mister Howitt said David will you think me rude if I leave you alone to day The city pavement fits one but poorly to walk these hills of mine and you are too tired after your trip and the loss of your regular sleep to go with me this morning Stay at the ranch and rest If you care to read here are a few of your favorites Will you mind very much I should like to be alone to day David Right Daniel right I understand Don t say another word not a word Go ahead I m stiff and sore anyway just suit me The shepherd arranged everything for his friend s comfort putting things in readiness for his noonday meal and showing him the spring Then taking his own lunch as his custom was he went to the corral and released the sheep The doctor watched until the last of the flock was gone and he could no longer hear the tinkle of the bells and the bark of the dog CHAPTER XXXVIII I AIN T NOBODY NO MORE With the coming of the evening the shepherd returned to his guest doctor Coughlan heard first the bells on the leaders of the flock and the barking of the dog coming nearer and nearer through the woods Soon the sheep appeared trooping out of the twilight shadows into the clearing then came Brave followed by his master The countenance of the old scholar wore again that look of calm strength and peace that had marked it before the coming of his friend Have you had a good rest David Or has your day been long and tiresome I fear it was not kind of me to leave you alone in this wilderness The doctor told how he had passed the time reading sleeping and roaming about the clearing and the nearby woods And you he said looking the other over with a professional eye you look like a new man a new man Daniel How do you do it Some secret spring of youth in the wilderness Blast it all wish you would show me Fool Sarah and the girls fool them sure David have you forgotten the prescription you gave me when you ordered me from the city You took it you remember from one of our favorite volumes The shepherd bared his head and repeated If thou art worn and hard beset With sorrows that thou wouldst forget If thou wouldst read a lesson that will keep Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep Go to the woods and hills No tears Dim the sweet look that Nature wears David I never understood until the past months why the Master so often withdrew alone into the wilderness There is not only food and medicine for one s body there is also healing for the heart and strength for the soul in nature One gets very close to God David in these temples of God s own building doctor Coughlan studied his old friend curiously Change remarkable change in you Remarkable Never said a thing like that in all your life before never The shepherd smiled It s your prescription Doctor he said They retired early that evening for the physician declared that his friend must need the rest Talk to morrow he said all day nothing else to do He promptly enforced his decision by retiring to his own bunk leaving the shepherd to follow his example But not until the doctor was sure that his friend was sleeping soundly did he permit himself to sink into unconsciousness It was just past midnight when the shepherd was aroused by the doctor striking a match to light the lamp As he awoke he heard Pete s voice Where is Dad Pete wants Dad doctor Coughlan thinking it some strange freak of the boy s disordered brain and not wishing to break his friend s much needed rest was trying in low tones to persuade the boy to wait until morning What does Pete want asked the shepherd entering the room Pete wants Dad Dad and the other man They must sure go with Pete right quick Go where with Pete Who told Pete to come for Dad asked mister Howitt HE told Pete Right now he said And Pete he come Course I come with him Dad must go an the other man too cause he said so In sickness or in trouble of any kind the people for miles around had long since come to depend upon the shepherd of Mutton Hollow The old man turned now to the doctor Someone needs me David We must go with the boy But Daniel Daniel Blast it all The boy s not responsible Where will he take us Where do you want us to go boy Not me not me nobody can t go nowhere can they You go with Pete Mister Yes yes go with Pete but where will Pete take us persisted the Doctor Pete knows Now look at that Daniel Look at that Blast it all we ought not go not in the night this way What would Sarah and the girls say Notwithstanding his protests the doctor was ready even before the shepherd Take a gun Daniel take a gun at least he said The other hesitated then asked Does Pete want Dad to take a gun The youth who stood in the doorway waiting impatiently shook his head and laughed No no nothing can t get Dad where Pete goes God he s there just like Dad says It s all right David said the shepherd with conviction Pete knows It is safe to trust him to night And the boy echoed as he started forward It s alright Mister Pete knows I wish you had your medicine case though David added mister Howitt as they followed the boy out into the night Got one Daniel got one Always have a pocket case habit Pete led the way down the road and straight to the old cabin ruin below the corral Though the stars were hidden behind clouds it was a little light in the clearing but in the timber under the shadow of the bluff it was very dark The two men were soon bewildered and stood still Which way Pete said the shepherd There was no answer Where s Pete Tell Pete to come here said mister Howitt again Still there was on reply Their guide seemed to have been swallowed up in the blackness They listened for a sound This is strange mused the shepherd A grunt of disgust came from the doctor Crazy man crazy There s three of us Which way is the house Blast it all what would A spot of light gleamed under the bushes not fifty feet away Come Dad Come on Pete s ready They were standing close to the old cabin under the bluff In a narrow space between the log wall of the house and the cliff Pete stood with a lighted lantern The farther end of the passage was completely hidden by a projection of the rock the overhanging roof touched the ledge above while the opening near the men was concealed by the heavy growth of ferns and vines and the thick branches of a low cedar Even in daylight the place would have escaped anything but a most careful search Dropping to his knees and to one hand the shepherd pushed aside the screen of vines and branches with the other and then on all fours crawled into the narrow passage The Doctor followed They found their guide crouching in a small opening in the wall of rock mister Howitt uttered an exclamation The lost cave Old man Dewey The boy laughed Pete knows Come Dad Come other man Ain t nothin can get you here He scrambled ahead of them into the low tunnel Some twenty feet from the entrance the passage turned sharply to the left and opened suddenly into a hallway along which the shepherd could easily walk erect Pete went briskly forward as one on very familiar ground his lantern lighting up the way clearly for his two companions For some distance their course dipped downward at a gentle angle while the ceilings and sides dripped with moisture Soon they heard the sound of running water and entering a wider room saw sparkling in the lantern s light a stream that came from under the rocky wall crossed their path and disappeared under the other wall of the chamber Lost Creek ejaculated the shepherd as he picked his way over the stream on the big stones And the boy answered Pete knows Pete knows From the bank of the creek the path climbed strongly upward the footing grew firmer and the walls and ceiling drier as they went on the passage too grew wider and higher until they found themselves in a large underground hallway that echoed loudly as they walked Overhead pure white stalactites and frost like formations glittered in the light and the walls were broken by dark nooks and shelf like ledges with here and there openings leading who could tell where At the farther end of this hallway where the ceiling was highest the guide paused at the foot of a ledge against which rested a rude ladder The shepherd spoke again Dewey Bald he asked Pete nodded and began to climb the ladder Another room and another ledge then a long narrow passage the ceiling of which was so high that it was beyond the lantern light then a series of ledges and they saw that they were climbing from shelf to shelf on one side of an underground canon Following along the edge of the chasm the doctor pushed a stone over the brink and they heard it go bounding from ledge to ledge into the dark heart of the mountain No bottom Daniel Blast it all no bottom to it What would Sarah and the girls say They climbed one more ladder and then turned from the canon into another great chamber the largest they had entered The floor was perfectly dry the air too was dry and pure and from what seemed to be the opposite side of the huge cavern a light gleamed like a red eye in the darkness They were evidently nearing the end of their journey Drawing closer they found that the light came from the window of a small cabin built partly of rock and partly of logs Instinctively the two men stopped Pete said in a low tone as one would speak in a sacred presence HE is there Come on Dad Come other man Don t be scared Still the boy s companions hesitated mister Howitt asked Who boy who is there Do you know who it is No no not me Nobody can t know nothin can they Hopeless case Daniel hopeless Too bad too bad muttered the physician laying his hand upon his friend s shoulder The shepherd tried again Who does Pete say it is Oh Pete says it s him just him But who does Pete say he is suggested doctor Coughlan Again the boy s voice lowered to a whisper Sometimes Pete says it must be God cause he s so good Dad says God is good an that he takes care of folks an HE sure does that Twas him that scared Wash Gibbs an his crowd that night An he sent the gold to you Dad God s gold it was he s got heaps of it He killed that panther too when it was a goin to fight Young Matt Pete knows You see Dad when Pete is with him I ain t nobody no more I m just Pete then an Pete is me Funny ain t it But he says that s the way it is an he sure knows The two friends listened with breathless interest And what does Pete call him asked the doctor Pete calls him father like Dad calls God He talks to God too like Dad does Do you reckon God would talk to God mister With a cry the shepherd reeled The doctor caught him Strong Daniel strong Pete drew away from the two men in alarm The old scholar s agitation was pitiful David David tell me what is this thing Can it be my boy Howard my son can it be My God David what am I saying He is dead Dead I tell you Can the dead come back from the grave David He broke from his friend and ran staggering toward the cabin but at the door he stopped again It was as if he longed yet feared to enter and the doctor and the boy came to his side Without ceremony Pete pushed open the door The room was furnished with a cupboard table and small cook stove It was evidently a living room Through a curtained opening at the right a light showed from another apartment and a voice called Is that you Pete A look of pride came into the face of the lad That s me he whispered I m Pete here an Pete is me It s always that way with him Aloud he said Yes Father it s Pete Pete an Dad an the other man As he spoke he drew aside the curtain For an instant the two men paused on the threshold The room was small and nearly bare of furniture In the full glare of the lamp so shaded as to throw the rest of the room in deep shadow hung a painting that seemed to fill the rude chamber with its beauty It was the picture of a young woman standing by a spring of water a cup brimming full in her outstretched hand On a bed in the shadow facing the picture lay a man A voice faltered Father doctor Coughlan CHAPTER XXXIX A MATTER OF HOURS Father Father can you can you forgive me The man on his knees raised his head Forgive you my son Forgive you My dear boy there has never been in my heart a thought but of love and sympathy Pain there has been I can t deny but it has helped me to know what you have suffered I understand it now my boy I understand it all for I too have felt it But when I first knew even beneath all the hurt I was glad glad to know I mean It is a father s right to suffer with his child my son It hurt most when the secret stood between us and I could not enter into your life but I understand that too I understand why you could not tell me I too came away because I was not strong enough I I thought it would be easier for you never to know said the son as he lay on the bed I am sorry now And I am glad that you know But I must tell you all about it just the same I must tell you myself you see so that it will be all clear and straight when I when I go He turned his eyes to the picture on the wall When you go Howard laid a hand upon the gray head Poor father yes I am going It was an accident but it was a kindness It will be much better that way only only I am sorry for you father I thought I could save you all this I intended to slip quietly away without your ever knowing but when Pete said that doctor Coughlan was here I could not go without without The little doctor came forward I am a fool Howard an old fool Blast it all no business to go poking into this no business at all Daniel would have sent if he had wanted me Ought to have known Old native can give me lessons on being a gentleman every time Blast it all What s wrong Howard Get hurt Now I am here might as well be useful Indeed Doctor you did right to come You will be such a help to father You will help us both just as you have always done Will you excuse us father while doctor Coughlan looks at this thing here in my side The physician arranged the light so that it shone full upon the man on the bed then carefully removed the bandages from an ugly wound in the artist s side doctor Coughlan looked very grave When did this happen Howard I I can t tell exactly You see I thought at first I could get along with Pete to help and I did for a week I guess Then things didn t go so well Some fever I think for she she came He turned his eyes toward the picture again And I I lost all track of time It was the night of the eighteenth Father will know Two weeks muttered the physician A low exclamation came from the shepherd It was you you who brought the horses to the ranch that night The artist smiled grimly The officers saw me and thought that I was one of the men they wanted It s alright though The old scholar instinctively lifted his hands and looked at them He remembered the saddle wet with blood Making a careful examination the doctor asked more questions When he had finished and had skilfully replaced the bandages the wounded man asked What about it doctor Coughlan The kind hearted physician jerked out a volley of scientific words and phrases that meant nothing and busied himself with his medicine case When his patient had taken the medicine the doctor watched him for a few minutes and then asked Feel stronger Howard The artist nodded Tell me the truth now Doctor I know that I am going But how long have I Wait a minute first Where s Pete Come here my boy The lad drew near Father mister Howitt seated himself on the bedside You ll be strong father We are ready now doctor Coughlan Yes tell us David said the shepherd and his voice was steady The physician spoke Matter of hours I would say Twenty four perhaps not more not more There is no possible chance David asked the shepherd Again the little doctor took refuge behind a broadside of scientific terms before replying No no possible chance A groan slipped from the gray bearded lips of the father The artist turned to the picture and smiled Pete looked wonderingly from face to face Poor father said the artist One thing more Doctor can you keep up my strength for awhile Reasonably well reasonably well Howard I am so glad of that because there is much to do before I go There is so much that must be done first and I want you both to help me CHAPTER XL THE SHEPHERD S MISSION During the latter part of that night and most of the day it rained a fine slow quiet rain with no wind to shake the wet from burdened leaf or blade But when the old shepherd left the cave by a narrow opening on the side of the mountain near Sammy s Lookout the sky was clear The mists rolled heavily over the valley but the last of the sunlight was warm on the knobs and ridges The old man paused behind the rock and bushes that concealed the mouth of the underground passage Not a hundred feet below was the Old Trail he followed the little path with his eye until it vanished around the shoulder of Dewey Along that way he had come into the hills Then lifting his eyes to the far away lines of darker blue his mind looked over the ridge to the world that is on the other side the world from which he had fled It all seemed very small and mean now it was so far so far away He started as the sharp ring of a horse s iron shoe on the flint rocks came from beyond the Lookout and safely hidden he saw a neighbor round the hill and pass on his way to the store on Roark He watched as horse and rider followed the Old Trail around the rim of the Hollow watched until they passed from sight in the belt of timber Then his eyes were fixed on a fine thread of smoke that curled above the trees on the Matthews place and leaving the shelter of rock and bush he walked along the Old Trail toward the big log house on the distant ridge Below him on his left Mutton Hollow lay submerged in the drifting mists with only a faint line of light breaking now and then where Lost Creek made its way and on the other side Compton Ridge lifted like a wooded shore from the sea A black spot in the red west shaped itself into a crow making his way on easy wing toward a dead tree on the top of Boulder Bald The old shepherd walked wearily the now familiar objects wore a strange look It was as though he saw them for the first time yet had seen them somewhere before perhaps in another world As he went his face was the face of one crushed by shame and grief made desperate by his suffering Supper was just over and Young Matt was on the porch when mister Howitt entered the gate The young fellow greeted his old friend and called back into the house Here s Dad Father As mister Matthews came out Aunt Mollie and Sammy appeared in the doorway How like it all was to that other evening The mountaineer and the shepherd sat on the front porch while Young Matt brought the big sorrel and the brown pony to the gate and with Sammy rode away They were going to the Postoffice at the Forks Ain t had no news for a week said Aunt Mollie as she brought her chair to join the two men And besides Sammy needs the ride There s goin to be a moon so it ll be light by the time they start home The sound of the horses feet and the voices of the young people died away in the gray woods The dusk thickened in the valley below and as the light in the west went out the three friends saw the clump of pines etched black and sharp against the blood red background of the sky Old Matt spoke Reckon everything s alright at the ranch Dad How s the little doctor You ought to brung him up with you He watched the shepherd s face curiously from under his heavy brows as he pulled at his cob pipe Tired out trampin over these hills I reckon ventured Aunt Mollie mister Howitt tried to answer with some commonplace but his friends could not but note his confusion missus Matthews continued I guess you ll be a leavin us pretty soon now Well I ain t a blamin you and you ve sure been a God s blessin to us here in the woods I don t reckon we re much long side the fine friends you ve got back where you come from in the city and we we can t do nothin for you but but The good soul could say no more We ve often wondered sir added Old Matt how you ve stood it here an educated man like you I reckon though there s somethin deep under it all keepin you up somethin that ignorant folks without no education like us can t understand The old scholar could have cried aloud but he was forced to sit dumb while the other continued You re goin won t make no difference though with what you ve done This neighborhood won t never go back to what it was before you come It can t with all you ve taught us and with Sammy stayin here to keep it up It ll be mighty hard though to have you go it sure will mister Howitt Looking up the shepherd said quietly I expect to live here until the end if you will let me But I fear you will not want me to stay when you know what I ve come to tell you this evening The mountaineer straightened his huge form as he returned Dad there ain t nothin on earth or in hell could change what we think of you and we don t want to hear nothin about you that you don t like to tell us We ain t a carin what sent you to the hills We re takin you for what you are And there ain t nothin can change that Not even if it should be the grave under the pine yonder asked the other in a low voice Old Matt looked at him in a half frightened way as though without knowing why he feared what the shepherd would say next mister Howitt felt the look and hesitated He was like one on a desperate mission in the heart of an enemy s country feeling his way Was the strong man s passion really tame Or was his fury only sleeping waiting to destroy the one who should wake it Who could tell The old scholar looked away to Dewey Bald for strength mister Matthews he said you once told me a story It was here on this porch when I first came to you It was a sad tale of a great crime To night I know the other side of that story I ve come to tell you At the strange words Aunt Mollie s face turned as white as her apron Old Matt grasped the arms of his chair as though he would crush the wood as he said shortly Go on At the tone of his voice the old shepherd s heart sank CHAPTER XLI THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY With a prayer in his heart for the boy who lay dying in that strange underground chamber the artist s father began It is the story mister Matthews of a man and his only son the last of their family With them will perish has perished one of the oldest and proudest names in our country From his childhood this man was taught the honored traditions of his people and thus trained in pride of ancestry grew up to believe that the supreme things of life are what his kind call education refinement and culture In his shallow egotism he came to measure all life by the standards of his people It was in keeping with this that the man should enter the pulpit of the church of his ancestors and it was due very largely no doubt to the same ancestral influence that he became what the world calls a successful minister of the gospel But Christianity to him was but little more than culture and his place in the church merely an opportunity to add to the honor of his name Soon after leaving the seminary he married The crowning moment of his life was when his first born a boy was laid in his arms The second child was a girl there were no more For ten years before her death the wife was an invalid The little girl too was never strong and six months after they buried the mother the daughter was laid beside her You sir can understand how the father lavished every care upon his son The first offspring of the parents love the sole survivor of his home and the last to bear the name of a family centuries old he was the only hope of the proud man s ambition The boy was a beautiful child a delicate sensitive soul in a body of uncommon physical grace and strength and the proud father loved to think of him as the flower of long ages of culture and refinement The minister himself jealously educated his son and the two grew to be friends sir constant companions This also YOU will understand you and your boy But with all this the young man did not follow his father in choosing his profession He he became an artist Old Matt started from his seat Aunt Mollie uttered an exclamation But the shepherd without pausing continued When his schooling was completed the boy came into the Ozarks one summer to spend the season painting The man had expected to go with his son For months they had planned the trip together but at last something prevented and the father could not go no he could not go The speaker s voice broke the big mountaineer was breathing hard Aunt Mollie was crying Presently mister Howitt went on When the young artist returned to his father among many sketches of the mountains he brought one painting that received instant recognition The people stood before it in crowds when it was exhibited in the art gallery the papers were extravagant in their praise the artist became famous and wealthy patrons came to his studio to sit for their portraits The picture was of a beautiful girl standing by a spring holding out a dripping cup of water At this a wild oath burst from the giant Springing to his feet he started toward the speaker Aunt Mollie screamed Grant oh Grant Think what Dad has done for us The mountaineer paused mister Matthews said the shepherd in trembling tones for my sake will you not hear me to the end for my sake The big man dropped back heavily into his chair Go on he said But his voice was as the growl of a beast The boy loved your girl mister Matthews It was as though he had left his soul in the hills Night and day he heard her calling The more his work was praised the more his friends talked of honors and planned his future the keener was his suffering and most of all there was the shadow that had come between him and his father breaking the old comradeship and causing them to shun each other though the father never knew why The poor boy grew morose and despondent giving way at times to spells of the deepest depression He tried to lose himself in his work He fled abroad and lived alone It seemed a blight had fallen on his soul The world called him mad Many times he planned to take his life but always the hope of meeting her again stopped him At last he returned to this country determined to see her at any cost and if possible gain her forgiveness and his father s consent to their marriage He came into the hills only to find that the mother of his child had died of a broken heart Then came the end The artist disappeared leaving a long pitiful letter saying that before the word reached his father he would be dead The most careful investigation brought nothing but convincing evidence that the unhappy boy had taken his own life The artist knew that it would be a thousand times easier for the proud man to think his son dead than for him to know the truth and he was right mister Matthews he was right I cannot tell you of the man s suffering but he found a little comfort in the reflection that such extravagant praise of his son s work had added to the honor of the family for the lad s death was held by all to be the result of a disordered mind There was not a whisper of wrong doing His life they said was without reproach and even his sad mental condition was held to be evidence of his great genius The minister was weak sir He knew something of the intellectual side of his religion and the history of his church but he knew little very little of the God that could sustain him in such a trial He was shamefully weak He tried to run away from his trouble and because the papers had made so much of his work as a preacher and because of his son s fame he gave only the first part of his name thinking thus to get away from it all for a season But God was to teach the proud man of culture and religious forms a great lesson and to that end directed his steps He was led here here sir to your home and you you told him the story of his son s crime The shepherd paused A hoarse whisper came from the giant in the chair You you Dad your name is The other threw out his hand as if to guard himself and shrank back Hush oh hush I have no name but the name by which you know me The man who bore that name is dead In all his pride of intellect and position he died Your prayers for vengeance were answered sir You you killed him killed him as truly as if you had plunged a knife into his heart and you did well Aunt Mollie moaned Is that all growled the mountaineer All God no I I must go on I must tell you how the man you killed staid in the hills and was born again There was nothing else for him to do but stay in the hills With the shame and horror of his boy s disgrace on his heart he could not go back back to the city his friends and his church to the old life He knew that he could not hope to deceive them He was not skilled in hiding things Every kind word in praise of himself or in praise of his son would have been keenest torture He was a coward he dared not go back His secret would have driven him mad and he would have ended it all as his son had done His only hope for peace was to stay here here on the very spot where the wrong was done and to do what little he could to atone for the crime At first it was terrible the long lonely nights with no human friend near the weight of shame the memories and the lonely wind always the wind in the trees her voice Pete said calling for him to come God sir I wonder the man did not die under his punishment But God is good mister Matthews God is good and merciful Every day out on the range with the sheep the man felt the spirit of the hills and little by little their strength and their peace entered into his life The minister learned here sir what he had not learned in all his theological studies He learned to know God the God of these mountains The hills taught him and they came at last to stand between him and the trouble from which he had fled The nights were no longer weary and long He was never alone The voices in the wilderness became friendly voices for he learned their speech and the poor girl ceased to call in the wailing wind Then doctor Coughlan came and Again the shepherd stopped He could not go on The light was gone from the sky and he felt the blackness of the night But against the stars he could still see the crown of the mountain where his son lay When he had gathered strength he continued saying simply doctor Coughlan came and last night we learned that my son was not dead but living Again that growl like the growl of a wild beast came from the mountaineer Silently mister Howitt prayed Go on came the command in hoarse tones In halting broken words the shepherd faltered through the rest of his story as he told how while using the cabin under the cliff as a studio the artist had discovered the passage to the old Dewey cave how since his supposed death he had spent the summers at the scene of his former happiness how he had met his son roaming the hills at night and had been able to have the boy with him much of the time how he had been wounded the night Jim Lane was killed and finally how Pete had led them to his bedside He is dying yonder doctor Coughlan is with him and Pete Pete is there too I I came for you He is calling for you I came to tell you All that a man may suffer here he has suffered sir Your prayer has been doubly answered mister Matthews Both father and son are dead The name the old name is perished from the face of the earth For Christ s dear sake forgive my boy and let him go For my sake sir I I can bear no more Who but He that looketh upon the heart of man could know the battle that was fought in the soul of that giant of the hills He uttered no sound He sat in his seat as if made of stone save once when he walked to the end of the porch to stand with clenched hands and passion shaken frame facing the dark clump of pines on the hill Slowly the moon climbed over the ridge and lighted the scene The mountaineer returned to his chair All at once he raised his head and leaning forward looked long and earnestly at the old shepherd where he sat crouching like a convict awaiting sentence From down the mill road came voices and the sound of horses feet Old Matt started turning his head a moment to listen The horses stopped at the lower gate The children said Aunt Mollie softly The children Grant Oh Grant Sammy and our boy Then the shepherd felt a heavy hand on his shoulder and a voice that had in it something new and strange said Dad my brother Daniel I I ain t got no education an I don t know rightly how to say it but Daniel what these hills have been to you you you have been to me It s sure God s way Daniel Let s let s go to the boy CHAPTER XLII THE WAY OF THE LOWER TRAIL Fix the light as it was please That s it Thank you Doctor How beautiful she is how beautiful He seemed to gather strength and looked carefully into the face of each member of the little group about the bed the shepherd Old Matt Aunt Mollie Pete and the physician Then he turned his eyes back to the painting To the watchers the girl in the picture holding her brimming cup seemed to smile back again I loved her I loved her She was my natural mate my other self I belonged to her she to me I I can t tell you of that summer when we were together alone in the hills the beautiful hills away from the sham and the ugliness of the world that men have made The beauty and inspiration of it all I put into my pictures and I knew because of that they were good I knew they would win a place for me and they did Most of all I put it there He pointed to the painting on the wall and the crowd saw it and felt it and did not know what it was But I knew I knew all the time I knew Oh if that short summer could have been lengthened into years what might I not have done Oh God That men can be so blind so blind For a time he lay exhausted his face still turned toward the picture but with eyes closed as though he dreamed Then suddenly he started up again raising himself on his elbows his eyes opened wide and on his face a look of wondering gladness They drew near Do do you hear She is calling she is calling again Yes sweetheart yes dear I I am com Then Old Matt and Aunt Mollie led the shepherd from the room And this way runs the trail that follows the lower level where those who travel as they go look always over their shoulders with eyes of dread and the gloomy shadows gather long before the day is done CHAPTER XLIII POOR PETE They buried the artist in the cave as he had directed close under the wall on the ledge above the canon with no stone or mark of any sort to fix the place The old mine which he had discovered was reached by one of the side passages far below in the depth of the mountain The grave would never be disturbed For two weeks longer doctor Coughlan staid with his friend out on the hills with him all day helping to cook their meals at the ranch or sitting on the porch at the Matthews place when the day was gone When the time finally came that he must go the little physician said as he grasped the shepherd s hand You re doing just right Daniel just right Always did always did Blast it all I would stay too but what would Sarah and the girls do I ll come again next spring Daniel sure sure if I m alive Don t worry no one will ever know Blast it all I don t like to leave you Daniel Don t like it at all But you are right right Daniel The old scholar stood in the doorway of his cabin to watch the wagon as it disappeared in the forest He heard it rattle across the creek bottom below the ruined cabin under the bluff He waited until from away up on Compton Ridge the sound of wheels came to him on the breeze that slipped down the mountain side Still he waited listening listening until there were only the voices of the forest and the bleating of the sheep in the corral Slipping a book in his pocket and taking a luncheon for himself and Pete he opened the corral gate and followed his flock to the hills All that summer Pete was the shepherd s constant companion At first he seemed not to understand Frequently he would start off suddenly for the cave only to return after a time with that look of trouble upon his delicate face mister Howitt tried to help the boy and he appeared gradually to realize in part Once he startled his old friend by saying quietly When are you goin Dad Going where Where does Pete think Dad is going The boy was lying on his back on the grassy hillside watching the clouds He pointed upward There where HE went up there in the white hills Pete knows The other looked long at the lad before answering quietly Dad does not know when he will go But he is ready any time now Pete says better not wait long Dad cause Pete he s a goin an course when he goes I ve got to go long Do you reckon Dad can see Pete when he is up there in them white hills Some folks used to laugh at Pete when he told about the white hills the flower things the sky things an the moonlight things that play in the mists An once a fellow called Pete a fool an Young Matt he whipped him awful But folks wasn t really to blame cause they couldn t see em That s what HE said An HE knew cause he could see em too But Aunt Mollie an Uncle Matt an you all they don t never laugh They just say Pete knows But they couldn t see the flower things or the tree things neither Only HE could see The summer passed and when the blue gray haze took on the purple touch and all the woods and hills were dressed with cloth of gold Pete went from the world in which he had never really belonged nor had been at home mister Howitt writing to doctor Coughlan of the boy s death said Here and there among men there are those who pause in the hurried rush to listen to the call of a life that is more real How often have we seen them David jostled and ridiculed by their fellows pushed aside and forgotten as incompetent or unworthy He who sees and hears too much is cursed for a dreamer a fanatic or a fool by the mad mob who having eyes see not ears and hear not and refuse to understand We build temples and churches but will not worship in them we hire spiritual advisers but refuse to heed them we buy bibles but will not read them believing in God we do not fear Him acknowledging Christ we neither follow nor obey Him Only when we can no longer strive in the battle for earthly honors or material wealth do we turn to the unseen but more enduring things of life and with ears deafened by the din of selfish war and cruel violence and eyes blinded by the glare of passing pomp and folly we strive to hear and see the things we have so long refused to consider Pete knew a world unseen by us and we therefore fancied ourselves wiser than he The wind in the pines the rustle of the leaves the murmur of the brook the growl of the thunder and the voices of the night were all understood and answered by him The flowers the trees the rocks the hills the clouds were to him not lifeless things but living friends who laughed and wept with him as he was gay or sorrowful Poor Pete we said Was he in truth David poorer or richer than we They laid the boy beside his mother under the pines on the hills the pines that showed so dark against the sky when the sun was down behind the ridge And over his bed the wild vines lovingly wove a coverlid of softest green while all his woodland friends gathered about his couch Forest and hill and flower and cloud sang the songs he loved All day the sunlight laid its wealth in bars of gold at his feet and at night the moonlight things and the shadow things came out to play Summer and autumn slipped away the winter passed spring came with all the wonder of the resurrection of flower and leaf and blade So peace and quiet came again into the shepherd s life When no answer to his letter was received and the doctor did not return as he had promised the old man knew that the last link connecting him with the world was broken CHAPTER XLIV THE TRAIL ON THE SUNLIT HILLS When Young Matt first knew that Sammy had sent Ollie back to the city with no promise to follow he took to the woods and returned only after miles of tramping over the wildest roughest part of the country The big fellow said no word but on his face was a look that his father understood and the old mountaineer felt his own blood move more quickly at the sight But when Sammy with her books was fully established in the Matthews home and Young Matt seemed always as the weeks went by to find her reading things that he could not understand he was made to realize more fully what her studies with the shepherd meant He came to feel that she had already crossed the threshold into that world where mister Howitt lived And thinking that he himself could never enter he grew lonely and afraid With the quickness that was so marked in her character Sammy grasped the meaning of his trouble almost before Young Matt himself knew fully what it was Then the girl with much care and tact set about helping him to see the truths which the shepherd had revealed to her All through the summer and fall when the day s work was done or on a Sunday afternoon they were together and gradually the woods and the hills with all the wild life that is in them began to have for the young man a new meaning or rather he learned little by little to read the message that lay on the open pages first a word here and there then sentences then paragraphs and soon he was reading alone as he tramped the hills for stray stock or worked in the mountain field The idle days of winter and the long evenings were spent in reading aloud from the books that had come to mean most to her So she led him on slowly along the way that her teacher had pointed out to her but always as they went he saw her going before far ahead and he knew that in the things that men call education he could never hope to stand by her side But he was beginning to ask are there not after all things that lie still deeper in life than even these Often he would go to his old friend in the Hollow with some thought and the shepherd seeing how it was would smile as he helped the lad on his way The scholar looked forward with confidence to the time when young Matt would discover for himself as Sammy had found for herself that the only common ground whereon men and women may meet in safety is the ground of their manhood and womanhood And so it was on that spring morning when the young giant felt the red life throbbing strongly in his great limbs as he followed his team to and fro across the field And in his voice as he shouted to his horses at the end of the furrow there was something under the words something of a longing something also of a challenge Sammy was going to spend the day with her friends on Jake Creek She had not been to see Mandy since the night of her father s death As she went she stopped at the lower end of the field to shout a merry word to the man with the plow and it was sometime later when the big fellow again started his team The challenge in his tone had grown bolder Sammy returned that afternoon in time for the evening meal and Aunt Mollie thought as the girl came up the walk that the young woman had never looked so beautiful Why honey she said you re just a bubblin over with life Your cheeks are as rosy your eyes are as sparklin you re fairly shinin all over Your ride sure done you good The young woman replied with a hug that made her admirer gasp Law child you re strong as a young panther You walk like one too so kind of strong easy like The girl laughed I hope I don t impress everybody that way Aunt Mollie I don t believe I want to be like a panther I d rather be like like Like what child Like you just like you the best the very best woman in the whole world because you ve got the best and biggest heart She looked back over her shoulder laughing as she ran into the house When Young Matt came in from the field Sammy went out to the barn while he unharnessed his team Are you very tired to night she asked The big fellow smiled Tired Me tired Where do you want to go Haven t you ridden enough to day I should think you d be tired yourself Tired Me tired said the girl I don t want to ride I want to walk It s such a lovely evening and there s going to be a moon I have been thinking all day that I would like to walk over home after supper if you cared to go That night the work within the house and the chores about the barn were finished in a remarkably short time The young man and woman started down the Old Trail like two school children while the father and mother sat on the porch and heard their voices die away on the mountain side below The girl went first along the little path moving with that light sure step that belongs only to perfect health the health of the woods and hills The man followed walking with the same sure easy step strength and power revealed in every movement of his body Two splendid creatures they were masterpieces of the Creator s handiwork made by Him who created man male and female and bade them have dominion over every living thing that moveth upon the earth kings by divine right In the belt of timber where the trail to the ranch branches off they met the shepherd on his way to the house for an evening visit The old man paused only long enough to greet them and pushed on up the hill for he saw by their faces that the time was come Sammy had grown very quiet when they rounded the shoulder of Dewey and they went in silence down to the cabin on the southern slope of the mountain The girl asked Young Matt to wait for her at the gate and going to the house she entered alone A short time she remained in the familiar rooms then slipping out through the rear door ran through the woods to the little glen back of the house Dropping beside the mound she buried her face in the cool grass as she whispered Oh Daddy Daddy Jim I wish you were here to night this night that means so much to me Do you know how happy I am Daddy Do you know I wonder The twilight deepened I must go now Daddy I must go to him You told me you would trust me anywhere with him He is waiting for me now but I wish oh I wish that you were here to night Daddy Jim Quickly she made her way back to the cabin passed through the house and rejoined Young Matt The two returned silently up the mountain side to the higher levels where the light still lingered though the sun was down At the Lookout they stopped We ll wait for the moon here she said and so seated on a big rock they watched the last of the evening go out from the west From forest depth and mountain side came the myriad voices of Nature s chorus blending softly in the evening hymn and rising clear above the low breathed tones yet in perfect harmony came a whip poor will s plaintive call floating up from the darkness below the sweet cooing of a wood dove in a tree on the ridge and the chirping of a cricket in a nearby crevice of the ledge Like shadowy spirits the bats flitted here and there in the gathering gloom The two on the mountain s shoulder felt themselves alone above it all above it all yet still a part of all Then the moon looked over the mountain behind them turning Mutton Hollow into a wondrous sea of misty light out of which the higher hills lifted their heads like fairy islands The girl spoke Come Matt we must go now Help me down He slipped from his seat and stood beside the rock with uplifted arms Sammy leaned forward and placed her hands upon his shoulders He felt her breath upon his forehead The next instant he held her close So they went home along the trail that is nobody knows how old and the narrow path that was made by those who walked one before the other they found wide enough for two Dad Howitt returning to the ranch saw them coming so in the moonlight and slipped aside from the path into the deeper shadows As they passed the old shepherd scholar and poet stood with bowed uncovered head When they were gone and their low voices were no longer heard he said aloud What God hath joined what God hath joined And this way runs the trail that lies along the higher sunlit hills where those who journey see afar and the light lingers even when the day is done CHAPTER XLV SOME YEARS LATER A wandering artist searching for new fields found his way into the Ozark country One day as he painted in the hills a flock of sheep came over the ridge through a low gap and worked slowly along the mountain side A few moments later the worker at the easel lifted his eyes from the canvas to find himself regarded by an old man in the dress of a native Hello uncle Fine day said the artist shortly his eyes again upon his picture The God of these hills gives us many such young sir and all His days are good The painter s hand paused between palette and canvas and his face was turned toward the speaker in wonder Every word was perfect in accent of the highest culture and the deep musical tone of the voice was remarkable in one with the speaker s snowy hair and beard The young man arose to his feet I beg your pardon sir I thought He hesitated as he again took in the rude dress of the other The brown eyes under their white shaggy brows lighted with good nature You mean young sir that you did not think Tis the privilege of youth make the most of it Very soon old age will rob you of your freedom and force you to think whether you will or no Your greeting under the circumstance is surely excusable It is I who should beg pardon for I have interrupted your study and I have no excuse neither my youth nor my occupation will plead for me The charm of his voice and manner were irresistible The painter stepped forward with outstretched hand Indeed sir I am delighted to meet you I am here for the summer from Chicago My camp is over there The other grasped the offered hand cordially I am Daniel Howitt young sir from the sheep ranch in Mutton Hollow Dad Howitt the people call me So you see you were not far wrong when you hailed me Uncle Uncle and Dad are sure close kin as Preachin Bill would say Both men laughed and the painter offered his folding easel chair Thank you no Here is a couch to which I am more accustomed I will rest here if you please The old man stretched himself upon the grassy slope Do you like my hills he asked But I am sure you do he added as his eye dwelt fondly upon the landscape Ah you are the owner of this land then I was wondering who No no young sir the old man interrupted laughing again Others pay the taxes these hills belong to me only as they belong to all who have the grace to love them They will give you great treasure that you may give again to others who have not your good strength to escape from the things that men make and do in the restless world over there One of your noble craft could scarcely fail to find the good things God has written on this page of His great book Your brothers need the truths that you will read here unless the world has greatly changed You are not then a native of this country I was a native of that world yonder young sir Before your day they knew me but long since they have forgotten When I died there I was born again in these mountains And so he finished with a smile I am as you see a native It is long now since I met one from beyond the ridges I will not likely meet another I wonder that others have not discovered the real beauty of the Ozarks remarked the painter The old shepherd answered softly One did Then rising to his feet and pointing to Roark valley he said Before many years a railroad will find its way yonder Then many will come and the beautiful hills that have been my strength and peace will become the haunt of careless idlers and a place of revelry I am glad that I shall not be here But I must not keep you longer from your duties I shall see you again shall I not The painter was loath to let him go More often than will be good for your picture I fear You must work hard young sir while the book of God is still open and God s message is easily read When the outside world comes men will turn the page and you may lose the place After that they met often and one day the old man led the artist to where a big house looked down upon a ridge encircled valley Though built of logs without the house within was finished and furnished in excellent taste To his surprise the painter found one room lined with shelves and upon the shelves the best things that men have written for their fellows In another room was a piano The floors were covered with rugs Draperies and hangings softened the atmosphere and the walls were hung with pictures not many but good and true pictures that had power over those who looked upon them The largest painting hung in the library and was veiled My daughter missus Matthews said the old shepherd as he presented the stranger to the mistress of the house In all his search for beauty never had the artist looked upon such a form and such a face It was a marvelous blending of the physical with the intellectual and spiritual A firm step was heard on the porch My husband said the lady And the stranger rose to greet the woman s MATE The children of this father and mother were like them or as the visitor afterwards said in his extravagant way like young gods for beauty and strength The next summer the painter went again to the Ozarks Even as he was greeted by the strong master of the hills and his charming wife there fell upon his ears a dull report as of distant cannon then another and another They led him across the yard and there to the north on the other side of Roark men were tearing up the mountain to make way for the railroad As they looked another blast sent the rocks flying while the sound rolled and echoed through the peaceful hills The artist turned to his friends with questioning eyes mister Howitt said it would come Is he is he well missus Matthews answered softly Dad left us while the surveyors were at work He sleeps yonder She pointed to Dewey Bald Then they went into the library where the large picture was unveiled When the artist saw it he exclaimed Mad Howard s lost masterpiece How where did you find it It was Father Howitt s request that I tell you the story Sammy replied And then she told the artist a part of that which I have set down here THE END End of
