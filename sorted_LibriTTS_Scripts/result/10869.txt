aren t very good friends largely because of this life he s leading He went on out of the room mumbling again incoherently She resumed her vigil unable to read because of her misgivings staring at the fire starting at a harsher gust of wind or any unaccustomed sound And for a long time there beat against her brain the shuffling searching tread of her uncle Its cessation about eleven o clock increased her uneasiness He had been so afraid Suppose already the thing he had feared had overtaken him She listened intently Even then she seemed to sense the soundless footsteps of disaster straying in the decayed house and searching too A morbid desire to satisfy herself that her uncle s silence meant nothing evil drove her upstairs She stood in the square main hall at the head of the stairs listening Her uncle s bedroom door lay straight ahead To her right and left narrow corridors led to the wings Her room and Bobby s and a spare room were in the right hand wing The opposite corridor was seldom used for the left hand wing was the oldest portion of the house and in the march of years too many legends had gathered about it The large bedroom was there with its private hall beyond and a narrow enclosed staircase descending to the library Originally it had been the custom for the head of the family to use that room Its ancient furniture still faded within stained walls For many years no one had slept in it because it had sheltered too much suffering because it had witnessed the reluctant spiritual departure of too many Blackburns Katherine shrank a little from the black entrance of the corridor but her anxiety centred on the door ahead She was about to call when a stirring beyond it momentarily reassured her The door opened and her uncle stepped out He wore an untidy dressing gown His hair was disordered His face appeared grayer and more haggard than it had downstairs A lighted candle shook in his right hand What are you doing up here Katy he quavered She broke down before the picture of his increased fear He shuffled closer What you crying for Katy She controlled herself She begged him for an answer to her doubts You make me afraid He laughed scornfully You What you got to be afraid of I m afraid because you are she urged You ve got to tell me I m all alone I can t stand it What are you afraid of He didn t answer He shuffled on toward the disused wing Her hand tightened on the banister Where are you going she whispered He turned at the entrance to the corridor I am going to the old bedroom Why Why she asked hysterically You can t sleep there The bed isn t even made He lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper Don t you mention I ve gone there If you want to know I am afraid I m afraid to sleep in my own room any longer She nodded And you don t think they d look for you there What is it Tell me what it is Why don t you send for some one a man Leave me alone he mumbled Nothing for you to be worried about except Bobby Yes there is she cried Yes there is He paid no attention to her fright He entered the corridor She heard him shuffling between its narrow walls She saw his candle disappear in its gloomy reaches She ran to her own room and locked the door She hurried to the window and leaned out her body shaking her teeth chattering as if from a sudden chill The quiet assured tread of disaster came nearer The two wings stretching at right angles from the main building formed a narrow court Clouds harrying the moon failed quite to destroy its power so that she could see across the court the facade of the old wing and the two windows of the large room through whose curtains a spectral glow was diffused She heard one of the windows opened with a grating noise The court was a sounding board It carried to her even the shuffling of the old man s feet as he must have approached the bed The glow of his candle vanished She heard a rustling as if he had stretched himself on the bed a sound like a long drawn sigh She tried to tell herself there was no danger that these peculiar actions sprang from the old man s fancy but the house her surroundings her loneliness contradicted her To her over acute senses the thought of Blackburn in that room so often consecrated to the formula of death suggested a special and unaccountable menace Under such a strain the supernatural assumed vague and singular shapes She slept for only a little while Then she lay awake listening with a growing expectancy for some message to slip across the court The moon had ceased struggling The wind cried The baying of a dog echoed mournfully from a great distance It was like a remote alarm bell which vibrates too perfectly whose resonance is too prolonged She sat upright She sprang from the bed and her heart beating insufferably felt her way to the window From the wing opposite the message had come a soft shrouded sound another long drawn sigh She tried to call across the court At first no response came from her tight throat When it did at last her voice was unfamiliar in her own ears the voice of one who has to know a thing but shrinks from asking Uncle The wind mocked her It is nothing she told herself nothing But her vigil had been too long her loneliness too complete Her earlier impression of the presence of death in the decaying house tightened its hold She had to assure herself that Silas Blackburn slept untroubled The thing she had heard was peculiar and he hadn t answered across the court The dark empty corridors at first were an impassable barrier but while she put on her slippers and her dressing gown she strengthened her courage There was a bell rope in the upper hall She might get Jenkins When she stood in the main hall she hesitated It would probably be a long time provided he heard at all before Jenkins could answer her Her candle outlined the entrance to the musty corridor Just a few running steps down there a quick rap at the door and perhaps in an instant her uncle s voice and the blessed power to return to her room and sleep While her fear grew she called on her pride to let her accomplish that brief abhorrent journey Then for the first time a different doubt came to her As she waited alone in this disturbing nocturnal intimacy of an old house she shrank from no thought of human intrusion and she wondered if her uncle had been afraid of that too of the sort of thing that might lurk in the ancient wing with its recollections of birth and suffering and death But he had gone there as an escape Surely he had been afraid of men It shamed her that in spite of that her fear defined itself ever more clearly as something indefinable With a passionate determination to strangle such thoughts she held her breath She tried to close her mind She entered the corridor She ran its length She knocked at the locked door of the old bedroom She shrank as the echoes rattled from the dingy walls where her candle cast strange reflections There was no other answer A sense of an intolerable companionship made her want to cry out for brilliant light for help She screamed Uncle Silas Uncle Silas Through the silence that crushed her voice she became aware finally of the accomplishment of its mission by death in this house And she fled into the main hall She jerked at the bell rope The contact steadied her stimulated her to reason One slender hope remained The oppressive bedroom might have driven Silas Blackburn through the private hall and down the enclosed staircase Perhaps he slept on the lounge in the library She stumbled down hoping to meet Jenkins She crossed the hall and the dining room and entered the library She bent over the lounge It was empty Her candle was reflected in the face of the clock on the mantel Its hands pointed to half past two She pulled at the bell cord by the fireplace Why didn t the butler come Alone she couldn t climb the enclosed staircase to try the other door It seemed impossible to her that she should wait another instant alone The butler as old and as gray as Silas Blackburn faltered in He started back when he saw her My God Miss Katherine What s the matter You look like death There s death she said She indicated the door of the enclosed staircase She led the way with the candle The panelled narrow hall was empty That door too was locked and the key she knew must be on the inside Who who is it Jenkins asked Who would be in that room Has mister Bobby come back She descended to the library before answering She put the candle down and spread her hands It s happened Jenkins whatever he feared Not mister Silas We have to break in she said with a shiver Get a hammer a chisel whatever is necessary But if there s anything wrong the butler objected if anybody s been there the other door must be open She shook her head Those two first of all faced that extraordinary puzzle How had the murderer entered and left the room with both doors locked on the inside with the windows too high for use They went to the upper story She urged the butler into the sombre corridor We have to know she whispered what s happened beyond those locked doors She still vibrated to the feeling of unconformable forces in the old house Jenkins she saw responded to the same superstitious misgivings He inserted the chisel with maladroit hands He forced the lock back and opened the door Dust arose from the long disused room flecking the yellow candle flame They hesitated on the threshold They forced themselves to enter Then they looked at each other and smiled with relief for Silas Blackburn in his dressing gown lay on the bed his placid unmarked face upturned as if sleeping Why miss Jenkins gasped He s all right Almost with confidence Katherine walked to the bed Uncle Silas she began and touched his hand She drew back until the wall supported her Jenkins must have read everything in her face for he whimpered But he looks all right He can t be Cold already If I hadn t touched The horror of the thing descended upon her stifling thought Automatically she left the room and told Jenkins what to do After he had telephoned police headquarters in the county seat and had summoned

none	none	a country physician she sat without words huddled over the library fire The detective a competent man named Howells and Doctor Groom arrived at about the same time The detective made Katherine accompany them upstairs while he questioned her In the absence of the coroner he wouldn t let the doctor touch the body I must repair this lock he said the first thing so nothing can be disturbed Doctor Groom a grim and dark man had grown silent on entering the room For a long time he stared at the body in the candle light making as much of an examination as he could evidently without physical contact Why did he ever come here to sleep he asked in his rumbling bass voice Nasty room Unhealthy room Ten to one you re a formality policeman Coroner s a formality He sneered a little I daresay he died what the hard headed world will call a natural death Wonder what the coroner ll say The detective didn t answer He shot rapid uneasy glances about the room in which a single candle burned After a time he said with an accent of complete conviction That man was murdered Perhaps the doctor s significant words added to her earlier dread of the abnormal made Katherine read in the detective s manner an apprehension of conditions unfamiliar to the brutal routine of his profession Her glances were restless too She had a feeling that from the shadowed corners of the faded musty room invisible faces mocked the man s stubbornness All this she recited to Bobby when under extraordinary circumstances neither of them could have foreseen he arrived at the Cedars many hours later Of the earlier portion of the night of his grandfather s death Bobby retained a minute recollection The remainder was like a dim appalling nightmare whose impulse remains hidden When he went to his apartment to dress for dinner he found the letter of which Silas Blackburn had spoken to Katherine It mentioned the change in the will as an approaching fact nothing could alter Bobby fancied that the old man merely craved the satisfaction of terrorizing him of casting him out with all the ugly words at his command Still a good deal more than a million isn t to be relinquished lightly as long as a chance remains Bobby had an engagement for dinner He would think the situation over until after dinner then he might go It was perhaps unfortunate that at his club he met friends who drew him in a corner and offered him too many cocktails As he drank his anger grew and it wasn t all against his grandfather He asked himself why during the last few months he had avoided the Cedars why he had drifted into too vivid a life in New York It increased his anger that he hesitated to give himself a frank answer But always at such moments it was Katherine rather than his grandfather who entered his mind He had cared too much for her and lately beyond question the bond of their affection had weakened He raised his glass and drank He set the glass down quickly as if he would have liked to hide it A big man clear eyed and handsome walked into the room and came straight to the little group in the corner Bobby tried to carry it off Lo Hartley old preacher You fellows all know Hartley Graham Sit down We re going to have a little cocktail Graham looked at the glasses shaking his head If you ve time Bobby I d like a word with you No preaching Bobby bargained It isn t Sunday Graham laughed pleasantly It s about money That talks any day Bobby edged a way out and followed Graham to an unoccupied room There the big man turned on him See here Bobby When are you going out to the Cedars Bobby flushed You re a dear friend Hartley and I ve always loved you but I m in no mood for preaching tonight Besides I ve got my own life to lead he glanced away my own reasons for leading it I m not going to preach Graham answered seriously although it s obvious you re raising the devil with your life I wanted to tell you that I ve had a note from Katherine to day She says your grandfather s threats are taking too much form that the new will s bound to come unless you do something She cares too much for you Bobby to see you throw everything away She s asked me to persuade you to go out Why didn t she write to me Have you been very friendly with Katherine lately And that s not fair You re both without parents You owe Katherine something on that account Bobby didn t answer because it was clear that while Katherine s affection for him had weakened her friendship for Graham had grown too fast Looking at the other he didn t wonder There s another thing Graham was saying The gloomy old Cedars has got on Katherine s nerves and she says there s been a change in the old man the last few days wanders around as if he were afraid of something Bobby laughed outright Him afraid of something It s always been his system to make everybody and everything afraid of him But you re right about Katherine We have always depended on each other I think I ll go out after dinner Then come have a bite with me Graham urged I ll see you off afterward If you catch the eight thirty you ought to be out there before half past ten Bobby shook his head An engagement for dinner Hartley I m expecting Carlos Paredes to pick me up here any minute Graham s disapproval was belligerent Why in the name of heaven Bobby do you run around with that damned Panamanian Steer him off to night I ve argued with you before It s unpleasant I know but the man carries every mark of crookedness Easy with my friends Hartley You don t understand Carlos He s good fun when you know him awfully good fun So Graham said is this sort of thing Too many cocktails too much wine Paredes has the same pleasant dangerous quality A club servant entered In the reception room mister Blackburn Bobby took the card tore it into little bits and dropped them one by one into the waste paper basket Tell him I ll be right out He turned to Graham Sorry you don t like my playmates I ll probably run out after dinner and let the old man terrorize me as a cure for his own fear Pleasant prospect So long Graham caught at his arm I m sorry Can t we forget to night that we disagree about Paredes Let me dine with you Bobby s laugh was uncomfortable Come on if you wish and be my guardian angel God knows I need one He walked across the hall and into the reception room The light was not brilliant there One or two men sat reading newspapers about a green shaded lamp on the centre table but Bobby didn t see Paredes at first Then from the obscurity of a corner a form tall and graceful emerged with a slow monotony of movement suggestive of stealth The man s dark sombre eyes revealed nothing His jet black hair parted in the middle and his carefully trimmed Van Dyke beard gave him an air of distinction an air at the same time a trifle too reserved For a moment as the green light stained his face unhealthily Bobby could understand Graham s aversion He brushed the idea aside Glad you ve come Carlos The smile of greeting vanished abruptly from Paredes s face He looked with steady eyes beyond Bobby s shoulder Bobby turned Graham stood on the threshold his face a little too frank But the two men shook hands I d an idea until I saw Bobby Graham said that you d gone back to Panama Paredes yawned Each year I spend more time in New York Business suggests it Pleasure demands it His voice was deep and pleasant but Bobby had often remarked that it like Paredes s eyes was too reserved It seemed never to call on its obvious powers of expression Its accent was noticeable only in a pleasant polished sense Hartley Bobby explained is dining with us Paredes let no disapproval slip but Graham hastened to explain Bobby and I have an engagement immediately after dinner An engagement after dinner I didn t understand Let s think of dinner first Bobby said We can talk about engagements afterward Perhaps you ll have a cocktail here while we decide where we re going The aperitif I should like very much Paredes said About dinner there is nothing to decide I have arranged everything There s a table waiting in the Fountain Room at the C and there I have planned a little surprise for you He wouldn t explain further While they drank their cocktails Bobby watched Graham s disapproval grow The man glanced continually at his watch In the restaurant when Paredes left them to produce as he called it his surprise Graham appraised with a frown the voluble people who moved intricately through the hall I m afraid Paredes has planned a thorough evening he said for which he ll want you to pay Don t be angry Bobby The situation is serious enough to excuse facts You must go to the Cedars to night Do you understand You must go in spite of Paredes in spite of everything Peace until train time Bobby demanded He caught his breath There they are Carlos has kept his word See her Hartley She s glorious A young woman accompanied the Panamanian as he came back through the hall She appeared more foreign than her guide the Spanish of Spain rather than of South America Her clothing was as unusual and striking as her beauty yet one felt there was more than either to attract all the glances in this room to set people whispering as she passed Clearly she knew her notoriety was no little thing Pride filled her eyes Paredes had first introduced her to Bobby a month or more ago He had seen her a number of times since in her dressing room at the theatre where she was featured or at crowded luncheons in her apartment At such moments she had managed to be exceptionally nice to him Bobby however had answered merely to the glamour of her fame to the magnetic response her beauty always brought in places like this Paredes Graham muttered will have a powerful ally You won t fail me Bobby You will go Bobby scarcely heard He hurried forward and welcomed the woman She tapped his arm with her fan Leetle Bobby she lisped I haven t seen very much of you lately So when Carlos proposed you see I don t dance until late Who is that behind you mister Graham is it not He would maybe not remember me I danced at a dinner where you were one night at mister Ward s Even lawyers I find take enjoyment in my dancing I remember Graham said It is very pleasant we are to dine together He continued tactlessly But as I ve explained to mister Paredes we must hurry Bobby and I have an early engagement Her head went up An early engagement I do not often dine in public An unavoidable thing Graham explained Bobby will tell you Bobby nodded It s a nuisance particularly when you re so condescending Maria She shrugged her shoulders With Bobby she entered the dining room at the heels of Paredes and Graham Paredes had foreseen everything There were flowers on the table The dinner had been ordered Immediately the waiter brought cocktails Graham glanced at Bobby warningly He wouldn t as an example Bobby appreciated touch his own Maria held hers up to the light Pretty yellow things I never drink them She smiled dreamily at Bobby But see I shall place this to my lips in order that you may make pretty speeches and maybe tell me it is the most divine aperitif you have ever drunk She passed the glass to him and Bobby avoiding Graham s eyes wondering why she was so gracious emptied it And afterward frequently she reminded him of his wine by going through the same elaborate formula Probably because of that as much as anything else constraint grasped the little company tighter Graham couldn t hide his anxiety Paredes mocked it with sneering phrases which he turned most carefully Before the meal was half finished Graham glanced at his watch We ve just time for the eight thirty he whispered to Bobby if we pick up a taxi Maria had heard She pouted There is no engagement she lisped as sacred as a dinner no entanglement except marriage that cannot be easily broken Perhaps I have displeased you mister Graham Perhaps you fancy I excite unpleasant comment It is unjust I assure you my reputation is above reproach her dark eyes twinkled certainly in New York It isn t that Graham answered We must go It s not to be evaded She turned tempestuously Am I to be humiliated so Carlos Why did you bring me Is all the world to see my companions leave in the midst of a dinner as if I were plague touched Is Bobby not capable of choosing his own company You are thoroughly justified Maria Paredes said in his expressionless tones Bobby however has said very little about this engagement I did not know mister Graham that you were the arbiter of Bobby s actions In a way I must resent your implication that he is no longer capable of caring for himself Graham accepted the challenge He leaned across the table speaking directly to Bobby ignoring the others You ve not forgotten what I told you Will you come while there s time You must see I can t remain here any longer Bobby hating warfare in his present mood sought to temporize It s all right Hartley Don t worry I ll catch a later train Maria relaxed Ah Bobby still chooses for himself I ll have enough rumpus Bobby muttered when I get to the Cedars Don t grudge me a little peace here Graham arose His voice was discouraged I m sorry I ll hope Bobby Without a word to the others he walked out of the room So far when Bobby tried afterward to recall the details of the evening everything was perfectly distinct in his memory The remainder of the meal made uncomfortable by Maria s sullenness and Paredes s sneers his attempt to recapture the earlier gayety of the evening by continuing to drink the wine his determination to go later to the Cedars in spite of Graham s doubt of all these things no particular lacked He remembered paying the check as he usually did when he dined with Paredes He recalled studying the time table and finding that he had just missed another train Maria s spirits rose then He was persuaded to accompany her and Paredes to the music hall In her dressing room while she was on the stage he played with the boxes of make up splashing the mirror with various colours while Paredes sat silently watching The alteration he was sure came a little later in the cafe at a table close to the dancing floor Maria had insisted that Paredes and he should wait there while she changed But he had protested I have missed too many trains She had demanded his time table scanning the columns of close figures There is one she had said at twelve fifteen time for a little something in the cafe and who knows If you are agreeable I might forgive everything and dance with you once Bobby on the public floor So he sat for some time expectant with Paredes watching the boisterous dancers listening to the violent music sipping absent mindedly at his glass He wondered why Paredes had grown so quiet I mustn t miss that twelve fifteen he said You know Carlos you weren t quite fair to Hartley He s a splendid fellow Roomed with me at college played on same team and all that Only wanted me to do the right thing Must say it was the right thing I won t miss that twelve fifteen Graham Paredes sneered is a wonderful type Apollo in the flesh and Billy Sunday in the conscience Then as Bobby started to protest Maria entered more dazzling than at dinner and the dancers swayed less boisterously the chatter at the tables subsided the orchestra seemed to hesitate as a sort of obeisance A man Bobby had never seen before followed her to the table His middle aged figure was loudly clothed His face was coarse and clean shaven He acknowledged the introductions sullenly I ve only a minute Bobby said to Maria He continued however to raise his glass indifferently to his lips All at once his glass shook Maria s dark and sparkling face became blurred He could no longer define the features of the stranger He had never before experienced anything of the kind He tried to account for it but his mind became confused Maria he burst out Why are you looking at me like that Her contralto laugh rippled Bobby looks so funny Carlos Leetle Bobby looks so queer What is the matter with him Bobby s anger was lost in the increased confusion of his senses but through that mental turmoil tore the thought of Graham and his intention of going to the Cedars With shaking fingers he dragged out his watch He couldn t read the dial He braced his hands against the table thrust back his chair and arose The room tumbled about him Before his eyes the dancers made long nebulous bands of colour in which nothing had form or coherence Instinctively he felt he hadn t dined recklessly enough to account for these amazing symptoms He was suddenly afraid Carlos he whispered He heard Maria s voice dimly Take him home A hand touched his arm With a supreme effort of will he walked from the room guided by the hand on his arm And always his brain recorded fewer and fewer impressions for his memory to struggle with later At the cloak room some one helped him put on his coat He was walking down steps He was in some kind of a conveyance He didn t know what it was An automobile a carriage a train He didn t know He only understood that it went swiftly swaying from side to side through a sable pit Whenever his mind moved at all it came back to that sensation of a black pit in which he remained suspended swinging from side to side trying to struggle up against impossible odds Once or twice words flashed like fire through the pit Tyrant Fool to go From a long immersion deeper in the pit he struggled frantically He must get out Somehow he must find wings He realized that his eyes were closed He tried to open them and failed So the pit persisted and he surrendered himself as one accepts death to its hateful blackness Abruptly he experienced a momentary release There was no more swaying no more movement of any kind He heard a strange melancholy voice whispering without words always whispering with a futile perseverance as if it wished him to understand something it could not express What is it trying to tell me he asked himself Then he understood It was the voice of the wind and it tried to tell him to open his eyes and he found that he could But in spite of his desire they closed again almost immediately Yet from that swift glimpse a picture outlined itself later in his memory In the midst of wild rolling clouds the moon was a drowning face Stunted trees bent before the wind like puny men who strained impotently to advance Over there was one more like a real man a figure Bobby thought with a black thing over its face a mask This is the forest near the Cedars Bobby said to himself I ve come to face the old devil after all He heard his own voice harsh remote unnatural speaking to the dim figure with a black mask that waited half hidden by the straining trees Why am I here in the woods near the Cedars And he thought the thing answered Because you hate your grandfather Bobby laughed thinking he understood The figure in the black mask that accompanied him was his conscience He could understand why it went masked The wind resumed its whispering The figures straining like puny men fought harder The drowning face disappeared wet and helpless Bobby felt himself sinking back back into the sable pit I don t want to go he moaned A long time afterward he heard a whisper again and he wondered if it was the wind or his conscience He laughed through the blackness because the words seemed so absurd Take off your shoes and carry them in your hand Always do that It is the only safe way He laughed again thinking What a careful conscience He retained only one more impression He was dully aware that some time had passed He shivered He thought the wind had grown angry with him for it no longer whispered It shrieked and he could make nothing of its wrath He struggled frantically to emerge from the pit The quality of the blackness deepened His fright grew He felt himself slipping slowly at first then faster faster down into impossible depths and there was nothing at all he could do to save himself Go away For God s sake go away Bobby thought he was speaking to the sombre figure in the mask His voice aroused him to one more effort at escape but he felt that there was no use He was too deep Something hurt his eyes He opened them and for a time was blinded by a narrow shaft of sunlight resting on his face With an effort he moved his head to one side and closed his eyes again at first merely thankful that he had escaped from the black hell trying to control his sensations of physical evil Subtle curiosity forced its way into his sick brain and stung him wide awake This time his eyes remained open staring about him dilating with a wilder fright than he had experienced in the dark mazes of his nightmare adventure He had never seen this place before He lay on the floor of an empty room The shaft of sunlight that had aroused him entered through a crack in one of the tightly drawn blinds There were dust and grime on the wails and cobwebs clustered in the corners In the silent deserted room the beating of his heart became audible He struggled to a sitting posture He gasped for breath He knew it was very cold in here but perspiration moistened his face He could recall no such suffering as this since when a boy he had slipped from the crisis of a destructive fever Had he been drugged But he had been with friends There was no motive What house was this Was it like this room empty and deserted How had he come here For the first time he went through that dreadful process of trying to draw from the black pit useful memories He started recalling the strange voice and its warning for his shoes lay near by as though he might have dropped them carelessly when he had entered the room and stretched himself on the floor Damp earth adhered to the soles The leather above was scratched Then he thought that much is right I was in the woods What was I doing there That dim figure My imagination He suffered the agony of a man who realizes that he has wandered unawares in strange places and retains no recollection of his actions of his intentions He went back to that last unclouded moment in the cafe with Maria Paredes and the stranger Where had he gone after he had left them He had looked at his watch He had told himself he must catch the twelve fifteen train He must have gone from the restaurant proceeding automatically and caught the train That would account for the sensation of motion in a swift vehicle and perhaps there had been a taxicab to the station Doubtless in the woods near the Cedars he had decided it was too late to go in or that it was wiser not to He had answered to the necessity of sleeping somewhere But why had he come here Where indeed was he At least he could answer that He drew on his shoes a pair of patent leather pumps He fumbled for his handkerchief thinking he would brush the earth from them He searched each of his pockets His handkerchief was gone No matter He got to his feet lurching for a moment dizzily He glanced with distaste at his rumpled evening clothing To hide it as far as possible he buttoned his overcoat collar about his neck On tip toe he approached the door and with the emotions of a thief opened it quietly He sighed The rest of the house was as empty as this room The hall was thick with dust The rear door by which he must have entered stood half open The lock was broken and rusty He commenced to understand There was a deserted farmhouse less than two miles from the Cedars Since he had always known about it it wasn t unusual he should have taken shelter there after deciding not to go in to his grandfather He stepped through the doorway to the unkempt yard about whose tumbled fences the woods advanced thickly He recognized the place For some time he stood ashamed yet fair enough to seek the cause of his experience in some mental unhealth deeper than any reaction from last night s folly He glanced at his watch It was after two o clock The mournful neighbourhood the growing chill in the air the sullen sky urged him away He walked down the road Of course he couldn t go to the Cedars in this condition He would return to his apartment in New York where he could bathe change his clothes recover from this feeling of physical ill and remember perhaps something more It wasn t far to the little village on the railroad and at this hour there were plenty of trains He hoped no one he knew would see him at the station He smiled wearily What difference did that make He might as well face old Blackburn himself as he was By this time the thing was done The new will had been made He was penniless and an outcast But his furtive manner clung He didn t want Katherine to see him like this From the entrance of the village it was only a few steps to the station Several carriages stood at the platform testimony that a train was nearly due He prayed that it would be for New York He didn t want to wait around He didn t want to risk Katherine s driving in on some errand His mind intent only on escaping prying eyes was drawn by a man who stepped from behind a carriage and started across the roadway in his direction staring at him incredulously His quick apprehension vanished He couldn t recall that surprised face There was no harm being seen miserable as he was dressed as he was by this stranger He looked at him closer The man was plainly clothed He had small sharp eyes His hairless face was intricately wrinkled His lips were thin making a straight line To avoid him Bobby stepped aside thinking he must be going past but the stranger stopped and placed a firm hand on Bobby s shoulder He spoke in a quick authoritative voice Certainly you are mister Robert Blackburn For Bobby in his nervous bewildered condition there was an ominous note in this surprise this assurance this peremptory greeting What s amazing about that he jerked out The stranger s lips parted in a straight smile Amazing That s the word I was thinking of Hoped you might come in from New York Seemed you were here all the time That s a good one on me a very good one The beating of Bobby s heart was more pronounced than it had been in the deserted house He asked himself why he should shrink from this stranger who had an air of threatening him The answer lay in that black pit of last night and this morning Unquestionably he had been indiscreet The man would tell him how You mean he asked with dry lips that you ve been looking for me Who are you Please take your hand off The stranger s grasp tightened Not so fast mister Robert Blackburn I daresay you haven t just now come from the Cedars No no I m on my way to New York There s a train soon I think His voice trailed away The stranger s straight smile widened He commenced to laugh harshly and uncouthly Sure there s a train but you don t want to take it And why haven t you been at the Cedars Grandpa s death grieved you too much to go near his body Bobby drew back The shock robbed him for a moment of the power to reason Dead The old man How The stranger s smile faded Here it is nearly three o clock in the afternoon and you re all dressed up for last night That s lucky Bobby couldn t meet the narrow eyes Who are you The stranger with his free hand threw back his coat lapel My name s Howells I m a county detective I m on the case because your grandfather died very strangely He was murdered very cleverly murdered Queerest case I ve ever handled What do you think In his own ears Bobby s voice sounded as remote and unreal as it had through the blackness last night Why do you talk to me like this Because I tell you I m on the case and I want you to turn about and go straight to the Cedars This is absurd You mean you suspect You re placing me under arrest The detective s straight smile returned How we jump at conclusions I m simply telling you not to bother me with questions I m telling you to go straight to the Cedars where you ll stay Understand You ll stay there until you re wanted Until you re wanted The merciless repetition settled it for Bobby He knew it would be dangerous to talk or argue Moreover he craved an opportunity to think to probe farther into the black pit He turned and walked away When he reached the last houses he glanced back The detective remained in the middle of the road staring after him with that straight and satisfied smile Bobby walked on his shaking hands tightly clenched muttering to himself I ve got to remember Good God I ve got to remember It s the only way I can ever know he s not right that I m not a murderer CHAPTER II THE CASE AGAINST BOBBY Bobby hurried down the road in the direction of the Cedars Always he tried desperately to recall what had occurred during those black hours last night and this morning before he had awakened in the empty house near his grandfather s home All that remained were his sensation of travel in a swift vehicle his impression of standing in the forest near the Cedars his glimpse of the masked figure which he had called his conscience the echo in his brain of a dream like voice saying Take off your shoes and carry them in your hand Always do that It s the only safe way These facts then alone were clear to him He had wandered unconscious in the neighbourhood His grandfather had been strangely murdered The detective who had met him in the village practically accused him of the murder And he couldn t remember He turned back to his last clear recollections When he had experienced his first symptoms of slipping consciousness he had been in the cafe in New York with Carlos Paredes Maria the dancer and a strange man whom Maria had brought to the table Through them he might to an extent trace his movements unless they had put him in a cab thinking he would catch the train of which he had talked for the Cedars Already the forest crowded the narrow curving road The Blackburn place was in the midst of an arid thicket of stunted pines oaks and cedars Old Blackburn had never done anything to improve the estate or its surroundings Steadily during his lifetime it had grown more gloomy less habitable With the silent forest thick about him Bobby realized that he was no longer alone A crackling twig or a loose stone struck by a foot might have warned him He went slower glancing restlessly over his shoulder He saw no one but that idea of stealthy pursuit persisted Undoubtedly it was the detective Howells who followed him hoping perhaps that he would make some mad effort at escape That he muttered is probably the reason he didn t arrest me at the station Bobby however had no thought of escape He was impatient to reach the Cedars where he might learn all that Howells hadn t told him about his grandfather s death A high wooden fence straggled through the forest The driveway swung from the road through a broad gateway The gate stood open Bobby remembered that it had been old Blackburn s habit to keep it closed He entered and hurried among the trees to the edge of the lawn in the centre of which the house stood Feeling as guilty as the detective thought him he paused there and examined the house for some sign of life At first it seemed as dead as the forest stripped by autumn almost as gloomy and arid as the wilderness which straggled close about it He had no eye for the symmetry of its wings which formed the court in the centre of which an abandoned fountain stood He studied the windows picturing Katherine alone surrounded by the complications of this unexpected tragedy His feeling of an inimical watchfulness persisted A clicking sound swung him back to the house The front door had been opened and in the black frame of the doorway as he looked Katherine and Graham appeared and he knew the resolution of his last doubt was at hand Katherine had thrown a cloak over her graceful figure Her sunny hair strayed in the wind but her face while it had lost nothing of its beauty projected even at this distance a sense of weariness of anxiety of utter fear Bobby was grateful for Graham s presence It was like the man to assume his responsibilities to sacrifice himself in his service He straightened He must meet these two Through his own wretched appearance and position he must develop for Katherine more clearly than ever Graham s superiority He stepped out calling softly Katherine She started She turned in his direction and came swiftly toward him She spread her hands Bobby Bobby Where have you been There were tears in her eyes They were like tears that have been too long coming He took her hands Her fingers were cold They twitched in his Look at me Katherine he said hoarsely I m sorry Graham came up He spoke with apparent difficulty You ve not been home Then what happened last night Quick Tell us what you did everything I ve seen the detective he answered He s told you too Be careful I think he s back there watching and listening Katherine freed her hands The tears had dried She shook a little Then you were at the station she said You must have come from New York but I tried so hard to get you there For hours I telephoned and telegraphed Then I got Hartley Come away from the trees so we can talk without without being overheard As they moved to the centre of the open space Graham indicated Bobby s evening clothes Why are you dressed like that Bobby You did come from town You can tell us everything you did last night after I left you and early this morning Bobby shook his head His answer was reluctant I didn t come from New York just now I was evidently here last night and I can t remember Hartley I remember scarcely anything Graham s face whitened Tell us he begged You ve got to remember Katherine cried Bobby as minutely as he could recited the few impressions that remained from last night When he had finished Graham thought for some time Paredes and the dancer he said at last practically forced me away from you last night It s obvious Bobby you must have been drugged Bobby shook his head I thought of that right away but it won t do If I had been drugged I wouldn t have moved around and I did come out somehow I managed to get to the empty house to sleep It s more as if my mind had simply closed as if it had gone on working its own ends without my knowing anything about it And that s dreadful because the detective has practically accused me of murdering my grandfather How was it done You see I know nothing Tell me how how he was killed I can t believe I I m such a beast Tell me If I was in the house some detail might start my memory So Katherine told her story while Bobby listened shrinking from some disclosure that would convict him As she went on however his sense of bewilderment increased and when she had finished he burst out But where is the proof of murder Where is there even a suggestion You say the doors were locked and he doesn t show a mark That s what we can t understand Graham said There s no evidence we know anything about that your grandfather s heart didn t simply give out but the detective is absolutely certain and there s no use mincing matters Bobby he believes he has the proof to convict you He won t tell me what He simply smiles and refuses to talk The motive Bobby asked Graham looked at him curiously Katherine turned away Of course Bobby cried with a sharpened discomfort I d forgotten The money the new will he had planned to make The money s mine now but if he had lived until this morning it never would have been I see It is a powerful motive Graham said for any one who doesn t know you But Bobby answered Howells has got to prove first that my grandfather was murdered The autopsy Coroner s out of the county Graham replied and Howells won t have an assistant doctor Groom s waiting in the house We re expecting the coroner almost any time Bobby spoke rapidly If he calls it murder Hartley there s one thing we ve got to find out what my grandfather was afraid of Tell me again Katherine everything he said about me I can t believe he could have been afraid of me He called you Katherine answered a waster He said God knows what he ll do next He said he d ordered you out last night and he hadn t had a word from you but that he d made up his mind anyway He was going to have his lawyer this morning and change his will leaving all his money to the Bedford Foundation except a little annuity for me He grew sentimental and said he had no faith left in his flesh and blood and that it was sad to grow old with nobody caring for him except to covet his money I asked him if he were afraid of you and all he answered was You and Bobby are thicker than thieves Oh yes When I saw him for the last time in the hall he said there was nothing for me to worry about except you That s all I remember perfectly He said nothing more about you I wonder Bobby muttered if a jury wouldn t think it enough Katherine shook her head There seemed so much more than that behind his fear she said As I ve told you he gave me a feeling of superstition I never once was afraid of a murderer of a man in the house I was afraid of something queer and active but not human Bobby straightened Would you he asked call a man going about in an aphasia quite human Somnambulists do unaccountable things such as overcoming locked doors Don t Bobby Don t Katherine cried Sh h Quiet Graham warned A foot scraped on gravel Maybe the detective Bobby suggested He stared at the bend expecting to see the stiff plain figure of the detective emerge from the forest Instead with a dawning amazement he watched Carlos Paredes stroll into view The Panamanian was calm and immaculate His Van Dyke beard was neatly trimmed and combed As he advanced he puffed in leisurely fashion at a cigarette Graham flushed After last night he has the nerve Be decent to him Bobby urged He might help me might clear up last night I wonder Graham mused to what extent he could clear it up if he wished Paredes threw his cigarette away as he came closer Solemnly he shook hands with Katherine and Bobby expressing a profound sympathy Even then Bobby remarked that those reserved features let slip no positive emotion The man turned to Graham Our little difference of last evening he said suavely will I hope evaporate in this atmosphere of unexpected sorrow If I was in the wrong I deeply regret it My one wish now is to join you in being of use to Bobby and Miss Katherine in their bereavement I saw the account in a paper at luncheon I came as quickly as possible Graham answered this smooth effrontery with a blunt question Do you know that Bobby is in very real trouble that he may be implicated in mister Blackburn s death Paredes flung up his hands but Bobby looking for emotion in the sallow face then found none Paredes s features it occurred to him were exactly like a mask Bobby checked himself In his unhealthy way Paredes had been a good friend The man s voice flowed smoothly demanding particulars But this he said when they had told him what they could changes the situation I must stay here I must watch that detective and learn what he has up his sleeve Graham turned away I ve tried Maybe you ll succeed better than I Then you ll excuse me Paredes said quickly I should like your permission to telephone to my hotel in New York for some clothing I want to see this through The three looked at each other Katherine and Graham seemed about to speak Bobby wouldn t let them Carlos he said you might help me I m almost afraid to ask What happened in the cafe last night The last thing I remember distinctly is sitting there with you and Maria and a stranger she had introduced I didn t get his name What did I do Did any one leave the place with me Paredes smiled a little shaking his head You behaved as if mister Graham s earlier fears had been accomplished You insisted you were going to catch your train I didn t think it wise so I went to the cloak room with you intending to see you home Somehow just the same you gave me the slip You oughtn t to have let him get away Graham said Paredes shrugged his shoulders You weren t there You don t know how sly Bobby was I suppose it s useless to ask Graham said You saw nothing put in his wine Paredes laughed Is it likely Certainly not I should have mentioned it I should have stopped such a thing What do you think I am mister Graham Sorry Graham said You must understand we can t let any lead slip This stranger Maria brought up I didn t catch his name Paredes answered I d never seen him before I gathered he was a friend of hers connected with the profession Now I shall telephone with your permission Miss Katherine and don t you worry Bobby I will see you through but we can t do much until the coroner comes until the detective can be made to talk Katherine hesitated for a moment then she surrendered Please go with him Hartley and and make him as comfortable as you can in this unhappy house Katherine detained Bobby with a nod He saw the others go He shrank in his mental and physical discomfort from this isolation with her As soon as the door was closed she touched his hand She burst out passionately I don t believe it Bobby I ll never believe it no matter what happens It s sweet of you Katherine he said huskily That helps when you don t know what to believe yourself Don t talk that way Such a crime would never have entered your head under any conditions Only Bobby it ought never to have happened You ought never to have been in this position Why have you been friendly with people like like that Spaniard What can he want forcing himself here At any rate you ll never lead that sort of life again Her fingers sought his He clasped them firmly If I get past this he said I ll always look you straight in the eye Katherine It was mad silly You don t quite understand He broke off glancing at the door through which Graham had disappeared Then remember she said softly I don t believe it She released his hand sighing That s all I can say all I can do now You re ill Bobby Go in Rest for awhile When you ve had sleep you may remember something He shook his head He walked slowly with her to the house As he climbed the stairs he heard Paredes telephoning He couldn t understand the man s insistence on remaining where clearly he was an intruder He entered his bedroom which he had occupied only once or twice during the last few months The place seemed unfamiliar As he bathed and dressed his sense of strangeness grew and he understood why The last time he had been here he had stood in no personal danger There had been no black parenthesis in his life during the stretch of which he might have committed an unspeakable crime For he couldn t believe as firmly as Katherine did Since he couldn t remember he might have done anything Come he called in response to a stealthy rapping at the door Stealth it occurred to him had since last night become a stern condition of his life Graham entered and noiselessly closed the door I had a chance to slip in he explained Paredes is wandering about the place I d give a lot to know what he s after at the Cedars Katherine is in her room trying to rest after last night I fancy And Bobby asked the detective Howells If he s back from the station Graham answered he s keeping low I wonder if it was he or Paredes who followed you through the woods Why should Carlos have followed me Bobby asked I ve been thinking it over Hartley It isn t a bad scheme having him here since you think he hasn t told all he knows I don t say that Graham answered I don t know what to think about Paredes I ve come to talk about just that I m a lawyer and I ve had some criminal practice Since this detective will be satisfied with you for a victim I m going to take your case if you ll have me I ll be your detective as well as your lawyer Bobby was a good deal touched That s kind of you more than I deserve for I have resented you at times Graham it was clear didn t guess he referred to his friendship for Katherine for he answered quickly I must have seemed a nuisance but I was only trying to get you back on the straight path where you ve always belonged I can t believe you did this thing even unconsciously until I m shown proof without a single flaw Until the autopsy the only thing we have to work on is that party last night I ve telephoned to New York and put a trustworthy man on the heels of Maria and the stranger Meantime I think I d better watch developments here Please Bobby agreed Stay with me Hartley until this man takes some definite action He picked at the fringe of the window curtain If the autopsy shows that my grandfather was murdered he said either I killed him or else some one has deliberately tried to throw suspicion on me for with only a motive to go on this detective wouldn t be so sure Why in the name of heaven should any one kill the old man place all this money in my hands and at the same time send me to the electric chair Don t you see how absurd it is that Carlos Maria or any one else should have had a hand in it There was nothing for them to gain from his death I ve thought and thought in such circles until I am almost convinced of the logic of my guilt He drew the curtain farther back and gazed across the court at the room where his grandfather lay dead One of the two windows of the room was a little raised but the blinds were closely drawn I did hate him he mused There s that Ever since I can remember he did things to make me despise him Have have you seen him Graham nodded Howells took me in He looked perfectly normal not a mark I don t want to see him Bobby said He drew back from the window pointing The detective Howells had strolled into the court His hands hung at his sides They didn t swing as he walked His lips were stretched in that thin straight smile He paused by the fountain glancing for a moment anxiously downward Then he came on and entered the house He ll be restless Graham said until the coroner comes and proves or disproves his theory of murder If he questions you you d better say nothing for the present From his point of view what you remember of last night would be only damaging I want him to leave me alone Bobby said If he doesn t arrest me I won t have him bullying me Jenkins knocked and entered The old butler was as white faced as Bobby more tremulous The policeman sir He s asking for you Tell him I don t wish to see him The detective himself stepped from the obscurity of the hall smiling his queer smile Ah You are here mister Blackburn I d like a word with you He turned to Graham and Jenkins Alone if you please Bobby mutely agreed and Graham and the butler went out The detective closed the door and leaned against it studying Bobby with his narrow eyes I don t suppose he began that there s any use asking you about your movements last night None Bobby answered jerkily unless you arrest me and take me before those who ask questions with authority The detective s smile widened No matter I didn t come to argue with you about that I was curious to know if you d tried to see your grandfather s body Bobby shook his head I took it for granted the room was locked Yes the detective answered but some people it seems have skilful ways of overcoming locks He moved to one side placing his hand on the door knob I ve come to open doors for you to give you the opportunity an affectionate grandson must crave Bobby hesitated fighting back his feeling of repulsion his first instinct to refuse The detective might take it as an evidence against him On the other hand if he went the man would unquestionably try to tear from a meeting between the living and the dead some valuable confirmation of his theory Well the detective said What s the matter Thought the least I could do was to give you a chance Wouldn t do it for everybody Then everybody hasn t your affectionate nature Bobby advanced For God s sake stop mocking me I ll go since you wish The detective opened the door and stood aside to let Bobby pass Daresay you know the room the way to it Bobby didn t answer He went along the corridor and into the main hall where Katherine had met Silas Blackburn last night He fought back his aversion and entered the corridor of the old wing He heard the detective behind him He was aware of the man s narrow eyes watching him with a malicious assurance Bobby with a feeling of discomfort sprung in part from the gloomy passageway paused before the door his grandfather had had the unaccountable whim of entering last night The detective took a key from his pocket and inserted it in the lock Had some trouble repairing the lock this morning he said That fellow Jenkins entered with a heavy hand a good deal heavier than whoever was here before him He opened the door Queerest case I ve ever seen he mumbled Step in mister Blackburn Because of the drawn blinds the room was nearly as dark as the corridor Bobby entered slowly his nerves taut Against the farther wall the bed was like an enormous shadow without form Stay where you are the detective warned until I give you more light You know I wouldn t want you to touch anything because the room is exactly as it was when he was murdered Bobby experienced a swift impulse to strangle the brutal word in the detective s throat But he stood still while the man went to the bureau struck a match and applied it to a candle The wick burned reluctantly It flickered in the wind that slipped past the curtain of the open window Come here the detective commanded roughly Bobby dragged himself forward until he stood at the foot of the four poster bed The detective lifted the candle and held it beneath the canopy You look all you want now mister Robert Blackburn he said grimly Bobby conquered the desire to close his eyes to refuse to obey He stared at his grandfather and a feeling of wonder grew upon him For Silas Blackburn rested peacefully in the great bed His eyes were closed The thick gray brows were no longer gathered in the frown too familiar to Bobby The face with its gray beard retained no fear no record of a great shock Bobby glanced at the detective who bent over the bed watching him out of his narrow eyes Why he asked simply do you say he was murdered He was murdered the detective answered Murdered in cold blood and look you here young fellow I know who did it I m going to strap that man in the electric chair He s got just one chance if he talks out if he makes a clean breast of it Across the body he bent closer He held the candle so that its light searched Bobby s face instead of the dead man s and the uncertain flame was like an ambush for his eyes In response to those intolerable words Bobby s sick nerves stretched too tight No masquerade remained before this huntsman who had his victim trapped and calmly studied his agony The horror of the accusation shot at him across the body of the man he couldn t be sure he hadn t murdered robbed him of his last control He cried out hysterically Why don t you do something For God s sake why don t you arrest me A chuckle came from the man in ambush behind the yellow flame Listen to the boy What s he talking about Grief for his grandfather That s what it is grief Stop Bobby shouted It s what you ve been accusing me with ever since you stopped me at the station He indicated the silent form of the old man You keep telling me I murdered him Why don t you arrest me then Why don t you lock me up Why don t you put the case on a reasonable basis He waited trembling The flame continued to flicker but the hand holding the candlestick failed to move and Bobby knew that the eyes didn t waver either He forced his glance from the searching flame He managed to lower and steady his voice You can t That s the trouble He wasn t murdered The coroner will tell you so Anybody who looks at him will tell you so Since you haven t the nerve to arrest me I m going I m glad to have had this out with you Understand I m my own master I do what I please I go where I please At last the candle moved to one side The detective straightened and walked to Bobby The multitude of small lines in his face twitched His voice was too cold for the fury of his words That s just what I want you to do damn you anything you please I m accusing nobody but I m getting somebody I ve got somebody right now for this old man s murder My man s going to writhe and burn in the chair confession or no confession Now get out of this room since you re so anxious and don t come near it again Bobby went At the end of the corridor he heard the closing of the door the scraping of the key He was afraid the detective might follow him to his room to heckle him further To avoid that he hurried to the lower floor He wanted to be alone He must have time to accustom himself to this degrading fate which loomed in the too close future Unless they could demolish the detective s theory he Bobby Blackburn would go to the death house A fire blazed in the big hall fireplace Paredes stood with his back to it smoking and warming his hands A man sat in the shadow of a deep leather chair his rough unpolished boots stretched toward the flaming logs As he came down the stairs Bobby heard the heavy rumbling voice of the man in the chair Certainly it s a queer case but not the way Howells means I daresay the old fool died what the world will call a natural death If you smoke so much you will too before long Bobby tried to slip past but Paredes saw him Feeling better Bobby The boots were drawn in From the depths of the chair arose a figure nearly gigantic in the firelight The man s face at first glance appeared to be covered with hair Black and curling it straggled over his forehead It circled his mouth and fell in an unkempt beard down his waistcoat The huge man must have been as old as Silas Blackburn but he showed no touch of gray His only concession to age was the sunken and bloodshot appearance of his eyes Bobby and Katherine had always been afraid of this great grim country practitioner who had attended their childish illnesses That sense of an overpowering and incomprehensible personality had lingered Even through his graver fear Bobby felt a sharp discomfort as he surrendered his hand to the other s absorbing grasp I m afraid you came too late this time Doctor Groom The doctor looked him up and down Not for you I guess he grumbled Don t you know you re sick boy Bobby shook his head I m very tired That s all I m on my way to the library to try to rest He freed his hand The big man nodded approvingly I ll send you a dose he promised and don t you worry about your grandfather s having been murdered by any man I ve seen the body Stuff and nonsense Detective s an ass Waiting for coroner although I know he s one too I pray Bobby answered listlessly that you re right If there s any little thing I can do Paredes offered formally No no

none	none	Bobby answered He went on to the library He glanced with an unpleasant shrinking from the door of the enclosed staircase leading to the private hall just outside the room in which his grandfather lay dead There was no fire here but he wrapped himself in a rug and lay on the broad high backed lounge which was drawn close to the fireplace facing it His complete weariness conquered his premonitions his feeling of helplessness The entrance of Jenkins barely aroused him Where are you mister Robert Here Bobby answered sleepily The butler walked to the lounge and looked over the back To be sure sir I didn t see you here He held out a glass Doctor Groom said you were to drink this It would make you sleep sir Bobby closed his eyes again Put it on the table where I can reach it when I want it Yes sir mister Robert The policeman Did he say anything if I might make so bold as to ask Go away Bobby groaned Leave me in peace And peace for a little time came to him It was the sound of voices in the room that aroused him He lay for a time scarcely knowing where he was but little by little the sickening truth came back and he realized that it was Graham and the detective Howells who talked close to the window and Graham had already fulfilled his promise Bobby didn t want to eavesdrop but it was patent he would embarrass Graham by disclosing himself now and it was likely Graham would be glad of a witness to anything the detective might say It was still light A ray from the low sun entered the window and rested on the door of the enclosed staircase Graham s anxious demand was the first thing Bobby heard distinctly the thing that warned him to remain secreted I think now with the coroner on his way it s time you defined your suspicions a trifle more clearly I am a lawyer In a sense I represent young mister Blackburn Please tell me why you are so sure his grandfather was murdered All right the detective s level voice came back Half an hour ago I would have said no again but now I ve got the evidence I wanted I appreciate mister Graham that you re a friend of that young rascal and what I have to say isn t pleasant for a friend to hear But first you want to know why I m so sure the case is murder in spite of the doctor who made his diagnosis without really looking Go on Graham said softly Bobby waited his nerves as tense as they had grown in the presence of the dead man Two days ago the detective went on quietly old mister Blackburn came to the court house in Smithtown and asked for the best detective the district attorney could put his hand on I don t want to blow my own trumpet but I ve got away with one or two pretty fair jobs I ve had good offers from private firms in New York So they turned him over to me It was easy to see the old man was scared just as his niece says he was last night The funny part was he wouldn t say definitely what he was afraid of I thought he might be shielding somebody until he was a little surer of his ground He told me he was afraid of being murdered and he wanted a good man he could call on to come out here to the Cedars if things got too hot for him I can hear his voice now as distinctly as if he was standing where you are My heart s all right he said It won t stop awhile yet unless it s made to So if I m found cold some fine morning you can be sure I was put out of the way I tried to pump him naturally but he wouldn t say another word except that he d send for me if there was time He didn t want any fuss made and he gave me a handsome present to keep my mouth shut and not to bother him with any more questions I figured you can t blame me mister Graham that the old boy was a little cracked So I took his money and let it go at that I didn t think much more about it until they told me early this morning he lay dead here under peculiar circumstances Odd Graham commented It does make it more like murder Howells But he doesn t look like a murdered man When you know as much about crime as I do mister Graham you ll realize that murders which are a long time planning are likely to take on one of two appearances suicide or natural death All right Graham said For the purpose of argument let us agree it s murder Even so why do you suspect young Blackburn Without a scrap of evidence it s plain as the nose on your face the detective answered If old Blackburn had lived until this morning our young man would have been a pauper As it is he s a millionaire but I don t think he ll enjoy his money The two had been at sword s points for a long time Robert hated the old man never made any bones about it You couldn t ask for a more damaging motive You can t convict a man on motive Graham said shortly You spoke of evidence More the detective replied than any jury in the land would ask Bobby held his breath shrinking from this information which however he realized it was better he should know When I got here the detective said I decided on the theory of murder to make a careful search as soon as day broke I didn t have to wait for day though to find one crying piece of evidence For a long time I was alone in the room with the body Queer feeling about that room mister Graham Don t know how to describe it except to say it s uncomfortable Too old maybe Maybe it was just being there alone with the dead man before the dawn although I thought I was hardened to that sort of thing Anyway I didn t like it To keep my spirits up as well as to save time I commenced searching the place with a candle Nothing about the bed Nothing in the closets or the bureau He grinned sheepishly You know I kind of was afraid to open the closet doors Then I got on my knees and looked under the bed The light was bad and I didn t see anything at first After a minute close against the wall I noticed something white I reached in and pulled it out It was a handkerchief and it had a monogram mister Graham R B in purple and green He paused Graham exclaimed sharply Bobby felt the net tighten If that evidence was conclusive to the others how much more so was it for him He recalled how after awaking in the empty house he had searched unsuccessfully in all his pockets for his handkerchief intending to brush the dirt from his shoes I went to his room the detective hurried on and found a lot of his clothes and his stationery and his toilet articles marked with the same cipher I knew my man had made a big mistake the sort of mistake every criminal makes no matter how clever he is and I had him But that isn t by any means all Don t look so distressed mister Graham There isn t the slightest chance for him You see I repaired the lock and as soon as it was day closed the room and went outside to look for signs Since nightfall no one had come legitimately through the court except Doctor Groom and myself Our footprints were all right making a straight line along the path to the front door In the soft earth by the fountain I found another and a smaller print made by a very neat shoe sir and I said to myself There is almost certainly the footprint of the murderer There were plenty of others coming across the grass He d evidently avoided the path And there was one directly under the open window where the body lies It s still there Perhaps you can see it No matter That s the last one I found The prints ceased there There wasn t a one going back and I was fair up a stump Then I saw a little undefined sign of pressure on the grass and I got an idea Suppose I says my man took his shoes off and went around in his stockinged feet I couldn t understand though why he hadn t thought of that before I went back to Robert Blackburn s room and got one of his shoes and ran into a snag again The sole of the shoe was a trifle larger than the footprints Every one of his shoes I tried was the same way I argued that the handkerchief was enough but I wanted this other evidence I simply had to clear up these queer footprints I figured since the murder had been made to look so much like a natural death that he d come out here some time to day expecting to carry it off I wanted to go to the station anyway to find out if he d been seen coming through last night or early this morning While I was talking to the station agent I had my one piece of luck I couldn t believe my eyes mister Robert walks up from the woods He d been hiding around the neighbourhood all the time Probably had missed his handkerchief and decided he d better not take any chances Yet it must have seemed a pretty sure thing that the station wouldn t be watched and it s those nervy things doing the obvious that skilful criminals get away with all the time I needed only one look at him and I had the answer to the mystery of the footprints I gave him plenty of time to come here and change his clothes then I manoeuvered him out of his room and went there and found the pumps he d worn last night and to day You see they d be a little smaller than his ordinary shoes Not only did they fit the footprints exactly but they were stained with soil exactly like that in the court There you are sir I ve made a plaster cast of one of the prints I ve got it here in my pocket where I intend to keep it until I clear the whole case up and turn in my report Graham s tone was shocked and discouraged What more do you want Why haven t you arrested him In this room the detective s satisfied chuckle was an offence No good detective would ask that mister Graham I want my report clean The coroner will tell us how the old man was killed I want to tell how young Blackburn got into that room One of the windows was raised a trifle but that s no use I ve figured on the outside of the wing until I m dizzy There s no way up for a normal man An orangoutang would make hard work of it His latch key would have let him into the house and it would have been simple enough for him to find out that the old man had changed his room I ve got to find out how he got past those doors locked on the inside He chuckled again Almost like a sleep walker s work Bobby shivered Was that where the evidence pointed Already the net was too finely woven The detective continued earnestly I m figuring on some scheme to make him show me the way I ve a sort of plan for to night but it s only a chance What Graham asked Oh no sir Howells laughed You ll learn about that when the time comes I don t understand you Graham said You re sure of your man but you keep no close watch on him Do you know where he is now Haven t the slightest idea mister Graham What s to prevent his running away I m offering him every opportunity He wouldn t get far and I ve a feeling that if he confessed by running he d break down and give up the whole thing You ve no idea how it frets me mister Graham I ve got my man practically in the chair but from a professional point of view it isn t a pretty piece of work until I find out how he got in and out of that room The thing seems impossible and yet here we are knowing that he did it Well maybe I ll find out to night Hello The door opened Bobby from his hiding place could see Paredes on the threshold yawning and holding a cigarette in his fingers Here you are he said drowsily I ve just been in the court It made me seek company That court s too damp mister Detective His laugh was lackadaisical When the sun leaves it the court seems full of unfriendly things what the ignorant would call ghosts I m Spanish and I know The detective grunted Funny Paredes went on Observation doesn t seem to interest you I d rather fancied it might He yawned again and put his cigarette to his lips Puffing placidly he turned and left What do you suppose he means by that the detective said to Graham Without waiting for an answer he followed Paredes from the room Graham went after him Bobby threw back the rug and arose For a moment he was as curious as the others as to Paredes s intention He slipped across the dining room The hall was deserted The front door stood open From the court came Paredes s voice even languid wholly without expression Mean to tell me you don t react to the proximity of unaccountable forces here mister Howells The detective s laugh was disagreeable You trying to make a fool of me That isn t healthy As Bobby hurried across the hall and up the stairs he heard Paredes answer You should speak to Doctor Groom He says this place is too crowded by the unpleasant past Bobby climbed out of hearing He entered his bedroom and locked the door He resented Paredes s words and attitude which he defined as studied to draw humour out of a tragic and desperate situation He thought of them in no other way His tired mind dismissed them He threw himself on the bed muttering If I run away I m done for If I stay I m done for He took a fierce twisted joy in one phase of the situation If I was there last night he thought Howells will never find out how I got into the room because no matter what trap he sets I can t tell him His leaden weariness closed his eyes For a few minutes he slept again Once more it was a voice that awakened him this time a woman s raised in a scream He sprang up flung open the door and stumbled into the corridor Katherine stood there holding her dressing gown about her with trembling hands The face she turned to Bobby was white and panic stricken She beckoned and he followed her to the main hall The others came tearing up the stairs Graham Paredes the detective and the black and gigantic doctor In answer to their quick questions she whispered breathlessly I heard It was just like last night It came across the court and stole in at my window She shook She stretched out her hands in a terrified appeal Somebody something moved in that room where he he s dead Nonsense the detective said Both doors are locked and I have the keys in my pocket Paredes fumbled with a cigarette You re forgetting what I said about my sensitive apprehension of strange things The detective interrupted him loudly confidently I tell you the room is empty except for the murdered man unless someone s broken down a door Katherine cried out No I heard that same stirring Something moved in there The detective turned brusquely and entered the old corridor We ll see The others followed Katherine was close to Bobby He touched her hand He s right Katherine No one s there No one could have been there You mustn t give way like this I m depending on you on your faith She pressed his hand but her assurance didn t diminish The key scraped in the lock They crowded through the doorway after the detective He struck a match and lighted the candle He held it over the bed He sprang back with a sharp cry unlike his level quality his confident conceit He pointed They all approximated his helpless gesture his blank amazement For on the bed had occurred an abominable change The body of Silas Blackburn no longer lay peacefully on its back It had been turned on its side and remained in a stark and awkward attitude For the first time the back of the head was disclosed Their glances focussed there on the tiny round hole at the base of the brain on the pillow where the head had rested and which they saw now was stained with an ugly and irregular splotch of blood Bobby saw the candle quiver at last in the detective s hand The man strode to the door leading to the private hall and examined the lock Both doors he said were locked There was no way in He turned to the others spreading his hands in justification The candle which he seemed to have forgotten cast gross moving shadows over his face and over the face of the dead man At least you ll all grant me now that he was murdered They continued to stare at the body of Silas Blackburn Cold for many hours it was as if he had made this atrocious revealing movement to assure them that he had indeed been murdered to expose to their startled eyes the sly and deadly method CHAPTER III HOWELLS DELIVERS HIMSELF TO THE ABANDONED ROOM For a long time no one spoke The body of Silas Blackburn had been alone in a locked room yet before their eyes it lay turned on its side as if to inform them of the fashion of this murder The tiny hole at the base of the brain the blood stain on the pillow which the head had concealed offered their mute and ghastly testimony Doctor Groom was the first to relax He raised his great hairy hand to the bed post and grasped it His rumbling voice lacked its usual authority It vibrated with a childish wonder I m reminded that it isn t the first time there s been blood from a man s head on that pillow Katherine nodded What do you mean the detective snarled There s only one answer to this There must have been a mechanical post mortem reaction For a moment Doctor Groom s laugh filled the old room It ceased abruptly He shook his head Don t be a fool mister Policeman At the most conservative estimate this man has been dead more than thirteen hours Even a few instants after death the human body is incapable of any such reaction What then the detective asked Some one of us or one of the servants must have overcome the locks again and deliberately disturbed the body That must be so but I don t get the motive It isn t so Doctor Groom answered bluntly Already the detective had to a large extent controlled his bewilderment I d like your theory then he said dryly You and mister Paredes have both been gossiping about the supernatural When you first came you hinted dark things You said he d probably died what the world would call a natural death I meant the doctor answered only that mister Blackburn s heart might have failed under the impulse of a sudden fright in this room I also said you remember that the room was nasty and unhealthy Plenty of people have remarked it before me Graham touched the detective s arm A little while ago you admitted yourself that the room was uncomfortable Doctor Groom smiled The detective faced him with a fierce belligerency You ll agree he was murdered Certainly if you wish to call it that But I ask for the sharp instrument that caused death I want to know how while Blackburn lay on his back it was inserted through the bed the springs the mattress and the pillow

none	none	Doctor Groom pointed to the dead man I merely repeat that it isn t the first time that pillow s been stained from unusual wounds in the head Being as you call it a trifle superstitious I merely ask if the coincidence is significant Katherine cried out Bobby in spite of his knowledge that sooner or later he would be arrested for his grandfather s murder stepped forward nodding I know what you mean doctor Anybody the doctor said who s ever heard of this house knows what I mean We needn t talk of that The detective however was insistent Paredes in his unemotional way expressed an equal curiosity Bobby and Katherine had been frightened as children by the stories clustering about the old wing They nodded from time to time while the doctor held them in the desolate room with the dead man speaking of the other deaths it had sheltered Silas Blackburn s great grandfather he told the detective had been carried to that bed from a Revolutionary skirmish with a bullet at the base of his brain For many hours he had raved deliriously fighting unsuccessfully against the final silence It has been a legend in the family as these young people will tell you that Blackburns die hard and there are those who believe that people who die hard leave something behind them something that clings to the physical surroundings of their suffering If it was only that one case But it goes on and on Silas Blackburn s father for instance killed himself here He had lost his money in silly speculations He stood where you stand detective and blew his brains out He fell over and lay where his son lies his head on that pillow Silas Blackburn was a money grubber He started with nothing but this property and he made a fortune but even he had enough imagination to lock this room up after one more death of that kind It was this girl s father You were too young Katherine to remember it but I took care of him I saw it He was carried here after he had been struck at the back of the head in a polo match He died too fighting hard God How the man suffered He loosened his bandages toward the end When I got here the pillow was redder than it is to day It strikes me as curious that the first time the room has been slept in since then it should harbour a death behind locked doors from a wound in the head Paredes s fingers were restless as if he missed his customary cigarette The detective strolled to the window Very interesting he said Extremely interesting for old women and young children You may classify yourself doctor Thanks the doctor rumbled I ll wait until you ve told me how these doors were entered how that wound was made how this body turned on its side in an empty room The detective glanced at Bobby His voice lacked confidence I ll do my best I ll even try to tell you why the murderer came back this afternoon to disturb his victim Bobby went curiously convinced that the doctor had had the better of the argument For a moment Katherine Graham Paredes and he were alone in the main hall God knows what it was Graham said but it may mean something to you Bobby Tell us carefully Katherine about the sounds that came to you across the court It was just what I heard last night when he died she answered It was like something falling softly then a long drawn sigh I tried to pay no attention I fought it I didn t call at first But I couldn t keep quiet I knew we had to go to that room It never occurred to me that the detective or the coroner might be there moving around You were alone up here Graham said I think so No Bobby said I was in my room What were you doing Graham asked I was asleep Katherine s call woke me up Asleep Paredes echoed And she didn t call at once He broke off Bobby grasped his arm What are you trying to do I m sorry Paredes said Now really you mustn t think of that I shouldn t have spoken I m more inclined to agree with the doctor s theory impossible as it seems Yesterday Katherine said I would have thought it impossible After last night and just now I m not so sure I I wish the doctor were right It would clear you Bobby He smiled Do you think any jury would listen to such a theory Katherine put her finger to her lips Howells and the doctor came from the corridor of the old wing At the head of the stairs the detective turned You will find it very warm and comfortable by the fire in the lower hall mister Blackburn He waited until Katherine had slipped to her room until Graham Paredes the doctor and Bobby were on the stairs Then he walked slowly into the new corridor Bobby knew what he was after The detective had made no effort to disguise his intention He wanted Bobby out of the way while he searched his room again this time for a sharp slender instrument capable of penetrating between the bones at the base of a man s brain Paredes lighted a cigarette and warmed his back at the fire The doctor settled himself in his chair He paid no attention to the others He wouldn t answer Paredes s slow remarks Interesting doctor I am a little psychic Always in this house I have responded to strange unfriendly influences Always as now the approach of night depresses me Bobby couldn t sit still He nodded at Graham arose got his coat and hat and stepped into the court The dusk was already thick there Dampness and melancholy seemed to exude from the walls of the old house He paused and gazed at one of the foot prints in the soft earth by the fountain Shreds of plaster adhered to the edges testimony that the detective had made his cast from this print He tried to realize that that mute familiar impression had the power to send him to his execution Graham who had come silently from the house startled him What are you looking at No use Hartley I was on the library lounge I heard every word Howells said Perhaps it s just as well Graham said You know what you face But I hate to see you suffer We ve got to find a way around that evidence Bobby pointed to the windows of the room of death There s no way around except the doctor s theory He laughed shortly Much as I ve feared that room I m afraid the psychic explanation won t hold water Paredes put his finger on it I would have had time to get back to my room before Katherine called Stop Bobby Hartley I m afraid to go to sleep It s dreadful not to know whether you are active in your sleep whether you are evil and ingenious to the point of the miraculous in your sleep I m so tired Hartley Why should you have gone to that room this afternoon Graham asked You must get this idea out of your head You must have sleep and perhaps when you re thoroughly rested you will remember I m not so sure Bobby said that I want to remember He pointed to the footprint There s no question I was here last night Unless Graham said your handkerchief and your shoes were stolen Nonsense Bobby cried The only motive would be to commit a murder in order to kill me by sending me to the chair And who would know his way around that dark house like me Who would have found out so easily that my grandfather had changed his room It s logical Graham admitted slowly but we can t give in By the way has Paredes ever borrowed any large sums Bobby hesitated After all Paredes and he had been good friends A little here and there he answered reluctantly Has he ever paid you back I don t recall Bobby answered flushing You know I ve never been exactly calculating about money Whenever he wanted it I was always glad to help Carlos out Why do you ask If any one Graham answered looked on you as a certain source of money there would be a motive in conserving that source in increasing it Probably lots of people knew mister Blackburn was out of patience with you would make a new will to day Do you think Bobby asked that Carlos is clever enough to have got through those doors And what about this afternoon that ghastly disturbing of the body He smiled wanly It looks like me or the ghosts of my ancestors If Paredes Graham insisted tries to borrow any money from you now tell me about it Another thing Bobby We can t afford to keep your experiences of last night a secret any longer He stepped to the door and asked Doctor Groom to come out He won t be likely to pass your confidences on to Howells he said Those men are natural antagonists After a moment the doctor appeared a slouch hat drawn low over his shaggy forehead What you want he grumbled This court s a first class place to catch cold Dampest hole in the neighbourhood Often wondered why I want to ask you Graham began something about the effects of such drugs as could be given in wine Tell him will you Bobby what happened last night Bobby vanquished the discomfort with which the gruff opinionated physician had always filled him He recited the story of last night s dinner of his experience in the cafe of his few blurred impressions of the swaying vehicle and the woods Hartley thinks something may have been put in my wine What for the doctor asked What had these people to gain by drugging you Suppose for some far fetched reason they wanted to have Silas Blackburn put out of the way They couldn t make you do it by drugging you At any rate they couldn t have had a hand in this afternoon Mind I m not saying you had a thing to do with it yourself but I don t believe you were drugged Any drug likely to be used in wine would probably have sent you into a deep sleep And your symptoms on waking up are scarcely sharp enough Sorry boy Sounds more like aphasia The path you ve been treading sometimes leads to that black country and it s there that hates sharpen unknown I remember a case where a tramp returned and killed a farmer who had refused him food Retained no recollection of the crime hours dropped out of his life They executed him while he still tried to remember I read something about the case Bobby muttered Been better if you hadn t the doctor grumbled Suggestions work in a man s brain without his knowing it He thought for a moment his heavy black brows coming closer together He glanced at the windows of the old room His sunken infused eyes nearly closed I know how you feel and that s a little punishment maybe you deserve I ll say this for your comfort You probably followed the plan that had been impressed on your brain by mister Graham You came here no doubt and stood around With an automatic appreciation of your condition you may have taken that old precaution of convivial men returning home and removed your shoes Then your automatic judgment may have warned you that you weren t fit to go in at all and you probably wandered off to the empty house Then Bobby asked you don t think I did it God knows who did it God knows what did it The longer I live the surer I become that we scientists can t probe everything Whenever I go near Silas Blackburn s body I receive a very powerful impression that his death in that room from such a wound goes deeper than ordinary murder deeper than a case of recurrent aphasia His eyes widened He turned with Graham and Bobby at the sound of an automobile coming through the woods Probably the coroner at last he said The automobile a small runabout drew up at the entrance to the court A little wizened man with yellowish skin stretched across high cheek bones stepped out and walked up the path Well he said shrilly What you doing Doctor Groom Waiting to witness another reason why coroners should be abolished the doctor rumbled This is the dead man s grandson Coroner and mister Graham a friend of the family s Bobby accepted the coroner s hand with distaste Howells the coroner said in his squeaky voice seems to think it s a queer case Inconvenient I call it Wish people wouldn t die queerly whenever I go on a little holiday I had got five ducks gentlemen when they came to me with that damned telegram Bad business mine cause people will die when you least expect them to Let s go see what Howells has got on his mind Bright sleuth Howells Ought to be in New York He started up the path side by side with Doctor Groom Are you coming Graham asked Bobby Bobby shook his head I don t want to I d rather stay outside You d better be there Hartley Graham followed the others while Bobby wandered from the court and started down a path that entered the woods from the rear of the house Immediately the forest closed greedily about him Here and there where the trees were particularly stunted branches cut against a pallid greenish glow in the west the last light Bobby wanted if he could to find that portion of the woods where he had stood last night fancying the trees straining in the wind like puny men visualizing a dim figure in a black mask which he had called his conscience The forest was all of a pattern ugly unfriendly melancholy He went on however hoping to glimpse that particular picture he remembered He left the path walking at haphazard among the undergrowth Ahead he saw a placid flat and faintly luminous stretch He pushed through the bushes and paused on the shore of a lake small and stagnant Dead stripped trunks of trees protruded from the water At the end a bird arose with a sudden flapping of wings it cried angrily as it soared above the trees and disappeared to the south The morbid loneliness of the place touched Bobby s spirit with chill hands As a child he had never cared to play about the stagnant lake nor he recalled had the boys of the village fished or bathed there Certainly he hadn t glimpsed it last night He was about to walk away when a movement on the farther bank held him made him gaze with eager eyes across the sleepy water He thought there was something black in the black shadows of the trees a thing that stirred through the heavy dusk without sound He received moreover an impression of anger and haste as distinct as the bird had projected But he could see nothing clearly in this bad light He couldn t be sure that there was any one over there He started around the end of the lake and for a moment he thought that the shape of a woman clothed in black detached itself from the shadow The image dissolved He wondered if it had been more substantial than fancy Who is that he called The woods muffled his voice There was no answer Nor was there he noticed any crackling of twigs or rustling of dead leaves If there had been a woman there she had fled noiselessly yet as he went on around the lake his own progress was distinctly audible through the decay of autumn It was too dark on the other side to detect any traces of a recent human presence in the thicket He couldn t quiet however the feeling that he had had a glimpse of a woman clothed in black who had studied him secretly across the stagnant stretch of the lake On the other hand there was no logic in a woman s presence here at such an hour no logic in a stranger s running away from him While he pondered the night invaded the forest completely making it impossible for him to search farther It had grown so dark indeed that he found his way out with difficulty The branches caught at his clothing The underbrush tangled itself about his feet It was as if the thicket were trying to hold him away from the house As he entered the court he noticed a discoloured glow diffusing itself through the curtains of the room of death He opened the front door Paredes and Graham alone sat by the fire Then they re not through yet Bobby said Graham arose He commenced to pace the length of the hall They ve had Katherine in that room One would think she d been through enough Now they ve sent for the servants Paredes laughed lightly After this he said I m afraid Bobby you ll need the powers of the police to keep servants in your house Muttering frightened voices came from the dining room Jenkins entered and shaking his head went up the stairs The two women who followed him were in tears They paused as if seeking an excuse to linger on the lower floor to postpone as long as possible their entrance of the room of death Ella a pretty girl whose dark hair and eyes suggested a normal vivacity spoke to Bobby It s outrageous mister Robert He found out all we knew this morning What s he after now You might think we d murdered mister Blackburn Jane was older An ugly scar crossed her cheek It was red and like an open wound as she demanded that Bobby put a stop to these inquisitions I can do nothing he said Go on up and answer or they can make trouble for you Muttering again to each other they followed Jenkins and in the lower hall the three men waited Jenkins came down first His face was white It twitched The body he mouthed It s moved I saw it before He stretched out his hands to Bobby That s why they wanted us to find out where we were this afternoon and everything we ve done as if we might have gone there and disturbed Angry voices in the upper hall interrupted him The two women ran down as white as Jenkins At an impatient nod from Bobby the three servants went on to the kitchen Howells the coroner and Doctor Groom descended What ails you Doctor the coroner was squeaking I agree it s an unpleasant room Lots of old rooms are I follow you when you say no post mortem contraction would have caused such an alteration in the position of the body There s no question about the rest of it The man was clearly murdered with a sharp tool of some sort and the murderer was in the room again this afternoon and disturbed the corpse Howells says he knows who It s up to him to find out how He says he has plenty of evidence and that the guilty person s in this house so I m not fretting myself I m cross with you Howells for breaking up my holiday One of my assistants would have done as well Howells apparently paid no attention to the coroner His narrow eyes followed the doctor with a growing curiosity His level smile seemed to have drawn his lips into a line inflexible a little cruel The doctor grunted Instead of abolishing coroners we ought to double their salaries The coroner made a long squeak as an indication of mirth You think unfriendly spooks did it I ve always believed you were an old fogy Hanged if that doesn t sound modern The doctor ran his fingers through his thick untidy hair I merely ask for the implement that caused death I only ask to know how it was inserted through the bed while Blackburn lay on his back And if you ve time you might tell me how the murderer entered the room last night and to day The coroner repeated his squeak He glanced at the little group by the fire Out in the kitchen upstairs or right here under our noses is almost certainly the person who could tell us Interesting case Howells Howells who still watched the doctor answered dryly Unusually interesting The coroner struggled into his coat Permits are all available he squeaked Have your undertakers out when you like Graham answered him brusquely Everything s arranged I ve only to telephone The coroner nodded at Doctor Groom His voice pointed its humour with a thinner tone If I were you Howells I d take this hairy old theorist up as a suspicious character The doctor made a movement in his direction while Howells continued to stare The doctor checked himself He went to the closet and got his hat and coat Want me to drop you old sawbones the coroner asked Savagely the doctor shook his head My buggy s in the stable The coroner s squeak was thinner more irritating than ever Then don t let the spooks get you driving through the woods Old folks say there are a plenty there Bobby arose He couldn t face the prospect of the man s squeaking again We find nothing to laugh at in this situation he said You re quite through The coroner s eyes blazed I m through if that s the way you feel Goodnight He added with a sharp maliciousness I leave my sympathy for whoever Howells has his eagle eye on Howells when the doctor and the coroner had gone excused himself with a humility that mocked the others With your permission I shall write in the library until dinner He bowed and left He wants to work on his report Graham suggested An exceptional man Paredes murmured Has he questioned you Graham asked I d scarcely call it that Paredes replied We ve both questioned and we ve both been clams I fancy he doesn t think much of me since I believe in ghosts yet the doctor seems to interest him Where were you Graham asked when Miss Perrine s scream called us Paredes stifled a yawn Dozing here by the fire I am very tired after last night You don t look particularly tired Custom I m ashamed to say constructs a certain armour To morrow with a fresh mind I hope to be able to dissect all I have seen and heard all that has happened here to day The thing that counts is what happened to me last night Carlos Bobby said It s the only way you can help me As Paredes strolled to the foot of the stairs Bobby waited for a defensive reply for a sign perhaps that the Panamanian was offended and proposed to depart Paredes however went upstairs yawning He called back I must make myself a trifle more presentable for dinner Graham faced Bobby with the old question What can he want hanging around here unless it s money And after a moment He s clever hard to sound I have to leave you Bobby I must telephone the ugly formalities It s good of you to take them off my mind Bobby answered He remained in his chair gazing drowsily at the fire trying always trying to remember yet finding no new light among the shadows of his memory Just before dinner Katherine joined him She wore a sombre gown that made her face seem too white that heightened the groping curiosity of her eyes Without speaking she sat down beside him and stared too at the smouldering fire From her presence from her tactful silence he drew comfort to an extent rest You make me ashamed he whispered once I ve been a beast leaving you here alone these weeks You don t understand quite why that was She wouldn t let him go on She shook her head They remained silently by the fire until Graham and Paredes joined them When dinner was announced the detective came from the library and uninvited sat at the table with them His report evidently still filled his mind for he spoke only when it was unavoidable and then in monosyllables Paredes alone ate with a show of enjoyment alone attempted to talk Eventually even he fell silent before the lack of response Afterward he arranged a small card table by the fire in the hall He found cards and with a package of cigarettes and a box of matches convenient to his hand commenced to play solitaire The detective Bobby gathered had brought his report up to date for he lounged near by watching the Panamanian s slender fingers as they handled the cards deftly Bobby Graham and Katherine were glad to withdraw beyond the range of those narrow searching eyes They entered the library and closed the door Graham expectant of a report from his man in New York as to the movements of Maria and the identity of the stranger was restless If we could only get one fact he said one reasonable clue that didn t involve Bobby I ve never felt so at sea I wonder if in spite of Howells s evidence we re not all a little afraid since this afternoon of something such as Katherine felt last night something we can t define Howells alone is satisfied We must believe in the hand of another man Doctor Groom talks about indefinable hands Uncle Silas was so afraid last night Katherine whispered That Bobby cried is the fact we must have He paused What s that he asked sharply They sat for some time listening to the sound of wheels on the gravel to the banging of the front door and later to the pacing of men in the room of death overhead They tried again to thread the mazes of this problem whose only conceivable exit led to Bobby s guilt The movements upstairs persisted At last they became measured and dragging like the footsteps of men who carried some heavy burden They looked at each other then Katherine hid her eyes It s like a tomb here Bobby said He arranged kindling in the fireplace and touched a match to it It hadn t occurred to him to ring for Jenkins None of them wished to be disturbed Eventually it was the detective who intruded He strolled in glanced at them curiously for a moment then walked to the door of the enclosed staircase He grasped the knob To night he announced I am trying a small experiment on the chance of clearing up the last details of the mystery Since it depends on the courage of whoever murdered mister Blackburn I ve small hope of its success He indicated the ceiling You ve heard I daresay what s been going on up there mister Blackburn s body has been removed to his own room The room where he was killed is empty I mean to go up and enter and lock the doors as he did last night I shall leave the window up as it was last night I shall blow out the candle as he did He lowered his voice He looked directly at Bobby His words carried a definite challenge I shall lie on the bed and await the murderer under the precise conditions mister Blackburn did What do you expect to gain by that Graham asked Probably nothing Howells answered because as I have said success depends upon the courage of a man who kills in the dark while his victim sleeps I simply give him the chance to attack me as he did mister Blackburn Of course he realizes it would be a good deal to his advantage to have me out of the way I ask him to come therefore as stealthily as he did last night I beg him to match his skill with mine I want him to play his miracle with the window or one of the locks But I ll wager he hasn t the nerve although I don t see why he should hesitate He s a doomed man I shall make my arrest in the morning I shall publish all my evidence Bobby wouldn t meet the narrow menacing eyes for he knew that Howells challenged him to a duel of slyness with the whole truth at stake The detective s manner increased the hatred which had blazed in Bobby s mind when he had stood in the bedroom over his grandfather s body For a moment he wished with all his heart that he might accept the challenge He did the best he could I gather he said that you haven t unearthed the motive for disturbing the body And have you found the sharp instrument that caused death The detective answered tolerantly I have found a number of sharp instruments None of them however seems quite slender or round enough I ll get all that out of my man when I lock him up I ll get it to night if he dares come Why Graham said do you announce your plans so accurately to us The detective s level smile widened You shouldn t ask that mister Graham I ve caused the servants to know my plans mister Paredes knows them I wish every one in the house to know them That is in order that the murderer who is in the house may come if he wishes Katherine arose abruptly When you come down to it she said you are accusing one of us It s brutal unfair absurd I am a detective Miss Howells answered I have my own methods Bobby stared at the slight protuberance in the breast pocket of the detective s coat The cast of his footprint must be secreted there and almost certainly the handkerchief which had been found beneath the bed He shrank from his own thoughts If he had consciously committed this murder he could understand a desire to get that evidence Katherine had gone closer to the detective In any case she urged him I wish you wouldn t try to spend the night in that room It isn t pleasant After what the doctor has said it well it isn t safe Howells burst out laughing Never fear Miss I m content to give Doctor Groom s spirits as much chance to take a fall out of me as anybody I ll be going up now He bowed Good night to you all and pleasant dreams He opened the door and slipped into the darkness of the private staircase They heard him after he had closed the door climbing upward Katherine shivered He has plenty of courage Hartley If nothing happens to him to night he ll finish Bobby in the morning That mustn t happen He mustn t go to jail You understand Things would never be the same for him again Graham spread his hands What am I to do I might go to New York and get after these people myself Don t leave the Cedars Bobby begged until he does arrest me There ll be plenty of time for the New York end then I ve no faith in it Watch Carlos if you want but most important of all find out somehow you ve got to find out what my grandfather was afraid of Graham nodded And if it does come to an arrest Bobby you re not to say a word to anybody without my advice You ought to get to bed now You must have rest and Katherine too Don t listen to night Katherine for messages from across the court I ll try she said but Hartley I wish that man wasn t there I wish no one was in that room She took Bobby s hand Good night Bobby and don t give up hope We ll do something Somehow we ll pull you through Bobby waited hoping that Graham would offer to share his room with him For as he had said earlier the prospect of going to sleep of losing control of his thoughts and actions appalled him Yet such an offer he realized must impress Graham as delicate as an indication that he really doubted Bobby s innocence as a sort of spying He wasn t surprised therefore when Graham only said I ll be in the next room Bobby If you re restless or need me you ve only to knock on the wall Bobby didn t leave the library with them The warmth with which Katherine had just filled him faded as he watched her go out side by side with Graham Her hand was on Graham s arm There was he fancied in her eyes an emotion deeper than gratitude or friendship He sighed as the door closed behind them He was himself largely to blame for that situation His very revolt against its imminence had hastened its shaping He walked anxiously to the table He had remembered the medicine Doctor Groom had prepared for him that afternoon to make him sleep He hadn t taken it then If it remained where he had left it which was likely enough in the disordered state of the household he would drink it now Reinforced by his complete weariness it ought to send him into a sleep profound enough to drown any possible abnormal impulses of unconsciousness The glass was there He drained it and stood for a time looking at the pinkish sediment in the bottom That was all right for to night but afterward he couldn t shrink perpetually from sleep He shrugged his shoulders remembering it would make little difference what he did in his sleep when they had him behind prison bars Perhaps this would be his last night of freedom He found Paredes still in the hall The Panamanian with languid gestures continued to play his solitaire His box of cigarettes was much reduced

none	none	tired Carlos Paredes glanced up His eyes were neither weary nor alert As usual his expression disclosed nothing of his thoughts yet he must have read in Bobby s tone a reproach at this indifference The game intrigues me he murmured and you know he added dreamily I sometimes think better while I amuse myself Bobby nodded good night and went on up to his room Even while he undressed the effects of the doctor s narcotic were perceptible His eyes had grown heavy his brain a trifle numb Almost apathetically he assured himself that he couldn t accomplish these mad actions in his sleep Yet last night he murmured That finishes me in the eyes of the law The doctor will testify to aphasia According to him I am two men two men He yawned recalling snatches of books he had read and one or two scientific reports of such cases He climbed into bed and blew out his candle His drowsiness thickened In his dulled mind one recollection remained the picture of Howells coldly challenging him with his level smile to make a secret entrance of the old bedroom in a murderous effort to escape the penalty of the earlier crime And Howells had been right His death would give Bobby a chance The destruction of the evidence the bringing into the case of a broader minded man a man without a carefully constructed theory all that would help Bobby might save him Howells moreover had indicated that he had so far withheld his evidence But that was probably a bait In his drowsy way Bobby hated more powerfully than before this detective who with a serene malevolence made him writhe in his net Thought ceased He drifted into a trance like sleep He swung in the black pit again fighting out against crushing odds The darkness thundered as though informing him that graver forces than any he had ever imagined had definitely grasped him Then he understood He was in a black cell and the thundering was the steady advance of men along an iron floor to take him Bobby Bobby He flung out his hands He sat upright opening his eyes The blackness assumed the familiar yielding quality of the night The thunder the footfalls became a hurried knocking at his door Bobby You re there It was Katherine Her tone made the night as frightening as the blackness of the pit What s the matter You re there I didn t know Get up Hartley s putting some clothes on Hurry The house is so dark so strange Tell me what s happened She didn t answer at first He struck a match lighted his candle threw on a dressing gown and stepped to the door Katherine shrank against the wall hiding her eyes from the light of his candle He thought it odd she should wear the dress in which she had appeared at dinner But it seemed indifferently fastened and her hair was in disorder Graham stepped from his room What is it Bobby demanded You wouldn t wake up Bobby You were so hard to wake The idea seemed to fill her mind She repeated it several times It s nothing Graham said Go back to your room Katherine She s fanciful She lowered her hands Her eyes were full of terror No We have to go to that room as I went last night as we went to day Graham tried to quiet her We ll go to satisfy you Her voice hardened I know I was asleep It woke me up stealing in across the court again Bobby grasped her arm You came out and aroused up at once She shook her head I I couldn t find my dressing gown This dress was by the bed I put it on but I couldn t seem to fasten it Bobby stepped back remembering his last thought before drifting into the trance like sleep She seemed to know what was in his mind But when I knocked you were sleeping so soundly Too soundly perhaps Come We re growing imaginative Graham said Howells would take care of himself He ll probably give us the deuce for disturbing him but to satisfy you Katherine we ll wake him up If you can she whispered They entered the main hall Light came through the stair well from the lower floor Graham walked to the rail and glanced down Bobby followed him On the table by the fireplace the cards were arranged in neat piles A strong draft blew cigarette smoke up to them Paredes Graham said amazed is still downstairs The front door s open He s probably in the court It must be very late Bobby said Katherine shivered Half past two I looked at my watch The same time as last night With a gesture of resolution she led the way into the corridor Bobby shrank from the damp and musty atmosphere of the narrow passage Why do you come Katherine he asked I have to know as I had to know last night Graham raised his hand and knocked at the door which again was locked on the inside The echoes chattered back at them Graham knocked again With a passionate revolt Katherine raised her hands too and pounded at the panels Suddenly she gave up She let her hands fall listlessly It s no use Howells Howells Graham called Why don t you answer When he boasted to night Katherine whispered the murderer heard him Suppose he s gone down to the library Graham said Bobby gave Katherine the candle No He d have stayed We ve got to break in here We ve got to find out Graham placed his powerful shoulder against the door The lock strained Bobby added his weight With a splintering of wood the door flew open precipitating them across the threshold Through the darkness Graham sprang for the opposite door It s locked he called and the key s on this side Bobby took the candle from Katherine and forced himself to approach the bed The flame flickered a little in the breeze which stole past the curtain of the open window It shook across the body of Howells fully clothed with his head on the stained pillow His face intricately lined was as peaceful as Silas Blackburn s had been Its level smile persisted Bobby caught his breath Howells He set the candle on the bureau It s no use We must look at the back of his head The back of his head Katherine echoed It s illegal Graham said Look Bobby cried We ve got to look Graham tiptoed forward He stretched out his hand With a motion of abhorrence he drew it back Bobby watched him hypnotically thinking I wanted this I hated him I thought of it just before I went to sleep Graham reached out again This time he touched Howells s head It rolled over on the pillow Good God he said They stared at the red hole near the base of the brain at a fresh crimson splotch straying beyond the edges of the darker one they had seen that afternoon Graham turned away his hand still outstretched as if it had touched some poisonous thing and might retain a contamination He was prepared against it he whispered expected it yet it got him He glanced rapidly around the room whose shadows seemed crowding about the candle to stifle it Unless we re all mad he cried the murderer must be hidden in this room now Don t you see He s got to be or Groom s right and we re fighting the dead Go out Katherine Stand by that broken door Bobby I m going to look CHAPTER IV A STRANGE LIGHT APPEARS AT THE DESERTED HOUSE Graham s intention logical as it was impressed Bobby as quite futile Silas Blackburn had died in this ancient melancholy room behind locked doors This afternoon with a repetition of the sounds that had probably accompanied his death they had been drawn to find that behind locked doors again the position of the body had changed incredibly as if to expose to them the tiny fatal wound at the base of the brain Now for the third time those stealthy movements had aroused Katherine and they had found once more behind locked doors the determined and malicious detective murdered precisely as old Blackburn had been Of course Graham was logical By every rational argument the murderer must still be in the room Yet Bobby foresaw that as always no one would be found that nothing would be unearthed to explain the succession of tragic mysteries While Graham commenced his search indeed he continued to stare at the little round hole in Howells s head at the fresh irregular stain on the pillow and he became absorbed in his own predicament Again and again he asked himself if he could be responsible for these murders which had been committed with an inhuman ingenuity He knew only that he had wandered unconscious in the vicinity of the Cedars last night that he had been asleep when his grandfather s body had altered its position that he had gone to sleep a little while ago too profoundly brooding over Howells s challenge to the murderer to invade the room of death and kill him if he could Howells had been confident that he could handle a man and so solve the riddle of how the room had been entered Certainly Howells s challenge had been accepted and Bobby knew that he had fallen into that deep sleep hating the detective telling himself that the man s death might save him from arrest from conviction from an intolerable walk to a little room with a single chair Recurrent aphasia The doctor s expression came back to him In such a state a man could overcome locked doors could accomplish apparent miracles and retain no recollection And Bobby had hated and feared Howells more than he had his grandfather Dully he saw Katherine go out at Graham s direction As one in a dream he moved toward the door they had had to break down on entering Stand close to it Graham said We ll cover everything You ll find no one Bobby answered with a perfect assurance He saw Graham take the candle and explore the large closets He watched him examine the spaces behind the window curtains He could smile a little as Graham stooped peering beneath the bed as he moved each piece of furniture large enough to secrete a man You see Hartley it s no use Graham s lack of success however stimulated his anger Then he said there must be some hiding place in the walls Such devices are common in houses as old as this Bobby indicated the silent form of the detective He believed I killed my grandfather The only reason he didn t arrest me was his failure to find out how the room had been entered and left Don t you suppose he looked for a hiding place or a secret entrance the first thing It s obvious But Graham s savage determination increased He sounded each panel None gave the slightest revealing response He got a tape from Katherine and measured the dimensions of the room the private hall and the corridor At last he turned to Bobby his anger dead his face white and tired Everything checks he admitted There s no secret room no way in or out Logically Groom s right We re fighting the dead who resent the intrusion of your grandfather and Howells He laughed mirthlessly After all we can t surrender to that There must be another answer From the first Howells was satisfied with me Bobby said Graham flung up his hands Then tell me how you got in without disturbing those locks I grant you Bobby you had sufficient motive for both murders but I don t believe you have two personalities one decent and lovable the other cruel and cunning to the point of magic I don t believe if a man had two such personalities the actions of one would be totally closed to the memory of the other Bobby smiled wanly It isn t pleasant to confess it Hartley but I have read of such cases Fiction Scientific fact I wish to the devil I had shared your room with you to night Graham muttered I might have furnished you an alibi for this affair at least Either that Bobby answered frankly or you might have followed me and learned the whole secret Honestly isn t that what you were thinking of Hartley And I did go to sleep telling myself it would help me if something of the sort happened to Howells Now I m not so sure that it will I I suppose you ve got to notify the police Graham held up his hand What s that In the corridor There were quiet footsteps in the corridor Bobby turned quickly Paredes strolled slowly through the passage a cigarette held in his slender listless fingers Bobby stared at him remembering his surprise a few minutes ago that the Panamanian should have sat up so late should have been probably in the court when they had followed Katherine to the discovery of this new crime Paredes paused in the doorway He took in the tragic picture framed by the sinister room without displaying the slightest interest He continued to hold his cigarette until it expired Then he crossed the threshold Graham and Bobby watched the expressionless face Gracefully Paredes raised his finger and pointed to the bed When he spoke his voice was low and pleasant Appalling I feared something of the kind when I heard you come to this room He glanced at the broken door The same unbelievable circumstance he drawled I see you had to break in The colour flashed back to Graham s face You have taken plenty of time to solve your misgivings It hasn t been so long I fancied everything was all right and I was immersed in my solitaire Then I heard a stirring upstairs As I ve told you the house frightens me It is not natural or healthy So I came up to investigate this stirring and there was Miss Katherine in the hall She told me Graham faced him with undisguised enmity Immersed in your solitaire We were attracted by a light in the lower hall at such an hour We looked down You were not there The front door was open Paredes glanced at his cold cigarette He yawned When Howells died precisely as mister Blackburn did Graham hurried on you alone were awake about the house Weren t you at that moment in the court Paredes laughed tolerantly It is clear in spite of my apologies that we are not friends Graham but may I ask are you accusing me of this strange accident I should like to know what you were doing in the court Perhaps Paredes answered I was attracted there by the sounds that aroused Miss Katherine Graham shook his head From her description I doubt if those sounds would have been audible in the hall No matter Paredes said I merely suggest that it s a case for Groom His hint of a spiritual enmity may be saner than you think Katherine appeared in the doorway She had evidently overheard Paredes s comment for she nodded The determination in her eyes suggested that she had struggled with the situation during these last moments and had reached a definite conclusions That quality was in her voice At least Hartley she said you must send for Doctor Groom before you notify the police Graham waved his hand Why he asked The man is dead With a movement hidden from Paredes she indicated Bobby Last time there was a good deal of delay before the doctor came If we get him right away he may be able to do something for this poor fellow At least his advice would be useful Bobby realized that she was fighting for time for him Any delay would be useful that would give them a chance to plan before the police with unimaginative efficiency should invade the house and limit their opportunities Graham showed that he caught her point Maybe it s better he said Then Bobby telephone Groom to be ready for you and take my runabout It s in the stable You ll get him here much faster than he could come in his carriage While I m gone Bobby asked what will you do Watch this room Graham jerked out See that no one enters or leaves it or touches the body I ll hope for some clue You ve plenty of courage Paredes drawled I shouldn t care to watch alone in this room He followed Katherine into the corridor Bobby looked at Graham You ll take no chances Hartley Graham s smile wasn t pleasant According to you and the dead detective there s no risk while you re out of the house Still I shall be nervous but don t worry Bobby joined the others before they had reached the hall Of course Hartley found nothing Katherine said to him Nothing Paredes answered except a very bad temper Katherine s distaste for the man was no longer veiled You don t like mister Graham she said but he is our friend and he is in this house to help us Paredes bowed I regret that the amusement mister Graham causes me sometimes finds expression He is so earnest so materialistic in his relation to the world That is why he will see nothing psychic in the situation Paredes s easy contempt was like a tonic for Katherine Her fear seemed to drop from her She turned purposefully to Bobby ignoring the Panamanian I shall watch with Hartley she said He was ashamed that jealousy should creep into such a moment but her resolve recalled his amorous discontent The prospect of Graham and her watching alone drawn to each other by their fright and uncertainty by their surroundings by the hour became unbearable It placed him to an extent on Paredes s side It urged him when Paredes had gone on downstairs to spring almost eagerly to his defence As Hartley says Katherine began he makes you think of a snake He must see we dislike and resent him You and Hartley perhaps Bobby said Carlos says he is here to help me I ve no reason to disbelieve him A little colour came into Katherine s face She half stretched out her hand as if in an appeal But the colour faded and her hand dropped We are wasting time she said You had better go I am sorry we disagree about Carlos he commenced She turned deliberately away from him You must hurry she said Hurry He saw her enter the corridor to join Graham The obscurity of the narrow place seemed to hold for him a new menace He walked downstairs slowly While he telephoned instructing a servant to tell the doctor to be dressed and ready in twenty minutes he saw Paredes go to the closet and get his hat and coat I shall keep you company the Panamanian announced Bobby was glad enough to have him He didn t want to be alone He was aware by this time that no amount of thought would persuade useful memories to emerge from the black pit They walked to the stable half gone to ruin like the rest of the estate Bobby started Graham s car The servants quarters he saw were dark Then Jenkins and the two women hadn t been aroused were still ignorant of the new crime As they drove smoothly past the gloomy house they glimpsed through the court the dimly lit windows of the old room that persistently guarded its grim secret Bobby pictured the living as well as the dead there and his mind revolted and he shivered He opened the throttle wider The car sprang forward The divergent glare from the headlights forced back the reluctant thicket Paredes drawled unexpectedly There is nothing as lonely anywhere in the world He stooped behind the windshield and lighted a cigarette At least Bobby he said between puffs the Cedars has taken from you the fear of Howells And after a time staring at the glow of his cigarette he went on softly Have you noticed anything significant about the discovery of each mystery at the Cedars Many things Bobby muttered Think Paredes urged him Bobby answered angrily You ve suggested that to me once to day Carlos You mean that each time I have been asleep or unconscious I mean something quite different Paredes said He hesitated When he continued his drawl was more pronounced Then you haven t remarked that each time it has been Miss Katherine who has made the discovery who has aroused the rest of the house The car swerved sharply Bobby s first impulse had been to take his hands from the wheel to force Paredes to retract his sly insinuation That s the rottenest thing I ve ever known you to do Carlos Take it back Paredes shrugged his shoulders There is nothing to take back I accuse no one I merely call attention to a chain of exceptional coincidences You make me wonder Bobby said if Hartley isn t justified in his dislike of you You ll kill such a ridiculous suspicion Or Paredes drawled Very well It seems my fate recently to offend those I like best I merely thought that any theory leading away from you would be welcome Any theory Bobby answered involving Katherine is unthinkable Paredes smiled I didn t understand exactly how you felt I rather took it for granted that Graham Never mind I take it back Then drop it Bobby answered sullenly sorry that there was nothing else he could say They continued in silence through the deserted forest whose aggressive loneliness made words seem trivial Bobby was asking himself again where he had stood last night when he had glimpsed for a moment the straining trees and the figure in a mask which he had called his conscience If he could only prove that figure substantial Then Graham would have some ground for his suspicion of Paredes and the dancer Maria He glanced at Paredes Could there have been a conspiracy against him in the New York cafe Did Paredes in fact have some devious purpose in remaining at the Cedars The automobile took a sharp curve in the road Bobby started gazing ahead with an interest nearly hypnotic The headlights had caught in their glare the deserted farmhouse in which he had awakened just before Howells had told him of his grandfather s death and practically placed him under arrest In the white light the frame of the house from which the paint had flaked appeared ghastly unreal like a structure seen in a nightmare from which one recoils with morbid horror The light left the building As the car tore past Bobby could barely make out the black mass in the midst of the thicket Paredes had observed it too I daresay he remarked casually the Cedars will become as deserted as that It is just that it should for the entire neighbourhood impresses one as unfriendly to life as striving through death to drive life out Have you ever seen that house before Bobby asked quickly I have never seen it before I do not care ever to see it again It was a relief when the forest thinned and fields stretched flat and pleasant like barriers against the stunted growth Bobby stopped the car in front of one of a group of houses at a crossroads He climbed the steps and rang Doctor Groom opened the door himself His gigantic hairy figure was silhouetted against the light from within What s the matter now he demanded in his gruff voice Fortunately I hadn t gone to bed I was reading some books on psychic manifestations Who s sick Or Bobby s face must have told him a good deal for he broke off Get your things on Bobby said and I will tell you as we drive back for you must come Howells has been killed precisely as my grandfather was For a moment Doctor Groom s bulky frame remained motionless in the doorway Instead of the surprise and horror Bobby had foreseen the old man expressed only a mute wonder He got his hat and coat and entered the runabout Paredes made room for him sitting on the floor his feet on the running board Bobby had told all he knew before they had reached the forest The doctor grunted then The wound at the back of the head was the same as in your grandfather s case Exactly Then what good am I Why am I routed out A formality Bobby answered Katherine thought if we got you quickly you might do something Anyway she wanted your advice The woods closed about them Again the lights seemed to push back a palpable barrier I can t work miracles the doctor was murmuring I can t bring men back to life Such a wound leaves no ground for hope You d better have sent for the police at once Hello He strained forward peering around the windshield Funny Paredes called Bobby s eyes were on the road What do you see The house Bobby Paredes cried No one to my certain knowledge the doctor said has lived in that house for ten years You say it was empty and falling to pieces when you woke up there this morning Bobby knew what they meant then and he reduced the speed of the car and looked ahead to the right A pallid glow sifted through the trees from the direction of the deserted house Bobby guided the car to the side of the road stopped it and shut off the engine At first no one moved The three men stared as if in the presence of an unaccountable phenomenon Even when Bobby had extinguished the headlights the glow failed to brighten Its pallid quality persisted It seemed to radiate from a point close to the ground It comes from the front of the house Bobby murmured He stepped from the automobile What are you going to do Paredes wanted to know Find out who is in that house For Bobby had experienced a quick hope If there was a man or a woman secreted in the building the truth as to his own remarkable presence there last night might not be so far to seek after all There was moreover something lawless about this light escaping from the place at such an hour A little while ago when Paredes and he had driven past the house had been black They had remarked its lonely abandoned appearance It had led Paredes to speak of the neighbourhood as the domain of death Yet the strange pallid quality of the light itself made him pause by the broken fence It did come from the lower part of the front of the house yet so faint was it it failed to outline the aperture through which it escaped The doctor and Paredes joined him When I was here he said all the shutters were closed This glow is too white too diffused We must see As he started forward Paredes grasped his arm There are too many of us We would make a noise Suppose I creep up and investigate There is one way in at the back Bobby told the doctor Let us go there We ll have whoever s inside trapped Meantime Carlos if he wishes will steal up to the front he ll find out where the light comes from He ll look in if he can That s the best plan Paredes agreed But they had scarcely turned the corner of the house beyond reach of the glow when Paredes rejoined them His feet were no longer careful in the underbrush He came up running For the first time in their acquaintance Bobby detected a lessening of the man s suave unemotional habit The light the Panamanian gasped It s gone Before I could get close it faded out Bobby called to the doctor and ran toward the door at the rear It was unhinged and half open as it had been when he had awakened to his painful and inexplicable predicament He went through fumbling in his pocket for matches The damp chill of the hall nauseated him as it had done before seemed to place about his throat an intangible band that made breathing difficult Before he could get his match safe out the doctor had struck a wax vesta Its strong flame played across the dingy streaked walls There s a flashlight Carlos Bobby said in the door flap of the automobile Paredes started across the yard with a haste it seemed to Bobby almost eager Striking matches as they went the doctor and Bobby hurried to the front of the house The rooms appeared undisturbed in their decay The shutters were closed The front door was barred The broken walls from which the plaster hung in shreds leered at them Suddenly Bobby turned grasping the doctor s arm Did you hear anything The doctor shook his head Or feel anything No I thought Bobby said excitedly that there was some one in the hall I I simply got that impression for 
118_47824_000016_000003	train-clean-100	I saw nothing 
none	none	myself My back was turned Paredes strolled silently in It may have been mister Paredes the doctor said But Bobby wasn t convinced Did you see or hear anything coming through the hall Carlos No Paredes said He had brought the light With its help they explored the tiny cellar and the upper floor There was no sign of a recent occupancy Everything was as Bobby had found it on awakening A vagrant wind sighed about the place They looked at each other with startled eyes They filed out with an incongruous stealth Then there are ghosts here too Paredes whispered Who knows Doctor Groom mused It is as puzzling as anything that has happened at the Cedars unless the light we saw was some phosphorescent effect of decaying wood or vegetation Then why should it go out all at once Bobby asked Is there any connection between this light and what has happened at the Cedars The house at least Paredes put in is connected with what has happened at the Cedars through your experience here At Doctor Groom s suggestion they sat in the automobile for some time watching the house for a repetition of the pallid light After several minutes when it failed to come Bobby set his gears Graham and Katherine will be worried They drove quickly away from the black uncommunicative mass of the abandoned building The woods were lonelier than before They impressed Bobby as guarding something He drove straight to the stable As they walked into the court they saw the uncertain candlelight diffused from the room of death In the hall Bobby responded to a quick alarm The Cedars was too quiet What had happened since he and Paredes had left Katherine Hartley he called He heard running steps upstairs Katherine leaned over the banister Her quiet voice reassured him Is the doctor with you He nodded Paredes yawned and lighted a cigarette He settled himself in an easy chair Bobby and Doctor Groom hurried up Katherine led them down the old corridor Two chairs had been placed in the broken doorway Graham sat there He arose and greeted the doctor Nothing has happened since I left Bobby asked Graham shook his head Katherine and I have watched every minute Doctor Groom walked to the bed and for a long time looked down at Howells Once he put out his hand quickly withdrawing it It s simply a repetition he said at last and his voice was softer than its custom It may be a warning for all we know that no one may sleep in this room without attracting death Yet why should that be I miss this poor fellow s materialistic viewpoint There s nothing I can do for him nothing I can say except that death must have been instantaneous The police must seek again for a man to place in the electric chair Graham touched his arm with an odd reluctance Sitting here for so long I ve been thinking I have always been materialistic too Tell me seriously doctor do you believe there is any psychic force capable of killing two men in this incisive fashion No one the doctor answered can say what psychic force is capable of doing Some scientists have started to explore but it is still uncharted country From certain places I daresay you ve noticed it one gets an impression of peace and content from others a depression a sense of suffering I think we have all experienced psychic force to that extent Remember that this room has a history of intense and rebellious suffering Some of it I have seen with my own eyes Your father s fight for life Katherine was horrible for those of us who knew he had no chance As I watched beside him I used to wonder if such violent agony could ever drift wholly into silence and when we had to tell him finally that the fight was lost it was beyond bearing If these men had been found dead without marks of violence Graham said I might consider such a possibility irrational as it seems Irrational Doctor Groom answered must not be confused with impossible The marks of a physical violence far from proving that the attack was physical strengthens the case of the supernatural Certainly you have heard and read of pictures being dashed from walls by invisible hands of objects moved about empty rooms of cases where human beings have been attacked by inanimate things heavy things hurtling through the air Some scientists recognize such irrational possibilities Policemen don t Very well Graham said stubbornly I ll follow you that far but you must show me in this room the sharp object with which these men were attacked no matter what the force behind it The doctor spread his hands His infused eyes nearly closed That I can t do At any rate Robert this isn t wholly tragic to you I don t see how any one could accuse you of aphasia to night You ve not forgotten Bobby said slowly that you spoke of a recurrent aphasia That s the trouble Graham put in under his breath He has no more alibi now than he had when his grandfather was murdered Bobby told of his heavy sleep of the delay in Katherine s arousing him The doctor s gruff voice was disapproving You shouldn t have drunk that medicine It had stood too long It would only have approximated its intended effect You mean Bobby asked that I wasn t sleeping as soundly as I thought Probably not but you re by no means a satisfactory victim Men do unaccountable things in a somnambulistic state but asleep they haven t wings any more than they have awake You ve got to show us how you entered this room without disturbing the locks Now mister Graham we must comply with the law Call in the police There s nothing else to do Bobby agreed So they went along the dingy corridor and downstairs From the depths of the easy chair in which Paredes lounged smoke curled with a lazy indifference The Panamanian didn t move While Graham and the doctor walked to the back of the hall to telephone Katherine an anxious figure a secretive one beckoned Bobby to the library He went with her wondering what she could want It was quite dark in the library As Bobby fumbled with the lamp and prepared to strike a match he was aware of the girl s provocatively near presence He resisted a warm impulse to reach out and touch her hand He desired to tell her all that was in his heart of the division that had increased between them the last few months Yet to follow that impulse would he realized place a portion of his burden on her shoulders would also in a sense be disloyal to Graham for he no longer questioned that the two had reached a definite sentimental understanding So he sighed and struck the match Even before the lamp was lighted Katherine was speaking with a feverish haste Before the police come you ve a chance Bobby the last chance You must do before the police arrive whatever is to be done He replaced the shade and glanced at her astonished by her intensity by the forceful gesture with which she grasped his arm For the first time since Silas Blackburn s murder all of her vitality had come back to her What do you mean She pointed to the door of the private staircase Just what Howells told you before he went up there to his death Bobby understood He reacted excitedly to her attitude of conspirator He said she went on that the criminal had nothing to lose That it would be to his advantage to have him out of the way to destroy that evidence I thought of it Bobby answered just before I went to sleep Don t you see she said If you had killed him you would have taken the cast and the handkerchief and destroyed them Hartley has told me everything and I could see his coat for myself The cast and the handkerchief are still in Howells s pocket Why should I have killed him if not to destroy those Bobby took her up with a quick hope You didn t she cried Nothing would ever make me believe that you killed him but you will be charged with it unless the evidence disappears You ll have no defence Bobby drew back a little You want me to go there and and take from his pocket those things She nodded You remember he suggested that he hadn t sent his report That may be there too Bobby shook his head He must have said that as a bait At the worst she urged a report without evidence could only turn suspicion against you It wouldn t convict you as those other things may You must get them You must destroy them Graham slipped quietly in and closed the door The district attorney is coming himself with another detective he said I can guess what Katherine has been talking about She s right I m a lawyer an I know the penalty of tampering with evidence But I don t believe you re a murderer and I tell you as long as that evidence exists they can convict you They can send you to the chair They may arrest you and try you anyway on his report but I don t believe they can convict you on it alone You re justified in protecting yourself Bobby in the only way you can No one will see you go in the room We ll arrange it so that no one can testify against you Bobby felt himself at a cross roads During the commission of those crimes he had been unconscious If he had in fact had anything to do with them his personality his real self had known nothing had done no wrong His body had merely reacted to hideous promptings whose source lurked at the bottom of the black pit To tamper with evidence would be a conscious crime All the more because of his doubt of himself he shrank from that Katherine saw his hesitation It s a matter of your life or death But although Katherine decided him it wasn t with that She came closer She looked straight at him and her eyes were full of an affection that stirred him profoundly For my sake Bobby He studied the dead ashes of the fire which a little while ago had played on Howells vital and antagonistic by the door of the private staircase The man had challenged him to do just the thing from which he shrank But Howells was no longer vital or antagonistic and it occurred to him that a little of his shrinking arose from the thought of approaching and robbing the still thing upstairs all that was left of the man who had not been afraid of the mystery of the locked room For my sake Katherine repeated Bobby squared his shoulders He fought back his momentary cowardice The affection in Katherine s eyes was stronger than that All right he said Howells never gave me a chance while he was alive He ll have to now he s dead Katherine relaxed Graham s face was quite white but he gave his instructions in a cold even tone We ll go to the hall now Katherine will go on upstairs She mustn t see you enter the room but she will watch in the corridor while you are there to be sure you aren t disturbed You and I will chat for awhile with the others Bobby then you will go up You understand Paredes mustn t even guess what you are doing I ll keep him and Groom downstairs If he spied if he knew what you were at he d have a weapon in his hands I d hate to think about He may be all right but we can t risk any more than we have to We must go on tiptoe He opened the door Katherine gave Bobby s hand a quick encouraging pressure Take the stuff to my room Graham whispered The first chance we ll destroy it so that no trace will be left They went to the hall Without speaking Katherine climbed the stairs Graham drew a chair between Paredes and the doctor Bobby lounged against the mantel trying to find in the Panamanian s face some clue as to his real feelings But Paredes s eyes were closed His hand drooped across the chair arm His slender pointed fingers held as if from mere habit a lifeless cigarette Asleep Graham whispered Without opening his eyes Paredes spoke No I feel curiously awake He yawned Doctor Groom glanced at his watch The powers of prosecution he grumbled ought to be here within the next fifteen or twenty minutes Bobby glanced at Graham Then it wasn t safe to delay too long More and more as he waited he shrank from the invasion of the room of death The prospect of reaching out and touching the still cold thing on the bed revolted him Was there anything in that room capable of forbidding his intention Was there in short a surer more malicious force for evil than his unconscious self at work in the house He was about to make some formal comment to the others to embark on his distasteful adventure when Paredes as if he had read Bobby s mind opened his eyes languidly left his chair and walked to the foot of the stairs Where you going Graham asked sharply Paredes waved his hand indifferently and walked on up There was something of stealth in his failure to reply in his cat like tread on the stairs Graham and Bobby stared after him unable to meet this new situation audibly because of Groom Yet five minutes had gone There was no time to be lost Paredes mustn t rob Bobby of his chance With a sort of desperation he started for the stairs Graham held out his hand as if to restrain him then nodded Bobby had his foot on the first step when Katherine s cry reached them shaping the moment to their use For there was no fright in her cry It was rather angry And Bobby and Graham ran up while Doctor Groom remained in his chair an expression of blank amazement on his face A candle burned on the table in the upper hall Katherine and Paredes stood near the entrance of the old corridor Paredes as usual was quite unruffled Katherine s attitude was defensive She seemed to hold the corridor against him The anger of her cry was active in her eyes Paredes laughed lightly Sorry to have given the household one more shock Fortunately no harm done What is it Katherine Graham demanded I don t know she answered He startled me He entered the corridor Paredes nodded Quite right She was there I was on my way to my room If your house had electricity Bobby this incident would have been avoided I saw something dark in the corridor You may not know Graham said that ever since we found Howells one of us has tried more or less to keep the entrance of that room under observation Yet you were all downstairs a little while ago Paredes yawned It s too bad I might have taken my turn then At any rate since I was excluded from your confidence I overcame my natural fear and for Bobby s sake slipped in and I am afraid startled Miss Katherine Yes she said His explanation was reasonable There was nothing more to be said but Bobby s doubt of his friend sown by Graham and stimulated by the incidents of the last hour was materially strengthened He felt a sharp fear of Paredes Such reserve such concealment of emotion was scarcely human If Graham was saying you really want to help Bobby there is something you can do Will you come downstairs with me for a moment I d like to suggest one or two things before the police arrive Without hesitation Paredes followed Graham down the stairs Katherine turned immediately to Bobby her eyes eager full of the tense determination that had dictated her plan in the library Now Bobby she whispered And there s no time to waste They may be here any minute I won t see you go but I ll be back at once to guard you against Paredes if he slips up again She walked across the hall and disappeared in the newer corridor Without witness he faced the old corridor and with the attempt directly ahead his repugnance achieved a new power The black entrance with its scarcely dared memories reminded him that what he was about to do was directed against more than human law was an outrage against the dead man He had to remind himself of the steely purpose with which Howells had marked him as the murderer and the man s power persisted after death In such a contest he was justified He took the candle from the table Through the stair well the murmur of Graham s voice occasionally interrupted by Groom s heavy tones or the languid accents of Paredes drifted encouragingly Trying to crush his premonitions Bobby entered the corridor Instead of illuminating the narrow passage the candle seemed half smothered by its blackness For the first time in his memory Bobby faced the entrance of the sinister room alone He pushed open the broken door He paused on the threshold It impressed him as not unnatural that he should experience such misgivings They sprang not alone from the fact that within twenty four hours two men had died unaccountably within these faded walls Nor did the evidence pointing to his own unconscious guilt wholly account for them At the bottom of everything was the fact that from his earliest childhood he had looked upon the room as consecrated to death had consequently feared it had he recalled always hurried past the disused corridor leading in its direction Through its wide spaces the light of the candle scarcely penetrated No more than an indefinite radiance thrust back the obscurity and outlined the bed He could barely see the stark black form outstretched there The dim vast room as he advanced imposed upon him a sense of isolation Katherine in the upper hall the others downstairs whose voices no longer reached him seemed all at once far away He stood in a place lonelier and more remote than the piece of woods where he had momentarily opened his eyes last night and instead of the straining trees and the figure in the black mask which he had called his conscience he had for motion and companionship only the swaying of the curtains in the breeze from the open window and the dark prostrate thing whose face as he went closer was like a white mask a mask with a fixed and malevolent sneer The wind caught the flame of the candle making it flicker Tenuous shadows commenced to dance across the walls He paused with a tightening throat for the form on the bed seemed moving too with sly and scarcely perceptible gestures Then he understood It was the effect of the shaking candle and he forced himself to go on but a sense of a multiple companionship accompanied him a sense of a shapeless soundless companionship that projected an idea of a steady regard There swept through his mind a procession of figures in quaint dress and with faces not unlike his own remembered from portraits and family legends men and women to whom this room had been familiar within whose limits they had suffered cried out a too powerful agony and died It seemed to him that he waited for voices to guide him to urge him on as Katherine had urged him or to drive him back because he was an intruder in a company whose habit was strange and terrifying He forced his glance from the shadows which seemed more active along the walls He raised his candle and stared at the dead man The cast was undoubtedly there The coat stretched tightly across the breast outlined it He stood at the side of the bed He had only to bend and place his hand in the pocket which the cast filled awkwardly The wind alone he saw wasn t responsible for the shaking of the candle His hand shook as the shadows shook as the thing on the bed shook The sense of loneliness grew upon him until it became complete appalling For the first time he understood that loneliness can possess a ponderable quality It was he felt potent and active in the room a thing he couldn t understand or challenge or overcome His hand tightened He thought of Katherine guarding the corridor of Paredes and Doctor Groom held downstairs by Graham of the county authorities hurrying to seize this evidence that would convict him and he realized that his duty and his excuse were clear He understood that just now he had been captured by a force undefinable in terms of the world he knew For a moment he eluded the stealthy fleshless hands of its impalpable skirmishers He reached impulsively out to the dead man He was about to place his fingers in the pocket which after all was said and done held his life In the light of the candle the face seemed alive and more menacing than it had ever done in life About the straight smile was a wider more triumphant quality The candle flickered sharply It expired The conquering blackness took his breath He told himself it was the draft from the window which was strong but the companionship of the night was closer and more numerous The darkness wreathed itself into mocking and tortuous bodies whose faces were hidden In an agony of revolt against these incorporeal these fanciful horrors he reached in the pocket He sprang back with a choked inaudible cry for the dead thing beneath his hand was stirring The dead cold thing with a languid and impossible rebuke moved beneath his touch And the pocket he had felt was empty The coat a moment ago bulging and awkward was flat There sprang to his mind the mad thought that the detective malevolent in life had long after death snatched from his hand the evidence carefully gathered on which everything for him depended CHAPTER V THE CRYING THROUGH THE WOODS Bobby s inability to cry out alone prevented his alarming the others and announcing to Paredes and Doctor Groom his unlawful presence in the room During the moment that the shock held him silent motionless bent in the darkness above the bed he understood there could have been no ambiguity about his ghastly and loathsome experience The dead detective had altered his position as Silas Blackburn had done and this time someone had been in the room and suffered the appalling change Bobby s fingers still responded to the charnel feeling of cold inactive flesh suddenly become alive and potent beneath his touch And a reason for the apparent miracle offered itself Between the extinction of his candle and the commencement of that movement only a second or so the evidence had disappeared from the detective s pocket Bobby relaxed He stumbled across the room and into the corridor He went with hands outstretched through the blackness for no candle burned in the upper hall but he knew that Katherine was on guard there When he left the passage he saw her an unnatural figure herself in the yellowish unhealthy twilight which sifted through the stair well from the lamp in the hall below She must have sensed something out of the way immediately for she hurried to meet him and her whisper held no assurance You got the cast and the handkerchief Bobby And when he didn t answer at once she asked with a sharp rush of fear What s the matter What s happened He shuddered At last he managed to speak Katherine I have felt death cease to be death Later he was to recall that phrase with a sicker horror than he experienced now You saw something she said But your candle is out There is no light in the room He took her hand He pressed it You re real he said with a nervous laugh Something I can understand Everything is unreal This light He strode to the table found a match and lighted his candle Katherine as she saw his face drew back Bobby My candle went out he said dully and he moved through the darkness I tell you he moved beneath my hand She drew farther away staring at him You were frightened No If we go there with a light now he said with the same dull conviction we will find him as we found my grandfather this afternoon The monotonous voices of the three men in the lower hall weaved a background for their whispers The normal familiar sound was like a tonic Bobby straightened Katherine threw off the spell of his announcement But the evidence You got She stared at his empty hands He fancied that he saw contempt in her eyes In spite of everything you must go back You must get that Even if I had the courage he said wearily it would be no use for the evidence is gone But I saw it At least I saw his pocket It was there he answered when my light went out I did put my hand in his pocket In that second it had gone There was no one there she said no one but you because I watched He leaned heavily against the wall Good God Katherine It s too big Whatever it is we can t fight it She looked for some time down the corridor at the black entrance of the sinister room At last she turned and walked to the banister She called Hartley Will you come up Bobby wondered at the steadiness of her voice The murmuring below ceased Graham ran up the stairs Her summons had been warning enough Their attitudes as Graham reached the upper hall were eloquent of Bobby s failure You didn t get the cast and the handkerchief he said Bobby told briefly what had happened What is one to do he ended Even the dead are against me It s beyond belief Graham said roughly He snatched up the candle and entered the corridor Uncertainly Katherine and Bobby followed him He went straight to the bed and thrust the candle beneath the canopy The others could see from the door the change that had taken place The body of Howells was turned awkwardly on its side The coat pocket was as Bobby had described it flat and empty Katherine turned and went back to the hall Graham s hand shook as Bobby s had shaken No tricks Bobby Bobby couldn t resent the suspicion which appeared to offer the only explanation of what had happened The candle flickered in the draft Look out Bobby warned The misshapen shadows danced with a multiple vivacity across the walls Graham shaded the candle flame and the shadows became like morbid decorations gargantuan and motionless It s madness Graham said There s no explanation of this that we can understand Howells s straight smile mocked them As if in answer to Graham a voice sighed through the room Its quality was one with the shadows unsubstantial and shapeless Bobby grasped one of the bed posts and braced himself listening The candle in Graham s hand commenced to flicker again and Bobby knew that it hadn t been his fancy for Graham listened too It shook again through the heavy oppressive night merely accentuated by the candle a faint ululation barely detaching itself from silence straying after a time into the silence again At first it was like the grief of a woman heard at a great distance But the sound while it gained no strength forced on them more and more an abhorrent sense of intimacy This crying from an infinite distance filled the room seemed finally to have its source in the room itself After it had sobbed thinly into nothing its pulsations continued to sigh in Bobby s ears They seemed timed to the renewed and eccentric dancing of the amorphous shadows Graham straightened and placed the candle on the bureau He seemed more startled than he had been at the unbelievable secretiveness of a dead man You heard it Bobby breathed Graham nodded What was it Where did you think it came from Bobby demanded It was like someone mourning for this this poor devil Graham couldn t disguise his effort to elude the sombre spell of the room to drive from his brain the illusion of that unearthly moaning It must have come from outside the house he answered There s no use giving way to fancies where there s a possible explanation It must have come from outside from some woman in great agony of mind Bobby recalled his perception of a woman moving with a curious absence of sound about the edges of the stagnant lake He spoke of it to Graham I couldn t be sure it was a woman but there s no house within two miles What would a woman be doing wandering around the Cedars At any rate there are three women in the house Graham said Katherine and the two servants Ella and Jane The maids are badly frightened It may have come from the servants quarters It must have been one of them But Bobby saw that Graham didn t believe either of the maids had released that poignant suffering It didn t sound like a living voice he said simply Then how are we to take it Graham persisted angrily I shall question Katherine and the two maids He took up the candle with a stubborn effort to recapture his old forcefulness but as they left the room the shadows thronged thickly after them in ominous pursuit and it wasn t necessary to question Katherine She stood in the corridor her lips parted her face white and shocked What was it she said That nearly silent grief She put her hands to her ears lowering them helplessly after a moment Where did you think it came from Graham asked From a long ways off she answered Then I I thought it must be in the room with you and I wondered if you saw Graham shook his head We saw nothing It was probably Ella or Jane They ve been badly frightened Perhaps a nightmare or they ve heard us moving around the front part of the house I am going to see Katherine and Bobby followed him downstairs Doctor Groom and Paredes stood in front of the fireplace questioningly looking upward Paredes didn t speak at first but Doctor Groom burst out in his grumbling bass voice What s been going on up there Did you hear just now a queer crying Graham asked No You Paredes I ve heard nothing Paredes answered except Doctor Groom s disquieting theories It s an uncanny hour for such talk What kind of a cry may I ask Like a woman moaning Bobby said and Doctor Howells has changed his position What are you talking about the doctor cried He has turned on his side as mister Blackburn did Graham told him Paredes glanced at Bobby And how was this new mystery discovered Bobby caught the implication Then the Panamanian clung to his slyly expressed doubt of Katherine which might after all have had its impulse in an instinct of self preservation Bobby knew that Graham and Katherine would guard the fashion in which the startling discovery had been made Before he could speak for himself indeed Graham was answering Paredes This crying seemed after a time to come from the room We entered But Miss Katherine called you up Paredes said I supposed she had heard again movements in the room Bobby managed a smile You see Carlos nothing is consistent in this case Paredes bowed gravely It is very curious a woman should cry about the house The servants may make it seem natural enough Graham said Will you come Bobby As they crossed the dining room they heard a stirring in the kitchen Graham threw open the door Jenkins stood at the foot of the servants stairs The old butler had lighted a candle and placed it on the mantel The disorder of his clothing suggested the haste with which he had left his bed and come downstairs His wrinkled sunken face had aged perceptibly He advanced with an expression of obvious relief I was just coming to find you mister Robert What s up Bobby asked A little while ago I thought you were all asleep back here One of the women awakened him Graham said It s just as I thought Was that it the old butler asked with a quick relief But immediately he shook his head It couldn t have been that mister Graham for I stopped at Ella s and Jane s doors and there was no sound They seemed to be asleep And it wasn t like that You mean Bobby said that you heard a woman crying Jenkins nodded It woke me up If you didn t think it was one of the maids Graham asked what did you make of it I thought it came from outside I thought it was a woman prowling around the house Then I said to myself why should a woman prowl around the Cedars And it was too unearthly sir and I remembered the way mister Silas was murdered and the awful thing that happened to his body this afternoon and I you won t think me foolish sirs I doubted if it was a human voice I had heard No Graham said dryly we won t think you foolish So I thought I d better wake you up and tell you Graham turned to Bobby Katherine and you and I he said fancied the crying was in the room with us Jenkins is sure it came from outside the house That is significant Wherever it came from Bobby said softly it was like some one mourning for Howells Jenkins started The policeman Bobby remembered that Jenkins hadn t been aroused by the discovery of Howells s murder You d know in a few minutes anyway he said Howells has been killed as my grandfather was Jenkins moved back a look of unbelief and awe in his wrinkled face He boasted he was going to sleep in that room he whispered Bobby studied Jenkins not knowing what to make of the old man for into the awe of the wrinkled face had stolen a positive relief an emotion that bordered on the triumphant It s terrible Jenkins whispered Graham grasped his shoulder What s the matter with you Jenkins One would say you were glad No Oh no sir It is terrible I was only wondering about the policeman s report What do you know about his report Bobby cried Only that that he gave it to me to mail just before he went up to the old room You mailed it Graham snapped Jenkins hesitated When he answered his voice was self accusing I m an old coward mister Robert The policeman told me the letter was very important and if anything happened to it I would get in trouble He couldn t afford to leave the house himself he said But as I say I m a coward and I didn t want to walk through the woods to the box by the gate I figured it all out It wouldn t be taken up until early in the morning and if I waited until daylight it would only be delayed one collection So I made up my mind I d sleep on it because I knew he had it in for you mister Robert I supposed I d mail it in the morning but I decided I d think it over anyway and not harrow myself walking through the woods You ve done a good job Graham said excitedly Where is the report now In my room Shall I fetch it sir Graham nodded and Jenkins shuffled up the stairs What luck Graham said Howells must have telephoned his suspicions to the district attorney He must have mentioned the evidence but what does that amount to since it s disappeared along with the duplicate of the report if Howells made one I can fight with a clear conscience Bobby cried I wasn t asleep when Howells s body altered its position Do you realize what that means to me For once I was wide awake when the old room was at its tricks If Howells were alive Graham answered shortly he would look on the fact that you were awake and alone with the body as the worst possible evidence against you Bobby s elation died There is always something to tangle me in the eyes of the law with these mysteries But I know and I ll fight Can you find any trace of a conspiracy against me in this last ghastly adventure It complicates everything Graham admitted It s beyond sounding Bobby said for my grandfather s death last night and the disturbance of his body this afternoon seemed calculated to condemn me absolutely yet Howells s murder and the movement of his body with the disappearance of the cast and the handkerchief seem designed to save me Are there two influences at work in this house one for me one against me Let s think of the human elements Graham answered with a frown I have no faith in Paredes My man has failed to report on Maria That s queer You fancy a woman in black slipping through the woods and we hear a woman cry I want to account for those things before I give in to Groom s spirits I confess at times they seem the only logical explanation Here s Jenkins If trouble comes of his withholding the report I ll take the blame Bobby said Graham snatched the long envelope from Jenkins hand It was addressed in a firm hand to the district attorney at the county seat There s no question Graham said That s it We mustn t open it We d better not destroy it Put it where it won t be easily found Jenkins If you are questioned you have no recollection of Howells having given it to you mister Blackburn promises he will see you get in no trouble The old man smiled Trouble he scoffed mister Blackburn needn t fret himself about me He s the last of this family that is Miss Katherine and he I m old and about done for I don t mind trouble Not a bit sir Bobby pressed his hand His voice was a little husky I didn t think you d go that far in my service Jenkins The old butler smiled slyly I d go a lot further than that sir We d better get back Graham said The blood hounds ought to be here and they ll sniff at the case harder than ever because it s done for Howells They watched Jenkins go upstairs with the report We re taking long chances Graham said desperately long chances but you re in a desperately dangerous position It s the only way You ll be accused of stealing the evidence but remember when they question you they can prove nothing unless the cast and the handkerchief turn up If they ve been taken by an enemy in some magical fashion to be produced at the proper moment there s no hope Meantime play the game and Katherine and I will help you all we can The doctor too is friendly There s no doubt of him Come now Let s face the music Bobby followed Graham to the hall trying to strengthen his nerves for the ordeal Even now he was more appalled by the apparently supernatural background of the case than he was by the material details which pointed to his guilt More than the report and the cast and the handkerchief the remembrance of that impossible moment in the blackness of the old room filled his mind and the unearthly and remote crying still throbbed in his ears Katherine Graham and the doctor waited by the fireplace They had heard nothing from the authorities But they must be here soon Doctor Groom said Did you learn anything back there Hartley Katherine asked It wasn t the servants he said Jenkins heard the crying He s certain it came from outside the house Paredes looked up Extraordinary he said I wish I had heard it Doctor Groom grumbled Paredes laughed Thank the good Lord I didn t Perpetually Bobby your house reminds me that I ve nerves sensitive to the unknown world I will go further than the doctor I will say that this house is crowded with the supernatural It shelters things that we cannot understand that we will never understand When I was a child in Panama I had a nurse who unfortunately developed too strongly my native superstition How she frightened me with her bedtime stories They were all of men murdered or dead of fevers crossing the trail or building the railroad or digging insufficient ditches for De Lesseps Some of her best went farther back than that They were thick with the ghosts of old Spaniards and the crimson hands of Morgan s buccaneers Really that tiny strip across the isthmus is crowded with souls snatched too quickly from torn and tortured bodies If you are sensitive you feel they are still there What has all this to do with the Cedars Doctor Groom grumbled It explains my ability to sense strange elements in this old house There are in Panama if you don t mind doctor improvised graveyards tangled by the jungle that give you a feeling of an active unseen population precisely as this house does He arose and strolled with a cat like lack of sound about the hall When he spoke again his voice was scarcely audible It was the voice of a man who thinks aloud and the doctor failed to interrupt him again I have felt less spiritually alarmed in those places of grinning skulls which always seem trying to recite agonies beyond expression than I feel in this house For here the woods are more desolate than the jungle and the walls of houses as old as this make a prison for suffering A vague discomfort stole through Bobby s surprise He had never heard Paredes speak so seriously In spite of the man s unruffled manner there was nothing of mockery about his words What then was their intention Paredes said no more but for several minutes he paced up and down the hall glancing often with languid eyes toward the stairs He had the appearance of one who expects and waits Katherine Graham and the doctor Bobby could see had been made as uneasy as himself by the change in the Panamanian The doctor cleared his throat His voice broke the silence tentatively If this house makes you so unhappy young man why do you stay Paredes paused in his walk His thin lips twitched He indicated Bobby For the sake of my very good friend What are a man s personal fears and desires if he can help his friends Graham s distaste was evident Paredes recognized it with a smile Bobby watched him curiously realizing more and more that Graham was right to this extent they must somehow learn the real purpose of the Panamanian s continued presence here Paredes resumed his walk He still had that air of expectancy He seemed to listen This feeling of imminence reached Bobby increased his restlessness He thought he heard an automobile horn outside He sprang up went to the door opened it and stood gazing through the damp and narrow court Yet he confessed he listened for a repetition of that unearthly crying through the thicket rather than for the approach of those who would try to condemn him for two murders Paredes was right The place was unhealthy Its dark walls seemed to draw closer They had a desolate and unfriendly secretiveness They might hide anything The whirring of a motor reached him Headlights flung gigantic distorted shadows of trees across the walls of the old wing Bobby faced the others They re coming he said and his voice was sufficiently apprehensive now Graham joined him at the door Yes he said There will be another inquisition You all know that Howells for some absurd reason suspected Bobby Bobby it goes without saying knows no more about the crimes than any of us I dare say you ll keep that in mind if they try to confuse you After all there s very little any of us can tell them Except Paredes said with a yawn what went on upstairs when the woman cried and Howells s body moved Of course I know nothing about that Graham glanced at him sharply I don t know what you mean but you have told us all that you are Bobby s friend Quite so And I am not a spy He moved his head in his grave and dignified bow The automobile stopped at the entrance to the court Three men stepped out and hurried up the path As they entered the hall Bobby recognized the sallow wizened features of the coroner One of the others was short and thick set His round and florid face one felt should have expressed friendliness and good humour rather than the intolerant anger that marked it now The third was a lank bald headed man whose sharp face released more determination than intelligence I am Robinson the district attorney the stout one announced and this is Jack Rawlins the best detective I ve got now that Howells is gone Jack was a close friend of Howells so he ll make a good job of it but I thought it was time I came myself to see what the devil s going on in this house The lank man nodded You re right mister Robinson There ll be no more nonsense about the case If Howells had made an arrest he might be alive this minute Bobby s heart sank These men would act from a primary instinct of revenge They wanted the man who had killed Silas Blackburn principally because it was certain he had also killed their friend Rawlins s words moreover suggested that Howells must have telephoned a pretty clear outline of the case Robinson stared at them insolently This is Doctor Groom I know Which is young mister Blackburn Bobby stepped forward The sharp eyes surrounded by puffy flesh studied him aggressively Bobby forced himself to meet that unfriendly gaze Would Robinson accuse him now before he had gone into the case for himself At least he could prove nothing After a moment the man turned away Who is this he asked indicating Graham A very good friend my lawyer mister Graham Bobby answered Robinson walked over to Paredes Another lawyer he sneered Another friend Paredes answered easily Robinson glanced at Katherine Of course you are Miss Perrine Good Coroner these are all that were in the front part of the house when you were here before The same lot the coroner squeaked There are three servants a man and two women Robinson went on Account for them Rawlins and see what they have to say Come upstairs when you re through All right Coroner But he paused at the foot of the steps For the present no one will leave the house without my permission If you care to come upstairs with me mister Blackburn you might be useful Bobby shrank from the thought of returning to the old room even with this determined company He didn t hesitate however for Robinson s purpose was clear He wanted Bobby where he could watch him Graham prepared to accompany them If you need me the doctor said I looked at the body Oh yes Robinson sneered I d like to know exactly what time you found the body Graham flushed but Katherine answered easily About half past two the hour at which mister Blackburn was killed And I Robinson sneered was aroused at three thirty An hour during which the police were left out of the case We thought it wise to get a physician first of all Graham said You knew Howells never had a chance You knew he had been murdered the moment you looked at him Robinson burst out We acted for the best Graham answered His manner impressed silence on Katherine and Bobby We ll see about that later Robinson said with a clear threat If it doesn t inconvenience you too much we ll go up now In the upper hall he snatched the candle from the table Which way Katherine nodded to the old corridor and slipped to her room Robinson stepped forward with the coroner at his heels Bobby Graham and the doctor followed Inside the narrow choking passage Bobby saw the district attorney hesitate What s the matter the doctor rumbled The district attorney went on without answering He glanced at the broken lock So you had to smash your way in He walked to the bed and looked down at Howells Poor devil he murmured Howells wasn t the man to get caught unawares It s beyond me how any one could have come close enough to make that wound without putting him on his guard It s beyond us as it was beyond him Graham answered how any one got into the room at all In response to Robinson s questions he told in detail about the discovery of both murders Robinson pondered for some time Then you and mister Blackburn were asleep he said Miss Perrine aroused you This foreigner Paredes was awake and dressed and in the lower hall I think he was in the court as we went by the stair well Graham corrected him I shall want to talk to your foreigner Robinson said He shivered This room is like a charnel house Why did Howells want to sleep here I don t think he intended to sleep Graham said From the start Howells was bound to solve the mystery of the entrance of the room He came here hoping that the criminal would make just such an attempt as he did He was confident he could take care of himself get his man and clear up the last details of the case Robinson looked straight at Bobby Then Howells knew the criminal was in the house Howells I daresay Graham said telephoned you something of his suspicions Robinson nodded He was on the wrong line Graham argued or he wouldn t have been so easily overcome You can see for yourself Locked doors a wound that suggests the assailant was close to him yet he must have been awake and watchful and if there had been a physical attack before the sharp instrument was driven into his brain he would have cried out yet Miss Perrine was aroused by nothing of the sort and the coroner I daresay will find no marks of a struggle about the body The coroner who had been busy at the bed glanced up No mark at all If Howells wasn t asleep his murderer must have been invisible as well as noiseless Doctor Groom smiled The coroner glared at him I suggest mister District Attorney he squeaked that the ordinary layman wouldn t know that this type of wound would cause immediate death Nor would any man the doctor answered angrily be able to make such a wound with his victim lying on his back On his back Robinson echoed But he isn t on his back The doctor told of the amazing alteration in the positions of both victims Bobby regretted with all his heart that he had made the attempt to get the evidence Already complete frankness was impossible for him Already a feeling of guilt sprang from the necessity of withholding the first hand testimony which he alone could give And a woman cried Robinson said bewildered All this sounds like a ghost story You ve more sense than I thought Doctor Groom said dryly I never could get Howells to see it that way What are you driving at Robinson snapped These crimes the doctor answered have all the elements of a ghostly impulse Robinson s laugh was a little uncomfortable The Cedars is a nice place for spooks but it won t do I ll be frank Howells telephoned me He had found plenty of evidence of human interference It s evident in both cases that the murderer came back and disturbed the bodies for some special purpose I don t know what it was the first time but it s simple to understand the last The murderer came for evidence Howells had on his person Bobby couldn t meet the sharp puffy eyes He alone was capable of testifying that the evidence had been removed as if to secrete it from his unlawful hand Yet if he spoke he would prove the district attorney s point He would condemn himself Curious Graham said slowly that the murderer didn t take the evidence when he killed his man I don t know about that Robinson said but I know Howells had evidence on his person You through Coroner Then we ll have a look although it s little use He walked to the bed and searched Howells s pockets Just as I thought Nothing He told me he was preparing a report If he didn t mail it that was stolen with the rest of the stuff Rawlins s right He waited too long to make his arrest Again Bobby wondered if the man would bring matters to a head now He could appreciate however that Robinson with nothing to go on but Howells s telephoned suspicions might spoil his chances of a solution by acting too hastily Rawlins strolled in The two women were asleep he said The old man knows nothing beyond the fact that he heard a woman crying outside a little while ago I don t think we need bother about the back part of the house for the present Robinson said Howells s evidence has been stolen It s your job to find it unless it s been destroyed Your other job is to discover the instrument that caused death in both cases Then maybe our worthy doctor will desert his ghosts mister Blackburn if you will come with me there s a slight possibility of checking up some of the evidence of which Howells spoke Our fine fellow may have made a slip in the court Bobby understood and was afraid more afraid than he had been at any time since he had overheard Howells catalogue his case to Graham in the library Why even in so much confusion had Graham and he failed to think of those tell tale marks in the court They had been intact when he had stood there just before dark It was unlikely any one had walked across the grass since He saw Graham s elaborate precautions demolished the case against him stronger than it had been before Howells s murder Graham s face revealed the same helpless comprehension They followed Robinson downstairs Graham made a gesture of surrender Bobby glanced at Paredes who alone had remained below The Panamanian smoked and lounged in the easy chair His eyes seemed restless I shall wish to ask you some questions in a few minutes mister Paredes the district attorney said At your service I m sure Paredes drawled He watched them until they had entered the court and closed the door The chill dampness of the court infected Bobby as it had always done It was a proper setting for his accusation and arrest For Robinson he knew wouldn t wait as Howells had done to solve the mystery of the locked doors Robinson while the others grouped themselves about him took a flashlight from his pocket and pressed the control The brilliant cylinder of light illuminated the grass making it seem unnaturally green Bobby braced himself for the inevitable denouement Then while Robinson exclaimed angrily his eyes widened his heart beat rapidly with a vast and wondering relief For the marks he remembered so clearly had been obliterated with painstaking thoroughness and at first the slate seemed perfectly clean He was sure his unknown friend had avoided leaving any trace of his own Each step in the grass had been carefully scraped out In the confusion of the path there was nothing to be learned The genuine surprise of Bobby s exclamation turned Robinson to him with a look of doubt You acknowledge these footmarks were here mister Blackburn Certainly Bobby answered I saw them myself just before dark I knew Howells ridiculously connected them with the murderer You made a good job of it when you trampled them out Robinson hazarded But it was clear Bobby s amazement had not been lost on him Or he went on this foreigner who advertises himself as your friend He was in the court tonight We know that Suddenly he stooped and Bobby got on his knees beside him The cylinder of light held in its centre one mark clear and distinct in the trampled grass and with a warm gratitude a swift apprehension Bobby thought of Katherine For the mark in the grass had been made by the heel of a woman s shoe Not the foreigner then Robinson mused not yourself Blackburn but a woman a devoted woman That s something to get after And if she lies the impression of the heel will give her away the coroner suggested Robinson grinned You d make a rotten detective Coroner Women s heels are cut to a pattern There are thousands of shoes whose heels would fit this impression We need the sole for identification and that she hasn t left us But she s done one favour She s advertised herself as a woman and there are just three women in the house One of those committed this serious offence and the inference is obvious Before Bobby could protest the doctor broke in with his throaty rumble One of those or the woman who cried about the house Bobby started The memory of that eerie grief was still uncomfortable in his brain Could there have been actually a woman at the stagnant lake that afternoon and close to the house to night some mysterious friend who assumed grave risks in his service He recognized Robinson s logic Unless there were something in that far fetched theory Katherine faced a situation nearly as serious as his own Robinson straightened At the same moment the scraping of a window reached them Bobby glanced at the newer wing Katherine leaned from her window The coincidence disturbed him In Robinson s mind he knew her anxiety would assume a colour of guilt Her voice moreover was too uncertain too full of misgivings What is going on down there There have been no no more tragedies Would you mind joining us for a moment Robinson asked She drew back The curtain fell over her lighted window The darkness of the court was disturbed again only by the limited radiance of the flashlight She came hurriedly from the front door I saw you gathered here I heard you talking I wondered You knew there were footprints in this court Robinson said harshly that Howells connected them with the murderer of your uncle Yes she answered simply Why then he asked did you attempt to obliterate them She laughed What do you mean I didn t I haven t been out of the house since just after luncheon Can you prove that It needs no proof I tell you so The flashlight exposed the ugly confidence of Robinson s smile I am sorry to suggest the need of corroboration You doubt my word she flashed A woman he answered has obliterated valuable testimony I shall make it my business to punish her She laughed again Without another word she turned and reentered the house Robinson s oath was audible to the others We can t put up with that sort of thing sir Rawlins said I ought to place this entire household under arrest Robinson muttered As a lawyer Graham said easily I should think with your lack of evidence it might be asking for trouble There is Paredes who acknowledges he was in the court All right I ll see what he s got to say He started for the house Bobby lingered for a moment with Graham Do you know anything about this Hartley Nothing Graham whispered Then you don t think Katherine If she d done it she d have taken good care not to be so curious I doubt if it was Katherine They followed the others into the hall Bobby scarcely appreciating why at first realized there had been a change there Then he understood Robinson faced an empty chair The hall was pungent with cigarette smoke but Paredes had gone Robinson pointed to the stairs Get him down he said to Rawlins He wouldn t have gone to bed Graham suggested Suppose he s in the old room where Howells lies But Rawlins found him nowhere upstairs With an increasing excitement Robinson joined the search They went through the entire house Paredes was no longer there He had to all appearances put a period to his unwelcome visit He had definitely disappeared from the Cedars His most likely exit was through the kitchen door which was unlocked but Jenkins who had returned to his room had heard no one With their electric lamps Robinson and Rawlins ferreted about the rear entrance for traces The path there was as trampled and useless as the one in front Rawlins who had gone some distance from the house straightened with a satisfied exclamation The others joined him Here s where he left the path right enough he said And our foreigner wasn t making any more noise than he had to He flashed his lamp on a fresh footprint in the soft soil at the side of the path The mark of the toe was deep and firm The impression of the heel was very light Paredes it was clear had walked from the house on tiptoe Follow on Robinson commanded I told this fellow I wanted to question him I ve scared him off Keeping his light on the ground Rawlins led the way across the clearing The trail was simple enough to follow Each of the Panamanian s footprints was distinct Each had that peculiarity that suggested the stealth of his progress As they continued Bobby responded to an excited premonition He sensed the destination of the chase He could picture Paredes now in the loneliest portion of the woods for the trail unquestionably pointed to the path he had taken that afternoon toward the stagnant lake Hartley he said Paredes left the house to go to the stagnant lake where I fancied I saw a woman in black Do you see And he didn t hear the crying of a woman a little while ago and when we told him he became restless He wandered about the hall talking of ghosts A rendezvous Graham answered He may have been waiting for just that The crying may have been a signal Perhaps you ll believe now Bobby that the man has had an underhanded purpose in staying here I ve made too many hasty judgments in my life Hartley I ll go slow on this I ll wait until we see what we find at the lake Rawlins snapped off his light The little party paused at the black entrance of the path into the thicket He s buried himself in the woods Rawlins said They crowded instinctively closer in the sudden darkness A brisk wind had sprung up It rattled among the trees and set the dead leaves in gentle rustling motion It suggested to Bobby the picture which had been forced into his brain the night of his grandfather s death The moon now possessed less light but it reminded him again of a drowning face and through the darkness he could fancy the trees straining in the wind like puny men Abruptly the thought of penetrating the forest became frightening The silent loneliness of the stagnant lake seemed as unfriendly and threatening as the melancholy of the old room There are too many of us Robinson was saying You d better go on alone Rawlins and don t take any chances I ve got to have this man You understand I think he knows things worth while The rising wind laughed at his whisper The detective flashed his lamp once shut it off again and stepped into the close embrace of the thicket Suddenly Bobby grasped Graham s arm The little group became tense breathless For across the wind with a diffused quality a lack of direction vibrated to them again the faint and mournful grief of a woman CHAPTER VI THE ONE WHO CREPT IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE The odd mournful crying lost itself in the restless lament of the wind The thicket from which it had seemed to issue assumed in the pallid moonlight a new unfriendliness Instinctively the six men moved closer together The coroner s thin tones expressed his alarm What the devil was that I don t really believe there could be a woman around here A queer one the detective grunted The district attorney questioned Bobby and Graham That s the voice you heard from the house Graham nodded Perhaps not so far away Doctor Groom hitherto more captured than any of them by the imminence of a spiritual responsibility for the mystery of the Cedars was the first now to reach for a rational explanation of this new phase We mustn t let our fancies run away with us The coroner s right for once No excuse for a woman hiding in that thicket A bird maybe or some animal Sounded more like a human being Robinson objected The detective reasoned in a steady unmoved voice Only a mad woman would wander through the woods crying like that without a special purpose This man Paredes has left the house and come through here I d guess it was a signal Graham and I had thought of that Bobby said Howells was a sharp one Robinson mused but he must have gone wrong on this fellow He phoned me the man knew nothing Spoke of him as a foreigner who lolled around smoking cigarettes and trying to make a fool of him with a lot of talk about ghosts Howells Graham said misjudged the case from the start He wasn t to blame but his mistake cost him his life Robinson didn t answer Bobby saw that the man had discarded his intolerant temper From that change he drew a new hope He accepted it as the beginning of fulfilment of his prophecy last night that an accident to Howells and the entrance of a new man into the case would give him a fighting chance It was clearly Paredes at the moment who filled the district attorney s mind Go after him he said shortly to Rawlins If you can get away with it bring him back and whoever you find with him Rawlins hesitated I m no coward but I know what s happened to Howells This isn t an ordinary case I don t want to walk into an ambush It would be safer not to run him down alone All right Robinson agreed I don t care to leave the Cedars for the present Perhaps mister Graham But Graham wasn t enthusiastic It never occurred to Bobby that he was afraid Graham he guessed desired to remain near Katherine I ll go if you like Doctor Groom rumbled It was probable that Graham s instinct to stay had sprung from service rather than sentiment The man it was reasonable sought to protect Katherine from the Cedars itself and from Robinson s too direct methods of examination As an antidote for his unwelcome jealousy Bobby offered himself to Rawlins Would you mind if I came too I ve known Paredes a long time Robinson sneered What do you think of that Rawlins But the detective stepped close and whispered in the district attorney s ear All right Robinson said Go with em if you want mister Blackburn And Bobby knew that he would go not to help but to be watched The others strayed toward the house The three men faced the entrance of the path alone No more loud talk now the detective warned If he went on tiptoe so can we Even with this company Bobby shrank from the dark and restless forest With a smooth skill the detective followed the unfamiliar path From time to time he stooped close to the ground shaded his lamp with his hand and pressed the control Always the light verified the presence of Paredes ahead of them Bobby knew they were near the stagnant lake The underbrush was thicker They went with more care to limit the sound of their passage among the trees And each moment the physical surroundings of the pursuit increased Bobby s doubt of Paredes No ordinary impulse would bring a man to such a place in this black hour before the dawn particularly Paredes who spoke constantly of his superstitious nature who advertised a thorough paced fear of the Cedars The Panamanian s decision to remain his lack of emotion before the tragic succession of events at the house his attempt to enter the corridor just before Bobby had gone himself to the old room for the evidence his desire to direct suspicion against Katherine finally this excursion in response to the eerie crying all suggested a definite perhaps a dangerous purpose in the brain of the serene and inscrutable man They slipped to the open space about the lake The moon barely distinguished for them the flat melancholy stretch of water They listened breathlessly There was no sound beyond the normal stirrings of the forest Bobby had a feeling similar to the afternoon s that he was watched He tried unsuccessfully to penetrate the darkness across the lake where he had fancied the woman skulking The detective s keen senses were satisfied Dollars to doughnuts they re not here They ve probably gone on I ll have to take a chance and show the light again Fresh footprints were revealed in the narrow circle of illumination Testifying to Paredes s continued stealth they made a straight line to the water s edge Rawlins exclaimed He stepped into the lake How deep is it The black surface of the water seemed to Bobby like an opaque glass hiding sinister things Suppose Paredes instead of coming to a rendezvous had been led It s

none	none	in the centre he answered Shallow around the edges Quite Then he knew we were after him Groom said Rawlins nodded and ran his light along the shore A few yards to the right a ledge of smooth rock stretched from the water to a grove of pine trees The detective arose and turned off his light He s blocked us he said He knew he wouldn t leave his marks on the rocks or the pine needles No way to guess his direction now Doctor Groom cleared his throat With a hesitant manner he recited the discovery of the queer light in the deserted house its unaccountable disappearances their failure to find its source I was thinking he explained that Paredes alone saw the light give out It was his suggestion that he go to the front of the house to investigate This path might be used as a short cut to the deserted house The rendezvous may have been there Rawlins was interested again How far is it Not much more than a mile Groom answered Then we ll go the detective decided Show the way Groom in the lead they struck off through the woods Bobby who walked last noticed the faint messengers of dawn behind the trees in the east He was glad The night cloaked too much in this neighbourhood By daylight the empty house would guard its secret less easily Suddenly he paused and stood quite still He wanted to call to the others to point out what he had seen There was no question By chance he had accomplished the task that had seemed so hopeless yesterday He had found the spot where his consciousness had come back momentarily to record a wet moon trees straining in the wind like puny men and a figure in a mask which he had called his conscience He gazed his hope retreating before an unforeseen disappointment for with the paling moon and the bent trees survived that very figure on the discovery of whose nature he had built so vital a hope and in this bad light it conveyed to him an appearance nearly human Through the underbrush the trunk of a tree shattered by some violent storm mocked him with its illusion The dead leaves at the top were like cloth across a face Therefore he argued there had been no conspiracy against him Paredes was clean as far as that was concerned He had wandered about the Cedars alone He had opened his eyes at a point between the court and the deserted house Rawlins turned back suspiciously asking why he loitered He continued almost indifferently He still wanted to know Paredes s goal but his disappointment and its meaning obsessed him When they crept up the growing light exposed the scars of the deserted house Everything was as Bobby remembered it At the front there was no decayed wood or vegetation to strengthen the doctor s half hearted theory of a phosphorescent emanation The tangle of footsteps near the rear door was confusing and it was some time before the three men straightened and glanced at each other knowing that the doctor s wisdom was proved For Paredes had been there recently for that matter might still be in the house Moreover he hadn t hidden his tracks as he could have done in the thick grass Instead he had come in a straight line from the woods across a piece of sandy ground which contained the record of his direction and his continued stealth But inside they found nothing except burnt out matches strewn across the floor testimony of their earlier search The fugitive had evidently left more carefully than he had come The chill emptiness of the deserted house had drawn and released him ahead of the chase I guess he knew what the light meant the detective said as well as he did that queer calling It complicates matters that I can t find a woman s footprints around here She may have kept to the grass and this marked up path for since I don t believe in banshees I ll swear there s been a woman around either a crazy woman wandering at large who might be connected with the murders or else a sane one who signalled the foreigner Let s get back and see what the district attorney makes of it It might be wiser not to dismiss the banshees as you call them too hurriedly Doctor Groom rumbled As they returned along the road in the growing light Bobby lost the feeling he had had of being spied upon The memory of such an adventure was bound to breed something like confidence among its actors Rawlins Bobby hoped would be less unfriendly The detective in fact talked as much to him as to the doctor He assured them that Robinson would get the Panamanian unless he proved miraculously clever He s shown us that he knows something he went on I don t say how much because I can t get a motive to make it worth his while to commit such crimes The man smiled blandly at Bobby While in your case there s a motive at least the money He chuckled That s the easiest motive to understand in the world It s stronger than love Bobby wondered Love had been the impulse for the last few months folly that had led him into his present situation Graham over his stern principles of right had already stepped outside the law in backing Katherine s efforts to save Bobby So he wondered how much Graham would risk how far he was capable of going himself at the inspiration of such a motive The sun was up when they reached the Cedars Katherine had gone to her room The coroner had left Robinson and Graham had built a fresh fire in the hall They sat there talking Where you been Robinson demanded We d about decided the spooks had done for you The detective outlined their failure The district attorney listened with a frown At the end he arose and without saying anything walked to the telephone When he returned he appeared better satisfied mister Paredes he said will have to be a slick article to make a clean getaway And I m bringing another man to keep reporters out They ll know from Howells s murder that mister Blackburn didn t die a natural death If reporters get in don t talk to them I don t want that damned foreigner reading in the papers what s going on here I d give my job to have him in that chair for five minutes now Graham cleared his throat I scarcely know how to suggest this since it is sufficiently clear because of Howells s suspicions that you have mister Blackburn under close observation But he has a fair idea of Paredes s habits his haunts and his friends in New York He might be able to learn things the police couldn t I ve one or two matters to take me to town I would make myself personally responsible for his return The district attorney interrupted I see what you mean Wait a minute He clasped his hands and rolled his fat thumbs one around the other The little eyes surrounded by puffy flesh became enigmatic All at once he glanced up with a genial smile Why not I haven t said anything about holding mister Blackburn as more than a witness His tone chilled Bobby as thoroughly as a direct accusation would have done And Robinson went on the sooner you go the better The sooner you get back the better Graham was visibly puzzled by this prompt acquiescence He started for the stairs but the district attorney waved him aside Coats and hats are downstairs No need wasting time Graham turned to Doctor Groom You ll tell Miss Perrine Doctor The doctor showed that he understood the warning Graham wished to convey The district attorney made a point of walking to the stable to see them off Graham gestured angrily as they drove away It s plain as the nose on your face I was too anxious to test their attitude toward you Bobby He jumped at the chance to run us out of the house He ll have several hours during which to turn the place upside down to give Katherine the third degree And we can t go back We ll have to see it through Why should he give me a chance to slip away Bobby asked But before long he realized that Robinson was taking no chances At the junction of the road from Smithtown a car picked them up and clung to their heels all the way to the city Rawlins must have telephoned Graham said while we went to the stable They re still playing Howells s game They ll give you plenty of rope He drove straight to Bobby s apartment The elevator man verified their suspicions Robinson had telephoned the New York police for a search A familiar type of metropolitan detective met them in the hall outside Bobby s door I m through gentlemen he greeted them impudently Graham faced him in a burst of temper The city may have to pay for this outrage The man grinned I should get gray hairs about that He went on downstairs They entered the apartment to find confusion in each room Bureau drawers had been turned upside down The desk had been examined with a reckless thoroughness Graham was frankly worried I wonder if he found anything If he did you won t get out of town What could he find Bobby asked If the court was planted Graham answered why shouldn t these rooms have been After last night I don t believe the court was planted Bobby said In the lower hall the elevator man handed Bobby the mail that had come since the night of his grandfather s murder In the car again he glanced over the envelopes He tore one open with a surprised haste This is Maria s handwriting he told Graham He read the hastily scrawled note aloud with a tone that failed toward the end DEAR BOBBY You must not as you say think me a bad sport You were very wicked last night Maybe you were so because of too many of those naughty little cocktails Why should you threaten poor Maria And you boasted you were going out to the Cedars to kill your grandfather because you didn t like him any more So I told Carlos to take you home I was afraid of a scene in public Come around Have tea with me Tell me you forgive me Tell me what was the matter with you She must have written that yesterday morning Bobby muttered Good Lord Hartley Then it was in my mind Unless that letter s a plant too Graham said Yet how could she know there d be a search Why shouldn t she have addressed it to the Cedars where there was a fair chance of its being opened and read by the police Why hasn t my man made any report on her We ve a number of questions to ask Maria But word came down from the dancer s apartment that Maria wasn t at home When did she go out Graham asked the hall man Not since I came on duty at six o clock Graham slipped a bill in the man s hand We ve an important message for her We d better leave it with the maid When they were alone in the upper hall he explained his purpose to Bobby We must know whether she s actually here If she isn t if she hasn t been back for the last twenty four hours don t you see It was yesterday afternoon you thought you saw a woman at the lake and last night a woman cried about the Cedars That s going pretty far Hartley It s a chance A physical one A pretty maid opened the door Her face was troubled She studied them with frank disappointment I thought she began That your mistress was coming back Graham flashed There was no concealment in the girl s manner It was certain that Maria was not in the apartment You remember me Bobby asked Yes You have been here You are a friend of mademoiselle s You can perhaps tell me where she is Bobby shook his head The girl spread her hands She burst out excitedly What is one to do I have telephoned the theatre There was no one there who knew anything at all except that mademoiselle had not appeared at the performance last night Graham glanced at Bobby When he asked did you see her last It was before luncheon yesterday Did she leave no instructions Didn t she say when she would be back The girl nodded That s what worries me for she said she would be back after the performance last night She left no instructions Graham repeated Only that if any one called or telephoned I was to make no appointments What am I to do Perhaps I shouldn t be talking to you She would never forgive me for an indiscretion For the present I advise you to do nothing Graham said You can safely leave all that to her managers I am going to see them now I will tell them what you have said The girl s eyes moistened Thank you sir I have been at my wits end Apparently she withheld nothing She played no part to confuse the dancer s friends On the way to the managers office with the trailing car behind them Graham reasoned excitedly For the first time we seem to be actually on the track Here s a tangible clue that may lead to the heart of the case Maria pulled the wool over the maid s eyes too She didn t want her to know her plans but her instructions show that she had no intention of returning last night She probably made a bee line for the Cedars It was probably she that you saw at the lake probably she who cried last night If only she hadn t written that note I can t get the meaning of it It s up to her managers now If they haven t heard from her it s a safe guess she s playing a deep game connected with the crying and the light at the deserted house and the disappearance of Paredes before dawn You must realize the connection between that and your condition the other evening after you had left them Bobby nodded He began to hope that at the managers office they would receive no explanation of Maria s absence destructive to Graham s theory Early as it was they found a bald headed man in his shirt sleeves pacing with an air of panic a blantantly furnished office Well he burst out as they entered My secretary tells me you ve come about this temperamental Carmen of mine Tell me where she is Quick 
118_47824_000015_000000	train-clean-100	Graham smiled 
none	none	at Bobby The manager ran his fingers across his bald and shining forehead It s no laughing matter Then she has definitely disappeared Graham said Disappeared Why did I come down at this ungodly hour except on the chance of getting some word She didn t even telephone last night I had to show myself in front of the curtain and give them a spiel about a sudden indisposition And believe me gentlemen audiences ain t what they used to be Did these ginks sit back and take the show for what it was worth Not by a darn sight Flocked to the box office and howled for their money back If she doesn t appear to night I might as well close the house I ll be ruined Unless Graham suggested you get your press agent to make capital out of her absence The papers would publish her picture and thousands of people would look her up for you The manager ceased his perplexed massage of his forehead He shook hands genially I d thought of that with some frills Has beautiful dancer met foul play Millions in jewels on her person when last seen Old stuff but they rise to it That will help Graham said to Bobby when they were in the car again The reporters will find Maria quicker than any detective I can put my hand on My man evidently fell down because she had gone before I got him on the case At his office they learned that was the fact The private detective had been able to get no slightest clue as to Maria s whereabouts Moreover Bobby s description of the stranger who had entered the cafe with her merely suggested a type familiar to the Tenderloin For purposes of identification it was worthless Always followed by the car from Smithtown they went to the hotel where Paredes had lived to a number of his haunts Bobby talked with men who knew him but he learned nothing Paredes s friends had had no word since the man s departure for the Cedars the day before So they turned their backs on the city elated by the significance of Maria s absence yet worried by the search and the watchful car which never lost sight of them When they were in the country Graham sighed his relief You haven t been stopped Therefore nothing was found at your apartment but if that wasn t planted why should Maria have sent an incriminating note there Unless Bobby answered she told the truth Unless she was sincere when she mailed it Unless she learned something important between the time she wrote it and her disappearance from her home Frankly Bobby Graham said the note and the circumstances under which it came to you are as damaging as the footprints and the handkerchief but it doesn t tell us how any human being could have entered that room to commit the murders and disturb the bodies At least we ve got one physical fact and I m going to work on that If it is Maria prowling around the Cedars Bobby said she s amazingly slippery and with Paredes gone what are you going to do with your physical fact And how does it explain the friendly influence that wiped out my footprints Is it a friendly or an evil influence that snatched away the evidence and that keeps it secreted We ll see Graham said I m going after a flesh and blood criminal who isn t you I m going to try to find out what your grandfather was afraid of the night of his murder After a time he glanced up You ve known Paredes for a long time Bobby but I don t think you ve ever told me how you met him A couple of years ago I should think Bobby answered Somebody brought him to the club I ve forgotten who Carlos was working for a big Panama importing firm He was trying to interest this chap in the New York end I saw him off and on after that and got to like him for his quiet manner and a queer dry wit he had in those days Two or three months ago he he seemed to fit into my humour and we became pretty chummy as you know Even after last night I hate to believe he s my enemy He s your enemy Graham answered and last night s the weak joint in his armour I wonder if Robinson didn t scare him away by threatening to question him Paredes isn t connected with that company now is he I gather he has no regular position No He s picked up one or two temporary things with the fruit companies More than his running away the thing that worries me about Carlos is his ridiculous suspicion of Katherine He told Graham in detail of that conversation 
118_47824_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Graham frowned 
none	none	He opened the throttle wider Their anxiety increased to know what had happened at the Cedars since their departure The outposts of the forest imposed silence closed eagerly about them seemed to welcome them to its dead loneliness There was a man on guard at the gate They hurried past The house showed no sign of life but when they entered the court Bobby saw Katherine at her window doubtless attracted by the sounds of their arrival Her face brightened but she raised her arms in a gesture suggestive of despair Does she mean the evidence has been found Bobby asked Graham made no attempt to conceal his real interest the impulse at the back of all his efforts in Bobby s behalf More likely Robinson has worried the life out of her since we ve been gone I oughtn t to have left her I set the trap myself When they were in the house their halting curiosity was lost in a vast surprise The hall was empty but they heard voices in the library They hurried across the dining room pausing in the doorway staring with unbelieving eyes at the accustomed picture they had least expected to see Paredes lounged on the divan smoking with easy indifference His clothing and his shoes were spotless He had shaved and his beard had been freshly trimmed Rawlins and the district attorney stood in front of the fireplace studying him with perplexed eyes The persistence of their regard even after Bobby s entrance suggested to him that the evidence remained secreted that the officers under the circumstances were scarcely interested in his return He was swept himself into an explosive amazement Carlos What the deuce are you doing here The Panamanian expelled a cloud of smoke He smiled Resting after a fatiguing walk In his unexpected presence Bobby fancied a demolition of the hope Graham and he had brought back from the city He couldn t imagine guilt lurking behind that serene manner Where did you come from What were you up to last night There was no accounting for Paredes s daring he told himself no accounting for his easy gesture now as he drew again at his cigarette and tossed it in the fireplace These gentlemen he said have been asking just that question I m honoured I had no idea my movements were of such interest I ve told them that I took a stroll The night was over There was no point in going to bed and all day I had been without exercise Yet Graham said harshly you have had practically no sleep since you came here Paredes nodded Very distressing isn t it Maybe Rawlins sneered you ll tell us why you went on tiptoe and I suppose you didn t hear a woman crying in the woods That s just it Paredes answered I did hear something like that and it occurred to me to follow such a curious sound So I went on tiptoe as you call it Why Robinson exclaimed angrily you walked in the lake to hide your tracks Paredes smiled It was very dark That was chance Quite silly of me My feet got wet I gather Rawlins said it was chance that took you to the deserted house Paredes shook his head Don t you think I was as much puzzled as the rest by that strange disappearing light It was as good a place to walk as any Where have you been since Graham asked When I had got there I was tired Paredes answered Since it wasn t far to the station I thought I d go on into Smithtown and have a bath and rest But I assure you I ve trudged back from the station just now Suddenly he repeated the apparently absurd formula he had used with Howells You know the court seems full of unfriendly things what the ignorant would call ghosts I m Spanish and I know After a moment he added The woods too I shouldn t care to wander through them too much after dark Robinson stared but Rawlins brushed the question aside What hotel did you go to in Smithtown It s called the New Nothing could be farther from the fact Shall I see if that s straight sir The district attorney agreed and Rawlins left the room Paredes laughed How interesting I m under suspicion It would be something wouldn t it to commit crimes with the devilish ingenuity of these No no mister District Attorney look to the ghosts They alone are sufficiently clever But I might say since you take this attitude that I don t care to answer any more questions until you discover something that might give you the right to ask them He lay back on the divan languidly lighting another cigarette Graham beckoned Robinson Bobby followed them out suspecting Graham s purpose unwilling that action should be taken too hastily against the Panamanian for even now guilty knowledge seemed incompatible with Paredes s polished reserve When he joined the others indeed Graham with an aggressive air was demanding the district attorney s intentions If he could elude you so easily last night it s common sense to put him where you can find him in case of need He s given you excuse enough The man s got me guessing Robinson mused but there are other elements What s happened since we left Graham asked quickly Have you got any trace of Howells s evidence Robinson smiled enigmatically but his failure was apparent I m like Howells he said I d risk nearly anything myself to learn how the room was entered how the crimes were committed how those poor devils were made to alter their positions So Bobby said you had my rooms in New York searched You had me followed to day It s ridiculous Robinson ignored him He stepped to the front door opened it and looked around the court What did the sphinx mean about ghosts in the court They walked out gazing helplessly at the trampled grass about the fountain at the melancholy walls at the partly opened window of the room of mystery He knows something Robinson mused Maybe you re right mister Graham but I wonder if I oughtn t to go farther and take you all Graham smiled uncomfortably but Bobby knew why the official failed to follow that radical course Like Howells he hesitated to remove from the Cedars the person most likely to solve its mystery As long as a chance remained that Howells had been right about Bobby he would give Silas Blackburn s grandson his head merely making sure as he had done this morning that there should be no escape He glanced up I wonder if our foreigner s laughing at me now Graham made a movement toward the door We might he said significantly find that out without disturbing him Robinson nodded and led the way silently back to the house Such a method was repugnant to Bobby and he followed at a distance Then he saw from the movements of the two men ahead that the library had again offered the unexpected and he entered Paredes was no longer in the room Bobby was about to speak but Robinson shook his head angrily raising his hand in a gesture of warning All three strained forward listening and Bobby caught the sound that had arrested the others a stealthy scraping that would have been inaudible except through such a brooding silence as pervaded the old house Bobby s interest quickened at this confirmation of Graham s theory There was a projection of cold fear moreover in its sly allusion It gave to his memory of Paredes with his tall graceful figure his lack of emotion his inscrutable eyes and his pointed beard a suggestion nearly satanic For the stealthy scraping had come from behind the closed door of the private staircase Howells had gone up that staircase None of them could forget for a moment that it led to the private hall outside the room in which the murders had been committed It occurred to Bobby that the triumph Graham s face expressed was out of keeping with the man It disturbed him nearly as thoroughly as Paredes s stealthy presence in that place We ve got him Graham whispered Robinson s bulky figure moved cautiously toward the door He grasped the knob swung the door open and stepped back smiling his satisfaction Half way down the staircase Paredes leaned against the wall one foot raised and outstretched as though an infinitely quiet descent had been interrupted The exposure had been too quick for his habit His face failed to hide its discomfiture His laugh rang false Hello I m afraid we ve caught you Paredes Graham said and the triumph blazed now in his voice What Paredes did then was more startling more out of key than any of his recent actions He came precipitately down His eyes were dangerous As Bobby watched the face whose quiet had at last been tempestuously destroyed he felt that the man was capable of anything under sufficient provocation Got me for what he snarled Tell us why you were sneaking up there In connection with your little excursion before dawn it suggests a guilty knowledge Paredes straightened He shrugged his shoulders With an admirable effort of the will he smoothed the rage from his face but for Bobby the satanic suggestion lingered Why do you suppose I m here he said in a restrained voice that scarcely rose above a whisper To help Bobby I was simply looking around for Bobby s sake That angered Bobby He wanted to cry out against the supposed friend who had at last shown his teeth That Graham laughed is why you sneaked why you didn t make any noise why you lost your temper when we caught you at it What about it mister District Attorney Robinson stepped forward Nothing else to do mister Graham He s too slippery I ll put him in a safe place You mean Paredes cried that you ll arrest me You ve guessed it I ll lock you up as a material witness Paredes swung on Bobby You ll permit this Bobby You ll forget that I am a guest in your house Bobby flushed Why have you stayed What were you doing up there Answer those questions Tell me what you want Paredes turned away He took a cigarette from his pocket and lighted it His fingers were not steady For the first time it became evident to Bobby Paredes was afraid Rawlins came back from the telephone He took in the tableau What s the rumpus Run this man to Smithtown Robinson directed Lock him up and tell the judge when he s arraigned in the morning that I want him held as a material witness He was at the hotel in Smithtown all right Rawlins said He tapped Paredes s arm You coming on this little joy ride like a lamb or a lion Say you ll find the jail about as comfortable as the New Hotel Paredes smiled The evil and dangerous light died in his eyes He became all at once easy and impervious again Like a lamb How else I m sorry Carlos Bobby muttered If you d only say something If you d only explain your movements If you d only really help Again Paredes shrugged his shoulders Handcuffs he asked Rawlins Rawlins ran his hands deftly over the Panamanian s clothing No armed neutrality for me he grinned All right We ll forget the bracelets since you haven t a gun Puffing at his cigarette Paredes got his coat and hat and followed the detective from the house Robinson and Graham climbed the private staircase to commence another systematic search of the hall to discover if they could the motive for Paredes s stealthy presence there Bobby accepted greedily this opportunity to find Katherine to learn from her undisturbed what had happened in the house that morning the meaning perhaps of her despairing gesture When in response to his knock she opened her door and stepped into the corridor he guessed her despair had been an expression of the increased strain of her helplessness in face of Robinson s harsh determination He questioned me for an hour she said principally about the heel mark in the court They cling to that because I don t think they ve found anything new at the lake You don t know anything about it do you Katherine You weren t there You didn t do that for me I wasn t there Bobby I honestly don t know any more about it than you do Carlos was in the court he mused Did you know they d taken him We found him creeping down the private stairway There was a hard quality about her gratitude I am glad Bobby The man makes me shudder and all morning they seemed more interested in you than in him They ve rummaged every room even mine She laughed feverishly That s why I ve been so upset They seemed She broke off She picked at her handkerchief After a moment she looked him frankly in the eyes and continued They seemed almost as doubtful of me as of you He recalled Paredes s suspicion of the girl It s nonsense Katherine And I m to blame for that too She put her finger to her lips Her smile was wistful Hush You mustn t blame yourself You mustn t think of that Again her solicitude their isolation in a darkened place tempted him aroused impulses nearly irresistible Her slender figure the pretty face grown familiar and more desirable through all these years swept him to a harsher revolt than he had conquered in the library In the face of Graham in spite of his own intolerable position he knew he couldn t fight that truth eternally She must have noticed his struggle without grasping its cause for she touched his hand and the wistfulness of her expression increased I wish you wouldn t think of me Bobby It s you we must all think of He accepted with a cold dismay the sisterly anxiety of her attitude It made his renunciation easier He walked away Why do you go she called after him He gestured vaguely without turning He didn t see her again until dinner time She was as silent then as she had been the night before when Howells had sat with them his moroseness veiling a sharp interest in the plan that was to lead to his death Robinson s mood was very different He talked a great deal making no effort to hide his irritation His failure to find any clue in the private staircase after Paredes s arrest had clearly stimulated his interest in Bobby The sharp little eyes surrounded by puffy flesh held a threat for him Bobby was glad when the meal ended Howells s body was taken away that night It was a relief for all of them to know that the old room was empty again I daresay you won t sleep there Graham said to Robinson Robinson glanced at Bobby Not as things stand he answered The library lounge is plenty good enough for me tonight Graham went upstairs with Bobby There was no question about his purpose He wouldn t repeat last night s mistake At least he said when the door was closed behind them I can see if you do get up and wander about in your sleep I d bet a good deal that you won t If I did it would be an indication Granted it s your custom what is there to tempt you to night Bobby answered half jesting You ve not forgotten Robinson on the library sofa The man isn t exactly working for me Tonight he seems almost as unfriendly as Howells was He yawned I ought to sleep now if ever I ve seldom been so tired Two such nights He hesitated But I am glad you re here Hartley I can go to sleep with a more comfortable feeling Don t worry Graham said You ll sleep quietly enough and we ll all be better for a good rest For only a little while they talked of the mystery While Graham regretted his failure to find any trace of Maria their voices dwindled sleepily Bobby recalled his last thought before losing himself last night He tried to force from his mind now the threat in Robinson s eyes He told himself again and again that the man wasn t actually unfriendly Then the blackness encircled him He slept Almost at once it seemed to him he was fighting away demanding drowsily What s the matter Leave me alone He heard Graham s voice unnaturally subdued and anxious What are you doing Bobby Then Bobby knew he was no longer in his bed that he stood instead in a cold place and the meaning of his position came with a rush of sick terror Get hold of yourself Graham said Come back Bobby opened his eyes He was in the upper hall at the head of the stairs Unconsciously he had been about to creep quietly down perhaps to the library Graham had awakened him It seemed to offer the answer to everything It seemed to give outline to a monstrous familiar that drowned his real self in the black pit while it conducted his body to the commission of unspeakable crimes He lurched into the bedroom and sat shivering on the bed Graham entered and quietly closed the door What time is it Bobby asked hoarsely Half past two I don t think Robinson was aroused The damp moon gave an ominous unreality to the room What did I do Bobby whispered Got softly out of bed and went to the hall It was uncanny You were like an automaton I didn t wake you at once You see I I thought you might go to the old room Bobby shook again He drew a blanket about his shoulders And you believed I d show the way in and out but the room was empty so I was going downstairs He shuddered Good God Then it s all true I did it for the money I put Howells out to protect myself I was going after Robinson It s true Hartley Tell me Do you think it s true Graham turned away Don t ask me to say anything to help you just now he answered huskily for after this I don t dare Bobby I don t dare CHAPTER VII THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD Bobby returned to his bed 
118_47824_000002_000001	train-clean-100	He lay there still shivering beneath the heavy blankets 
118_47824_000002_000002	train-clean-100	 I don t dare He echoed Graham s words There s nothing else any one can say 
118_47824_000002_000003	train-clean-100	I must decide what to do 
118_47824_000002_000004	train-clean-100	I must think it over 
118_47824_000003_000000	train-clean-100	But as always thought brought no release 
118_47824_000003_000001	train-clean-100	It merely insisted that the case against him was proved 
none	none	At last he had been seen slipping unconsciously from his room and at the same hour All that remained was to learn how he had accomplished the apparent miracles Then no excuse would remain for not going to Robinson and confessing The woman at the lake and in the courtyard the movement of the body and the vanishing of the evidence under his hand Paredes s odd behaviour all became in his mind puzzling details that failed to obscure the chief fact 
118_47824_000003_000006	train-clean-100	After this something must be done about Paredes s detention 
none	none	He hadn t dreamed that his weariness could placate even momentarily such reflections but at last he slept again He was aroused by the tramping of men around the house and strange harsh voices 
118_47824_000004_000002	train-clean-100	He raised himself on his elbow and glanced from the window 
none	none	It had long been daylight 
118_47824_000004_000004	train-clean-100	Two burly fellows in overalls carrying pick and spade across their shoulders pushed through the underbrush at the edge of the clearing 
none	none	He turned 
118_47824_000004_000006	train-clean-100	Graham fully dressed stood at the side of the bed 
118_47824_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Those men Bobby asked wearily 
118_47824_000006_000000	train-clean-100	 The grave diggers Graham answered 
none	none	They are going to work in the old cemetery to prepare a place for Silas Blackburn with his fathers 
118_47824_000006_000002	train-clean-100	That s why I ve come to wake you up 
118_47824_000006_000003	train-clean-100	The minister s telephoned Katherine 
118_47824_000006_000004	train-clean-100	He will be here before noon 
118_47824_000006_000005	train-clean-100	Do you know it s after ten o clock 
118_47824_000007_000000	train-clean-100	For some time Bobby stared through the window at the desolate ragged landscape 
118_47824_000007_000001	train-clean-100	It was abnormally cold even for the late fall 
118_47824_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Dull clouds obscured the sun and furnished an illusion of crowding earthward 
118_47824_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 A funereal day 
none	none	The words slipped into his mind He repeated them
118_47824_000010_000000	train-clean-100	 When your grandfather s buried Graham answered softly we ll all feel happier 
118_47824_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 Why Bobby asked 
118_47824_000011_000001	train-clean-100	 It won t lessen the fact of his murder 
118_47824_000012_000000	train-clean-100	 Time Graham said lessens such facts even for the police 
118_47824_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby glanced at him flushing 
none	none	You mean you ve decided to stand by me after what happened last night Graham smiled I ve thought it all over 
118_47824_000016_000001	train-clean-100	I slept like a top last night 
none	none	I heard nothing I saw nothing Ought I to want you to stand by me Bobby said Oughtn t I to make a clean breast of it At least I must do something about Paredes Graham frowned It s hard to believe he had any connection with your sleep walking last night yet it s as clear as ever that Maria and he are up to some game in which you figure
118_47824_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 He shouldn t be in jail Bobby persisted 
118_47824_000021_000000	train-clean-100	 Get up Graham advised 
none	none	Bathe and have some breakfast then we can decide There s no use talking of the other thing I ve forgotten it 
118_47824_000021_000004	train-clean-100	As far as possible you must 
118_47824_000022_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby sprang upright 
118_47824_000023_000000	train-clean-100	 How can I forget it 
118_47824_000023_000001	train-clean-100	If it was hard to face sleep before what do you think it is now 
none	none	Have I any right
118_47824_000024_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t Graham said 
none	none	I ll be with you again to night If I were satisfied beyond the shadow of a doubt I d advise you to confess but I can t be until I know what Maria and Paredes are doing 
118_47824_000025_000000	train-clean-100	When Bobby had bathed and dressed he found in spite of his mental turmoil that his sleep had done him good 
none	none	While he breakfasted Graham urged him to eat tried to drive from his brain the morbid aftermath of last night s revealing moment
118_47824_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 The manager took my advice but Maria s still missing 
118_47824_000026_000001	train-clean-100	Her pictures are in most of the papers 
none	none	There have been reporters here this morning about the murders He strolled over and handed Bobby a number of newspapers
118_47824_000028_000000	train-clean-100	 Where s Robinson Bobby asked 
none	none	I saw him in the court a while ago I daresay he s wandering around perhaps watching the men at the grave
118_47824_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 He learned nothing new last night 
none	none	I was with him at breakfast 
118_47824_000031_000001	train-clean-100	I gather not 
118_47824_000032_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby looked up 
118_47824_000033_000000	train-clean-100	 Isn t that an automobile coming through the woods he asked 
none	none	Maybe Rawlins back from Smithtown or the minister 
118_47824_000035_000000	train-clean-100	The car stopped at the entrance of the court 
118_47824_000035_000001	train-clean-100	They heard the remote tinkling of the front door bell 
118_47824_000035_000002	train-clean-100	Jenkins passed through 
118_47824_000035_000003	train-clean-100	The cold air invading the hall and the dining room told them he had opened the door His sharp exclamation recalled Howells s report which at their direction he had failed to mail 
118_47824_000035_000004	train-clean-100	Had his exclamation been drawn by an accuser 
118_47824_000035_000005	train-clean-100	Bobby started to rise 
118_47824_000035_000006	train-clean-100	Graham moved toward the door 
none	none	Then Jenkins entered and stood to one side Bobby shared his astonishment for Paredes walked in unbuttoning his overcoat the former easy mannered uncommunicative foreigner 
118_47824_000035_000009	train-clean-100	He appeared moreover to have slept pleasantly 
none	none	His eyes showed no weariness his clothing no disarrangement He spoke at once quite as if nothing disagreeable had shadowed his departure
118_47824_000036_000000	train-clean-100	 Good morning 
none	none	If I had dreamed of this change in the weather I would have brought a heavier overcoat 
118_47824_000036_000002	train-clean-100	I ve nearly frozen driving from Smithtown 
118_47824_000037_000000	train-clean-100	Before either man could grope for a suitable greeting he faced Bobby 
none	none	He felt in his pockets with whimsical discouragement
118_47824_000038_000000	train-clean-100	 Fact is Bobby I left New York too suddenly 
none	none	I hadn t noticed until a little while ago You see I spent a good deal in Smithtown yesterday Bobby spoke with an obvious confusion What do you mean Carlos I thought you were 
118_47824_000041_000000	train-clean-100	Graham interrupted with a flat demand for an explanation 
118_47824_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 How did you get away 
none	none	Paredes waved his hand
118_47824_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Later mister Graham 
118_47824_000044_000001	train-clean-100	There is a hack driver outside who is even more suspicious than you 
118_47824_000044_000002	train-clean-100	He wants to be paid 
118_47824_000044_000003	train-clean-100	I asked Rawlins to drive me back but he rushed from the courthouse probably to telephone his rotund superior 
118_47824_000044_000004	train-clean-100	Fact is this fellow wants five dollars an outrageous rate 
none	none	I ve told him so but it doesn t do any good So will you lend me Bobby Bobby handed him a banknote He didn t miss Graham s meaning glance Paredes gave the money to the butler Pay him will you Jenkins Thanks 
118_47824_000047_000000	train-clean-100	He surveyed the remains of Bobby s breakfast 
none	none	He sat down May I My breakfast was early and prison food when you re not in the habit 
118_47824_000049_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby tried to account for Paredes s friendly manner 
none	none	That he should have come back at all was sufficiently strange but it was harder to understand why he should express no resentment for his treatment yesterday why he should fail to refer to Bobby s questions at the moment of his arrest or to the openly expressed enmity of Graham 
118_47824_000049_000002	train-clean-100	Only one theory promised to fit at all 
118_47824_000049_000003	train-clean-100	It was necessary for the Panamanian to return to the Cedars 
118_47824_000049_000004	train-clean-100	His purpose whatever it was compelled him to remain for the present in the mournful tragic house 
118_47824_000049_000005	train-clean-100	Therefore he would crush his justifiable anger 
118_47824_000049_000006	train-clean-100	He would make it practically impossible for Bobby to refuse his hospitality 
none	none	And he had asked for money only a trifling sum yet Graham would grasp at the fact to support his earlier suspicion 
118_47824_000050_000000	train-clean-100	Paredes s arrival possessed one virtue It diverted Bobby s thoughts temporarily from his own dilemma from his inability to chart a course 
118_47824_000051_000000	train-clean-100	Graham on the other hand was ill at ease 
none	none	Beyond a doubt he was disarmed by Paredes s good humour 
118_47824_000051_000002	train-clean-100	For him yesterday s incident was not so lightly to be passed over 
118_47824_000051_000003	train-clean-100	Eventually his curiosity conquered 
118_47824_000051_000004	train-clean-100	The words came nevertheless with some difficulty 
118_47824_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 We scarcely expected you back 
118_47824_000053_000000	train-clean-100	His laugh was short and embarrassed 
none	none	We took it for granted you would find it necessary to stay in Smithtown for a while Paredes sipped the coffee which Jenkins had poured
118_47824_000056_000000	train-clean-100	 Splendid coffee 
118_47824_000056_000001	train-clean-100	You should have tasted what I had this morning 
118_47824_000056_000002	train-clean-100	Simple enough mister Graham 
118_47824_000056_000003	train-clean-100	I telephoned as soon as Rawlins got me to the Bastille 
none	none	I communicated with the lawyer who represents the company for which I once worked He s a prominent and brilliant man 
118_47824_000056_000006	train-clean-100	He planned it with some local fellow 
none	none	When I was arraigned at the opening of court this morning the judge could hold me only as a material witness 
118_47824_000056_000008	train-clean-100	He fixed a pretty stiff bail but the local lawyer was there with a bondsman and I came back 
118_47824_000056_000009	train-clean-100	My clothes are here 
118_47824_000056_000010	train-clean-100	You don t mind Bobby 
118_47824_000057_000000	train-clean-100	That moment in the hall when Graham had awakened him urged Bobby to reply with a genuine warmth 
none	none	I don t mind 
118_47824_000058_000001	train-clean-100	I m glad you re out of it 
none	none	I m sorry you went as you did I was tired at my wits end 
118_47824_000058_000003	train-clean-100	Your presence in the private staircase was the last straw 
118_47824_000058_000004	train-clean-100	You will forgive us Carlos 
none	none	Paredes smiled 
118_47824_000059_000001	train-clean-100	He put down his coffee cup and lighted a cigarette 
118_47824_000059_000002	train-clean-100	He smoked with a vast contentment 
118_47824_000060_000000	train-clean-100	 That s better 
118_47824_000060_000001	train-clean-100	Nothing to forgive Bobby 
118_47824_000060_000002	train-clean-100	Let us call it a misunderstanding 
118_47824_000061_000000	train-clean-100	Graham moved closer 
none	none	Perhaps you ll tell us now what you were doing in the private staircase Paredes blew a wreath of smoke 
118_47824_000063_000001	train-clean-100	His eyes still smiled but his voice was harder 
118_47824_000064_000000	train-clean-100	 Bygones are bygones 
none	none	Isn t that so Bobby
118_47824_000065_000000	train-clean-100	 Since you wish it Bobby said 
118_47824_000066_000000	train-clean-100	But more important than the knowledge Graham desired loomed the old question 
118_47824_000066_000001	train-clean-100	What was the man s game 
none	none	What held him here 
118_47824_000067_000000	train-clean-100	Robinson entered 
none	none	The flesh around his eyes was puffier than it had been yesterday Worry had increased the incongruous discontent of his round face 
118_47824_000067_000003	train-clean-100	Clearly he had slept little 
118_47824_000068_000000	train-clean-100	 I saw you arrive he said 
none	none	Rawlins warned me But I must say I didn t think you d use your freedom to come to us Paredes laughed
118_47824_000070_000000	train-clean-100	 Since the law won t hold me at your convenience in Smithtown I keep myself at your service here if Bobby permits it 
118_47824_000070_000001	train-clean-100	Could you ask more 
none	none	Bobby shrank from the man with whom he had idled away so much time and money 
118_47824_000071_000001	train-clean-100	That fleeting satanic impression of yesterday came back sharper more alarming 
none	none	Paredes s clear challenge to the district attorney was the measure of his strength His mind was subtler than theirs 
118_47824_000071_000004	train-clean-100	His reserve and easy daring mastered them all and always as now he laughed at the futility of their efforts to sound his purposes to limit his freedom of action 
118_47824_000071_000005	train-clean-100	Bobby didn t care to meet the uncommunicative eyes whose depths he had never been able to explore 
118_47824_000071_000006	train-clean-100	Was there a special power there that could control the destinies of other people that might make men walk unconsciously to accomplish the ends of an unscrupulous brain 
118_47824_000072_000000	train-clean-100	The district attorney appeared as much at sea as the others 
none	none	Thanks he said dryly to Paredes And glancing at Bobby he asked with a hollow scorn
118_47824_000075_000000	train-clean-100	 You ve no objection to the gentleman visiting you for the present 
none	none	If he wishes Bobby answered a trifle amused at Robinson s obvious fancy of a collusion between Paredes and himself Robinson jerked his head toward the window
118_47824_000078_000000	train-clean-100	 I ve been watching the preparations out there 
none	none	I guess when he s laid away you ll be thinking about having the will read No hurry Bobby answered with a quick intake of breath
118_47824_000080_000000	train-clean-100	 I suppose not Robinson sneered since everybody knows well enough what s in it 
none	none	Bobby arose Robinson still sneered
118_47824_000082_000000	train-clean-100	 You ll be at the grave as chief mourner 
118_47824_000083_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby walked from the room 
none	none	He hadn t cared to reply He feared as it was that he had let slip his increased self doubt 
118_47824_000083_000003	train-clean-100	He put on his coat and hat and left the house 
none	none	The raw cold the year s first omen of winter made his blood run quicker forced into his mind a cleansing stimulation 
118_47824_000083_000005	train-clean-100	But almost immediately even that prophylactic was denied him 
118_47824_000083_000006	train-clean-100	With his direction a matter of indifference chance led him into the thicket at the side of the house 
118_47824_000083_000007	train-clean-100	He had walked some distance 
118_47824_000083_000008	train-clean-100	The underbrush had long interposed a veil between him and the Cedars above whose roofs smoke wreathed in the still air like fantastic figures weaving a shroud to lower over the time stained melancholy walls 
118_47824_000083_000009	train-clean-100	For once he was grateful to the forest because it had forbidden him to glance perpetually back at that dismal and pensive picture 
118_47824_000083_000010	train-clean-100	Then he became aware of twigs hastily lopped off of bushes bent and torn of the uncovering through these careless means of an old path 
none	none	Simultaneously there reached his ears the scraping of metal implements in the soft soil the dull thud of earth falling regularly 
118_47824_000083_000012	train-clean-100	He paused listening 
118_47824_000083_000013	train-clean-100	The labour of the men was given an uncouth rhythm by their grunting expulsions of breath 
118_47824_000083_000014	train-clean-100	Otherwise the nature of their industry and its surroundings had imposed upon them a silence in itself beast like and unnatural 
none	none	At last a harsh voice came to Bobby 
118_47824_000084_000001	train-clean-100	Its brevity pointed the previous dumbness of the speaker 
none	none	Deep enough And Bobby turned and hurried back along the roughly restored path as if fleeing from an immaterial thing suddenly quickened with the power of accusation He could picture the fresh oblong excavation in the soil of the family burial ground 
118_47824_000087_000001	train-clean-100	He could see where the men had had to tear bushes from among the graves in order to insert their tools 
118_47824_000087_000002	train-clean-100	There was an ironical justice in the condition of the old cemetery 
none	none	It had received no interment since the death of Katherine s father 
118_47824_000087_000004	train-clean-100	Like everything about the Cedars Silas Blackburn had delivered it to the swift obliterating fingers of time 
none	none	If the old man in his selfishness had paused to gaze beyond the inevitable fact of death Bobby reflected he would have guarded with a more precious interest the drapings of his final sleep 
118_47824_000088_000000	train-clean-100	This necessary task on which Bobby had stumbled had made the thicket less congenial than the house 
118_47824_000088_000001	train-clean-100	As he walked back he forecasted with a keen apprehension his approaching ordeal 
118_47824_000088_000002	train-clean-100	It would doubtless be more difficult to endure than Howells s experiment over Silas Blackburn s body in the old room 
118_47824_000088_000003	train-clean-100	Could he witness the definite imprisonment of his grandfather in a narrow box could he watch the covering earth fall noisily in that bleak place of silence without displaying for Robinson the guilt that impressed him more and more 
118_47824_000089_000000	train-clean-100	A strange man appeared walking from the direction of the house 
118_47824_000089_000001	train-clean-100	His black clothing relieved only by narrow edges of white cuffs between the sleeves and the heavy mourning gloves fitted with solemn harmony into the landscape and Bobby s mood 
none	none	Such a figure was appropriate to the Cedars Bobby stepped to one side placing a screen of dead foliage between himself and the man whose profession it was to mourn He emerged from the forest and saw again the leisurely weaving of the smoke shroud above the house Then his eyes were drawn by the restless movements of a pair of horses standing in the shafts of a black wagon at the court entrance and his ordeal became like a vast morass which offers no likely path yet whose crossing is the price of salvation 
118_47824_000090_000000	train-clean-100	He was glad to see Graham leave the court and hurry toward him 
118_47824_000091_000000	train-clean-100	 I was coming to hunt you up Bobby 
118_47824_000091_000001	train-clean-100	The minister s arrived 
118_47824_000091_000002	train-clean-100	So has Doctor Groom 
118_47824_000091_000003	train-clean-100	Everything s about ready 
none	none	Doctor Groom Yes He used to see a good deal of your grandfather It s natural enough he should be here 
118_47824_000094_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby agreed indifferently 
118_47824_000094_000001	train-clean-100	They walked slowly back to the house 
118_47824_000094_000002	train-clean-100	Graham made it plain that his mind was far from the sad business ahead 
none	none	What do you think of Paredes coming back as if nothing were wrong he asked
118_47824_000095_000001	train-clean-100	 He ignores what happened yesterday 
118_47824_000095_000002	train-clean-100	He settles himself in the Cedars again 
118_47824_000096_000000	train-clean-100	 I don t know what to think of it Bobby answered 
118_47824_000096_000001	train-clean-100	 This morning Carlos gave me the creeps 
none	none	Graham glanced at him curiously He spoke with pronounced deliberation startling Bobby for this friend expressed practically the thought that Paredes s arrival had driven into his own mind
118_47824_000098_000000	train-clean-100	 Gave me the creeps too 
none	none	Makes me surer than ever that he has an abominably deep purpose in using his wits to hang on here 
118_47824_000098_000002	train-clean-100	He suggests resources as hard to understand as anything that has happened in the old room 
118_47824_000098_000003	train-clean-100	You ll confess Bobby he s had a good deal of influence over you an influence for evil 
none	none	I ve liked to go around with him if that s what you mean Isn t he the cause of the last two or three months nonsense in New York
118_47824_000101_000000	train-clean-100	 I won t blame Carlos for that Bobby muttered 
none	none	He influenced you against your better judgment Graham persisted to refuse to leave with me the night of your grandfather s death
118_47824_000103_000000	train-clean-100	 Maria did her share Bobby said 
118_47824_000104_000000	train-clean-100	He broke off looking at Graham 
none	none	What are you driving at
118_47824_000106_000000	train-clean-100	 I ve been asking myself since he came back Graham answered if there s any queer power behind his quiet manner 
none	none	Maybe he is psychic Maybe he can do things we don t understand I ve wondered if he had without your knowing it acquired sufficient influence to direct your body when your mind no longer controlled it 
118_47824_000106_000003	train-clean-100	It s a nasty thought but I ve heard of such things 
118_47824_000107_000000	train-clean-100	 You mean Carlos may have made me go to the hall last night perhaps sent me to the old room those other times 
118_47824_000108_000000	train-clean-100	Now that another had expressed the idea Bobby fought it with all his might 
none	none	No 
118_47824_000109_000001	train-clean-100	I won t believe it 
118_47824_000109_000002	train-clean-100	I ve been weak Hartley but not that weak 
118_47824_000109_000003	train-clean-100	And I tell you I did feel Howells s body move under my hand 
118_47824_000110_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t misunderstand me Graham said gently 
118_47824_000110_000001	train-clean-100	 I must consider every possibility 
118_47824_000110_000002	train-clean-100	You were excited and imaginative when you went to the old room to take the evidence 
118_47824_000110_000003	train-clean-100	It was a shock to have your candle go out Your own hand reaching out to Howells might have moved spasmodically 
none	none	I mean you may have been responsible for the thing without realizing it And the disappearance of the evidence Bobby defended himself
118_47824_000112_000000	train-clean-100	 If it had been stolen earlier the coat pocket might have retained its bulging shape 
none	none	We know now that Paredes is capable of sneaking around the house
118_47824_000113_000000	train-clean-100	 No no Bobby said hotly 
118_47824_000113_000001	train-clean-100	 You re trying to take away my one hope But I was there and you weren t 
none	none	I know with my own senses what happened and you don t Paredes has no such influence over me 
118_47824_000113_000004	train-clean-100	I won t think of it 
118_47824_000114_000000	train-clean-100	 If it s so far fetched Graham asked quietly why do you revolt from the idea 
118_47824_000115_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby turned on him 
118_47824_000116_000000	train-clean-100	 And why do you fill my mind with such thoughts 
118_47824_000116_000001	train-clean-100	If you think I m guilty say so 
118_47824_000116_000002	train-clean-100	Go tell Robinson so 
118_47824_000117_000000	train-clean-100	He glanced away while the angry colour left his face 
none	none	He was a little dazed by the realization that he had spoken to Graham as he might have done to an enemy as he had spoken to Howells in the old bedroom 
118_47824_000117_000002	train-clean-100	He felt the touch of Graham s hand on his shoulder 
none	none	I m only working in your service Graham said kindly I m sorry if I ve troubled you by seeking physical facts in order to escape the ghosts 
118_47824_000118_000002	train-clean-100	For Groom has brought the ghosts back with him 
118_47824_000118_000003	train-clean-100	Don t make any mistake about that 
118_47824_000118_000004	train-clean-100	You want the truth don t you 
118_47824_000119_000000	train-clean-100	 Yes Bobby said even if it does for me 
118_47824_000119_000001	train-clean-100	But I want it quickly 
118_47824_000119_000002	train-clean-100	I can t go on this way indefinitely 
118_47824_000120_000000	train-clean-100	Yet that flash of temper had given him courage to face the ordeal 
118_47824_000120_000001	train-clean-100	A lingering resentment at Graham s suggestion lessened the difficulty of his position 
118_47824_000120_000002	train-clean-100	Entering the court he scarcely glanced at the black wagon 
118_47824_000121_000000	train-clean-100	There were more dark clothed men in the hall 
none	none	Rawlins had returned From the rug in front of the fireplace he surveyed the group with a bland curiosity Robinson sat near by glowering at Paredes 
118_47824_000121_000003	train-clean-100	The Panamanian had changed his clothing 
118_47824_000121_000004	train-clean-100	He too was sombrely dressed and instead of the vivid necktie he had worn from the courthouse a jet black scarf was perfectly arranged beneath his collar 
118_47824_000121_000005	train-clean-100	He lounged opposite the district attorney his eyes studying the fire 
none	none	His fingers on the chair arm were restless 
118_47824_000122_000000	train-clean-100	Doctor Groom stood at the foot of the stairs talking with the clergyman a stout and unctuous figure 
none	none	Bobby noticed that the great stolid form of the doctor was ill at ease 
118_47824_000122_000002	train-clean-100	From his thickly bearded face his reddish eyes gleamed forth with a fresh instability 
none	none	The clergyman shook hands with Bobby
118_47824_000123_000001	train-clean-100	 We need not delay 
118_47824_000123_000002	train-clean-100	Your cousin is upstairs He included the company in his circling turn of the head 
118_47824_000124_000000	train-clean-100	 Any one who cares to go 
118_47824_000125_000000	train-clean-100	Bobby forced himself to walk up the staircase facing the first phase of his ordeal 
118_47824_000125_000001	train-clean-100	He saw that the district attorney realized that too for he sprang from his chair and followed by Rawlins started upward The entire company crowded the stairs 
none	none	At the top Bobby found Paredes at his side Carlos Why do you come I would like to be of some comfort Paredes answered gravely His fingers on the banister made that restless groping movement 
118_47824_000129_000000	train-clean-100	Graham summoned Katherine 
118_47824_000129_000001	train-clean-100	One of the black clothed men opened the door of Silas Blackburn s room 
118_47824_000129_000002	train-clean-100	He stepped aside beckoning 
none	none	He had an air of a showman craving approbation for the surprise he has arranged Bobby went in with the others Automatically through the dim light he catalogued remembered objects all intimate to his grandfather each oddly entangled in his mind with his dislike of the old man 
118_47824_000130_000002	train-clean-100	The iron bed the chest of drawers scratched and with broken handles the closed colonial desk the miserly rag carpet all seemed mutely asking as Bobby did why their owner had deserted them the other night and delivered himself to the ghostly mystery of the old bedroom 
118_47824_000131_000000	train-clean-100	Reluctantly Bobby s glance went to the centre of the floor where the casket rested on trestles 
none	none	From the chest of drawers two candles the only light played wanly over the still figure and the ashen face So for the second time the living met the dead and the law watched hopefully 
118_47824_000132_000000	train-clean-100	Robinson stood opposite but he didn t look at Silas Blackburn who could no longer accuse 
none	none	He stared instead at Bobby and Bobby kept repeating to himself I didn t do this thing I didn t do this thing And he searched the face of the dead man for a confirmation A chill thought not without excuse under the circumstances and in this vague light raced along his nerves Silas Blackburn had moved once since his death If the power to move and speak should miraculously return to him now In this house there appeared to be no impossibilities The cold control of death had been twice broken Katherine s entrance swung his thoughts and released him for a moment from Robinson s watchfulness He found he could turn from the wrinkled face that had fascinated him that had seemed to question him with a calm and complete knowledge to the lovely one that was active with a little smile of encouragement He was grateful for that It taught him that in the heavy presence of death and from the harsh trappings of mourning the magnetism of youth is unconquerable So in affection he found an antidote for fear Even Graham s quick movement to her side couldn t make her presence less helpful to Bobby He looked at his grandfather again He glanced at Robinson As in a dream he heard the clergyman say The service will be read at the grave Almost indifferently he saw the dark clothed men sidle forward lift a grotesquely shaped plate of metal from the floor and fit it in place hiding from his eyes the closed eyes of the dead man He nodded and stepped to the hall when Robinson tapped his arm and whispered Make way mister Blackburn He watched the sombre men carry their heavy burden across the hall down the stairs and into the dull autumn air He followed at the side of Katherine across the clearing and into the overgrown path He was aware of the others drifting behind Katherine slipped her hand in his It is dreadful we shouldn t feel more sorrow more regret she said Perhaps we never understood him That is dreadful too for no one understood him We are the only mourners Bobby as they threaded the path behind the stumbling bearers found a grim justice in that also Because of his selfishness Silas Blackburn had lived alone Because of it he must go to his long rest with no other mourners than these and their eyes were dry Bobby clung to Katherine s hand If I could only know he whispered She pressed his hand She did not reply Ahead the forest was scarred by a yellow wound The bearers set their burden down beside it glancing at each other with relief Across the heap of earth Bobby saw the waiting excavation In his ears vibrated the memory of the harsh voice It s deep enough Another voice droned It was soft and unctuous It seemed to take a pleasure in the terrible words it loosed to stray eternally through the decaying forest Bobby glanced at bent stones strangled by the underbrush at other slabs cracked and brown which lay prone half covered by creeping vines The tones of the clergyman were no longer revolting in his ears He scarcely heard them He imagined a fantasy He pictured the inhabitants of these forgotten narrow houses straying to the great dwelling where they had lived punishing this one bringing him to suffer with them the degradation of their neglect So Robinson became less important in his mind Through such fancies the ordeal was made bearable A wind sprang up rattling through the trees and disturbing the vines on the fallen stones Later he thought it would snow and he shivered for those left helpless to sleep in the sad forest The dark clothed men strained at ropes now They glanced at Katherine and Bobby as at those most to be impressed by their skill They lowered Silas Blackburn s grimly shaped casing into the sorrel pit It passed from Bobby s sight The two roughly dressed labourers came from the thicket where they had hidden and with their spades approached the grave The sound from whose imminence Bobby had shrunk rattled in his ears The yellow earth cut across the stormy twilight of the cemetery and scattered in the trench After a time the response lost its metallic petulance Katherine pulled at Bobby s hand He started and glanced up One of the black clothed men was speaking to him with a professional gentleness You needn t wait mister Blackburn Everything is finished He saw now that Robinson stood across the grave still staring at him The professional mourner smiled sympathetically and moved away Katherine Robinson the two grave diggers and Bobby alone were left of the little company and Bobby staring back at the district attorney took a sombre pride in facing it out until even the men with the spades had gone The ordeal he reflected had lost its poignancy His mind was intent on the empty trappings he had witnessed He wondered if there was after all no justice against his grandfather in this unkempt burial The place might have something to tell him If it could only make him believe that beyond the inevitable fact nothing mattered If he were sure of that it would offer a way out at the worst perhaps the happiest exit for Katherine s sake Then Doctor Groom returned His huge hairy figure dominated the cemetery His infused eyes beneath the thick black brows were far seeing They seemed to penetrate Bobby s thought Then they glanced at the excavation appearing to intimate that Silas Blackburn s earthy blanket could hide nothing from the closed eyes it sheltered At his age he faced the near approach of that inevitable fact and he didn t hesitate to look beyond Bobby knew what Graham had meant when he had said that Groom had brought the ghosts back with him It was as if the cemetery had recalled the old doctor to answer his presumptuous question There s no use your staying here The resonance of the deep voice jarred through the woods The broad shoulders twitched One of the hairy hands made a half circle I hope you ll clean this up my boy You ought to replace the stones and trim the graves You couldn t blame them could you if these old people were restless and tried to go abroad For Bobby in spite of himself the man on whose last shelter the earth continued to fall became once more a potent thing able to appraise the penalty of his own carelessness Come Katherine whispered But Bobby lingered oddly fascinated supporting the ordeal to its final moment The blows of the backs of the spades on the completed mound beat into his brain the end The workmen wandered off through the woods From a distance the harsh voice of one of them came back I don t want to dig again in such a place People don t seem dead there Robinson tried to laugh That man s wise he said to the doctor If Paredes spoke of this cemetery as being full of ghosts I could understand him The doctor s deep bass answered thoughtfully Paredes is probably right The man has a special sense but I have felt it myself The Cedars and the forest are full of things that seem to whisper things that one never sees Such things might have an excuse for evil Let s get out of it Robinson said gruffly Katherine withdrew her hand Bobby reached for it again but she seemed not to notice She walked ahead of him along the path her shoulders a trifle bent Bobby caught up with her Katherine he said Don t talk to me Bobby He looked closer He saw that she was crying at last Tears stained her cheeks Her lips were strange to him in the distortion of a grief that seeks to control itself He slackened his pace and let her walk ahead He followed with a sort of awe that there should have been grief for Silas Blackburn after all He blamed himself because his own eyes were not moist Back of him he heard the murmuring conversation of the doctor and the district attorney Strangely it made him sorry that Robinson should have been more impressed than Howells by the doctor s beliefs They stepped into the clearing The wind had dissipated the smoke shroud It was no longer low over the roofs Against the forest and the darker clouds the house had a stark appearance It was like a frame from which the flesh has fallen The black wagon had gone The Cedars was left alone to the solution of its mystery Paredes Graham and Rawlins waited for them in the hall There was nothing to say Paredes placed with a delicate accuracy fresh logs upon the fire He arose flecking the wood dust from his hands How cold it will be here he mused how impossible of entrance when the house is left as empty as the woods to those who only go unseen Bobby saw Katherine s shoulders shake She had dried her eyes but in her face was expressed an aversion for solitude a desire for any company even that of the man she disliked and feared Robinson took Rawlins to the library for another futile consultation Bobby guessed Katherine sat on the arm of a chair thrusting one foot toward the fresh blaze It will snow she said It is very early for that No one answered The strain tightened The flames leapt throwing evanescent pulsations of brilliancy about the dusky hall They welcomed Jenkins s announcement that luncheon was ready but they scarcely disturbed the hurriedly prepared dishes and afterward they gathered again in the hall silent and depressed appalled by the long dreary afternoon which however possessed the single virtue of dividing them from another night For long periods the district attorney and the detective were closeted in the library Now and then they passed upstairs and they could be heard moving about but no one save Graham seemed to care Already the officers had had every opportunity to search the house The old room no longer held an inhabitant to set its fatal machinery in motion Yet Bobby realized in a dull way that at any moment the two men might come down to him saying We have found something You are guilty The heavy atmosphere of the house crushed such forecasts made them seem a little trivial Bobby fancied it gathering density to cradle new mysteries The long minutes loitered Doctor Groom made a movement to go Why should I stay he grumbled What is there to keep me Yet he sat back in his chair again and appeared to have forgotten his intention Graham wandered off Bobby thought he had joined Rawlins and Robinson in the library The only daylight entered the hall through narrow slits of windows on either side of the front door Bobby watching these was even with the problems night brought to him now glad when they grew paler Paredes who had been smoking cigarette after cigarette arose and brought his card table Drawing it close to him he arranged the cards in neat piles The uncertain firelight made it barely possible to identify their numbers Doctor Groom gestured his disgust Katherine stooped forward placing her hands on the table Is it kind she asked so soon after he has left his house Paredes started Wait he said softly Puzzled she glanced at him Stay just as you are he directed There has been so much death in this house who knows Languidly he placed his fingers on the edge of the table opposite hers What are you doing doctor Groom asked hoarsely Wait Paredes said again Then Bobby scarcely aware of what was going on saw the cards glide softly across the face of the table and flutter to the floor The table had lifted slowly toward the Panamanian It stood now on two legs What is it Katherine said It s moving I can feel it move beneath my fingers Her words recalled to Bobby unavoidably his experience in the old room Don t do that the doctor cried Paredes smiled If he answered the source of these crimes is as you think spiritual why not ask the spirits for a solution You see how quickly the table responds It is as I thought There is something in this hall Haven t you a feeling that the dead are in this dark hall with us They may wish to speak See The table settled softly down without any noise It commenced to rise again Katherine lifted her hands with a visible effort as if the table had tried to hold them against her will She covered her face and sat trembling I won t I Paredes shrugged his shoulders appealing to the doctor The huge shaggy head shook determinedly I m not so sure I don t agree with you I m not so sure the dead aren t in this hall That is why I ll have nothing to do with such dangerous play It has shown us at least that you are psychic mister Paredes I have a gift Paredes murmured It would be useful to speak with them They see so much more than we do He lifted his hands He waved them dejectedly He stooped and commenced picking up the cards The doctor arose I shall go now He sighed I don t know why I have stayed Bobby got his coat and hat I ll walk to the stable with you He was glad to escape from the dismal hall in which the firelight grew more eccentric The court was colder and damper and even beyond the chill was more penetrating than it had been at the grave that noon Uneven flakes of snow sifted from the swollen sky heralds of a white invasion No more sleep walking the doctor asked when he had taken the blanket from his horse and climbed into the buggy Bobby leaned against the wall of the stable and told how Graham had brought him back the previous night from the stairhead to which he had gone with a purpose he didn t dare sound The doctor shook his head You shouldn t tell me that You shouldn t tell any one You place yourself too much in my hands as you are already in Graham s hands Maybe that is all right But the district attorney You re sure he knows nothing of this habit which seems to have commenced the night of the first murder No and I think Paredes alone of those who know about that first night would be likely to tell him See that he doesn t the doctor said shortly I ve been watching Robinson If he doesn t make an arrest pretty soon with something back of it he ll lose his mind He mightn t stop to ask as I do as Howells did about the locked doors and the nature of the wounds How shall I find the courage to sleep to night Bobby asked The doctor thought for a moment Suppose I come back he said I ve only one or two unimportant cases to look after I ought to return before dinner I ll take Graham s place for to night It s time your reactions were better diagnosed I ll share your room and you can go to sleep assured that you ll come to no harm that harm will come to no one through you I ll bring some books on the subject I ll read them while you sleep Perhaps I can learn the impulse that makes your body active while your mind s a blank The idea of the influence of Paredes which Graham had put into words slipped back to Bobby He was nevertheless strengthened by the doctor s promise To an extent the dread of the night fell from him like a smothering garment This old man who had always filled him with discomfort had become a capable support in his difficult hour He saw him drive away He studied his watch computing the time that must elapse before he could return He wanted him at the Cedars even though the doctor believed more thoroughly than any one else in the spiritual survival of old passions and the power of the dead to project a physical evil He didn t care to go back to the hall It would do him good to walk to force as far as he could from his mind the memory of the ordeal at the grave the grim impending atmosphere of the house And suppose he should accomplish something useful Suppose he should succeed where Graham had failed So he walked toward the stagnant lake The flakes of snow fell thicker Already they had gathered in white patches on the floor of the forest If this weather continued the woods would cease to be habitable for that dark feminine figure through which they had accounted for the mournful crying after Howells s death which Graham had tried to identify with the dancer Maria As he passed the neighbourhood of the cemetery he walked faster Many yards of underbrush separated him from the little time devastated city of the dead but its mere proximity forced on him as the old room had done a feeling of a stealthy and intangible companionship He stepped from the fringe of trees about the open space in the centre of which the lake brooded The water received with a destructive indifference the fluttering caresses of the snowflakes Bobby paused with a quick expectancy He saw nothing of the woman who had startled him that first evening but he heard from the thicket a sound like muffled sobbing and he responded again to the sense of a malevolent regard He hid himself among the trees and in their shelter skirted the lake The sobbing had faded into nothing For a long time he heard only the whispers of the snow and the grief of the wind When he had rounded the lake and was some distance beyond it however the moaning reached him again and through the fast deepening twilight he saw as indistinctly as he had before a black feminine figure flitting among the trees in the direction of the lake Graham s theory lost its value It was impossible to fancy the brilliant colourful dancer in this black shadowy thing He commenced to run in pursuit calling out Stop Who are you Why do you cry through the woods But the dusk was too thick the forest too eager The black figure disappeared In retrospect it was again as unsubstantial as a phantom The flakes whispered mockingly The wind was ironical He found his pursuit had led him back to the end of the lake nearest the Cedars He paused His triumph was not unmixed with fear A black figure stood in the open quite close to him gazing over the stagnant water that was like a veil for sinister things He knew now that the woman was flesh and blood for she did not glide away and the snow made pallid scars on her black cloak He crept carefully forward until he was close behind the black figure Now he said you ll tell me who you are and why you cry about the Cedars The woman swung around with a cry He stepped back abashed not knowing what to say for there was still enough light to disclose to him the troubled face of Katherine and there were tears in her eyes as if she might recently have expressed an audible grief You frightened me Bobby Without calculation he spoke his swift thought Was it you I saw here before But surely you didn t cry in the house the other night and afterward when we followed Carlos The tranquil beauty of her face was disturbed When she answered her voice had lost something of its music What do you mean It was you who cried just now It was you I saw running through the woods What do you mean she asked again I have not run I I am not your woman in black if that s what you think I happened to pick up this cloak You ve seen it often enough before And I haven t cried She brushed the tears angrily from her eyes At least I haven t cried so any one could hear me I wanted to walk I hoped I would find you I thought you had come this way so I came too Why Bobby you re suspecting me of something But the problem of the fugitive figure receded before the more intimate one of his heart There was a thrill in her desire to find him in the solitude of the forest Only the faintest gray survived in the sky above the trees The shadows were thick about them The whispering snow urged him to use this moment for his happiness It wasn t the thought of Graham that held him back Last night under an equal temptation he might have spoken To night a new element silenced him and bound his eager hands His awakening at the head of the stairs raised an obstacle to self revelation around which there seemed to exist no path I m sorry Let us go back he said She looked at him inquiringly What is it Bobby You are more afraid to day than you have ever been before Has something happened I know nothing of He shook his head He couldn t increase her own trouble by telling her of that The woods seemed to receive an ashy illumination from the passage of the snowflakes Katherine walked a little faster Don t be discouraged Bobby she begged him Everything will come out straight You must keep telling yourself that You must fight until you believe it The nearness of her dusk clothed slender figure filled him with a new courage obscured to an extent his real situation He burst out impulsively Don t worry I ll fight I ll make myself believe If necessary I ll tell everything I know in order to find the guilty person She placed her hand on his arm Her voice fell to a whisper Don t fight that way Uncle Silas is dead Howells has been taken away The police will find nothing By and by they will leave It will all be forgotten Why should you keep it active and dangerous by trying to find who is guilty Katherine he cried surprised Why do you say that Her hand left his arm She walked on without answering Paredes came back to him Paredes serenely calling attention to the fact that Katherine had alarmed the household and had led it to the discovery of the Cedars s successive mysteries He shrank from asking her any more They left the thicket In the open space about the house the snow had spread a white mantle From it the heavy walls rose black and forbidding I don t want to go in Katherine said Their feet lagged as they followed the driveway to the entrance of the court The curtains of the room of death they saw had been raised A dim unhealthy light slipped from the small paned windows across the court staining the snow Robinson and Rawlins were probably searching again Suddenly Katherine stopped She pointed What s that she asked sharply Bobby followed the direction of her glance He saw a black patch against the wall of the wing opposite the lighted windows It is a shadow he said She relaxed and they walked on They entered the court There she turned and Bobby stopped too with a sudden fear For the thing he had called a shadow was moving He stared at it with a hypnotic belief that the Cedars was at last disclosing its supernatural secret He knew it could be no illusion since Katherine swayed half fainting against him The moving shadow assumed the shape of a stout figure slightly bent at the shoulders A pipe protruded from the bearded mouth One hand waved a careless welcome Bobby s first instinct was to cry out to command this old man they had seen buried that day to return to his grave For there wasn t the slightest doubt The unhealthy candlelight from the room of death shone full on the gray and wrinkled face of Silas Blackburn CHAPTER VIII WHAT HAPPENED AT THE GRAVE Hello Katy Hello Bobby You shown your face at last I hope you ve come sober The thin quarrelsome voice of Silas Blackburn echoed in the mouldy court The stout bent figure in the candlelight studied them suspiciously Katherine clung to Bobby trembling startled beyond speech by the apparition They both stared at the gray face at the thick figure which three days after death they had seen buried that noon in the overgrown cemetery Bobby recalled how Doctor Groom had reminded him that an activity like this might emerge from such places He had suggested that the condition of the family burial ground might be an inspiration to such strayings Yet why should the spirit of Silas Blackburn have escaped Why should it have returned forthwith to the Cedars unless to face his grandson as his murderer Afterward Bobby experienced no shame for these reflections The encounter was a fitting sequel to the moment in the dark room when he had felt Howells move beneath his hand He had a fleeting faith that the void between the living and the dead had indeed been bridged Then he wondered that the familiar figure failed to disintegrate and he noticed smoke curling from the blackened briar pipe He caught its pungent aroma in the damp air of the court Moreover Silas Blackburn had spoken challenging him as usual with a sneer Let us go past Katherine whispered But Silas Blackburn stepped out blocking their way He spoke again His whining accents held a reproach What s the matter with you two You might a seen a ghost Or maybe you re sorry to have me back Didn t you wonder where I was Katy Reckon you hoped I was dead Bobby Bobby answered He had a fancy of addressing emptiness Why have you come That is what you are to us dead Silas Blackburn chuckled He took the pipe from his mouth and tapped the tobacco down with a knotted forefinger I ll show you how dead I am Trying to be funny ain t you I ll make you laugh on the wrong side of your face It s cold here I m going in The same voice the same manner Yet his presence denied that great fact which during three days had been impressed upon them with a growing fear The old man jerked his thumb toward the dimly lighted windows of the wing What you got the old room lighted up for What s going on there I tried to sleep there the other night Uncle Katherine sprang forward She stretched out her hand to him with a reluctance as pronounced as Graham s when he had touched Howells s body Her fingers brushed his hand Her shoulders drooped She clung to his arm To Bobby this resolution was more of a shock less to be explained than his first assurance of an immaterial visitor What did it mean to him Was it an impossible assurance of safety The old man patted Katherine s shoulder Why what you crying for Katy Always seems something to scare you lately He jerked his thumb again toward the lighted windows You ain t told me yet what s going on in the old room Bobby s laugh was dazed questioning They re trying to account for your murder there His grandfather looked at him with blank amazement You out of your head No Katherine cried We saw you lying there cold and still I I found you You ve not forgotten Katherine Bobby said breathlessly that he moved afterward Silas Blackburn took his hand from Katherine s shoulder Trying to scare me What s the matter with you Some scheme to get my money You slept in the old room the other night Bobby asked helplessly No I didn t sleep there his grandfather whined I went in and lay down but I didn t sleep I defy anybody to sleep in that room What you talking about It s cold here This court was always damp I want to go in Is there a fire in the hall We ll light one while you tell me what s ailin you He turned and grasped the door knob They followed him into the hall shaking the snow from their coats Paredes sat alone by the fire languidly engaged in the solitaire which exerted so potent a fascination for him He didn t turn at their entrance It wasn t until Bobby called out that he moved Carlos Bobby s tone must have suggested the abnormal for Paredes sprang to his feet knocking over the table The cards fell lightly to the floor straying as far as the hearth His hands caught at the back of his chair He remained in an awkward position rigid white faced staring at the newcomer I told you all he whispered that the court was full of ghosts Silas Blackburn walked to the fire and stood with his back to the smouldering logs In this light he had the pallor of death the lack of colour Bobby remembered beneath the glass of the coffin The old man always so intolerant and authoritative was no longer sure of himself Why do you talk about ghosts he whined I I wish I hadn t waked up Paredes sank back in his chair Waked up he echoed in an awe struck voice Bobby took a trivial interest as one will turn to small things during the most vital moments in the reflection that twice within twenty four hours the Panamanian had been startled from his cold reserve Waked up Paredes repeated His voice rose At what time Do you remember the time Not exactly Sometime after noon Bobby guessed the object of Paredes s question He knew it had been about noon when they had seen the coffin covered in the restless wind swept cemetery Paredes hurried on How long had you been asleep What makes you ask that the other whined I don t know It was a long time Blackburn s voice rose complainingly How did you guess that I never slept so I dozed nearly three days but I m tired now tired as if I hadn t slept at all Paredes made a gesture of surrender Bobby struggled against the purpose of the man s questions against the suggestion of his grandfather s unexpected answers Your idea is madness Carlos he whispered This house is filled with it Paredes said I wish Groom were here Groom ought to be here He s coming back Bobby told him He shouldn t be long now He said before dinner time Paredes stirred I wish he would hurry The Panamanian said nothing more as if he realized the futility of pressing the matter before Doctor Groom should return Necessary questions surged in Bobby s brain The two that Paredes had put however disturbed his logic Katherine who hadn t spoken since entering kept her eyes fixed on her uncle Her lips were slightly parted She had the appearance of one afraid to break a silence covering impossible doubts Bobby called on his reason His grandfather stood before him in flesh With the old man in spite of Paredes s ghastly hint probably lay the solution of the entire mystery and his own safety He was about to speak when he heard footsteps in the upper hall His grandfather glanced inquiringly through the stair well asking Who s that up there The sharp tone confessed that fear of the Cedars was active in the warped brain The district attorney Bobby answered a detective probably Hartley Graham What they doing here He indicated Paredes What s this fellow doing here I never liked him Katherine answered They ve all come because I thought I saw you dead lying in the old room We all saw Bobby cried angrily and Paredes nodded Blackburn shrank away from them The three men descended the stairs Half way down they stopped Who is that Robinson cried Graham s face whitened He braced himself against the banister Next time mister District Attorney Paredes said you ll believe me when I say the court is full of ghosts He walked in from the court I tell you they found him in the court Silas Blackburn s voice rose shrill and angry What s the matter with you all Why do you talk of ghosts and my being dead Haven t I a right to come in my own house You all act as if you were afraid of me Paredes s questions had clearly added to the uncertainty of his manner Katherine spoke softly We are afraid The others came down Robinson walked close to Silas Blackburn and for some time gazed at the gray face Yes he said You are Silas Blackburn You came to my office in Smithtown the other day and asked for a detective because you were afraid of something out here There s no question Graham cried Of course it is mister Blackburn yet it couldn t be What you all talking about Why are the police in my house Why do you act like fools and say I was dead They gathered in a group at some distance from him They unconsciously ignored this central figure as if he were in fact a ghost Bobby and Katherine told how they had found the old man a black shadow against the wall of the wing Paredes repeated the questions he had asked and their strange answers Afterward Robinson turned to Silas Blackburn who waited trembling Then you did go to the old room to sleep You lay down on the bed but you say you didn t stay You must tell us why not and how you got out and where you ve been during this prolonged sleep I want everything that happened from the moment you entered the old bedroom until you wakened That s simple Silas Blackburn mouthed I went there along about ten o clock wasn t it Katy Nearly half past she said And you frightened me He must tell us why he went why he was afraid to sleep in his own room Graham began Robinson held up his hand One question at a time mister Graham The important thing now is to learn what happened in the room You re not forgetting Howells are you Silas Blackburn glanced at the floor He moved his feet restlessly He fumbled in his pocket for some loose tobacco With shaking fingers he refilled his pipe Except for Bobby and Katherine he quavered you don t know what that room means to Blackburns and they only know by hearsay because I ve seen it was kept closed Don t see how I m going to tell you You needn t hesitate Robinson encouraged him We ve all experienced something of the peculiarities of the Cedars Your return alone s enough to keep us from laughter All right the old man stumbled on I was raised on stories of that room even before my father shot himself there Later on I saw Katherine s father die in the big bed and after that I never cared to go near the place unless I had to The other night when I made up my mind to sleep there I tried to tell myself all this talk was tommyrot I tried to make myself believe I could sleep as comfortably in that bed as anywhere So I went in and locked the door and raised the window and lay down You re sure you locked the door Robinson asked Yes I remember turning the key in both doors because I didn t want anything bothering me from outside They all looked at each other unable to forecast anything of Blackburn s experiences for both doors had been locked when the body had been found Granted life how would it have been possible for Silas Blackburn to have left the room to commence his period of drowsiness An explanation of that should also unveil the criminal s route in and out The tensity of the little group increased but no one interposed the obvious questions Robinson was right It would be quicker to let the protagonist of this unbelievable adventure recite its details in his own fashion Paredes ran his slender fingers gropingly over the faces of several of the cards he had picked up When I got in bed Silas Blackburn continued I thought I d let the candle burn for company s sake but there was a wind and it came in the open window and it made the queerest black shadows dance all over the walls until I couldn t stand it a minute longer I blew the candle out and lay back in the dark He drew harshly on his cold pipe He looked at it with an air of surprise and slipped it in his pocket It was the funniest darkness I didn t like it You put your hand out and closed your fingers as if you could feel it But it wasn t all black either Some moonlight came in with the wind between the curtains It wasn t exactly yellow and it wasn t white After a little it seemed alive and I wouldn t look at it any more The only way I could stop myself was to shut my eyes and that was worse for it made me recollect my father the way I saw him lying there when I was a boy God grant none of you will ever have to see anything like that Then I seemed to see Katy s father too and I remembered his screams The room got thick with things like that with those two and with a lot of others come out of the pictures and the stories I ve heard about my family His experience when he had gone to the room to take the evidence from Howells s body became active in Bobby s memory There I lay with my eyes shut Silas Blackburn went on in his strange inquiring voice And yet I seemed to see those dead people all around me and I thought they were in pain again and were mad at me because I didn t do anything I guess maybe I must a been dozing a little for I thought He broke off He raised his hand slowly and pointed in the direction of the overgrown cemetery where they had seen his coffin covered that noon His voice was lower and harsher when he continued I I thought I heard them say that things were all broken out there and and awful so awful they couldn t stay His voice became defiant I ain t going to tell you what I dreamed It was too horrible but I made up my mind I would do what I could if I ever escaped from that room I I was afraid they d take me back with them underneath those broken stones And you you stand there trying to tell me that they did He paused again looking around with a more defiant glare in his bloodshot eyes He appeared to be surprised not to find them laughing at him What s the matter with you all he cried Why ain t you making me out a fool You seen something in that room too Go on Robinson urged What happened then What did you do Blackburn s voice resumed its throaty monotone As he spoke he glanced about slyly suspecting perhaps the watchfulness of the fancies that had intimidated him I realized I had to get out if they would let me So I left the bed I went He ceased intimating that he had told everything I know Robinson said but tell us how you got out of the room for when you when the murder was discovered both doors were locked on the inside and you know how impossible the windows are I tell you Katherine said hysterically it was his body in the bed Bobby knew her assurance was justified but he motioned her to silence Let him answer Robinson said Silas Blackburn ran his knotted fingers through his hair He shook his head doubtfully That s what I don t understand myself That s what s been worrying me while these young ones have been talking as if I was dead and buried I recollect telling myself I must go I seem to remember leaving the bed all right but I don t seem to remember walking on the floor or going through the door You re sure the doors were locked No doubt about that Rawlins said Seems to me Blackburn went on that I was in the private staircase but did I walk downstairs First thing I see clearly is the road through the woods not far from the station What did you wear Robinson asked I d had my trousers and jacket on under my dressing gown the old man answered because I knew the bed wasn t made up That s what I wore except for the dressing gown I reckon I must have left that in the room I wouldn t have gone back there for anything My mind was full of those angry people I wanted to get as far away from the Cedars as possible I knew the last train from New York would be along about three o clock so I thought I d go on into Smithtown and in the morning see this detective I d been talking to I went to Robert Waters s house I ve known him for a long time I guess you know who he is He s such a book worm I figured he might be up and he wouldn t ask a lot of silly questions being selfish like most people that live all the time with books He came to the door and I told him I wanted to spend the night He offered to shake hands That s funny too I didn t feel like shaking hands with anybody I recollect that because I d felt sort of queer ever since going in the old room and something told me I d better not shake hands Paredes looked up wide eyed The cards slipped from his fragile pointed fingers Do you realize mister District Attorney what this man is saying But Robinson motioned him to silence Let him go on What happened then That s all Blackburn answered except this long sleep I can t make out Old Waters didn t get mad at my not shaking hands He was too tied up in some book I guess I told him I was sleepy and didn t want to be bothered and he nodded to the spare room off the main hall and I tumbled into bed and was off almost before I knew it Paredes sprang to his feet and commenced to walk about the hall Tell us he said when you first woke up I guess it was late the next afternoon Silas Blackburn quavered fumbling with his pipe again But it was only for a minute Paredes stopped in front of Robinson When he turned You see It was Waters knocking on the door Blackburn went on I guess he wanted to know what was the matter and he talked about some food but I didn t want to be bothered so I called to him through the door to go away and turned over and went to sleep again He turned over and went to sleep again Katherine said breathlessly and it was about that time that I heard the turning in the old bedroom Katherine Graham called What are you talking about What are you thinking about What else is there she asked She s thinking about the truth Paredes said tensely I ve always heard of such things So have you You ve read of them if you read at all India is full of it It goes back to ancient Egypt the same person simultaneously in two places the astral body whatever you choose to call it It s the projection of one s self whether consciously or unconsciously perhaps the projection of something that retains reason after an apparent death You heard him He didn t seem to walk He doesn t remember leaving the room which was locked on the inside His descent of the stairs was without motion as we know it He had gone some distance before his mind consciously directed the movement of this active image of Silas Blackburn while the double from which it had sprung lay apparently dead in the old room You notice he shrank from shaking hands and he slept until we hid away the shell What disintegration and coming together again has taken place since we buried that shell in the old graveyard If his friend had shaken hands with him would he have grasped emptiness Did his normal self come back to him when the shell was put from our sight and he awakened These are some of the questions we must answer You ve a fine imagination mister Paredes Robinson said dryly His fat face nevertheless was bewildered and in the eyes surrounded by puffy flesh smouldered a profound uncertainty I wish Groom were here Paredes was saying He would agree with me He would know more about it than I Robinson threw back his shoulders He turned to Rawlins with his old authority The unimaginative detective had stood throughout releasing no indication of his emotions but as he raised his hand now to an unnecessary adjustment of his scarf pin the fingers were not quite steady Telephone this man Waters Robinson directed Then get in communication with the office and put them on that end Rawlins walked away Robinson apologized to Silas Blackburn with an uneasy voice Got to check up what I can Can t get anywhere with these things unless you make sure of your first facts I daresay Waters s story will tally with yours Blackburn nodded Graham cleared his throat Now perhaps we may ask that very important question The day mister Blackburn called at your office in Smithtown he told Howells he was afraid of being murdered According to Howells he said My heart s all right It won t stop yet awhile unless it s made to So if I m found cold some fine morning you can be sure I was put out of the way I know Robinson said And that night Graham continued when he went to the old room he was terrified of something which he wouldn t define for Miss Perrine He warned me not to mention he d gone there Katherine put in He told me he was afraid afraid to sleep in his own room any longer Robinson turned What about that mister Blackburn For a moment Bobby s curiosity overcame the confusion aroused by his grandfather s apparently occult return All along they had craved the knowledge he was about to give them the statement on which Bobby s life had seemed to depend Blackburn however was unwilling The question seemed to have returned to him something of his normal manner No use he mumbled going into that A good deal of use Robinson insisted Blackburn shifted his feet He gazed at his pipe doubtfully I don t see why That didn t come and seems it wasn t what I ought to have been afraid of after all All along I ought to have been afraid only of the Cedars and the old room I ve been accused of being unjust I don t want to do an injustice now Please answer Robinson said impatiently You must answer Graham urged I don t see that it makes the slightest difference Paredes drawled What has it got to do with the case as it stands to night Robinson snapped at him You keep out of it Don t forget there s a lot you haven t answered yet Silas Blackburn looked straight at Bobby Slowly he raised his hand pointing an accusing finger at his grandson If you want to know I was afraid of that young rascal Katherine started impulsively forward in an effort to stop him Blackburn waved her away You trying to scare me Katy he asked suspiciously Evidently Robinson commented to Graham Howells wasn t as dull as we thought him Go on mister Blackburn Why were you afraid of your grandson Maybe he can tell you better than I can the old man answered Don t see any use raking up such things anyway Maybe I d been pretty harsh with him Anyway I knew he hated the ground I walked on and would be glad enough to see me drop in my tracks That isn t so Bobby said You keep quiet now You always talked too much So the old feeling survived Go on Robinson urged I d always been a hard worker Blackburn whined and he was a waster Naturally we didn t get along I d decided to make a new will leaving my money to the Bedford Foundation and I wrote him that thinking it would bring him hot foot to make it up with me I d been nervous about him before because I didn t know what might come into his head when he was on these wild parties So I d spoken to Howells thinking I d trip him if he tried any funny business When he didn t come that night I got scared He knew I wouldn t make the new will until morning and since I couldn t see any man throwing all that money away I figured he d guessed he couldn t turn me and wouldn t waste any time talking When you got a lot of money and a grandson who hates you you have to think of such things Suppose I thought he should come out here drunk when I was sound asleep I knew he had a latch key and he might sneak up to my room before I could even get to the telephone Or I was afraid he might hire somebody You can buy men for that sort of work in New York I tell you the more I thought of it the more I was sure he d do something You d understand if you lived in this lonely place with all that money and nobody you wanted to will it to I nearly sent for Howells right then But if nothing had happened I d have looked a fool I wanted you to send for a man Katherine cried Bobby leaned against the wall repeating to himself the words of Maria s note which accused him of having made the very threat his grandfather had feared So Blackburn rambled on I decided I wouldn t sleep in my room that night and I picked out the least likely place for anybody to find me I was more afraid of him than I was of the old room but as I ve told you the old room made me forget Master Robert Robinson stepped to Bobby s side All along Howells was right Tell me what you did with that evidence Bobby turned away Katherine tried to laugh Graham beckoned to Robinson What s the use of bothering with evidence against a suspected murderer when the murdered man stands talking to you Robinson frowned helplessly Paredes sprang to his feet You re taking too much for granted Graham There was a murder Blackburn was killed We ve as many witnesses to that fact as we have that he s come back This man who talks with us accusing Bobby may not stay Have you thought of that I have noticed something that makes me think it possible I have been afraid to speak of it But it makes me hesitate to say that this man is alive as we understand life We have to learn the nature of the forces we are dealing with exactly how dangerous they are They started at a sharp rap on the front door Now who the old man whined I wish you wouldn t look at me so It makes me feel queer You re all crazy It s probably Doctor Groom Bobby said and stepped to the door opening it It was Groom The huge man walked in struggling out of his coat At first the others screened Silas Blackburn from him but he acknowledged their strained attitudes the excitement that still animated Paredes s face What s the matter with you he asked Found something mister District Attorney Robinson moved to one side jerking his thumb at Silas Blackburn The coat and hat slipped from Doctor Groom s hand His mouth opened His great body crept slowly back until the shoulders rested against the wall He placed the palms of his hands against the wall as if to push it away in order to assure further retreat Always the little infused eyes remained fixed on the man who had been his friend Such terror was chiefly arresting because of the great figure conquered by it Blackburn thrust his pipe in his mouth He laughed shakily That fellow Groom will have a stroke The Doctor s greeting had the difficult quality of a masculine sob Silas Blackburn Who do you think the other whined You going to try to frighten me out of my skin too These people are trying to say I ve been lying dead in the old room Hoped you d have enough sense to set them right and tell me what it s all about The doctor straightened You did lie dead in the old room His harsh amazed tones held an unqualified conviction I saw you there I helped the coroner make the examination You had been dead for many hours And I saw you bolted in your coffin I saw you buried in the graveyard you d let go to pieces The others had as far as possible recovered from the first shock had done their best to fathom the mystery but Groom s fear increased His reddish eyes grew always more alarmed Silas Blackburn turned with a quick frightened gesture facing the fire Paredes drew a deep breath Now you ll see he said Doctor Groom shrank against the wall again After a moment with the motions of one drawn by an outside will he approached the figure at the fireplace Then Bobby saw and he heard Katherine s choked scream For now that his grandfather s back was turned there was plainly visible on the white of the collar near the base of the brain a scarlet stain And the hair above it was matted That s what I meant Paredes whispered Graham moved back Good God Robinson stared The fear had found him too Doctor Groom touched Blackburn s shoulder tentatively What s the matter with the back of your neck Blackburn drew fearfully away He raised his hand and fumbled at the top of his collar He held his fingers to the firelight Why he said blankly I been bleeding back there To an extent the doctor controlled himself Sit down here Silas Blackburn he said I want to get the lamplight on your head I ain t badly hurt Blackburn whined I don t know the doctor answered Heaven knows Blackburn sat down The light shone full on the stained collar and the dark patch of hair at the base of the brain Doctor Groom examined the wound minutely He straightened He spoke unsteadily It is a healed wound It was made by something sharp Robinson thrust his hands in his pockets You re getting beyond my depths Doctor Bring him up to the old bedroom I want him to see that pillow But Blackburn cowered in his chair I won t go to that room again They don t want me there I ll have work started in the cemetery to morrow mister Blackburn Robinson said the man we buried in the cemetery to day the man these members of your family identify as yourself died of just such a wound as the doctor says has healed in your head Blackburn cowered farther in his chair You re making fun of me he whimpered You re trying to scare an old man No Robinson said How was that wound made The crouched figure wagged its head from side to side I don t know Nothing s touched me there I remember I had a headache when I woke up Why doesn t Groom tell me why I slept so long I only know Groom rumbled that the wound I examined upstairs must have caused instant death Paredes whispered to him The doctor nodded reluctantly What do you mean Blackburn cried You trying to tell me I can t stay with you He pointed to Paredes That s what he said that I might have to go back but I never heard of such a thing I m all right My neck doesn t hurt I m alive I tell you I m alive I ll teach you Rawlins returned from the telephone His story s straight he said in his crisp manner I ve been talking to Waters himself Says mister Blackburn turned up about three thirty looking queer and acting queer Wouldn t shake hands just as he says He went to the spare room and slept practically all the time until this afternoon No food Waters couldn t rouse him mister Blackburn wouldn t answer at all or else seemed half asleep He d made up his mind to call in a doctor this afternoon Then mister Blackburn seemed all right again and started home Robinson gazed at the fire What s to be done now sir Rawlins asked Find the answer if we can Robinson said Paredes spoke as softly as he had done the other night while reciting his sensitive reaction to the Cedars s gloomy atmosphere Only now his voice wasn t groping Call me a dreamer if you want mister District Attorney but I have given you the only answer This man s soul has dwelt in two places Robinson grinned I m going slow on calling anybody names but I haven t forgotten that there s been another crime in this house Howells was killed in that room too I would like to believe he could return as mister Blackburn has Blackburn looked up What s that Who s Howells And as Robinson told him of the second crime he sank back in his chair again whimpering from time to time His fear was harder to watch Might I suggest Graham said that Howells isn t out of the case yet It would be worth looking into By all means Robinson agreed Rawlins coughed apologetically I asked them about that at the office Howells was taken to his home in Boston to day The funeral s to be to morrow Then Robinson said we re confined for the present to this end of the case The facts I have tell me that two murders have been committed in this house It is still my first duty to convict the guilty man Graham indicated the huddled frightened figure in the chair You are going against the evidence of your own eyes I shall do what I can Robinson said sternly We buried one of those men this noon His grandson his niece and those who saw him frequently swear it was this living being who has such a wound as the one that caused the death of that man There is only one thing to do see who we buried The permits Graham suggested I shall telephone the judge Robinson answered and he can send them out but I shan t wait for hours doing nothing I am going to the grave at once A waste of time Paredes murmured I don t understand Silas Blackburn whined You say the doors were locked Then how could anybody have got in that room to be murdered How did I get out Robinson turned on Paredes angrily I m not through with you yet Before I am I ll get what I want from you He stormed away to the telephone No one spoke The doctor s rumpled head was still bent over the back of Silas Blackburn s chair The infused eyes didn t waver from the crimson stain and the healed wound and Blackburn remained huddled among the cushions his shoulders twitching Paredes commenced gathering up his cards Katherine watched him out of expressionless eyes Graham walked to her side Rawlins as always phlegmatic remained motionless waiting for his superior Bobby threw off his recent numbness He realized the disturbing parallel in the actions of his grandfather and himself He had come to the Cedars unconsciously perhaps directed by an evil external influence on the night of the first murder Now it appeared the man he was accused of killing had also wandered under an unknown impulse that night Was the same subtle control responsible in both cases Was there at the Cedars a force that defied physical laws moving its inhabitants like puppets for special aims of its own Yet he recalled there was something here friendly to him After the movement of Howells s body and the disappearance of the evidence the return of Silas Blackburn stripped Robinson s threats of power and seemed to place the solution beyond the district attorney s trivial reach The silence and the delay increased their weight upon the little group Silas Blackburn huddled in his chair was grayer more haggard than he had been at first He appeared attentive to an expected summons He seemed fighting the idea of going back The proximity of Graham to Katherine quieted the turmoil of Bobby s thoughts If he could only have foreseen this return he would have listened to the whispered encouragement of the forest Robinson reappeared Anxiety had replaced the anger in the round face which one felt should always have been no more than good natured Jenkins will have to help he said Silas Blackburn arose unsteadily I m coming with you You re not going to leave me here I won t stay here alone He should come by all means Paredes said in case anything should happen The old man put his hands to his ears You keep quiet I m not going back I tell you Bobby didn t want to hear any more He went to the kitchen and called Jenkins He let the butler go to the hall ahead of him in order that he might not have to witness this new greeting But Jenkins s cry came back to him and when he reached the hall he saw that the man s terror had not diminished They went through the court and around the house to the stable where they found spades and shovels Their grim purpose holding them silent they crossed the clearing and entered the pathway that had been freshly blazed that day for the passage of the men in black The snow was quite deep It still drifted down It filled the woods with a wan unnatural radiance Without really illuminating the sooty masses of the trees it made the night white Silas Blackburn stumbled in the van with Paredes and Robinson The doctor and Rawlins followed Graham was with Katherine behind them Bobby walked last fighting an instinct to linger to avoid whatever they might find beneath the white blanket of the little intimate burial ground Groom turned and spoke to Graham Katherine waited for Bobby and the white night closed swiftly about them whispering until the shuffling of the others became inaudible Was she glad of this solitude Had she sought it Her extraordinary request in that earlier solitude came to him and he spoke of it while he tried to control his emotions while he sought to mould the next few minutes reasonably and justly Why did you tell me to make no attempt to find the guilty person Because she answered you were too sure it was yourself Why Bobby did you think I was the the woman in black That has hurt me I didn t mean to hurt you he said but there is something I must tell you now that may hurt you a little And he explained how Graham had awakened him at the head of the stairs You re right he said I was sure then it was myself in spite of Howells s movement It followed so neatly on the handkerchief and the footmarks But now he has come back and it changes everything So I can tell you He couldn t be sure whether it was the cold white loneliness through which they paced or what he had just said that made her tremble Perhaps I shouldn t have told you that I am glad she answered You must never close your confidence to me again Why have you done it these last few months I want to know Calculation died Then you shall know Through the white night his hands reached for her found her drew her close The moment was too masterful for him to mould He became instead plastic in its white and stealthy grasp I couldn t stay he said and see you give yourself to Hartley She raised her hands to his shoulders He barely caught her whisper because of the sly communicativeness of the snow I am glad but why didn t you say so then The intoxication faded The enterprise ahead gave to their joy a fugitive quality Moreover with her very surrender came to him a great misgiving But you and Hartley I ve watched It s been forced on me Then you have misunderstood she answered You put me too completely out of your life after our quarrel That was about Hartley You were too jealous but it was my fault Hartley he asked spoke to you about that time Yes and I told him he was a very dear friend and he was kind enough to accept that and not to go away His measure of the widening of the rift between them made her more precious because of its affectionate human quality She had been kinder to Graham more mysterious about him to draw Bobby back Yet ever since his arrival at the Cedars Graham had assumed toward Katherine an attitude scarcely to be limited by friendship He had done what he had in Bobby s service clearly enough for her sake For a long time past indeed in speaking of her Graham always seemed to discuss the woman he expected to marry You are quite sure he asked puzzled that Hartley understood Why do you ask He has shown how good a friend he is He has always made me think Bobby said that he had your love You re sure he guessed that you cared for me In that place at that moment there was a tragic colour to her coquetry I think every one must have guessed it except you Bobby He raised her head and touched her lips Her lips were as cold as the caresses of the drifting snowflakes We must go on she sighed In his memory the chill of her kiss was bitter In the forest they could speak no more of love But Bobby hand in hand with her as they hurried after the others received a new strength He saw as a condition to their happiness the unveiling of the mystery at the Cedars He gathered his courage for that task He would not give way even before the memory of all that he had experienced even before the return of his grandfather even before the revelation toward which they walked And side by side with his determination grew shame for his former weakness It was comforting to realize that the causes for his weakness and his strength were identical The subdued murmur of voices reached them They saw among the indistinct masses of the trees restless patches of black Katherine stumbled against one of the fallen stones They stood with the others in the burial ground close to the mound that had been made that day They haven t begun Bobby whispered She freed her hand A white flame sprang across the mound The trees from formless masses took on individual shapes A row of cypresses on which the light gleamed were like sombre sentinels guarding the dead The snow patches clustered on their branches were like funeral decorations pointing their morbid function The light gave the overturned stones an illusion of striving to struggle from their white imprisonment Robinson swung his lamp back to the mound The snow isn t heavy he said and the ground isn t frozen It oughtn t to take long Silas Blackburn commenced to shake It s a desecration of the dead We have to know Robinson said who is buried in that grave With a spade Jenkins scraped the snow from the mound Rawlins joined him They commenced to throw to one side staining the white carpet spadesful of moist yellow earth Their labour was rapid Silas Blackburn watched with an unconquerable fascination He continued to shake I m too cold I ll never be warm again he whined If anything happens to me Bobby try to forget I ve been hard and don t let them bury me Suppose I should be buried alive Suppose Paredes said you were buried alive to day He turned to Bobby and Katherine That also is possible You remember the old theories that have never been disproved of the disintegration of matter into its atoms of its passage through solid substances of its reforming in a far place I wouldn t have to ask an East Indian that Jenkins standing in the excavation broke into torrential speech mister Robinson I can t work with the light It makes the stones seem to move It throws too many shadows I seem to see people behind you and I m afraid to look Nothing aggressive survived in Rawlins s voice We can work well enough without it sir Robinson snapped off the light The darkness descended eagerly upon them Above the noise of the spades in the soft earth Bobby heard indefinite stirrings In the graveyard at such an hour the supernatural legend of the Cedars assumed an inescapable probability Bobby wished for some way to stop the task on which they were engaged He felt instinctively it would be better not to tamper with the mystery of Silas Blackburn s return Bobby grew rigid There it is again Graham breathed A low keening came from the thicket It increased in power a trifle then drifted into silence It wasn t the wind It was like the moaning Bobby had heard at the stagnant lake that afternoon like the cries Graham and he had suffered in the old room Seeming at first to come from a distance it achieved a sense of intimacy It was like an escape of sorrow from the dismantled tombs Bobby turned to Katherine He couldn t see her for the darkness He reached out She was not there Katherine he called softly Her hand stole into his He had been afraid that the forest had taken her Under the reassurance of her handclasp he tried to make himself believe there was actually a woman near by if not Maria some one who had a definite purpose there Robinson flashed on his light Old Blackburn whimpered The Cedars is at its tricks again and there s nothing we can do It was like a lost soul Katherine sighed It seemed to cry from this place It must be traced Bobby said Then tell me its direction certainly Robinson challenged We d flounder in the thicket A waste of time Let us get through here Hurry Rawlins The light showed Bobby that the detective and Jenkins had nearly finished He shrank from the first hard sound of metal against metal It came After a moment the light shone on the dull face of the casket which was streaked with dirt Jenkins rested on his spade He groaned It occurred to Bobby that the man couldn t have worked hard enough in this cold air to have started the perspiration that streamed down his wrinkled face It would be a tough job to lift it out Rawlins said No need Robinson answered Get the soil away from the edges He bent over passing a screw driver to the detective Take off the top plate That will let us see all we want Jenkins climbed out I shan t look I don t dare look Silas Blackburn touched Bobby s arm timidly I ve been a hard man Bobby He broke off his bearded lips twitching The grating of the screws tore through the silence Rawlins glanced up Lend a hand somebody Groom spoke hoarsely It isn t too late to let the dead rest Robinson gestured him away Graham Paredes and he knelt in the snow and helped the detective raise the heavy lid They placed it at the side of the grave They all forced themselves to glance downward Katherine screamed Silas Blackburn leaned on Bobby s arm shaking with gross impossible sobs Paredes shrugged his shoulders The light wavered in Robinson s hand They continued to stare There was nothing else to do The coffin was empty CHAPTER IX BOBBY S VIGIL IN THE ABANDONED ROOM For a long time the little group gathered in the snow swept cemetery remained silent The lamp shaking in the district attorney s hand illuminated each detail of the casket s interior linings Bobby tried to realize that except for these meaningless embellishments the box was empty That was what held them all the void the unoccupied silken couch in which they had seen Silas Blackburn s body imprisoned Yet the screws which the detective had removed and the mass of earth packed down and covered with snow must have made escape a dreadful impossibility even if the spark of life had reanimated its occupant And that occupant stood there trembling and haggard sobbing from time to time in an utter abandonment to the terror of what he saw To Bobby in that moment the supernatural legend of the Cedars seemed more triumphantly fulfilled than it would have been through the immaterial return of his grandfather For Silas Blackburn was a reincarnation more difficult to accept than any ghost Had Paredes who all along had offered them a spectacle of veiled activity and thought grasped the truth At first glance indeed his gossip of oriental theories concerning the disintegration of matter its passage through solid substances its reassembly in far places seemed thoroughly justified Yet granted that who in the semblance of Silas Blackburn had they buried to vanish completely Who in the semblance of Silas Blackburn had drowsed without food for three days in the house at Smithtown The old man stretched his shaking hands to Bobby and Katherine Don t let them bury me again They never buried me I ve not been dead I tell you I ve not been dead He mouthed horribly I m alive Can t you see I m alive He broke down and covered his face Jenkins sank on the heap of earth I saw you mister Silas in that box And I saw you on the bed Miss Katherine and I found you We had to break the door You looked so peaceful we thought you were asleep But when we touched you you were cold No no no Blackburn grimaced I wasn t cold I couldn t have been There s no question Bobby said hoarsely No question Robinson repeated Katherine shrank from her uncle as he had shrunk from her in the library the night of the murder What do you make of it the district attorney asked Rawlins The detective who had remained crouched at the side of the grave arose brushing the dirt from his hands shaking his head What is one to make of it sir Paredes spoke softly to Graham The Cedars wants to be left alone to the dead We would all be better away from it You won t go yet awhile Robinson said gruffly Don t forget you re still under bond The detail no longer seemed of importance to Bobby The mystery centreing in the empty grave was apparently inexplicable He experienced a great pity for his grandfather and recalling that strengthening moment with Katherine he made up his mind that there was only one course for him It might be dangerous in itself yet on the other hand he couldn t go to Katherine while his share in the mystery of the Cedars remained so darkly shadowed He had no right to withhold anything and he wouldn t ask Graham s advice He had stepped all at once into the mastery of his own destiny He would tell Robinson therefore everything he knew from the party with Maria and Paredes in New York through his unconscious wanderings around the house on the night of the first murder to the moment when Graham had stopped his somnambulistic excursion down the stairs Robinson turned his light away from the grave There s nothing more to do here Let us go back The little party straggled through the snow to the house The hall fire smouldered as pleasantly as it had done before they had set forth yet an interminable period seemed to have elapsed Silas Blackburn went close to the fire He sank in a chair trembling I m so cold he whined I ve never been so cold What is the matter with me For God s sake tell me what is the matter Katherine if if nothing happens we ll close the Cedars We ll go to the city where there are lots of lights If you d only listened to Bobby and me and gone long ago she said Robinson stared at the fire I m about beaten he muttered wearily Rawlins with an air of stealth walked upstairs Graham after a moment s hesitation followed him Bobby wondered why they went He caught Robinson s eye He indicated he would like to speak to him in the library As he left the hall he saw Paredes who had not removed his hat or coat start for the front door Where are you going he heard Robinson demand Paredes s reply came glibly Only to walk up and down in the court The house oppresses me more than ever to night I feel with mister Blackburn that it is no place to stay And while he talked with Robinson in the library Bobby caught at times the crunching of Paredes s feet in the court Why does that court draw him Robinson asked Why does he keep repeating that it is full of ghosts He can t be trying to scare us with that now But Bobby didn t answer I ve come to tell you the truth he burst out everything I know You may lock me up Even that would be better than this uncertainty I must have an answer if it condemns me and how could I have had anything to do with what has happened to night He withheld nothing Robinson listened with an intent interest At the end he said not unkindly If the evidence and Howells s report hadn t disappeared I d have arrested you and considered the case closed before this miracle was thrown at me You ve involved yourself so frankly that I don t believe you re lying about what went on in the old room when you entered to steal those exhibits Can t say I blame you for trying that either You were in a pretty bad position an unheard of position You still are for that matter But the case is put on such an extraordinary basis by what has happened to night that I d be a fool to lock you up on such a confession I believe there s a good deal more in what has gone on in that room and in the return of your grandfather than you can account for Thanks Bobby said I hoped you d take it this way for if you will let me help I have a plan He turned restlessly to the door of the private staircase In his memory Howells s bold figure was outlined there but now the face with its slow smile seemed sympathetic rather than challenging What s your plan Robinson asked Bobby forced himself to speak deliberately steadily To go for the night alone to the old room as Howells did Robinson whistled Didn t believe you had that much nerve Two men have tried that What good would it do If the answer s anywhere Bobby said it must be hidden in that room Howells felt it I was sure of it when I was prevented from taking the evidence You ve believed it I think There is something strange and unhealthy about the room Robinson agreed Certainly the secret of the locked doors lies there But we ve had sufficient warning I m not ashamed to say I wouldn t take such a chance I don t know that I ought to let you Bobby smiled I ve been enough of a coward he said and Robinson I ve got to know I shan t go near the bed I ll watch the bed from a corner If the danger s at the bed as we suspect it probably won t be able to reach me but just the same it may expose itself And Rawlins or you can be outside the broken door in the corridor waiting to enter at the first alarm Howells had no chance to give an alarm Robinson muttered We ll see later But Bobby understood that he would agree and he forced his new courage to face the prospect Maybe something will turn up Robinson mused The case can t grow more mysterious indefinitely But his tone held no assurance He seemed to foresee new and difficult complications When they returned to the hall Bobby shrank from the picture of his grandfather still crouched by the fire his shoulders twitching his fingers about the black briar pipe shaking Groom alone had remained with him Bobby opened the front door There was no one in the court Paredes he said closing the door has gone out of the court Where s Katherine Doctor She went to the kitchen the doctor rumbled I m sure I don t know what for this time of night After a little Graham and Rawlins came down the stairs Graham s face was scarred by fresh trouble Rawlins drew the district attorney to one side What have you two been doing up there Bobby asked Graham Rawlins is hard headed Graham answered in a low worried tone He wouldn t meet Bobby s eyes He seemed to seek an escape Where s Katherine he asked Doctor Groom says she went to the back part of the house Why won t you tell me what you were doing Only keeping Rawlins from trying to make more mischief Graham answered He wouldn t explain Aren t there enough riddles in this house Doctor Groom asked with frank disapproval Rawlins and Robinson joined them sparing Graham a further defence The district attorney had an air of fresh resolution He was about to speak when the front door opened quietly framing the blackness of the court They started forward seeing no one Silas Blackburn made a slow shrinking movement crying out They ve opened the door Don t let them in Don t let them come near me again Although they knew Paredes had been in the court the spell of the Cedars was so heavy upon them that for a moment they didn t know what to expect They hesitated with a little of the abnormal apprehension Silas Blackburn exposed Then Rawlins sprang forward and Bobby called Carlos Paredes stepped from one side He lingered against the black background of the doorway It was plain enough something was wrong with him In the first place although he had opened the door he had been unwilling to enter Shut the door Silas Blackburn moaned Paredes with a quick gesture of surrender stepped in and obeyed His face was white He had lost his immaculate appearance His clothing showed stains of snow and mould He held his left hand behind his back What s the matter with you Robinson demanded The Panamanian s laugh lacked its usual indifference When I said the Cedars was full of ghosts I should have heeded my own warning I might better have stayed comfortably locked up in Smithtown Silas Blackburn spoke in a hoarse whisper What did you see out there Are they coming I saw very little Paredes answered It was too dark You saw something Doctor Groom rumbled Paredes nodded He looked at the floor A a woman in black By the lake Bobby cried Not as far as the lake It was near the empty grave Silas Blackburn commenced to shake again The doctor s little eyes were wider It was a woman a flesh and blood woman Robinson asked If it was a ghost Paredes answered it had the power of attack but that as you ll recall is by no means unusual here That s why I ve come in rather against my will It seems strange but I too have been struck by a sharp and slender object and I thought perhaps the doctor had better look at the result With a motion of repugnance he moved his left hand from behind his back and stretched it to the light The coat below the elbow was torn The slender hand was crimson He tried to smile Luckily it wasn t at the back of my head Sit down Doctor Groom said waving Robinson and Rawlins away Let me see how badly he s hurt There ll be plenty of time for questions afterward Paredes lay back in one of the chairs and extended his arm He kept his eyes closed while the doctor stooped examining the wound All at once his nearly perpetual sleeplessness since coming to the Cedars had recorded itself in his face His nerves at last confessed their vulnerability as he fumbled for a cigarette with his good hand as he placed it awkwardly between his lips Would you mind giving me a light Bobby Bobby struck a match and held it to the cigarette Thanks Paredes said Are you nearly through doctor I daresay it s nothing Doctor Groom glanced up Nothing serious with a little luck It s only torn through a muscle It might have pierced the large vein His forehead beneath the shaggy black hair was deeply lined He turned to Robinson doubtfully Maybe you ll tell us Robinson said what made the wound No use shirking facts the doctor rumbled mister Paredes has been wounded just as he said by something sharp and slender You mean Robinson said by an instrument that could have caused death in the case of Howells and and I won t have you looking at me that way Silas Blackburn whined Yes the doctor answered Before we go any farther I want to bind this arm There must be an antiseptic in the house Where is Katherine See if you can find her Bobby As Bobby started to cross the dining room he heard the slight scraping of the door leading to the kitchen He knew there was someone in the room with him He touched a cold hand Bobby Katherine breathed in his ear He understood why the little light from the hall had failed to disclose her when she had come from the kitchen She wore the black cloak Against the darkness at the end of the room she had made no silhouette When he put his arms around her and touched her cheek he noticed that that too was cold and the shoulders of the cloak were damp as if she had just come in from the falling snow Where have you been he asked Looking outside she answered frankly I couldn t sit still I wondered if the woman in black would be around the house to night Then I was afraid so I came in Doctor Groom s voice reached them Have you found her Is she in the dining room Without any thought of disloyalty Bobby recognized the menace of coincidence Take your cloak off he whispered Leave it here Why While he drew the cloak from her shoulders he raised his voice Carlos has been hurt The doctor asked me to find you His simple strategy was destroyed by the appearance of Rawlins The detective came directly to them nor was the coincidence lost on him and it was his business to advertise rather than to conceal it Without ceremony he took the cloak from Bobby He draped it over his arm The doctor he said to Katherine wants a basin of warm water some old linen carbolic acid if you have it She nodded and went back to the kitchen while Bobby returned with the detective to the hall Paredes s eyes remained closed Where did you get the cloak Rawlins Robinson asked The young lady Rawlins answered with soft satisfaction just wore it in At least it s still wet from the snow Paredes opened his eyes He looked for a moment at the black cloak He closed his eyes again You could recognize the woman who attacked you Rawlins said Paredes shook his head You ve forgotten how dark it is Please don t ask me even to swear that it was a woman You re trying to say it wasn t flesh and blood Blackburn quavered Paredes smiled weakly I m trying to say nothing at all Tell us each detail of the attack Robinson said But Katherine s footsteps reached them from the dining room and Paredes wouldn t answer Under those conditions Robinson s failure to press the question was as disturbing as the detective s matter of fact capture of the cloak Paredes glanced at Katherine once There was no softness in her attitude as she knelt beside his chair Neither Bobby felt was there the slightest uneasiness With a facile grace she helped the doctor bathe and bandage the slight wound A silk handkerchief for a sling the doctor suggested I won t have a sling Paredes said I wouldn t know what to do without the use of both my hands You ought to congratulate yourself that you still keep it the doctor grumbled Bobby took the pan and the bottles from Katherine and rang for Jenkins It was clear that Robinson had hoped the girl would go out with them herself and so give Paredes an opportunity to speak This new development made him wonder about Graham s theories as to Paredes If it was Maria who had struck the man there had either been a quarrel among thieves or else no criminal connection had ever existed between the two Paredes however aping the gestures of an invalid was less to Bobby s taste than his satanic appearance when he had come from the private staircase Rawlins still held the cloak After Jenkins had removed the doctor s paraphernalia everyone seemed to wait It was Silas Blackburn who finally released the strain Katy where you been with that cloak What s he doing with it Without answering she took the cloak from Rawlins and gave the detective and the district attorney the opportunity they craved She walked up the stairs turning at the landing Her farewell seemed pointed at the Panamanian who looked languidly up at her If I m wanted I shall be in my room Who would want you Katherine Graham blurted out But it was clear he had caught the coincidence too and the trouble he had confessed a little earlier was radically increased That remains to be seen Robinson sneered as soon as she had gone Now mister Paredes I ve really told you everything he said I walked toward the graveyard At a point very close to it I felt the presence of this creature in black I spoke I took my courage in my hands I reached out I touched nothing He raised his injured hand I got this for my pains What made you go to the graveyard Robinson asked suspiciously There was no mockery in the Panamanian s answer I have told you the court for me has always been full of ghosts He pointed to Silas Blackburn It frightened me that this man should come back through the court from his grave with all the evidence pointing to an astral magic I wanted to retrace his journey I thought at the grave if I were alone something might expose itself that had naturally remained hidden in the presence of so many materialistic human beings A smile spread over Rawlins s cold unimaginative features That sounds well mister Paredes and there is a lot about this case that looks like ghosts but leave us a few flesh and blood clues This woman in black is one of them although she s been slippery as an eel It looks to me as if you went to the grave to meet her alone exactly as you went to the deserted house to talk quietly with her night before last Maybe she mistook you for one of us snooping in the dark and let you have it If that is so Paredes said easily the nature of my wound would suggest that she is guilty of the crimes in the old room Why not go out and arrest her then She might explain everything except the return to life of mister Blackburn I m afraid that s rather beyond you in any case But at least find her Robinson joined in Rawlins s laugh Why go outside for that Paredes started You never mean You bet we do Rawlins said If what I ve doped out hadn t been so we d have caught her long before We re not blind and we haven t missed the nerve with which she helped the doctor fix you up We haven t caught her before because her headquarters have been right in this house all the time You remember the other night mister Robinson You d just questioned her in the court and had threatened to question him too when she came in here ahead of us and slipped out the back way She must have told him to follow because they had to talk undisturbed by us They went by different roads to the deserted house where a light had been seen before We happened to hit his trail first and followed it I ll guarantee you didn t see her when you first came in Robinson shook his head mister Graham kept me busy and I rather waited for your report before pushing things I didn t see her or question her until after mister Graham and mister Blackburn had started for New York And she could have sneaked in the back way any time before that Rawlins said It s utter nonsense Graham cried Rawlins turned on him See here mister Graham you ve been trying to fight me off this way all afternoon It won t do Katy s a good girl Silas Blackburn quavered With a growing discomfort Bobby realized that when the woman had cried near the graveyard he had reached out for Katherine and had failed to find her Moreover the night Graham and he had heard the crying in the old room she had stood alone in the corridor It was easily conceivable that the turn of events after Robinson s arrival should have made it necessary for conspirators to consult free from any danger of disturbance But Katherine he told himself was assuredly the victim of coincidence He couldn t picture her entangled in any of Paredes s purposes Her dislike of the man was complete and open But he saw that Rawlins out of the mass of apparently inexplicable clues had extracted this material one and would follow it desperately no matter who was hurt and Robinson was behind him That accounted for their frequent excursions upstairs during the afternoon for Rawlins s ascent as soon as they had returned from the grave They had evidently found something to sharpen their suspicions and Graham probably knew what it was Robinson took out his watch We can t put this off too late he mused The detective at his heels he walked to the library Bobby started after them Graham caught him and they crossed the dining room together What do they mean to do Bobby asked I have been afraid of it since this afternoon Graham answered I haven t cared to talk about it I had hoped to hold them off They intend to search Katherine s room I think they believe she has something important hidden there I ve been wondering if they ve got track of Howells s report which we told Jenkins to hide Why Bobby asked should that involve Katherine Howells may have written something damaging to her He knew she was devoted to your interests Robinson called to them from the library Won t you please come in mister Blackburn Bobby and Graham continued to the library They found Rawlins gazing through the door of the private staircase We could go up this way he was saying and across the old room so that she needn t suspect What is he talking about Bobby asked Robinson angrily You wanted to help Robinson answered so Rawlins and I are going to give you a chance We are about to search your cousin s room We hope to find there an explanation of a part of the mystery the motive at least for Howells s death perhaps your own exoneration You d do anything to have that wouldn t you You ve said so At her expense Bobby cried You ve no right to go to her room She s incapable of a share in such crimes Do you seriously think she could plan an escape from the grave and bring back to life a man three days dead Give me a human being that caused death Robinson answered and I ll tackle the ghosts later You re wrong if you think I m going to quit cold because your grandfather looks like a dead thing that moves about and talks I shan t give up to that madness until I ve done everything in my power I would be a criminal myself if I failed to do as Rawlins wishes If your cousin s skirts are clear no harm will be done I m acting on the assumption that your confession was honest I want you to get Miss Perrine out of her room I want you to see that she stays downstairs while we search You ve already searched her room Not since Rawlins Robinson caught himself Never mind that It is necessary it should be searched to night Even you ll acknowledge it s significant that all day when she has been downstairs her door has been locked It s only significant Bobby flashed in view of your treatment of her yesterday Robinson grinned That will hardly go down Rawlins has hesitated to break in I ve instructed him to do it now if necessary For the last time will you bring your cousin down Will you go through and unlock the door leading from the old bedroom to the private hall so we can get up No Bobby cried I wouldn t do it if I believed you were right And I know you re wrong Prove that we re wrong Clear your cousin by helping us Robinson urged Since you re so determined Graham said quietly I ll do it Hartley What are you thinking of Of showing them how wrong they are Graham said I ll tell her Doctor Groom wishes to speak to her about mister Blackburn I ll warn him to keep her downstairs for a quarter of an hour That should give you plenty of time Robinson nodded She ll never forgive you Bobby said It s spying He wondered that Graham should choose such a course so soon after it had become clear that Katherine had never really loved him It s the best way to satisfy them Graham said I have perhaps more faith than you in Katherine He left them to carry out Robinson s instructions They waited at the entrance of the private staircase I may witness this outrage Bobby asked I d rather you didn t speak of it in such harsh terms Robinson smiled Bobby didn t know what to expect The whole thing might be a trick of Paredes in line with his hints the night of Howells s death to involve Katharine The quiet confidence of the two officials was disturbing What had Rawlins seen After a long time Graham descended the private staircase carrying a lighted candle He beckoned and they followed him back through the private hall into the wide and mournful bedroom It encouraged Bobby to see the district attorney and the detective hurry across it After all they were really without confidence of solving its ghostly riddle What they were about to do he argued was a last chance They would find nothing They would acknowledge themselves beaten When they entered the farther wing he noticed that Katherine s door stood wide You see he said When I called her Graham explained she thought something had happened to her grandfather She ran out And forgot all about the door Robinson grinned That s lucky Now Rawlins Bobby couldn t bring himself to cross the threshold but from the corridor he could see the interior of the room and all that went on there during the next few moments A candle burned on the bureau exposing the feminine neatness and delicacy of the furnishings The presence of the three men was a desecration what they were about to do an unforgivable act of vandalism Rawlins went to a work table while Robinson rummaged in the closet Graham meantime bent against the footboard of the bed watching with anxious eyes Bobby s anger was increased by this picture He resisted an impulse to run to the stairs and call Katherine up That would simply increase Robinson s suspicions There was nothing she could do nothing he could do Rawlins had clearly been unsuccessful at the work table He glided to the bureau One after the other he opened the drawers fumbling within lifting the contents out replacing them with a rough haste while Bobby s futile rage increased Suddenly he saw Graham s attitude alter Rawlins s back stiffened He pulled the bottom drawer altogether from the bureau and thrust it to one side He gazed in the opening Come here mister Robinson he said softly Robinson left the closet and stooped beside the detective He exclaimed Graham went closer looking over their backs You d better see Bobby he said without turning Yes Robinson said Let me show you how wrong you were mister Blackburn Let me ask if you knew you were wrong Bobby entered with a quicker pulse He too stooped and looked in the opening Abruptly everything altered for him He wondered that his physical surroundings should remain the same that the eager faces beside him should retain their familiar lines Against the back board of the bureau where it would fit neatly when the drawer was in place lay a plaster cast of a footmark Near by was a rumpled handkerchief that Bobby recognized as his own and the envelope containing Howells s report which they had told Jenkins to hide Well Robinson grinned I swear I didn t know they were there Bobby answered You ll never make me believe that Katherine knows it I ve guessed Rawlins said that the stuff was hidden here ever since this afternoon when I saw a small bundle sneaked in Who brought it Bobby took him up Robinson s grin expanded Leave us one or two surprises to spring in court Then Bobby said my cousin wasn t in the room when this evidence was brought here I ll admit that Rawlins answered but she wasn t far away and she got here before I could investigate and she s kept the door locked ever since until just now He lifted the exhibits out The shape of the cast the monogram on the handkerchief cried out their testimony Robinson grasped Howells s report and glanced over the fine handwriting After a time he looked up There s the case against you mister Blackburn and at the least your cousin s an accessory But why the devil did you come to me and make a clean breast of it Because Bobby cried I didn t know anything about these things being here Can t you see that That s the trouble Robinson answered uncertainly I think I do see it Besides Graham said you re still without the instrument that caused death I expect to land it in this room Rawlins answered grimly He replaced the drawer and continued to fumble among the clothing it contained All at once he called out and raised his hand On the forefinger a tiny red stain showed How did you do that Robinson asked Something pricked me the detective answered Maybe it was only a pin but it might have been Excitedly he resumed his search He took the clothing from the drawer and threw it to one side Nothing remained in the drawer I guess it must have been a pin Robinson said disappointed But Rawlins took up each article of clothing and examined it minutely His face brightened Here s something stiff By gad I believe I ve got it Concealed in a woollen sack with the slender shaft thrust through and through the folds was a peculiarly long stout and sharp hat pin Rawlins drew it out He held it up triumphantly Now maybe we re not getting somewheres That s the boy that did the trick in both cases and it s what scratched mister Paredes Maybe you noticed how quickly she came upstairs to hide this when she got in Good work Rawlins Robinson said He glanced at Bobby and Graham Have either of you seen this deadly thing before Bobby wouldn t answer but after a moment s hesitation Graham spoke There s no point in lying Bobby Katherine knows nothing of this I disagree with Rawlins If she had been working with Paredes which is unthinkable she d never have made such a mistake She wouldn t have struck him I have seen her wear such a pin If she didn t cut him with it Rawlins reasoned who else could have got it out of here and put it back to night when she kept her door locked There s no getting around it Robinson said Take charge of these things Rawlins Put them in a safe place What are you going to do Bobby asked I m afraid there s only one thing to do Robinson answered I ll have to arrest you both One of you used this pin in the old room It doesn t make much difference which one You ve been working together and we ll find out about Paredes later You re making a terrible mistake Bobby muttered You don t know Katherine or you couldn t suspect her of any share in such crimes Give me until morning to prove how wrong you are What would be the use Robinson asked If you ll do that I will get the truth for you the whole truth how the room was entered everything I swear it Robinson Only a few hours Let me carry out my plan Let me offer myself to the dangers of the old room as Howells and my grandfather did Your case is no good unless you can explain the miracle to night Give us this chance Then in the morning if nothing happens and you still think I m guilty lock me up but for God s sake Robinson leave her out of it Graham walked to the window and flung it open A violent gust of wind swept in carrying a multitude of icy flakes The storm is worse he said No one is likely to try to escape from this house to night Bobby stretched out his hand You can t expose her to that Rawlins hadn t forgotten the sense of fellowship sprung from the pursuit of Paredes through the forest He s right mister Robinson You could lock up a dozen people You might send them to the chair without uncovering the real mystery of the Cedars Maybe he might find something and he d be as safe in that room as in any jail I know of I mean one of us would be in the library and the other in the corridor outside the broken door How could he reasonably get out If there was an attempt to repeat the trick we d be ready As for the girl it s simple enough to safeguard against her getting away before morning As mister Graham says no one s likely to run far in this storm anyway Robinson considered I don t want to be hard he said finally and I don t want to miss any chance of cleaning up where poor Howells failed He glanced at the extraordinary array of evidence The good nature which one felt should always have been in his face shone at last I don t believe you re guilty As far as you re concerned it s likely enough a put up job I don t know about the girl Go ahead anyway and tell us if you can how the locked room was entered Explain the mystery of that old man who looks as if he were dead but who moves around and talks with us The answer if it s anywhere Bobby said is in the old room Robinson nodded Under the conditions it seems worth while Go on then and clear your cousin and yourself if you can You have until daylight to morrow Bobby s gratitude was sufficiently eloquent in his eyes but he said nothing He hurried from the room to find Katherine As soon as he had stepped in the corridor he saw her figure against the wall Katherine he breathed I ve heard everything she said He led her to the main hall where the greedy ears in her bedroom couldn t overhear them Then you suspected what they were about he asked her Uncle Silas she answered seemed just as he had been when I went upstairs so I wondered and I remembered I had left my door unlocked Then you knew those things were there Her face was white She trembled Her words came jerkily Of course I didn t I only kept my door locked because they had searched so thoroughly before It was an humiliation I couldn t bear to face again You don t know he asked who took that stuff from Howells who hid it in your bureau The trembling of her slender body became more pronounced She spoke through chattering teeth Bobby Why do you ask such things You believe I am guilty as you thought I was the woman in black You think now because those things were in my bureau Stop Katherine You won t answer me No she said backing away from him But you are going to answer me We have come to that point already Just an hour or two of trust and then this It s the Cedars forcing us apart as it did when we had our quarrel Only this time it is definite Do you think I m guilty of these atrocious crimes or don t you Everything for us depends on your answer and I ll know whether you are telling me the truth Then he said why should I answer And he took her in his arms and held her close She didn t cry but for a moment she ceased trembling and her teeth no longer chattered My dear he said even if you had hidden that evidence I d have known it was to protect me Then she cried a little and for a moment even in the unmerciful grasp of their trouble they were nearly happy The footsteps of the others in the corridor recalled them Katherine leaned against the table drying her eyes Graham Robinson and Rawlins walked into the hall Hello Robinson said I suppose that isn t an unfair advantage mister Blackburn Still I d rather she hadn t been told He s told me nothing Katherine answered I came back to the corridor I heard everything you said Maybe it s as well Robinson reflected It certainly is if what you heard has shown you the wisdom of giving up the whole thing She stared at him without replying Come now he wheedled You might tell us at least why you stole and secreted the evidence I ll answer nothing That s wiser Katherine Graham put in She turned on him with a complete and unexpected fury The colour rushed back to her face Her eyes blazed Bobby had never guessed her capable of such anger His wonder grew that her outburst should be directed against Graham Keep quiet she cried hysterically Don t speak to me again I hate you Do you understand Graham drew back Why Katherine Don t she said Don t call me that The officers glanced at Graham with frank bewilderment Rawlins s materialistic mind didn t hesitate to express its first thought Must say I always thought you were sweet on the lady Hartley Bobby said You have been fair to us I don t know why she attacks me Graham muttered His face recorded a genuine pain His words Bobby felt overcame a barrier of emotion They heard Paredes and Doctor Groom on the stairs What s this the doctor rumbled as he came up I I m sorry I forgot myself Katherine said through her chattering teeth She turned to Robinson I am going to my room You needn t be afraid I shan t leave it until you come to take me Truly I hope it won t be necessary the district attorney answered She hurried away Rawlins grinned at Paredes I m wondering what the devil you know Robinson made no secret of what had happened In reply to the questions of Paredes and the doctor he told of the discovery of the evidence and of the stout hat pin that had unquestionably caused death The man made it clear enough however that he didn t care to have Paredes know of Bobby s plan to spend the night in the old room and Rawlins Bobby and Graham indicated that they understood It s quite absurd that any one should think Katherine guilty the doctor said to Robinson This evidence and its presence in her room are details that don t approach the heart of the mystery That s to be found only in the old room and I don t think any one wants to tempt it again In fact I m not sure one can learn the truth there and live You know what happened to Howells when he tried Silas Blackburn went there and none of us can understand the change that s taken place I have been watching him closely So has mister Paredes We have seen him become grayer We have seen his eyes alter He sits shaking in his chair Since we came back from the grave the man if we can call him a man seems to have shrunk Yes Paredes said Perhaps we shouldn t have left him alone Let us go back Let us see if he is all right Rawlins laughed skeptically You re not afraid he ll melt away I m not so sure he won t Paredes answered They followed him downstairs Because of the position of Blackburn s chair they could be sure of nothing until they had reached the lower floor and approached the fireplace Then they saw It was as if Paredes s far fetched fear had been realized Blackburn was not in his chair nor was he to be found in the hall Even then with the exception of Paredes they wouldn t take the thing seriously Since the old man wasn t in the hall since he couldn t have gone upstairs unobserved by them he must be either in the library the dining room or the rear part of the house There was no one in the library or the dining room and Jenkins who sat in the kitchen still shaken by the discovery at the grave said he hadn t moved for the last half hour was entirely sure no one had come through from the front part of the house They returned to the hall and stood in a half circle about the empty chair where a little while ago Silas Blackburn had cowered mouthing snatches of his fear I m not dead I tell you I m not dead They can t make me go back The echoes of that fear still shocked their ears There was a hypnotic power about the vacancy as there had been about the emptiness in the burial ground Paredes spoke gropingly What would we find he whispered if we went to the cemetery and looked again in the coffin Why should he have come back at all Groom mused Robinson opened the front door You know he might have gone this way But already the snow had obliterated the signs of their own passage in and out It showed no fresh marks Silas Blackburn has not gone that way in the body Doctor Groom rumbled The storm was more violent It discouraged the idea of examining the graveyard again before morning Robinson glanced at his watch He led Bobby and the detective to the library Then try your scheme if you want he said but understand I assume no responsibility Honestly I doubt if it amounts to anything You ll shout out if you are attacked or the moment you suspect any real cause for fear Rawlins will be in the corridor and I ll be in the library or wandering about the house always within call Rawlins will guard the broken door but be sure and lock the other one The two officers went upstairs with Bobby Graham followed You understand Robinson said I d rather Paredes and the doctor didn t suspect what you are going to do Change your mind before it s too late if you want Bobby walked on without replying You can t dissuade him Graham said because of what will happen to morrow unless the truth is discovered to night In the upper hall they found Katherine waiting Her endeavours were hard to face You shan t go there for me Bobby she said Isn t it clear I must go in my own service he said trying to smile He wouldn t speak to her again He wouldn t look at her Her anxiety and the affection in her eyes weakened him and he needed all his strength for at the entrance of the dark narrow corridor the fear met him Rawlins brought a candle and guided him down the corridor Graham came too The detective locked the door leading to the private hall and slipped the key in his pocket Nobody will get through there any more than they will through the other door which I ll watch With Graham s help he made a quick inspection of the room searching the closets and glancing beneath the bed and behind the furniture There s no one he said preparing to depart I tell you there s no chance of a physical attack His unimaginative mind cried out I tell you you ll find nothing learn nothing for there s nothing here to find nothing to learn Just the same Graham urged you ll call out won t you Bobby at the first sign of anything out of the way For God s sake take no foolish chances I don t want the light Bobby forced himself to say My grandfather and Howells both put their candles out I want everything as it was when they were attacked Rawlins nodded and followed by Graham carried the candle from the room and closed the broken door The sudden solitude and the darkness crushed Bobby taking his breath Yellow flames the response of his eyes to the disappearance of the candle tore across the blackness confusing him He felt his way to the wall near the open window He sat down there facing the bed At first he couldn t see the bed He saw only the projections of his fancy stimulated by Silas Blackburn s story against the black screen of the night He understood at last what the old man had meant The darkness did appear to possess a physical resistance and as the minutes lengthened it seemed to encase all the suffering the room had ever harboured But he wouldn t close his eyes as his grandfather had done It was a defence to keep them on the spot where the bed stood while his mind in spite of his will pictured lying there still forms with bandaged heads He wouldn t close his eyes even when those fancied shapes commenced to struggle in grotesque and impotent motion like ants whose hill has been demolished Nor could he drive from his ears the echoes of delirium that seemed to have lingered in the old room He continued to watch the darkness until the outlines of the room and of its furniture dimly detached themselves from the black pall The snow apparently caught what feeble light the moon forced through reflecting it with a disconsolate inefficiency He could see after a time the pallid frames of the windows the pillow on the bed and the wall above it He fancied the dark stain the depression in the mattress where the two bodies had rested Those physical objects forced on him the probability of his guilt Then he recalled that both men dead for many hours had moved apparently of their own volition and his grandfather had come back from the grave and then had disappeared leaving no trace and he comforted himself with the thought that the explanation if it came at all must arise from a force outside himself whether of the living or the dead Because of that very assurance his fear of the room was incited Could any subtle change overcome him here as it evidently had the others Could there be repeated in his case a return and a disappearance like his grandfather s There was as Rawlins had said no way in or out for an attack Therefore the danger must emerge from the dead and he was helpless before their incomprehensible campaign The whole illogical abominable course of events warned him to bring his vigil to an end before it should be too late urged him to escape from the restless revolt of the dead who had dwelt in this room And he wanted to respond He wanted to go to the corridor and confess to Rawlins and Robinson that he was beaten Yet he had begged so hard for this chance That course moreover meant the arrest of Katherine and himself in the morning For a few hours he could suffer here for her sake Daylight if he could persist until then would bring release and surely it couldn t be long now He shrank back Steadily it had grown colder in the old room He shivered He drew his coat closer about him What temerity to invade the domain of death as Paredes had called it to seek the secrets of unquiet souls He ceased shivering He waited tensely quiet Without calculation he realized that the moment for which he had hoped was at hand The old room was about to disclose its secret but would it permit him to depart with his knowledge He forgot to call He waited helpless and terrified against the wall He heard a moaning cry faint and distant the voice they had heard in the forest and at the grave But it was more than that that held him He knew now what Katherine had heard across the court heralding each tragedy and mystery He caught a formless stirring Yet on the bed there was no one Fortunately he had not gone there He tried to call out realizing that the danger could find him if it chose but his throat was tight and it permitted no response His glance hadn t wavered from the wall above the stained pillow There was movement there Then he saw A hand protruded from the blackness of the panelling where they had sounded and measured without success In the ashen unnatural light from the snow the long fingers of the hand were like the feelers of a gigantic reptile They wavered feebly and he became convinced that the hand was immaterial that it was unattached to any body If that was so it couldn t be the hand of Katherine At least he had proved that Robinson and Rawlins had been wrong about her That sense of victory stripped him of his paralyzing fear It loosed the tight band about his throat He called He could prove the immaterial nature of the repulsive hand wavering from the wall Crying out he sprang to his feet He flung himself across the bed With both of his own hands he grasped the slender inquisitive fingers which wavered above the stained pillow and once more his throat tightened He couldn t cry out again CHAPTER X THE CEDARS IS LEFT TO ITS SHADOWS Straightway Bobby repented the alarm he had perhaps too impulsively given For the hand protruding from the wall was indeed flesh and blood and with the knowledge came back his fear for Katherine conquering his first relief A sick revulsion swept him He remembered the evidence found in Katherine s room and her refusal to answer questions Could Paredes and the officers have been right Was it conceivably her hand struggling weakly in his grasp The door from the corridor crashed open Rawlins burst through Graham ran after him From the private stairway arose the sound of the district attorney s hurrying footsteps What is it What have you got Rawlins shouted Graham cried out You re all right Bobby The candle which the detective carried gleamed on the slender fingers showing Bobby that they had been inserted through an opening in the wall He couldn t understand for time after time each one of the panels had been sounded and examined Beyond he could see dimly the dark clothing of the person who with a stealth in itself suggestive of abnormal crime had made use of such a device As Rawlins hurried up he wondered if it wouldn t be the better course to free his prisoner to cry out urging an escape Already it was too late The detective and Graham had seen and clearly they had no doubt that he held the one responsible for two brutal murders and for the confusing mysteries that had capped them Looks like a lady s hand Rawlins called Don t let go young fellow He unlocked the door to the private hallway Graham and he dashed out In Bobby s uncertain grasp the hand twitched Robinson s voice reached him through the opening Let go mister Blackburn You ve done your share the Lord knows You ve caught the beast with the goods Bobby released the slender fingers He saw them vanish through the opening He left the bed and reluctantly approached the door to the private hall Excited phrases roared in his ears He scarcely dared listen because of their possible confirmation of his doubt The fingers he repeated to himself had been too slender The moment that had freed him from fear of his own guilt had constructed in its place an uncertainty harder to face Yet there was nothing to be gained by waiting Sooner or later he must learn whether Katherine had hidden the evidence whether she had used the stout and deadly hatpin whether she struggled now in the grasp of vindictive men A voice from the corridor arrested him Bobby With a glad cry he swung around Katherine stood in the opposite doorway Her presence there beyond a doubt was her exculpation He crossed the sombre room He grasped her hands He smiled happily After all the hand he had held was not as slender as hers Thank heavens you re here In a word he recited the result of his vigil It clears you she said Quick We must see who it is But he lingered for he wanted that ugly fear done with once for all You can tell me now how the evidence got in your room I can t she said I don t know The truth of her reply impressed him He looked at her and wondered that she should be fully dressed Why are you dressed he asked She was puzzled Why not I don t think any one had gone to bed But it must be very late I supposed it was the same time half past two She started to cross the room She laughed nervously It isn t eleven He recalled his interminable anticipation among the shadows of the old room I ve watched there only a little more than an hour Not much more than that Bobby What a coward I d have sworn it was nearly daylight She pressed his hand No Very brave she whispered Let us see if it was worth it They stepped through the doorway Half way down the hall Robinson Graham and Rawlins held a fourth who had ceased struggling Bobby paused yet since seeing Katherine step from the corridor his reason had taught him to expect just this The fourth man was Paredes nearly effeminate slender fingered Carlos Bobby cried You can t have done these unspeakable things The Panamanian stared without answering Evidently he had had time to control his chagrin to smother his revolt from the future for the thin face was bare of emotion The depths of the eyes as usual turned back scrutiny The man disclosed neither guilt nor the outrage of an assumed innocence neither confession nor denial He simply stared straining a trifle against the eager hands of his captors Rawlins grinned joyously You ought to have a medal for getting away with this young fellow Things didn t look so happy for you an hour or so ago And I had half a mind Robinson confessed to refuse you the chance Glad I didn t Glad as I can be you made good With the egotism any man is likely to draw from his efforts in the detection of crime he added easily Of course I ve suspected this spigotty all along I don t have to remind you of that Sure Rawlins said And didn t I put it up to him strong enough to night Paredes laughed lightly All credit where it is due You also put it up to Miss Perrine The details will straighten all that out Robinson said I don t pretend to have them yet I gather not Paredes mused with old Blackburn s ghost still in the offing That talk Rawlins said won t go down from you any more I daresay you ve got most of the details in your head I daresay Paredes answered dryly He fought farther back against the detaining hands Is there any necessity for this exhibition of brute strength You must find it very exhausting You may think me dangerous and I thank you but I have no gun and I m no match for four men and a woman Besides you hurt my arm Bobby was none too tender with that I ought to have used my good arm You ll get no details from me unless you take your hands off Robinson s hesitation was easily comprehensible If Paredes were responsible for the abnormalities they had experienced at the Cedars he might find it simple enough to trick them now but the man s mocking smile brought the anger to Robinson s face Of course he can t get away See if there s anything on his clothes Rawlins He ought to have the hatpin Then let him go The detective however failed to find the hatpin or any other weapon You see Paredes smiled That s something in my favour He stepped back brushing his clothing with his uninjured hand He lighted a cigarette He drew back the coat sleeve of his left arm and readjusted the bandage He glanced up as heavy footsteps heralded Doctor Groom Hello Doctor he called cheerily I was afraid you d nap through the show It seems the bloodhounds of the law left us out of their confidence What s all this the doctor rumbled Paredes waved his hand I am a prisoner The doctor gaped You mean you Young Blackburn caught him Robinson explained He was in a position to finish him just as he did Howells Except that I had no hatpin Paredes yawned The doctor s uneasy glance sought the opening in the wall I thought you had examined all these walls he grumbled How did you miss this Robinson ran his fingers through his hair That s what I ve been asking myself he said I went over that panelling a dozen times myself Bobby and Katherine went closer Bobby had been from the first puzzled by Paredes s easy manner He had a quick hope He saw the man watch with an amused tolerance while the district attorney bent over examining the face of the panel An entire section Robinson said the thickness of the wall has been shifted to one side No wonder we didn t see any joints or get a hollow sound from this panel any more than from the others But why didn t we stumble on the mechanism Maybe you ll tell us that Paredes The Panamanian blew a wreath of smoke against the ancient wall Gladly but you will find it humiliating I have experienced humility in this hall myself The reason you didn t find any mechanism is that there wasn t any You looked for something most cautiously concealed not realizing that the best concealment is no concealment at all It s fundamental I don t know how it slipped my own mind No grooves show because the door is an entire panel There isn t even a latch You merely push hard against its face Such arrangements are common enough in colonial houses and there was more than the nature of the crimes to tell you there was some such thing here I mean if you will examine the farther door closer than you have done you will find that it has fewer coats of paint than the one leading to the corridor that its frame is of newer wood In other words it was cut through after the wing was built This panel was the original door designed with the private stairway and the hall for the exclusive use of the master of the house Try it Robinson braced himself and shoved against the panel It moved in its grooves with a vibrant stirring Rusty he said Katherine started That s what I heard each time she cried Above his heavy black beard the doctor s cheeks whitened Robinson made a gesture of revulsion That gives the nasty game away Naturally Paredes said and you must admit the game is as beautifully simple as the panel The instrument of death wasn t inserted through the bedding as you thought inevitable Doctor Suppose you were lying in that bed asleep or half asleep and you were aroused by such a sound as that in the wall behind you What would you do What would any man do first of all Robinson nodded I see what you mean I d get up on my elbow I d look around as quickly as I could to see what it was I d expose myself to a clean thrust I d drop back on the bed more thoroughly out of it than though I d been struck through the heart Exactly Paredes said with the familiar shrug of his shoulders You re sensible to give up this way Robinson said It s the best plan for you What about mister Blackburn Graham interfered After all he said thoughtfully I m a lawyer and it isn t fair Robinson It s only decent to tell him that anything he says may be used against him Keep your mouth shut Robinson shouted But Paredes smiled at Graham It s very good of you but I agree with the district attorney There s no point in being a clam now Can you account for Silas Blackburn s return the doctor asked eagerly That s right Doctor Paredes said Stick to the ghosts I fancy there are plenty in this house I m afraid we must look on Silas Blackburn as dead You don t mean we ve been talking to a dead man Katherine whispered Before I answer Paredes said I want to have one or two things straight These men Bobby I really believe think me capable of the crimes in this house I want to know if you accept such a theory Do you think I had any idea of killing you Bobby studied the reserved face which even now was without emotion I can t think anything of the kind he said softly That s very nice Paredes said If you had answered differently I d have let these clever policemen lay their own ghosts He turned to Robinson Even you must begin to see that I m not guilty Your common sense will tell you so If I had been planning to kill Bobby why didn t I bring the weapon Why did I put my hand through the opening before I was ready to strike Why did I use my left hand my injured hand I was like Howells I couldn t consider the case finished until I had solved the mystery of the locked doors I supposed the room was empty When I found the secret to night I reached through to see how far my hand would be from the pillow Bobby s assurance of Paredes s innocence clouded his own situation made it in a sense more dangerous than it had ever been His wanderings about the Cedars remained unexplained and they knew now it had never been necessary for the murderer to enter the room Katherine too evidently realized the menace Do you think I she began Paredes bowed You dislike me Miss Katherine but don t be afraid for yourself or Bobby I think I can tell you how the evidence got in your room I can answer nearly everything There s one point He broke off glancing at his watch Extraordinary courage he mused enigmatically I scarcely understand it Rawlins looked at him suspiciously All this explaining may be a trick mister Robinson The man s slippery I ve had to be slippery to work under your noses Paredes laughed By the way Bobby did you hear a woman crying about the time I opened this door Yes It sounded like the voice we heard at the grave I thought I heard it from the library Robinson put in Then the rumpus up here started and I forgot about it The woman in black is very brave Paredes mused We should have had a visit from her long before this Do you know who she is Robinson asked And as Rawlins says no tricks We haven t let you go yet I thought Paredes mocked that you had identified the woman in black as Miss Katherine She hasn t had anything to do with the mystery directly Neither has Bobby Neither have I Then what the devil have you been doing here Robinson snapped Seeing your job through Paredes answered for Bobby s sake With a warm gratitude Bobby knew that Paredes had told the truth Then he had told it in the library yesterday when they had caught him prowling in the private staircase All along he had told it while they had tried to convict him of under handed and unfriendly intentions I saw Paredes was saying that Howells wouldn t succeed and it was obvious you and Rawlins would do worse while Graham s blundering from the start left no hope Somebody had to rescue Bobby Then why did you give us the impression Graham asked that you were not a friend Paredes held up his hand That s going rather far mister Graham Never once have I given such an impression I have time after time stated the fact that I was here in Bobby s service That has been the trouble with all of you As most detectives do you have denied facts searching always for something more subtle You have asked for impossibilities while you blustered that they couldn t exist Still every one is prone to do that when he fancies himself in the presence of the supernatural The facts of this case have been within your reach as well as mine The motive has been an easy one to understand Money And you have consistently turned your back Robinson spread his hands All right Prove that I m a fool and I ll acknowledge it Doctor Groom interrupted sharply What was that They bent forward listening Even with Paredes offering them a physical explanation they shrank from the keening that barely survived the heavy atmosphere of the old house You see the woman in black isn t Miss Perrine Paredes said He ran down the stairs They followed responding to an excited sense of imminence Even in the private staircase the pounding that had followed the cry reached them with harsh reverberations Its echoes filled the house as they dashed across the library and the dining room In the hall they realized that it came from the front door It had attained a feverish a desperate insistence Paredes walked to the fireplace Open the door he directed Rawlins Rawlins stepped to the door unlocked it and flung it wide The woman Katherine breathed A feminine figure white with snow stumbled in as if she had stood braced against the door Rawlins caught her and held her upright The flakes whirled from the court in vicious pursuit Bobby slammed the door shut Maria he cried You were right Hartley Yet at first he could scarcely accept this pitiful creature as the brilliant and exotic dancer with whom he had dined the night of the first murder As he stared at her her features twisted She burst into retching sobs She staggered toward Paredes As she went the snow melted from her hat and cloak She became a black figure again With an appearance of having been immersed in water she sank on the hearth swaying back and forth reaching blindly for Paredes s hand Do what you please with me Carlos she whimpered with her slight accent from which all the music had fled I couldn t stand it another minute I couldn t get to the station and I I wanted to know which which Paredes watched her curiously Get Jenkins he said softly to Rawlins He faced Maria again I could have told you I think when you fought me away out there No one wants to arrest you Jenkins will verify my own knowledge This is dangerous the doctor rumbled This woman shouldn t wait here She should have dry clothing at once Maria shrank from him For the first time her wet skirt exposed her feet encased in torn stockings The dancer wore no shoes and Bobby guessed why she had been so elusive why she had left so few traces I won t go she cried until he tells me Katherine got a cloak and threw it across the woman s shoulders Maria looked up at her with a dumb gratitude Then Rawlins came back with Jenkins The butler was bent and haggard His surrender to fear was more pronounced than it had been at the grave or when they had last seen him in the kitchen He grasped a chair and breathing heavily looked from one to the other moistening his lips Paredes faced the man completely master of the situation Through the old butler it became clear he would make his revelation and announce that simple fact they all had missed It was mister Silas of course who came back Oh my God the butler moaned What do you mean I know everything Jenkins Paredes said evenly The butler collapsed against the chair Paredes grasped his arm Pull yourself together man They won t want you as more than an accessory Maria started to rise She shrank back again shivering close to the fire Is your master hiding Paredes asked or has he left the house Jenkins s answer came through trembling lips He s gone mister Silas is gone How did you find out My God How did you find out He said nothing to you Paredes asked Jenkins shook his head Tell me how he was dressed The old servant covered his face mister Silas stumbled through the kitchen he answered hoarsely I tried to stop him but he pushed me away and ran out His voice rose I tell you he ran without a coat or a hat into the storm Paredes sighed The Cedars s final tragedy yet it was the most graceful exit he could have made Maria struggled to her feet Her eyes were the eyes of a person without reason That familiar hysterical quality which they had heard before at a distance vibrated in her voice Then he was the one I wanted to kill him I couldn t kill him because I never was sure Did you see him go out an hour or so ago Paredes asked I saw him she cried feverishly run from the back of the house and down the path to the lake I I tried to catch him but my feet were frozen and the snow was slippery and I couldn t find my shoes But I called and he wouldn t stop I had to know because I wanted to kill him if it was Silas Blackburn And I saw him run to the lake and splash in until the water was over his head She flung her clenched hands out Her voice became a scream shot with all her suffering all her doubt all her fury You don t understand He can t be punished I tell you he s at the bottom of the lake with the man he murdered And I can t pay him I tried to go after him but it it was too cold She sank in one of the chairs shaking and sobbing Unless we want another tragedy the doctor said this woman must be put to bed and taken care of She has been terribly exposed You ve heard her She s delirious Not so delirious that she hasn t told the truth Paredes said The doctor lifted her in his arms and with Rawlins s help carried her upstairs Katherine went with them Almost immediately the doctor and Rawlins hurried down I have told Katherine what to do Doctor Groom said The woman may be all right in the morning What s she been up to here Then Bobby cried there was a connection between the dinner party and the murders But what about my coming here unconscious What about my handkerchief I can see no answer yet Graham said Paredes smiled Not when you ve had the answer to everything I have shown you that Silas Blackburn was the murderer The fact stared you in the face Everything that has happened at the Cedars has pointed to his guilt Except the doctor said his own apparent murder which made his guilt seem impossible And I m not sure you re right now for there is no other Blackburn he could have murdered and Blackburns look alike You wouldn t mistake another man for one of them This house Paredes smiled has all along been full of the presence of the other Blackburn There has been evidence enough for you all to have known he was here He stretched himself in an easy chair He lighted a cigarette and blew the smoke toward the ceiling I shall tell you the simple facts if only to save my skin from this blood thirsty district attorney Rub it in Robinson grinned I ll take my medicine They gathered closer about the Panamanian Jenkins sidled to the back of his chair I don t see how you found it out he muttered I had only one advantage over you or the police Graham Paredes began and you were in a position to overcome that Maria did telephone me the afternoon of that ghastly dinner She asked me to get hold of Bobby She was plainly anxious to keep him in New York that night and to be frank I was glad enough to help her when you turned up trying to impress us with your puritan watchfulness Even you guessed that she had drugged Bobby I suspected it when I saw him go to pieces in the cafe He gave me the slip as I told you in the coat room when I was trying to get him home so I went back and asked Maria what her idea was She laughed in my face denying everything I too suspected the stranger but I ve convinced myself that he simply happened along by chance Now here s the first significant point Maria by drugging Bobby defeated her own purpose He had been drinking more than the Band of Hope would approve of and on top of that he got an overdose of a powerful drug The doctor can tell you better than I of the likely effect of such a combination What I told you in the court Bobby the doctor answered much the same symptoms as genuine aphasia Your brain was unquestionably dulled by an overdose on top of all that alcohol while your mechanical reflexes were stimulated Automatically you followed your ruling impulse Automatically at the last minute you revolted from exposing yourself in such a condition to your cousin and your grandfather Your lucid period in the woods just before you reached the deserted house and went to sleep showed that your exercise was overcoming the effect of the drug That moment you ll remember was coloured by the fanciful ideas such a drug would induce So Bobby Paredes said although you were asleep when the body moved and when Howells was murdered you can be sure you weren t anywhere near the old room But I walked in my sleep last night Bobby reminded him The doctor slapped his knee I understand It was only when we thought that was your habit that it frightened us It s plain This sleep walking had been suggested to you and you had brooded upon the suggestion until you were bound to respond Graham s presence in your room watching for just that reaction was a perpetual an unescapable stimulation It would have been a miracle in itself if your brain had failed to carry it out Bobby made a swift gesture of distaste If you hadn t come Carlos where would I have been Why did you come Graham asked Bobby was my friend the Panamanian answered He had been very good to me When I read of his grandfather s death I wondered why Maria had drugged him to keep him in New York In the coincidence lurked an element of trouble for him At first I suspected some kind of an understanding between her and old Blackburn perhaps she had engaged to keep Bobby away from the Cedars until the new will had been made But here was Blackburn murdered and it was manifest she hadn t tried to throw suspicion on Bobby and the points that made Howells s case incomplete assured me of his innocence Who then had killed his grandfather Not Maria for I had dropped her at her apartment that night too late for her to get out here by the hour of the murder Still as you suspected Maria was the key and I began to speculate about her She had told me something of her history You might have had as much from her press agent Although she had lived in Spain since she was a child she was born in Panama my own country of a Spanish mother and an American father Right away I wondered if Blackburn had ever been in Panama or Spain I began to seek the inception of the possible understanding between them Since I found no illuminating documents about Blackburn s past in the library I concluded if such papers existed they would be locked up in the desk in his room I searched there a number of times giving you every excuse I could think of to get upstairs The other night after I had suspected her of knowing something Miss Katherine nearly caught me But I found what I wanted a carefully hidden packet of accounts and letters and newspaper clippings They re at your service mister District Attorney They told me that Silas Blackburn had been in Panama They proved that Maria instead of ever having been his accomplice was his enemy They explained the source of his wealth and the foundation of that enmity Certainly you remember the doctor told us Silas Blackburn started life with nothing and hadn t you ever wondered why with all his money he buried himself in this lonely hole He returned from South America rich more than twenty five years ago the doctor said Why should we bother about his money I wish you had bothered about several things besides your ghosts Paredes said You d have found it significant that Blackburn laid the foundation of his fortune in Panama during the hideous scandals of the old French canal company We knew he was a selfish tyrant That discovery showed me how selfish how merciless he was for to succeed in Panama during those days required an utter contempt for all the standards of law and decency The men who got along held life cheaper than a handful of coppers That s what I meant when I walked around the hall talking of the ghosts of Panama For I was beginning to see Silas Blackburn s fear his trip to Smithtown were the first indications of the presence of the other Blackburn The papers outlined him more clearly Why had it been forgotten here Doctor that Silas Blackburn had a brother his partner in those wretched and profitable contract scandals You mean the doctor answered Robert Blackburn He was a year younger than Silas This boy was named in memory of him Why should any one have remembered He died in South America more than a quarter of a century ago before these children were born That s what Silas Blackburn told you when he came back Paredes said He may have believed it at first or he may not have I daresay he wanted to for he came back with his brother s money as well as his own the cash and the easily convertible securities that were all men would handle in that hell But he never forgot that his brother s wife was alive and when he ran from Panama he knew she was about to become a mother That brings me to the other feature that made me wander around here like a restless spirit myself that night You had just told your story about the woman crying If there was a strange woman around here it was almost certainly Maria As Rawlins deduced she must either be hysterical or signalling some one Why should she come unless something had gone wrong the night she drugged Bobby to keep him in New York She wasn t his enemy because that very night she did him a good turn by trampling out his tracks in the court Bobby took Maria s letter from his pocket and handed it to Paredes Then how would you account for this The Panamanian read the letter Her way of covering herself he explained in case you suspected she had made you drink too much or had drugged you She really wanted you to come to tea that afternoon It was after writing that that she found out what had gone wrong In other words she read in the paper of Silas Blackburn s death and in a panic she put on plain clothes and hurried out to see what had happened The fact that she forgot her managers her professional reputation everything testified to her anxiety and I began to sense the truth She had been born in Panama of a Spanish mother and an American father She had some stealthy interest in the Cedars and the Blackburns She was about the right age Ten to one she was Silas Blackburn s niece So for me many hours before Silas Blackburn walked in here the presence of the other Blackburn about the Cedars became a tragic and threatening inevitability Had Silas Blackburn been murdered or had his brother Where was the survivor who had committed that brutal murder Maria had come here hysterically to answer those questions She might know The light in the deserted house She might be hiding him and taking food to him there But her crying suggested a signal which he never answered At any rate I had to find Maria So I slipped out I thought I heard her at the lake She wasn t there I was sure I would trap her at the deserted house for the diffused glow of the light we had seen proved that it had come through the cobwebbed windows of the cellar which are set in little wells below the level of the ground The cellar explained also how she had turned her flashlight off and slipped through the hall and out while we searched the rooms She hadn t gone back I couldn t find her So I went on into Smithtown and sent a costly cable to my father His answer came to night just before Silas Blackburn walked in He had talked with several of the survivors of those evil days He gave me a confirmation of everything I had gathered from the papers The Blackburns had quarrelled over a contract Robert had been struck over the head He wandered about the isthmus half witted forgetting his name nursing one idea Someone had robbed him and he wanted his money back or a different kind of payment but he couldn t remember who and he took it out in angry talk Then he disappeared and people said he had gone to Spain Of course his wife suspected a good deal In Blackburn s desk are pitiful and threatening letters from her which he ignored Then she died and Blackburn thought he was safe But he took no chances Some survivor of those days might turn up and try blackmail It was safer to bury himself here Then Bobby said Maria must have brought her father with her when she came from Spain last summer Brought him or sent for him Paredes answered She s made most of her money on this side you know And she s as loyal and generous as she is impulsive Undoubtedly she had the doctors do what they could for her father and when she got track of Silas Blackburn through you Bobby she nursed in the warped brain that dominant idea with her own Latin desire for justice and payment Then Graham said that s what Silas Blackburn was afraid of instead of Bobby as he tried to convince us to night to cover himself One minute mister Paredes Robinson broke in Why did you maintain this extraordinary secrecy Nobody would have hurt you if you had put us on the right track and asked for a little help Why did you throw sand in our eyes Why did you talk all the time about ghosts I had to go on tiptoe Paredes smiled I suspected there was at least one spy in the house So I gave the doctor s ghost talk all the impetus I could I was like Howells as I ve told you in believing the case couldn t be complete without the discovery of the secret entrance of the room of death My belief in the existence of such a thing made me lean from the first to Silas Blackburn rather than Robert It s a tradition in many families to hand such things down to the head of each generation Silas Blackburn was the one most likely to know Such a secret door had never been mentioned to you had it Bobby Bobby shook his head Paredes turned and smiled at the haggard butler I m right so far am I not Jenkins Jenkins bobbed his head jerkily Then Paredes went on you might answer one or two questions When did the first letter that frightened your master come The day he went to Smithtown and talked to the detective the butler quavered You can understand his reflections Paredes mused Money was his god He distrusted and hated his own flesh and blood because he thought they coveted it He was prepared to punish them by leaving it to a public charity Now arises this apparition from the past with no claim in a court of law with an intention simply to ask and in case of a refusal to punish The conclusion reached by that selfish and merciless mind was inevitable He probably knew nothing whatever about Maria If all the world thought his brother dead his brother s murder now wouldn t alter anything I ll wager Doctor that at that time he talked over wounds at the base of the brain with you The doctor moved restlessly Yes But he was very superstitious We talked about it in connection with his ancestors who had died of such wounds in that room Everything was ready when he made the rendezvous here Paredes went on He expected to have Bobby at hand in case his plan failed and he had to defend himself But Maria had made sure that there should be no help for him When the man came did you take him upstairs Jenkins No sir I watched that Miss Katherine didn t leave the library but I think she must have caught mister Silas in the upper hall after he had pretended to give up and had persuaded his brother to spend the night Paredes smiled whimsically He took two faded photographs from his pocket They were of young men after the fashion of Blackburns remarkably alike even without the gray obliterating marks of old age I found these in the family album he said We should have known the difference just the same the doctor grumbled Why didn t we know the difference I ve complained often enough Paredes smiled of the necessity of using candles in this house There was never more than one candle in the old bedroom There were only two when we looked at the murdered man in his coffin And in death there are no familiar facial expressions no eccentricities of speech So you can imagine my feelings when I tried to picture the drama that had gone on in that room You can imagine poor Maria s Which one And Maria didn t know about the panel or the use of Miss Katherine s hat pin or the handkerchief All of those details indicated Silas Blackburn How could my handkerchief indicate anything of the kind Bobby asked How did it come there What Paredes said is the commonest form of borrowing in the world particularly in a climate where people have frequent colds I found a number of your handkerchiefs in your grandfather s bureau The handkerchief furnished me with an important clue It explains I think Jenkins will tell you the moving of the body It was obviously the cause of Howells s death Yes sir Jenkins quavered mister Silas thought he had dropped his own handkerchief in the room with the body I don t know how you ve found these things out By adding two and two Paredes laughed In the first place you must all realize that we might have had no mystery at all if it hadn t been for Miss Katherine For I don t know that Maria could have done much in a legal way Silas Blackburn had intended to dispose of the body immediately but Miss Katherine heard the panel move and ran to the corridor She made Jenkins break down the door and she sent for the police Silas Blackburn was helpless He was beaten at that moment but he did the best he could He went to Waters hoping at the worst to establish an alibi through the book worm who probably wouldn t remember the exact hour of his arrival Waters s house offered him too a strategic advantage You heard him say the spare room was on the ground floor You heard him add that he refused to open his door either asking to be left alone or failing to answer at all And he had to return to the Cedars the next day for he missed his handkerchief and he pictured himself since he thought it was his own in the electric chair I m right Jenkins Yes sir I kept him hidden and gave him his chance along in the afternoon He wanted me to try to find the handkerchief but I didn t have the courage He couldn t find it He searched through the panel all about the body and the bed That was when Katherine heard Bobby said when we found the body had been moved It put him in a dreadful way Jenkins mumbled for no one had bothered to tell me it was young mister Robert the detective suspected and when mister Silas heard the detective boast that he knew everything and would make an arrest in the morning he thought about the handkerchief and knew he was done for unless he took Howells up And the man did ask for trouble sir Well mister Silas gave it to him to save himself I ve never been able to understand Paredes said why he didn t take the evidence when he killed Howells Didn t you know you prevented that sir Jenkins asked I heard you come in from the court I thought you d been listening I signalled mister Silas there was danger and to get out of the private stairway before you could trap him And I couldn t give him another chance for a long time Some of you were in the room after that or Miss Katherine and mister Graham were sitting in the corridor watching the body until just before mister Robert tried to get the evidence for himself mister Silas had to act then It was his last chance for he thought mister Robert would be glad enough to turn him over to the law Why did you ever hide that stuff in Miss Katherine s room Bobby asked Jenkins flung up his hands Oh he was angry sir when he knew the truth and learned what a mistake he d made Howells didn t give me that report I showed you It was in his pocket with the other things We got it open without tearing the envelope and mister Silas read it He wouldn t destroy anything He never dreamed of anybody s suspecting Miss Katherine so he told me to hide the things in her bureau I think he figured on using the evidence to put the blame on mister Robert in case it was the only way to save himself Why did you show the report to me Bobby asked I I was afraid to take all that responsibility the butler quavered I figured if you were partly to blame it might go easier with me Paredes shrugged his shoulders You were a good mate for Silas Blackburn he sneered Even now I don t see how that old scoundrel had the courage to show himself to night Rawlins said That s the beautiful justice of the whole thing Paredes answered for there was nothing else whatever for him to do There never had been anything else for him to do since Miss Katherine had spoiled his scheme since you all believed that it was he who had been murdered He had to hide the truth or face the electric chair If he disappeared he was infinitely worse off than though he had settled with his brother a man without a home without a name without a penny Jenkins nodded He had to come back he said slowly and he knew how scared you were of the old room The funeral and the snow Paredes said gave him his chance Jenkins will doubtless tell you how they uncovered the grave late this afternoon took that poor devil s body and threw it in the lake then fastened the coffin and covered it again Of course the snow effaced every one of their tracks He came in naturally scared to death and told us that story based on the legends of the Cedars and the doctor s supernatural theories And you must admit that he might as you call it have got away with it He did create a mystification The body of the murdered man had disappeared There was no murdered Blackburn as far as you could tell Heaven knows how long you might have struggled with the case of Howells He glanced up Here is Miss Katherine She stood at the head of the stairs I think she s all right she said to the doctor She s asleep She went to sleep crying May I come down The doctor nodded She walked down glancing from one to the other questioningly Poor Maria Paredes mused She s the one I pity most She s been at times I think what Rawlins suspected an insane woman wandering and crying through the woods Assuredly she was out of her head to night when I found her finally at the grave I tried to tell her that her father was dead I begged her to come in I told her we were friends But she fought She wouldn t answer my questions She struck me finally when I tried to force her to come out of the storm Robinson I want you to listen to me for a moment I honestly believe for everybody s sake I did a good thing when I asked Silas Blackburn just before he disappeared why he had thrown his brother s body in the lake I d hoped it would simply make him run for it I prayed that we would never hear from him again and that Miss Katherine and Bobby could be spared the ugly scandal Doesn t this do as well Can t we get along without much publicity You ve about earned the right to dictate Robinson said gruffly Thanks For everybody s sake Bobby echoed You re right Carlos Maria must be considered now She shall have what was taken from her father with interest I know Katherine will agree Katherine nodded I doubt if Maria will want it or take it Paredes said simply She has plenty of her own It isn t fair to think it was greed that urged her You must understand that it was a bigger impulse than greed It was a thing of which we of Spanish blood are rather proud a desire for justice for something that has no softer name than revenge Suddenly Rawlins stooped and took the Panamanian s hand Say We ve been giving you the raw end of a lot of snap judgments We ve never got acquainted until to night Glad to meet you too Robinson grinned Rawlins patted the Panamanian s shoulder At that you d make a first class detective Paredes yawned I disagree with you thoroughly I have no equipment beyond my eyes and my common sense He yawned again He arranged the card table in front of the fire He got the cards and piled them in neat packs on the green cloth He placed a box of cigarettes convenient to his right hand He smoked I m very sleepy but I ve been so stupid over this solitaire since I ve been at the Cedars that I must solve it in the interest of my self respect before I go to bed Bobby went to him impulsively I m ashamed Carlos I don t know what to say How can I say anything How can I begin to thank you If you ever tell me I saved your life Paredes yawned I shall have to disappear because then you d have a claim on me Katherine touched his hand There were tears in her eyes It wasn t necessary for her to speak Paredes indicated two chairs If you aren t too tired sit here and help me for a while Perhaps between us we ll get somewhere I wonder why I have been so stupid with the thing After a time as he manipulated the cards he laughed lightly The same thing the thing I ve been scolding you all for With a perfectly simple play staring me in the face I nearly made the mistake of choosing a difficult one That would have got me in trouble while the simple one gives me the game Why are people like that As he moved the cards with a deft assurance to their desired combination he smiled drolly at Graham Rawlins and Robinson I guess it must be human nature Don t you think so mister District Attorney The condition Paredes had more than once foreseen was about to shroud the Cedars in loneliness and abandonment After the hasty double burial in the old graveyard the few things Bobby and Katherine wanted from the house had been packed and taken to the station At Katherine s suggestion they had decided to leave last of all and to walk Paredes with a tender solicitude had helped Maria to the waiting automobile He came back trying to colour his good bye with cheerfulness After all you may open the place again and let me visit you You will visit us perpetually Bobby said while Katherine pressed the Panamanian s hand but never here again We will leave it to its ghosts as you have often prophesied I am not sure Paredes said thoughtfully that the ghosts aren t here It was evident that Graham wished to speak to Bobby and Katherine alone so the Panamanian strolled back to the automobile Graham s embarrassment made them all uncomfortable You have not said much to me Katherine he began Is it because I practically lied to Bobby trying to keep you apart She tried to smile I too must ask forgiveness I shouldn t have spoken to you as I did the other night in the hall but I thought because you saw Bobby and I had come together that you had spied on me had deliberately tricked me knowing the evidence was in my room Of course you did try to help Bobby Yes he said and I tried to help you that night I was sure you were innocent I believed the best way to prove it to them was to let them search The two of you have nothing worse than jealousy to reproach me with In a sense it pleased Bobby that Graham who had always made him feel unworthy in Katherine s presence should confess himself not beyond reproach Come Hartley he cried I was beginning to think you were perfect We ll get along all the better the three of us for having had it out Graham murmured his thanks He joined Paredes and Maria in the automobile As they drove off Paredes turned His face as he waved a languid farewell was quite without expression Bobby and Katherine were left alone to the thicket and the old house After a time they walked through the court and from the shadow of the time stained melancholy walls At the curve of the driveway they paused and looked back The shroud of loneliness and abandonment descending upon the Cedars became for them nearly ponderable So they turned from that brooding picture and hand in hand walked out of the forest into the friendly and welcoming sunlight THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Abandoned Room

visit http pglaf org donate Section five General Information About Project Gutenberg tm electronic works Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www gutenberg net etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER
