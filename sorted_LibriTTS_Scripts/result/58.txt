defeated and repulsed And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness Thou Spirit who led saint this glorious Eremite Into the desert his victorious field Against the spiritual foe and brought saint him thence ten By proof the undoubted Son of God inspire As thou art wont my prompted song else mute And bear through highth or depth of Nature s bounds With prosperous wing full summed to tell of deeds Above heroic though in secret done And unrecorded left through many an age Worthy to have not remained so long unsung Now had the great Proclaimer with a voice More awful than the sound of trumpet cried Repentance and Heaven s kingdom nigh at hand twenty To all baptized To his great baptism flocked With awe the regions round and with them came From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed To the flood Jordan came as then obscure Unmarked unknown But him the Baptist soon Descried divinely warned and witness bore As to his worthier and would have resigned To him his heavenly office Nor was long His witness unconfirmed on him baptized Heaven opened and in likeness of a Dove thirty The Spirit descended while the Father s voice From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son That heard the Adversary who roving still About the world at that assembly famed Would not be last and with the voice divine Nigh thunder struck the exalted man to whom Such high attest was given a while surveyed With wonder then with envy fraught and rage Flies to his place nor rests but in mid air To council summons all his mighty Peers forty Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved A gloomy consistory and them amidst With looks aghast and sad he thus bespake O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World For much more willingly I mention Air This our old conquest than remember Hell Our hated habitation well ye know How many ages as the years of men This Universe we have possessed and ruled In manner at our will the affairs of Earth fifty Since Adam and his facile consort Eve Lost Paradise deceived by me though since With dread attending when that fatal wound Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve Upon my head Long the decrees of Heaven Delay for longest time to Him is short And now too soon for us the circling hours This dreaded time have compassed wherein we Must bide the stroke of that long threatened wound At least if so we can and by the head sixty Broken be not intended all our power To be infringed our freedom and our being In this fair empire won of Earth and Air For this ill news I bring The Woman s Seed Destined to this is late of woman born His birth to our just fear gave no small cause But his growth now to youth s full flower displaying All virtue grace and wisdom to achieve Things highest greatest multiplies my fear Before him a great Prophet to proclaim seventy His coming is sent harbinger who all Invites and in the consecrated stream Pretends to wash off sin and fit them so Purified to receive him pure or rather To do him honour as their King All come And he himself among them was baptized Not thence to be more pure but to receive The testimony of Heaven that who he is Thenceforth the nations may not doubt I saw The Prophet do him reverence on him rising eighty Out of the water Heaven above the clouds Unfold her crystal doors thence on his head A perfet Dove descend whate er it meant And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard This is my Son beloved in him am pleased His mother than is mortal but his Sire He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven And what will He not do to advance his Son His first begot we know and sore have felt When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep ninety Who this is we must learn for Man he seems In all his lineaments though in his face The glimpses of his Father s glory shine Ye see our danger on the utmost edge Of hazard which admits no long debate But must with something sudden be opposed Not force but well couched fraud well woven snares Ere in the head of nations he appear Their king their leader and supreme on Earth I when no other durst sole undertook one hundred The dismal expedition to find out And ruin Adam and the exploit performed Successfully a calmer voyage now Will waft me and the way found prosperous once Induces best to hope of like success He ended and his words impression left Of much amazement to the infernal crew Distracted and surprised with deep dismay At these sad tidings But no time was then For long indulgence to their fears or grief one hundred ten Unanimous they all commit the care And management of this man enterprise To him their great Dictator whose attempt At first against mankind so well had thrived In Adam s overthrow and led their march From Hell s deep vaulted den to dwell in light Regents and potentates and kings yea gods Of many a pleasant realm and province wide So to the coast of Jordan he directs His easy steps girded with snaky wiles one hundred twenty Where he might likeliest find this new declared This man of men attested Son of God Temptation and all guile on him to try So to subvert whom he suspected raised To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed But contrary unweeting he fulfilled The purposed counsel pre ordained and fixed Of the Most High who in full frequence bright Of Angels thus to Gabriel smiling spake Gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold one hundred thirty Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth With Man or men s affairs how I begin To verify that solemn message late On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure In Galilee that she should bear a son Great in renown and called the Son of God Then told saint her doubting how these things could be To her a virgin that on her should come The Holy Ghost and the power of the Highest O ershadow her This Man born and now upgrown one hundred forty To shew him worthy of his birth divine And high prediction henceforth I expose To Satan let him tempt and now assay His utmost subtlety because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng Of his Apostasy He might have learnt Less overweening since he failed in Job Whose constant perseverance overcame Whate er his cruel malice could invent He now shall know I can produce a man one hundred fifty Of female seed far abler to resist All his solicitations and at length All his vast force and drive him back to Hell Winning by conquest what the first man lost By fallacy surprised But first I mean To exercise him in the Wilderness There he shall first lay down the rudiments Of his great warfare ere I send him forth To conquer Sin and Death the two grand foes By humiliation and strong sufferance one hundred sixty His weakness shall o ercome Satanic strength And all the world and mass of sinful flesh That all the Angels and aethereal Powers They now and men hereafter may discern From what consummate virtue I have chose This perfet man by merit called my Son To earn salvation for the sons of men So spake the Eternal Father and all Heaven Admiring stood a space then into hymns Burst forth and in celestial measures moved one hundred seventy Circling the throne and singing while the hand Sung with the voice and this the argument Victory and triumph to the Son of God Now entering his great duel not of arms But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles The Father knows the Son therefore secure Ventures his filial virtue though untried Against whate er may tempt whate er seduce Allure or terrify or undermine Be frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell one hundred eighty And devilish machinations come to nought So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned Meanwhile the Son of God who yet some days Lodged in Bethabara where John baptized Musing and much revolving in his breast How best the mighty work he might begin Of Saviour to mankind and which way first Publish his godlike office now mature One day forth walked alone the Spirit leading And his deep thoughts the better to converse one hundred ninety With solitude till far from track of men Thought following thought and step by step led on He entered now the bordering Desert wild And with dark shades and rocks environed round His holy meditations thus pursued O what a multitude of thoughts at once Awakened in me swarm while I consider What from within I feel myself and hear What from without comes often to my ears Ill sorting with my present state compared two hundred When I was yet a child no childish play To me was pleasing all my mind was set Serious to learn and know and thence to do What might be public good myself I thought Born to that end born to promote all truth All righteous things Therefore above my years The Law of God I read and found it sweet Made it my whole delight and in it grew To such perfection that ere yet my age Had measured twice six years at our great Feast two hundred ten I went into the Temple there to hear The teachers of our Law and to propose What might improve my knowledge or their own And was admired by all Yet this not all To which my spirit aspired Victorious deeds Flamed in my heart heroic acts one while To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke Then to subdue and quell o er all the earth Brute violence and proud tyrannic power Till truth were freed and equity restored two hundred twenty Yet held it more humane more heavenly first By winning words to conquer willing hearts And make persuasion do the work of fear At least to try and teach the erring soul Not wilfully misdoing but unware Misled the stubborn only to subdue These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving By words at times cast forth inly rejoiced And said to me apart High are thy thoughts O Son but nourish them and let them soar two hundred thirty To what highth sacred virtue and true worth Can raise them though above example high By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire For know thou art no son of mortal man Though men esteem thee low of parentage Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules All Heaven and Earth Angels and sons of men A messenger from God foretold thy birth Conceived in me a virgin he foretold Thou shouldst be great and sit on David s throne two hundred forty And of thy kingdom there should be no end At thy nativity a glorious quire Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem sung To shepherds watching at their folds by night And told them the Messiah now was born Where they might see him and to thee they came Directed to the manger where thou lay saint For in the inn was left no better room A Star not seen before in heaven appearing Guided the Wise Men thither from the East two hundred fifty

prophetic Anna warned By vision found thee in the Temple and spake Before the altar and the vested priest Like things of thee to all that present stood This having heart straight I again revolved The Law and Prophets searching what was writ two hundred sixty Concerning the Messiah to our scribes Known partly and soon found of whom they spake I am this chiefly that my way must lie Through many a hard assay even to the death Ere I the promised kingdom can attain Or work redemption for mankind whose sins Full weight must be transferred upon my head Yet neither thus disheartened or dismayed The time prefixed I waited when behold The Baptist of whose birth I oft had heard two hundred seventy Not knew by sight now come who was to come Before Messiah and his way prepare I as all others to his baptism came Which I believed was from above but he Straight knew me and with loudest voice proclaimed Me him for it was shewn him so from Heaven Me him whose harbinger he was and first Refused on me his baptism to confer As much his greater and was hardly won But as I rose out of the laving stream two hundred eighty Heaven opened her eternal doors from whence The Spirit descended on me like a Dove And last the sum of all my Father s voice Audibly heard from Heaven pronounced me his Me his beloved Son in whom alone He was well pleased by which I knew the time Now full that I no more should live obscure But openly begin as best becomes The authority which I derived from Heaven And now by some strong motion I am led two hundred ninety Into this wilderness to what intent I learn not yet Perhaps I need not know For what concerns my knowledge God reveals So spake our Morning Star then in his rise And looking round on every side beheld A pathless desert dusk with horrid shades The way he came not having marked return Was difficult by human steps untrod And he still on was led but with such thoughts Accompanied of things past and to come three hundred Lodged in his breast as well might recommend Such solitude before choicest society Full forty days he passed whether on hill Sometimes anon in shady vale each night Under the covert of some ancient oak Or cedar to defend him from the dew Or harboured in one cave is not revealed Nor tasted human food nor hunger felt Till those days ended hungered then at last Among wild beasts They at his sight grew mild three hundred ten Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed his walk The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof But now an aged man in rural weeds Following as seemed the quest of some stray eye Or withered sticks to gather which might serve Against a winter s day when winds blow keen To warm him wet returned from field at eve He saw approach who first with curious eye Perused him then with words thus uttered spake three hundred twenty Sir what ill chance hath brought thee to this place So far from path or road of men who pass In troop or caravan for single none Durst ever who returned and dropt not here His carcass pined with hunger and with droughth I ask the rather and the more admire For that to me thou seem saint the man whom late Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford Of Jordan honoured so and called thee Son Of God I saw and heard for we sometimes three hundred thirty Who dwell this wild constrained by want come forth To town or village nigh nighest is far Where aught we hear and curious are to hear What happens new fame also finds us out To whom the Son of God Who brought me hither Will bring me hence no other guide I seek By miracle he may replied the swain What other way I see not for we here Live on tough roots and stubs to thirst inured More than the camel and to drink go far three hundred forty Men to much misery and hardship born But if thou be the Son of God command That out of these hard stones be made thee bread So shalt thou save thyself and us relieve With food whereof we wretched seldom taste He ended and the Son of God replied Think saint thou such force in bread Is it not written For I discern thee other than thou seem saint Man lives not by bread only but each word Proceeding from the mouth of God who fed three hundred fifty Our fathers here with manna In the Mount Moses was forty days nor eat nor drank And forty days Eliah without food Wandered this barren waste the same I now Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust Knowing who I am as I know who thou art Whom thus answered the Arch Fiend now undisguised Tis true I am that Spirit unfortunate Who leagued with millions more in rash revolt Kept not my happy station but was driven three hundred sixty With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep Yet to that hideous place not so confined By rigour unconniving but that oft Leaving my dolorous prison I enjoy Large liberty to round this globe of Earth Or range in the Air nor from the Heaven of Heavens Hath he excluded my resort sometimes I came among the Sons of God when he Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job To prove him and illustrate his high worth three hundred seventy And when to all his Angels he proposed To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud That he might fall in Ramoth they demurring I undertook that office and the tongues Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies To his destruction as I had in charge For what he bids I do Though I have lost Much lustre of my native brightness lost To be beloved of God I have not lost To love at least contemplate and admire three hundred eighty What I see excellent in good or fair Or virtuous I should so have lost all sense What can be then less in me than desire To see thee and approach thee whom I know Declared the Son of God to hear attent Thy wisdom and behold thy godlike deeds Men generally think me much a foe To all mankind Why should I they to me Never did wrong or violence By them I lost not what I lost rather by them three hundred ninety I gained what I have gained and with them dwell Copartner in these regions of the World If not disposer lend them oft my aid Oft my advice by presages and signs And answers oracles portents and dreams Whereby they may direct their future life Envy they say excites me thus to gain Companions of my misery and woe At first it may be but long since with woe Nearer acquainted now I feel by proof four hundred That fellowship in pain divides not smart Nor lightens aught each man s peculiar load Small consolation then were Man adjoined This wounds me most what can it less that Man Man fallen shall be restored I never more To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied Deservedly thou griev saint composed of lies From the beginning and in lies wilt end Who boast saint release from Hell and leave to come Into the Heaven of Heavens Thou com saint indeed four hundred ten As a poor miserable captive thrall Comes to the place where he before had sat Among the prime in splendour now deposed Ejected emptied gazed unpitied shunned A spectacle of ruin or of scorn To all the host of Heaven The happy place Imparts to thee no happiness no joy Rather inflames thy torment representing Lost bliss to thee no more communicable So never more in Hell than when in Heaven four hundred twenty But thou art serviceable to Heaven s King Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear Extorts or pleasure to do ill excites What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem Of righteous Job then cruelly to afflict him With all inflictions but his patience won The other service was thy chosen task To be a liar in four hundred mouths For lying is thy sustenance thy food Yet thou pretend saint to truth all oracles four hundred thirty By thee are given and what confessed more true Among the nations That hath been thy craft By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies But what have been thy answers what but dark Ambiguous and with double sense deluding Which they who asked have seldom understood And not well understood as good not known Who ever by consulting at thy shrine Returned the wiser or the more instruct To fly or follow what concerned him most four hundred forty And run not sooner to his fatal snare For God hath justly given the nations up To thy delusions justly since they fell Idolatrous But when his purpose is Among them to declare his providence To thee not known whence hast thou then thy truth But from him or his Angels president In every province who themselves disdaining To approach thy temples give thee in command What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say four hundred fifty To thy adorers Thou with trembling fear Or like a fawning parasite obey saint Then to thyself ascrib saint the truth foretold But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched No more shalt thou by oracling abuse The Gentiles henceforth oracles are ceased And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere At least in vain for they shall find thee mute God hath now sent his living Oracle four hundred sixty Into the world to teach his final will And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell In pious hearts an inward oracle To all truth requisite for men to know So spake our Saviour but the subtle Fiend Though inly stung with anger and disdain Dissembled and this answer smooth returned Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke And urged me hard with doings which not will But misery hath wrested from me Where four hundred seventy Easily canst thou find one miserable And not inforced oft times to part from truth If it may stand him more in stead to lie Say and unsay feign flatter or abjure But thou art placed above me thou art Lord From thee I can and must submiss endure Cheek or reproof and glad to scape so quit Hard are the ways of truth and rough to walk Smooth on the tongue discoursed pleasing to the ear And tunable as sylvan pipe or song four hundred eighty What wonder then if I delight to hear Her dictates from thy mouth most men admire Virtue who follow not her lore Permit me To hear thee when I come since no man comes And talk at least though I despair to attain Thy Father who is holy wise and pure Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest To tread his sacred courts and minister About his altar handling holy things Praying or vowing and voutsafed his voice four hundred ninety To Balaam reprobate a prophet yet Inspired disdain not such access to me To whom our Saviour with unaltered brow Thy coming hither though I know thy scope I bid not or forbid Do as thou find saint Permission from above thou canst not more He added not and Satan bowling low His gray dissimulation disappeared Into thin air diffused for now began Night with her sullen wing to double shade five hundred The desert fowls in their clay nests were couched And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam THE SECOND BOOK MEANWHILE the new baptized who yet remained At Jordan with the Baptist and had seen Him whom they heard so late expressly called Jesus Messiah Son of God declared And on that high authority had believed And with him talked and with him lodged I mean Andrew and Simon famous after known With others though in Holy Writ not named Now missing him their joy so lately found So lately found and so abruptly gone ten Began to doubt and doubted many days And as the days increased increased their doubt Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn And for a time caught up to God as once Moses was in the Mount and missing

the hour of night when thus the Son two hundred sixty Communed in silent walk then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of trees thick interwoven There he slept And dreamed as appetite is wont to dream Of meats and drinks nature s refreshment sweet Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood And saw the ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing even and morn Though ravenous taught to abstain from what they brought He saw the Prophet also how he fled two hundred seventy Into the desert and how there he slept Under a juniper then how awaked He found his supper on the coals prepared And by the Angel was bid rise and eat And eat the second time after repose The strength whereof sufficed him forty days Sometimes that with Elijah he partook Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse Thus wore out night and now the harald Lark Left his ground nest high towering to descry two hundred eighty The Morn s approach and greet her with his song As lightly from his grassy couch up rose Our Saviour and found all was but a dream Fasting he went to sleep and fasting waked Up to a hill anon his steps he reared From whose high top to ken the prospect round If cottage were in view sheep cote or herd But cottage herd or sheep cote none he saw Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud two hundred ninety Thither he bent his way determined there To rest at noon and entered soon the shade High roofed and walks beneath and alleys brown That opened in the midst a woody scene Nature s own work it seemed Nature taught Art And to a superstitious eye the haunt Of wood gods and wood nymphs He viewed it round When suddenly a man before him stood Not rustic as before but seemlier clad As one in city or court or palace bred three hundred And with fair speech these words to him addressed With granted leave officious I return But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide Of all things destitute and well I know Not without hunger Others of some note As story tells have trod this wilderness The fugitive Bond woman with her son Outcast Nebaioth yet found here relief By a providing Angel all the race three hundred ten Of Israel here had famished had not God Rained from heaven manna and that Prophet bold Native of Thebez wandering here was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat Of thee those forty days none hath regard Forty and more deserted here indeed To whom thus Jesus What conclud saint thou hence They all had need I as thou seest have none How hast thou hunger then Satan replied Tell me if food were now before thee set three hundred twenty Wouldst thou not eat Thereafter as I like the giver answered Jesus Why should that Cause thy refusal said the subtle Fiend Hast thou not right to all created things Owe not all creatures by just right to thee Duty and service nor to stay till bid But tender all their power Nor mention I Meats by the law unclean or offered first To idols those young Daniel could refuse Nor proffered by an enemy though who three hundred thirty Would scruple that with want oppressed Behold Nature ashamed or better to express Troubled that thou shouldst hunger hath purveyed From all the elements her choicest store To treat thee as beseems and as her Lord With honour Only deign to sit and eat He spake no dream for as his words had end Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld In ample space under the broadest shade A table richly spread in regal mode three hundred forty With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort And savour beasts of chase or fowl of game In pastry built or from the spit or boiled Grisamber steamed all fish from sea or shore Freshet or purling brook of shell or fin And exquisitest name for which was drained Pontus and Lucrine bay and Afric coast Alas how simple to these cates compared Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve And at a stately sideboard by the wine three hundred fifty That fragrant smell diffused in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad of fairer hue Than Ganymed or Hylas distant more Under the trees now tripped now solemn stood Nymphs of Diana s train and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea s horn And ladies of the Hesperides that seemed Fairer than feigned of old or fabled since Of faery damsels met in forest wide By knights of Logres or of Lyones three hundred sixty Lancelot or Pelleas or Pellenore And all the while harmonious airs were heard Of chiming strings or charming pipes and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned From their soft wings and Flora s earliest smells Such was the splendour and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renewed What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat These are not fruits forbidden no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure three hundred seventy Their taste no knowledge works at least of evil But life preserves destroys life s enemy Hunger with sweet restorative delight All these are Spirits of air and woods and springs Thy gentle ministers who come to pay Thee homage and acknowledge thee their Lord What doubt saint thou Son of God Sit down and eat To whom thus Jesus temperately replied Said saint thou not that to all things I had right And who withholds my power that right to use three hundred eighty Shall I receive by gift what of my own When and where likes me best I can command I can at will doubt not as soon as thou Command a table in this wilderness And call swift flights of Angels ministrant Arrayed in glory on my cup to attend Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence In vain where no acceptance it can find And with my hunger what hast thou to do Thy pompous delicacies I contemn three hundred ninety And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles To whom thus answered Satan male content That I have also power to give thou seest If of that power I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need Why shouldst thou not accept it But I see What I can do or offer is suspect Of these things others quickly will dispose four hundred Whose pains have earned the far fet spoil With that Both table and provision vanished quite With sound of harpies wings and talons heard Only the importune Tempter still remained And with these words his temptation pursued By hunger that each other creature tames Thou art not to be harmed therefore not moved Thy temperance invincible besides For no allurement yields to appetite And all thy heart is set on high designs four hundred ten High actions But wherewith to be achieved Great acts require great means of enterprise Thou art unknown unfriended low of birth A carpenter thy father known thyself Bred up in poverty and straits at home Lost in a desert here and hunger bit Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire To greatness whence authority deriv saint What followers what retinue canst thou gain Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude four hundred twenty Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost Money brings honour friends conquest and realms What raised Antipater the Edomite And his son Herod placed on Juda s throne Thy throne but gold that got him puissant friends Therefore if at great things thou wouldst arrive Get riches first get wealth and treasure heap Not difficult if thou hearken to me Riches are mine fortune is in my hand They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain four hundred thirty While virtue valour wisdom sit in want To whom thus Jesus patiently replied Yet wealth without these three is impotent To gain dominion or to keep it gained Witness those ancient empires of the earth In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved But men endued with these have oft attained In lowest poverty to highest deeds Gideon and Jephtha and the shepherd lad Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate four hundred forty So many ages and shall yet regain That seat and reign in Israel without end Among the Heathen for throughout the world To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of memorial canst thou not remember Quintius Fabricius Curius Regulus For I esteem those names of men so poor Who could do mighty things and could contemn Riches though offered from the hand of kings And what in me seems wanting but that I four hundred fifty May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did perhaps and more Extol not riches then the toil of fools The wise man s cumbrance if not snare more apt To slacken virtue and abate her edge Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise What if with like aversion I reject Riches and realms Yet not for that a crown Golden in shew is but a wreath of thorns Brings dangers troubles cares and sleepless nights four hundred sixty To him who wears the regal diadem When on his shoulders each man s burden lies For therein stands the office of a king His honour virtue merit and chief praise That for the public all this weight he bears Yet he who reigns within himself and rules Passions desires and fears is more a king Which every wise and virtuous man attains And who attains not ill aspires to rule Cities of men or headstrong multitudes four hundred seventy Subject himself to anarchy within Or lawless passions in him which he serves But to guide nations in the way of truth By saving doctrine and from error lead To know and knowing worship God aright Is yet more kingly This attracts the soul Governs the inner man the nobler part That other o er the body only reigns And oft by force which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight four hundred eighty Besides to give a kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done and to lay down Far more magnanimous than to assume Riches are needless then both for themselves And for thy reason why they should be sought To gain a sceptre oftest better missed THE THIRD BOOK SO spake the Son of God and Satan stood A while as mute confounded what to say What to reply confuted and convinced Of his weak arguing and fallacious drift At length collecting all his serpent wiles With soothing words renewed him thus accosts I see thou know saint what is of use to know What best to say canst say to do canst do Thy actions to thy words accord thy words To thy large heart give utterance due thy heart ten Contains of good wise just the perfet shape Should kings and nations from thy mouth consult Thy counsel would be as the oracle Urim and Thummim those oraculous gems On Aaron s breast or tongue of Seers old Infallible or wert thou sought to deeds That might require the array of war thy skill Of conduct would be such that all the world Could not sustain thy prowess or subsist In battle though against thy few in arms twenty These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide Affecting private life or more obscure In savage wilderness wherefore deprive All Earth her wonder at thy acts thyself The fame and glory glory the reward That sole excites to high attempts the flame Of most erected spirits most tempered pure AEthereal who all pleasures else despise All treasures and all gain esteem as dross And dignities and powers all but the highest thirty Thy years are ripe and over ripe The son Of Macedonian Philip had ere these Won Asia and the throne of Cyrus held At his dispose young Scipio had brought down The Carthaginian pride young Pompey quelled The Pontic king and in triumph had rode Yet years and to ripe years judgment mature Quench not the thirst of glory but augment Great Julius whom now all the world admires The more he grew in years the more inflamed forty With glory wept that he had lived so long Ingloroious But thou yet art not too late To whom our Saviour calmly thus replied Thou neither dost persuade me to seek wealth For empire s sake nor empire to affect For glory s sake by all thy argument For what is glory but the blaze of fame The people s praise if always praise unmixed And what the people but a herd confused A miscellaneous rabble who extol fifty Things vulgar and well weighed scarce worth the praise They praise and they admire they know not what And know not whom but as one leads the other And what delight to be by such extolled To live upon their tongues and be their talk Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise His lot who dares be singularly good The intelligent among them and the wise Are few and glory scarce of few is raised This is true glory and renown when God sixty Looking on the Earth with approbation marks The just man and divulges him through Heaven To all his Angels who with true applause Recount his praises Thus he did to Job When to extend his fame through Heaven and Earth As thou to thy reproach may saint well remember He asked thee Hast thou seen my servant Job Famous he was in Heaven on Earth less known Where glory is false glory attributed To things not glorious men not worthy of fame seventy They err who count it glorious to subdue By conquest far and wide to overrun Large countries and in field great battles win Great cities by assault What do these worthies But rob and spoil burn slaughter and enslave Peaceable nations neighbouring or remote Made captive yet deserving freedom more Than those their conquerors who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe er they rove And all the flourishing works of peace destroy eighty Then swell with pride and must be titled Gods Great benefactors of mankind Deliverers Worshipped with temple priest and sacrifice One is the son of Jove of Mars the other Till conqueror Death discover them scarce men Rowling in brutish vices and deformed Violent or shameful death their due reward But if there be in glory aught of good It may be means far different be attained Without ambition war or violence ninety By deeds of peace by wisdom eminent By patience temperance I mention still Him whom thy wrongs with saintly patience borne Made famous in a land and times obscure Who names not now with honour patient Job Poor Socrates who next more memorable By what he taught and suffered for so doing For truth s sake suffering death unjust lives now Equal in fame to proudest conquerors Yet if for fame and glory aught be done one hundred Aught suffered if young African for fame His wasted country freed from Punic rage The deed becomes unpraised the man at least And loses though but verbal his reward Shall I seek glory then as vain men seek Oft not deserved I seek not mine but His Who sent me and thereby witness whence I am To whom the Tempter murmuring thus replied Think not so slight of glory therein least Resembling thy great Father He seeks glory one hundred ten And for his glory all things made all things Orders and governs nor content in Heaven By all his Angels glorified requires Glory from men from all men good or bad Wise or unwise no difference no exemption Above all sacrifice or hallowed gift Glory he requires and glory he receives Promiscuous from all nations Jew or Greek Or Barbarous nor exception hath declared From us his foes pronounced glory he exacts one hundred twenty To whom our Saviour fervently replied And reason since his Word all things produced Though chiefly not for glory as prime end But to shew forth his goodness and impart His good communicable to every soul Freely of whom what could He less expect Than glory and benediction that is thanks The slightest easiest readiest recompense From them who could return him nothing else And not returning that would likeliest render one hundred thirty Contempt instead dishonour obloquy Hard recompense unsuitable return For so much good so much beneficience But why should man seek glory who of his own Hath nothing and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation ignominy and shame Who for so many benefits received Turned recreant to God ingrate and false And so of all true good himself despoiled Yet sacrilegious to himself would take one hundred forty That which to God alone of right belongs Yet so much bounty is in God such grace That who advances his glory not their own Them he himself to glory will advance So spake the Son of God and here again Satan had not to answer but stood struck With guilt of his own sin for he himself Insatiable of glory had lost all Yet of another plea bethought him soon Of glory as thou wilt said he so deem one hundred fifty Worth or not worth the seeking let it pass But to a Kingdom thou art born ordained To sit upon thy father David s throne By mother s side thy father though thy right Be now in powerful hands that will not part Easily from possession won with arms Judaea now and all the Promised Land Reduced a province under Roman yoke Obeys Tiberius nor is always ruled With temperate sway oft have they violated one hundred sixty The Temple oft the Law with foul affronts Abominations rather as did once Antiochus And think saint thou to regain Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring So did not Machabeus He indeed Retired unto the Desert but with arms And o er a mighty king so oft prevailed That by strong hand his family obtained Though priests the crown and David s throne usurped With Modin and her suburbs once content one hundred seventy If kingdom move thee not let move thee zeal And duty zeal and duty are not slow But on Occasion s forelock watchful wait They themselves rather are occasion best Zeal of thy Father s house duty to free Thy country from her heathen servitude So shalt thou best fulfil best verify The Prophets old who sung thy endless reign The happier reign the sooner it begins Rein then what canst thou better do the while one hundred eighty To whom our Saviour answer thus returned All things are best fulfilled in their due time And time there is for all things Truth hath said If of my reign Prophetic Writ hath told That it shall never end so when begin The Father in his purpose hath decreed He in whose hand all times and seasons rowl What if he hath decreed that I shall first Be tried in humble state and things adverse By tribulations injuries insults one hundred ninety Contempts and scorns and snares and violence Suffering abstaining quietly expecting Without distrust or doubt that He may know What I can suffer how obey Who best Can suffer best can do best reign who first Well hath obeyed just trial ere I merit My exaltation without change or end But what concerns it thee when I begin My everlasting Kingdom Why art thou Solicitous What moves thy inquisition two hundred Know saint thou not that my rising is thy fall And my promotion will be thy destruction To whom the Tempter inly racked replied Let that come when it comes All hope is lost Of my reception into grace what worse For where no hope is left is left no fear If there be worse the expectation more Of worse torments me than the feeling can I would be at the worst worst is my port My harbour and my ultimate repose two hundred ten The end I would attain my final good My error was my error and my crime My crime whatever for itself condemned And will alike be punished whether thou Reign or reign not though to that gentle brow Willingly I could fly and hope thy reign From that placid aspect and meek regard Rather than aggravate my evil state Would stand between me and thy Father s ire Whose ire I dread more than the fire of Hell two hundred twenty A shelter and a kind of shading cool Interposition as a summer s cloud If I then to the worst that can be haste Why move thy feet so slow to what is best Happiest both to thyself and all the world That thou who worthiest art shouldst be their King Perhaps thou linger saint in deep thoughts detained Of the enterprise so hazardous and high No wonder for though in thee be united What of perfection can in Man be found two hundred thirty Or human nature can receive consider Thy life hath yet been private most part spent At home scarce viewed the Galilean towns And once a year Jerusalem few days Short sojourn and what thence couldst thou observe The world thou hast not seen much less her glory Empires and monarchs and their radiant courts Best school of best experience quickest in sight In all things that to greatest actions lead The wisest unexperienced will be ever two hundred forty Timorous and loth with novice modesty As he who seeking asses found a kingdom Irresolute unhardy unadventrous But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit Those rudiments and see before thine eyes The monarchies of the Earth their pomp and state Sufficient introduction to inform Thee of thyself so apt in regal arts And regal mysteries that thou may saint know How best their opposition to withstand two hundred fifty With that such power was given him then he took The Son of God up to a mountain high It was a mountain at whose verdant feet A spacious plain outstretched in circuit wide Lay pleasant from his side two rivers flowed The one winding the other straight and left between Fair champaign with less rivers interveined Then meeting joined their tribute to the sea Fertil of corn the glebe of oil and wine With herds the pasture thronged with flocks the hills two hundred sixty Huge cities and high towered that well might seem The seats of mightiest monarchs and so large The prospect was that here and there was room For barren desert fountainless and dry To this high mountain top the Tempter brought Our Saviour and new train of words began Well have we speeded and o er hill and dale Forest and field and flood temples and towers Cut shorter many a league Here thou behold saint Assyria and her empire s ancient bounds two hundred seventy Araxes and the Caspian lake thence on As far as Indus east Euphrates west And oft beyond to south the Persian bay And inaccessible the Arabian drouth Here Nineveh of length within her wall Several days journey built by Ninus old Of that first golden monarchy the seat And seat of Salmanassar whose success Israel in long captivity still mourns There Babylon the wonder of all tongues two hundred eighty As ancient but rebuilt by him who twice Judah and all thy father David s house Led captive and Jerusalem laid waste Till Cyrus set them free Persepolis His city there thou seest and Bactra there Ecbatana her structure vast there shews And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates There Susa by Choaspes amber stream The drink of none but kings of later fame Built by Emathian or by Parthian hands two hundred ninety The great Seleucia Nisibis and there Artaxata Teredon Ctesiphon Turning with easy eye thou may saint behold All these the Parthian now some ages past By great Arsaces led who founded first That empire under his dominion holds From the luxurious kings of Antioch won And just in time thou com saint to have a view Of his great power for now the Parthian king In Ctesiphon hath gathered all his host three hundred Against the Scythian whose incursions wild Have wasted Sogdiana to her aid He marches now in haste See though from far His thousands in what martial equipage They issue forth steel bows and shafts their arms Of equal dread in flight or in pursuit All horsemen in which fight they most excel See how in warlike muster they appear In rhombs and wedges and half moons and wings He looked and saw what numbers numberless three hundred ten The city gates outpoured light armed troops In coats of mail and military pride In mail their horses clad yet fleet and strong Prauncing their riders bore the flower and choice Of many provinces from bound to bound From Arachosia from Candaor east And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs Of Caucasus and dark Iberian dales From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains Of Adiabene Media and the south three hundred twenty Of Susiana to Balsara s haven He saw them in their forms of battle ranged How quick they wheeled and flying behind them shot Sharp sleet of arrowy showers against the face Of their pursuers and overcame by flight The field all iron cast a gleaming brown Nor wanted clouds of foot nor on each horn Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight Chariots or elephants indorsed with towers Of archers nor of labouring pioners three hundred thirty A multitude with spades and axes armed To lay hills plain fell woods or valleys fill Or where plain was raise hill or overlay With bridges rivers proud as with a yoke Mules after these camels and dromedaries And waggons fraught with utensils of war Such forces met not nor so wide a camp When Agrican with all his northern powers Besieged Albracea as romances tell The city of Gallaphrone from thence to win three hundred forty The fairest of her sex Angelica His daughter sought by many prowest knights Both Paynim and the peers of Charlemane Such and so numerous was their chivalry At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presumed And to our Saviour thus his words renewed That thou may saint know I seek not to engage Thy virtue and not every way secure On no slight grounds thy safety hear and mark To what end I have brought thee hither and shew three hundred fifty All this fair sight Thy kingdom though foretold By Prophet or by Angel unless thou Endeavour as thy father David did Thou never shalt obtain prediction still In all things and all men supposes means Without means used what it predicts revokes But say thou wert possessed of David s throne By free consent of all none opposite Samaritan or Jew how couldst thou hope Long to enjoy it quiet and secure three hundred sixty Between two such enclosing enemies Roman and Parthian Therefore one of these Thou must make sure thy own the Parthian first By my advice as nearer and of late Found able by invasion to annoy Thy country and captive lead away her kings Antigonus and old Hyrcanus bound Maugre the Roman It shall be my task To render thee the Parthian at dispose Choose which thou wilt by conquest or by league three hundred seventy By him thou shalt regain without him not That which alone can truly reinstall thee In David s royal seat his true successor Deliverance of thy brethren those Ten Tribes Whose offspring in his territory yet serve In Habor and among the Medes dispersed The sons of Jacob two of Joseph lost Thus long from Israel serving as of old Their fathers in the land of Egypt served This offer sets before thee to deliver three hundred eighty These if from servitude thou shalt restore To their inheritance then nor till then Thou on the throne of David in full glory From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond Shalt reign and Rome or Caesar not need fear To whom our Saviour answered thus unmoved Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm And fragile arms much instrument of war Long in preparing soon to nothing brought Before mine eyes thou hast set and in my ear three hundred ninety Vented much policy and projects deep Of enemies of aids battles and leagues Plausible to the world to me worth naught Means I must use thou say saint prediction else Will unpredict and fail me of the throne My time I told thee and that time for thee Were better farthest off is not yet come When that comes think not thou to find me slack On my part aught endeavouring or to need Thy politic maxims or that cumbersome four hundred Luggage of war there shewn me argument Of human weakness rather than of strength My brethren as thou call saint them those Ten Tribes I must deliver if I mean to reign David s true heir and his full sceptre sway To just extent over all Israel s sons But whence to thee this zeal Where was it then For Israel or for David or his throne When thou stood saint up his tempter to the pride Of numbering Israel which cost the lives four hundred ten of threescore and ten thousand Israelites By three days pestilence Such was thy zeal To Israel then the same that now to me As for those captive tribes themselves were they Who wrought their own captivity fell off From God to worship calves the deities Of Egypt Baal next and Ashtaroth And all the idolatries of heathen round Besides their other worse than heathenish crimes Nor in the land of their captivity four hundred twenty Humbled themselves or penitent besought The God of their forefathers but so died Impenitent and left a race behind Like to themselves distinguishable scarce From Gentiles but by circumcision vain And God with idols in their worship joined Should I of these the liberty regard Who freed as to their ancient patrimony Unhumbled unrepentant unreformed Headlong would follow and to their gods perhaps four hundred thirty Of Bethel and of Dan No let them serve Their enemies who serve idols with God Yet He at length time to himself best known Remembering Abraham by some wondrous call May bring them back repentant and sincere And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood While to their native land with joy they haste As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft When to the Promised Land their fathers passed To his due time and providence I leave them four hundred forty So spake Israel s true King and to the Fiend Made answer meet that made void all his wiles So fares it when with truth falsehood contends THE FOURTH BOOK Perplexed and troubled at his bad success The Tempter stood nor had what to reply Discovered in his fraud thrown from his hope So oft and the persuasive rhetoric That sleeked his tongue and won so much on Eve So little here nay lost But Eve was Eve This far his over match who self deceived And rash beforehand had no better weighed The strength he was to cope with or his own But as a man who had been matchless held ten In cunning over reached where least he thought To salve his credit and for very spite Still will be tempting him who foils him still And never cease though to his shame the more Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time About the wine press where sweet must is poured Beat off returns as oft with humming sound Or surging waves against a solid rock Though all to shivers dashed the assault renew Vain battery and in froth or bubbles end twenty So Satan whom repulse upon repulse Met ever and to shameful silence brought Yet gives not o er though desperate of success And his vain importunity pursues He brought our Saviour to the western side Of that high mountain whence he might behold Another plain long but in breadth not wide Washed by the southern sea and on the north To equal length backed with a ridge of hills That screened the fruits of the earth and seats of men thirty From cold Septentrion blasts thence in the midst Divided by a river off whose banks On each side an Imperial City stood With towers and temples proudly elevate On seven small hills with palaces adorned Porches and theatres baths aqueducts Statues and trophies and triumphal arcs Gardens and groves presented to his eyes Above the highth of mountains interposed By what strange parallax or optic skill forty Of vision multiplied through air or glass Of telescope were curious to enquire And now the Tempter thus his silence broke The city which thou seest no other deem Than great and glorious Rome Queen of the Earth So far renowned and with the spoils enriched Of nations There the Capitol thou seest Above the rest lifting his stately head On the Tarpeian rock her citadel Impregnable and there Mount Palatine fifty The imperial palace compass huge and high The structure skill of noblest architects With gilded battlements conspicuous far Turrets and terraces and glittering spires Many a fair edifice besides more like Houses of gods so well I have disposed My aerie microscope thou may saint behold Outside and inside both pillars and roofs Carved work the hand of famed artificers In cedar marble ivory or gold sixty Thence to the gates cast round thine eye and see What conflux issuing forth or entering in Praetors proconsuls to their provinces Hasting or on return in robes of state Lictors and rods the ensigns of their power Legions and cohorts turms of horse and wings Or embassies from regions far remote In various habits on the Appian road Or on the AEmilian some from farthest south Syene and where the shadow both way falls seventy Meroe Nilotic isle and more to west The realm of Bocchus to the Blackmoor sea From the Asian kings and Parthian among these From India and the Golden Chersoness And utmost Indian isle Taprobane Dusk faces with white silken turbants wreathed From Gallia Gades and the British west Germans and Scythians and Sarmatians north Beyond Danubius to the Tauric pool All nations now to Rome obedience pay eighty To Rome s great Emperor whose wide domain In ample territory wealth and power Civility of manners arts and arms And long renown thou justly may saint prefer Before the Parthian These two thrones except The rest are barbarous and scarce worth the sight Shared among petty kings too far removed These having shewn thee I have shewn thee all The kingdoms of the world and all their glory This Emperor hath no son and now is old ninety Old and lascivious and from Rome retired To Capreae an island small but strong On the Campanian shore with purpose there His horrid lusts in private to enjoy Committing to a wicked favourite All public cares and yet of him suspicious Hated of all and hating With what ease Endued with regal virtues as thou art Appearing and beginning noble deeds Might saint thou expel this monster from his throne one hundred Now made a sty and in his place ascending A victor people free from servile yoke And with my help thou may saint to me the power Is given and by that right I give it thee Aim therefore at no less than all the world Aim at the highest without the highest attained Will be for thee no sitting or not long On David s throne be prophesied what will To whom the Son of God unmoved replied Nor doth this grandeur and majestic shew one hundred ten Of luxury though called magnificence More than of arms before allure mine eye Much less my mind though thou should saint add to tell Their sumptuous gluttonies and gorgeous feasts On citron tables or Atlantic stone For I have also heard perhaps have read Their wines of Setia Cales and Falerne Chios and Crete and how they quaff in gold Crystal and myrrhine cups imbossed with gems And studs of pearl to me should saint tell who thirst one hundred twenty And hunger still Then embassies thou shew saint From nations far and nigh What honour that But tedious waste of time to sit and hear So many hollow compliments and lies Outlandish flatteries Then proceed saint to talk Of the Emperor how easily subdued How gloriously I shall thou say saint expel A brutish monster what if I withal Expel a Devil who first made him such Let his tormentor Conscience find him out one hundred thirty For him I was not sent nor yet to free That people victor once now vile and base Deservedly made vassal who once just Frugal and mild and temperate conquered well But govern ill the nations under yoke Peeling their provinces exhausted all By lust and rapine first ambitious grown Of triumph that insulting vanity Then cruel by their sports to blood inured Of fighting beasts and men to beasts exposed one hundred forty Luxurious by their wealth and greedier still And from the daily Scene effeminate What wise and valiant man would seek to free These thus degenerate by themselves enslaved Or could of inward slaves make outward free Know therefore when my season comes to sit On David s throne it shall be like a tree Spreading and overshadowing all the earth Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash All monarchies besides throughout the world one hundred fifty And of my Kingdom there shall be no end Means there shall be to this but what the means Is not for thee to know nor me to tell To whom the Tempter impudent replied I see all offers made by me how slight Thou valuest because offered and reject saint Nothing will please the difficult and nice Or nothing more than still to contradict On the other side know also thou that I On what I offer set as high esteem one hundred sixty Nor what I part with mean to give for naught All these which in a moment thou behold saint The kingdoms of the world to thee I give For given to me I give to whom I please No trifle yet with this reserve not else On this condition if thou wilt fall down And worship me as thy superior Lord Easily done and hold them all of me For what can less so great a gift deserve Whom thus our Saviour answered with disdain one hundred seventy I never liked thy talk thy offers less Now both abhor since thou hast dared to utter The abominable terms impious condition But I endure the time till which expired Thou hast permission on me It is written The first of all commandments Thou shalt worship The Lord thy God and only Him shalt serve And dar saint thou to the Son of God propound To worship thee accursed now more accursed For this attempt bolder than that on Eve one hundred eighty And more blasphemous which expect to rue The kingdoms of the world to thee were given Permitted rather and by thee usurped Other donation none thou canst produce If given by whom but by the King of kings God over all supreme If given to thee By thee how fairly is the Giver now Repaid But gratitude in thee is lost Long since Wert thou so void of fear or shame As offer them to me the Son of God one hundred ninety To me my own on such abhorred pact That I fall down and worship thee as God Get thee behind me Plain thou now appear saint That Evil One Satan for ever damned To whom the Fiend with fear abashed replied Be not so sore offended Son of God Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men If I to try whether in higher sort Than these thou bear saint that title have proposed What both from Men and Angels I receive two hundred Tetrarchs of Fire Air Flood and on the Earth Nations besides from all the quartered winds God of this World invoked and World beneath Who then thou art whose coming is foretold To me most fatal me it most concerns The trial hath indamaged thee no way Rather more honour left and more esteem Me naught advantaged missing what I aimed Therefore let pass as they are transitory The kingdoms of this world I shall no more two hundred ten Advise thee gain them as thou canst or not And thou thyself seem saint otherwise inclined Than to a worldly crown addicted more To contemplation and profound dispute As by that early action may be judged When slipping from thy mother s eye thou went saint Alone into the Temple there wast found Among the gravest Rabbies disputant On points and questions fitting Moses chair Teaching not taught The childhood shews the man two hundred twenty As morning shews the day Be famous then By wisdom as thy empire must extend So let extend thy mind o er all the world In knowledge all things in it comprehend All knowledge is not couched in Moses law The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote The Gentiles also know and write and teach To admiration led by Nature s light And with the Gentiles much thou must converse Ruling them by persuasion as thou mean saint two hundred thirty Without their learning how wilt thou with them Or they with thee hold conversation meet How wilt thou reason with them how refute Their idolisms traditions paradoxes Error by his own arms is best evinced Look once more ere we leave this specular mount Westward much nearer by south west behold Where on the AEgean shore a city stands Built nobly pure the air and light the soil Athens the eye of Greece mother of arts two hundred forty And Eloquence native to famous wits Or hospitable in her sweet recess City or suburban studious walks and shades See there the olive grove of Academe Plato s retirement where the Attic bird Trills her thick warbled notes the summer long There flowery hill Hymettus with the sound Of bees industrious murmur oft invites To studious musing there Ilissus rowls His whispering stream Within the walls then view two hundred fifty The schools of ancient sages his who bred Great Alexander to subdue the world Lyceum there and painted Stoa next There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power Of harmony in tones and numbers hit By voice or hand and various measured verse AEolian charms and Dorian lyric odes And his who gave them breath but higher sung Blind Melesigenes thence Homer called Whose poem Phoebus challenged for his own two hundred sixty Thence what the lofty grave Tragedians taught In chorus or iambic teachers best Of moral prudence with delight received In brief sententious precepts while they treat Of fate and chance and change in human life High actions and high passions best describing Thence to the famous Orators repair Those ancient whose resistless eloquence Wielded at will that fierce democraty Shook the Arsenal and fulmined over Greece two hundred seventy To Macedon and Artaxerxes throne To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear From heaven descended to the low roofed house Of Socrates see there his tenement Whom well inspired the Oracle pronounced Wisest of men from whose mouth issued forth Mellifluous streams that watered all the schools Of Academics old and new with those Surnamed Peripatetics and the sect Epicurean and the Stoic severe two hundred eighty These here revolve or as thou likest at home Till time mature thee to a kingdom s weight These rules will render thee a king complete Within thyself much more with empire joined To whom our Saviour sagely thus replied Think not but that I know these things or think I know them not not therefore am I short Of knowing what I ought He who receives Light from above from the Fountain of Light No other doctrine needs though granted true two hundred ninety But these are false or little else but dreams Conjectures fancies built on nothing firm The first and wisest of them all professed To know this only that he nothing knew The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits A third sort doubted all things though plain sense Others in virtue placed felicity But virtue joined with riches and long life In corporal pleasure he and careless ease The Stoic last in philosophic pride three hundred By him called virtue and his virtuous man Wise perfect in himself and all possessing Equal to God oft shames not to prefer As fearing God nor man contemning all Wealth pleasure pain or torment death and life Which when he lists he leaves or boasts he can For all his tedious talk is but vain boast Or subtle shifts conviction to evade Alas what can they teach and not mislead Ignorant of themselves of God much more three hundred ten And how the World began and how Man fell Degraded by himself on grace depending Much of the Soul they talk but all awry And in themselves seek virtue and to themselves All glory arrogate to God give none Rather accuse him under usual names Fortune and Fate as one regardless quite Of mortal things Who therefore seeks in these True wisdom finds her not or by delusion Far worse her false resemblance only meets three hundred twenty An empty cloud However many books Wise men have said are wearisome who reads Incessantly and to his reading brings not A spirit and judgment equal or superior And what he brings what needs he elsewhere seek Uncertain and unsettled still remains Deep versed in books and shallow in himself Crude or intoxicate collecting toys And trifles for choice matters worth a sponge As children gathering pebbles on the shore three hundred thirty Or if I would delight my private hours With music or with poem where so soon As in our native language can I find That solace All our Law and Story strewed With hymns our Psalms with artful terms inscribed Our Hebrew songs and harps in Babylon That pleased so well our victor s ear declare That rather Greece from us these arts derived Ill imitated while they loudest sing The vices of their deities and their own three hundred forty In fable hymn or song so personating Their gods ridiculous and themselves past shame Remove their swelling epithetes thick laid As varnish on a harlot s cheek the rest Thin sown with aught of profit or delight Will far be found unworthy to compare With Sion s songs to all true tastes excelling Where God is praised aright and godlike men The Holiest of Holies and his Saints Such are from God inspired not such from thee three hundred fifty Unless where moral virtue is expressed By light of Nature not in all quite lost Their orators thou then extoll saint as those The top of eloquence statists indeed And lovers of their country as may seem But herein to our Prophets far beneath As men divinely taught and better teaching The solid rules of civil government In their majestic unaffected style Than all the oratory of Greece and Rome three hundred sixty In them is plainest taught and easiest learnt What makes a nation happy and keeps it so What ruins kingdoms and lays cities flat These only with our Law best form a king So spake the Son of God but Satan now Quite at a loss for all his darts were spent Thus to our Saviour with stern brow replied Since neither wealth nor honour arms nor arts Kingdom nor empire pleases thee nor aught By me proposed in life contemplative three hundred seventy Or active tended on by glory or fame What dost thou in this world The Wilderness For thee is fittest place I found thee there And thither will return thee Yet remember What I foretell thee soon thou shalt have cause To wish thou never hadst rejected thus Nicely or cautiously my offered aid Which would have set thee in short time with ease On David s throne or throne of all the world Now at full age fulness of time thy season three hundred eighty When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled Now contrary if I read aught in heaven Or heaven write aught of fate by what the stars Voluminous or single characters In their conjunction met give me to spell Sorrows and labours opposition hate Attends thee scorns reproaches injuries Violence and stripes and lastly cruel death A kingdom they portend thee but what kingdom Real or allegoric I discern not three hundred ninety Nor when eternal sure as without end Without beginning for no date prefixed Directs me in the starry rubric set So saying he took for still he knew his power Not yet expired and to the Wilderness Brought back the Son of God and left him there Feigning to disappear Darkness now rose As daylight sunk and brought in louring Night Her shadowy offspring unsubstantial both Privation mere of light and absent day four hundred Our Saviour meek and with untroubled mind After hisaerie jaunt though hurried sore Hungry and cold betook him to his rest Wherever under some concourse of shades Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield From dews and damps of night his sheltered head But sheltered slept in vain for at his head The Tempter watched and soon with ugly dreams Disturbed his sleep And either tropic now Gan thunder and both ends of heaven the clouds four hundred ten From many a horrid rift abortive poured Fierce rain with lightning mixed water with fire In ruin reconciled nor slept the winds Within their stony caves but rushed abroad From the four hinges of the world and fell On the vexed wilderness whose tallest pines Though rooted deep as high and sturdiest oaks Bowed their stiff necks loaden with stormy blasts Or torn up sheer Ill wast thou shrouded then O patient Son of God yet only stood saint four hundred twenty Unshaken Nor yet staid the terror there Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round Environed thee some howled some yelled some shrieked Some bent at thee their fiery darts while thou Sat saint unappalled in calm and sinless peace Thus passed the night so foul till Morning fair Came forth with pilgrim steps in amice grey Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar Of thunder chased the clouds and laid the winds And griesly spectres which the Fiend had raised four hundred thirty To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire And now the sun with more effectual beams Had cheered the face of earth and dried the wet From drooping plant or dropping tree the birds Who all things now behold more fresh and green After a night of storm so ruinous Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray To gratulate the sweet return of morn Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn Was absent after all his mischief done four hundred forty The Prince of Darkness glad would also seem Of this fair change and to our Saviour came Yet with no new device they all were spent Rather by this his last affront resolved Desperate of better course to vent his rage And mad despite to be so oft repelled Him walking on a sunny hill he found Backed on the north and west by a thick wood Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape And in a careless mood thus to him said four hundred fifty Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God After a dismal night I heard the wrack As earth and sky would mingle but myself Was distant and these flaws though mortals fear them As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven Or to the Earth s dark basis underneath Are to the main as inconsiderable And harmless if not wholesome as a sneeze To man s less universe and soon are gone Yet as being ofttimes noxious where they light four hundred sixty On man beast plant wasteful and turbulent Like turbulencies in the affairs of men Over whose heads they roar and seem to point They oft fore signify and threaten ill This tempest at this desert most was bent Of men at thee for only thou here dwell saint Did I not tell thee if thou didst reject The perfect season offered with my aid To win thy destined seat but wilt prolong All to the push of fate pursue thy way four hundred seventy Of gaining David s throne no man knows when For both the when and how is nowhere told Thou shalt be what thou art ordained no doubt For Angels have proclaimed it but concealing The time and means Each act is rightliest done Not when it must but when it may be best If thou observe not this be sure to find What I foretold thee many a hard assay Of dangers and adversities and pains Ere thou of Israel s sceptre get fast hold four hundred eighty Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round So many terrors voices prodigies May warn thee as a sure foregoing sign So talked he while the Son of God went on And staid not but in brief him answered thus Me worse than wet thou find saint not other harm Those terrors which thou speak saint of did me none I never feared they could though noising loud And threatening nigh what they can do as signs Betokening or ill boding I contemn four hundred ninety As false portents not sent from God but thee Who knowing I shall reign past thy preventing Obtrud saint thy offered aid that I accepting At least might seem to hold all power of thee Ambitious Spirit and would saint be thought my God And storm saint refused thinking to terrify Me to thy will Desist thou art discerned And toil saint in vain nor me in vain molest To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage replied Then hear O Son of David virgin born five hundred For Son of God to me is yet in doubt Of the Messiah I have heard foretold By all the Prophets of thy birth at length Announced by Gabriel with the first I knew And of the angelic song in Bethlehem field On thy birth night that sung thee Saviour born From that time seldom have I ceased to eye Thy infancy thy childhood and thy youth Thy manhood last though yet in private bred Till at the ford of Jordan whither all five hundred ten Flocked to the Baptist I among the rest Though not to be baptized by voice from Heaven Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view And narrower scrutiny that I might learn In what degree or meaning thou art called The Son of God which bears no single sense The Son of God I also am or was And if I was I am relation stands All men are Sons of God yet thee I thought five hundred twenty In some respect far higher so declared Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour And followed thee still on to this waste wild Where by all best conjectures I collect Thou art to be my fatal enemy Good reason then if I beforehand seek To understand my adversary who And what he is his wisdom power intent By parle or composition truce or league To win him or win from him what I can five hundred thirty And opportunity I here have had To try thee sift thee and confess have found thee Proof against all temptation as a rock Of adamant and as a centre firm To the utmost of mere man both wise and good Not more for honours riches kingdoms glory Have been before contemned and may again Therefore to know what more thou art than man Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven Another method I must now begin five hundred forty So saying he caught him up and without wing Of hippogrif bore through the air sublime Over the wilderness and o er the plain Till underneath them fair Jerusalem The Holy City lifted high her towers And higher yet the glorious Temple reared Her pile far off appearing like a mount Of alablaster topt with golden spires There on the highest pinnacle he set The Son of God and added thus in scorn five hundred fifty There stand if thou wilt stand to stand upright Will ask thee skill I to thy Father s house Have brought thee and highest placed highest is best Now shew thy progeny if not to stand Cast thyself down Safely if Son of God For it is written He will give command Concerning thee to his Angels in their hands They shall uplift thee lest at any time Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone To whom thus Jesus Also it is written five hundred sixty Tempt not the Lord thy God He said and stood But Satan smitten with amazement fell As when Earth s son Antaeus to compare Small things with greatest in Irassa strove With Jove s Alcides and oft foiled still rose Receiving from his mother Earth new strength Fresh from his fall and fiercer grapple joined Throttled at length in the air expired and fell So after many a foil the Tempter proud Renewing fresh assaults amidst his pride five hundred seventy Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall And as that Theban monster that proposed Her riddle and him who solved it not devoured That once found out and solved for grief and spite Cast herself headlong from the Ismenian steep So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend And to his crew that sat consulting brought Joyless triumphals of his hoped success Ruin and desperation and dismay Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God five hundred eighty So Satan fell and straight a fiery globe Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh Who on their plumy vans received Him soft From his uneasy station and upbore As on a floating couch through the blithe air Then in a flowery valley set him down On a green bank and set before him spread A table of celestial food divine Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink five hundred ninety That soon refreshed him wearied and repaired What hunger if aught hunger had impaired Or thirst and as he fed Angelic quires Sung heavenly anthems of his victory Over temptation and the Tempter proud True Image of the Father whether throned In the bosom of bliss and light of light Conceiving or remote from Heaven enshrined In fleshly tabernacle and human form Wandering the wilderness whatever place six hundred Habit or state or motion still expressing The Son of God with Godlike force endued Against the attempter of thy Father s throne And thief of Paradise Him long of old Thou didst debel and down from Heaven cast With all his army now thou hast avenged Supplanted Adam and by vanquishing Temptation hast regained lost Paradise And frustrated the conquest fraudulent He never more henceforth will dare set foot six hundred ten In paradise to tempt his snares are broke For though that seat of earthly bliss be failed A fairer Paradise is founded now For Adam and his chosen sons whom thou A Saviour art come down to reinstall Where they shall dwell secure when time shall be Of tempter and temptation without fear But thou Infernal Serpent shalt not long Rule in the clouds Like an autumnal star Or lightning thou shalt fall from Heaven trod down six hundred twenty Under his feet For proof ere this thou feel saint Thy wound yet not thy last and deadliest wound By this repulse received and hold saint in Hell No triumph in all her gates Abaddon rues Thy bold attempt Hereafter learn with awe To dread the Son of God He all unarmed Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice From thy demoniac holds possession foul Thee and thy legions yelling they shall fly And beg to hide them in a herd of swine six hundred thirty Lest he command them down into the Deep Bound and to torment sent before their time Hail Son of the Most High heir of both Worlds Queller of Satan On thy glorious work Now enter and begin to save Mankind Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek Sung victor and from heavenly feast refreshed
